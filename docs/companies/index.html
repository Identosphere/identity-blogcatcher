 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are wrestling with financial shortfalls that restrict what they can do. This three part series asks ‘Is there a positive way forward?’</p><p>Sometimes, in order to deal with a difficult problem, we have to embrace a paradox. Paradoxes happen when one thing — call it Proposition A — is clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true, but when something else opposite — call it Proposition B — is also clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true. In situations like this, to move forward, we have to find a way of holding both ideas in our minds at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Right now this paradox is hitting us all. Increasingly. With a vengeance. This is the paradox of ‘affordability’.</p><p>The first part of this paradox — the Proposition A bit — is the common understanding that “we can only do what we can afford”. If we’ve only got so much money to spend, there is only so much we can spend it on. Full stop. The simple reality of our situation. And, if because of circumstances beyond our control, we find ourselves with less money, then there are even less things that we can spend it on&nbsp;… less things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>This is not a happy situation. It’s a tough, harsh reality affecting millions of people today in every walk of life. It’s the day to day misery of millions of families wrestling with poverty. It’s looming centre stage across the nation’s local authorities, with 20% of them verging on bankruptcy. It’s causing a crisis in health and&nbsp;care.</p><p>It’s also dominating Government policies. ‘Only doing what we can afford’ — ‘austerity’ — has been the one theme that has dominated UK Government policies for decades now, particularly since the great financial crash of 2008. Over many years the Scottish Government has promised to do many things such as abolish child poverty. But in the last few months it has presided over a budget which will result in the exact opposite. It, too, is knuckling down to the harsh realities of ‘we can only do what we can&nbsp;afford’.</p><p>If the Labour Party gets elected at the forthcoming UK General Election things may not change all that much either. Labour leader Keir Starmer is making a big point that whatever promises he makes “in the end the fiscal rule comes first”. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;…</p> We’ve been here&nbsp;before! <p>As a society we’ve been here before, only worse. In the dark days of the Second World War for example, Britain had run out of money. It had spent every penny fighting the Nazis. Then, in the early days of 1942, there was a chink of light. Perhaps, after all, we might actually win the war! As this thought took hold, peoples’ attention began to turn to the question: what comes next? How to win the peace? How to&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>This triggered an almighty spat between the forces of financial orthodoxy — the people whose worldview was dominated by the mantra ‘we can only do what we afford’ — and those whose focus was on underlying economic realities.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes believed that keeping to the mantra ‘we can only do what we can afford’ would be disastrous. “At one level — the formal level of bank balances — it’s true we can only do what we can afford,” he said. “But at another level — of underlying economic reality — it’s nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. In reality, we can afford what we can actually do”. This was his Proposition B.</p><p>Keynes didn’t actually use the words in the above paragraph. But below are the words he used in a BBC broadcast on 2 April 1942, when he took the spat between the two worldviews public. Keynes called for an ambitious programme to “build homes, libraries, theatres, concert halls and dance halls” so that “every substantial city [has] the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital”.</p><p>But the financial establishment would have none of it. We don’t have the money, they argued. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>This is how Keynes replied to the financiers (whom he addressed as ‘Sir John’) in his BBC&nbsp;talk.</p><blockquote>“The money?”, I said. “But surely, Sir John, you don’t build houses with money? Do you mean that there won’t be enough bricks and mortar and steel and&nbsp;cement?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Do you mean,” I went on, “that there won’t be enough labour? For what will the builders be doing if they are not building&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Well,” I said “if there are bricks and mortar and steel and concrete and labour and architects, why not assemble all this good material in&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><p>Keynes finished his talk by saying “anything we can actually do we can afford”: wherever there are people with skills and energy capable of doing work, and wherever there are sources of energy and materials that could be deployed, then it’s possible to bring them together to meet human needs. When push comes to shove it is what we can actually do that defines ‘affordability’.</p> Riding two&nbsp;horses <p>The point about paradoxes is that to embrace the truths they both contain, we need to keep them both in mind at the same time. For many people running families, organisations, institutions and Governments today Proposition A — that we can only do what we can afford — dominates their days. Day in and day out, they struggle endlessly with the realities of financial constraints; of having to make hard, miserable choices that stop them doing things they really want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>They feel they don’t have a choice and in one sense they are right. The institutional reality of their situation is that the less money they have, they less they can do. If they start spending money they don’t have — beyond what they can ‘afford’ — they risk going bankrupt.</p><p>Yet only acting on Proposition A ignores the truth of Proposition B — that, as a society we can afford what we can actually do. And the more we focus only on Proposition A the more we actually reduce what we can actually do. And over time, that makes our situation worse, not better. Focusing only on Proposition A is a trap, placing us on a spiral of&nbsp;decline.</p><p>Somehow, then, we have to find a way of acting on Proposition B even as we wrestle with the constraints that Proposition A forces upon&nbsp;us.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that none of us has only one job. None of us can focus only on doing what we can ‘afford’ to do. Even as we wrestle with the constraints of Proposition A, somehow, somewhere, we need to find ways of also opening up and expanding what we can actually do. We all have two jobs to do. Two horses to ride, even if very often they pull us in different directions.</p><p>Our next blog looks at some of the ways we can do&nbsp;this.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Reconfiguring Transition Landscapes</p><p>Entering 2024, it becomes increasingly important to shift the focus from immediate technological and demographic trends to the broader systemic tendencies that are likely to shape the future and options landscape. The seven drivers outlined below must be understood against a systemic backdrop of steadily declining foundational systems of civilisation — from decreasing available arable land along with structural decline in quality at a planetary scale, a quantum decline in energy returned for energy invested, to decreasing global well-being and a decline in life expectancy.</p><p>These fundamental shifts place us in a new paradigm where foundational resources are relatively diminishing in comparison to demand, while climate breakdown introduces increased volatility and shocks into the system. This volatility, coupled with a systemic decline, suggests we will face more shocks and an accelerating shortfall in nutrients, energy and well&nbsp;being.</p><p>As these factors converge, we don’t just mean fluctuating availability, but also significant price spikes. For instance, a 3–4% drop in food system availability, or 5% in aggregate, could lead to price increases of up to 400%. Such price volatility will lead to systemic inequality within and between nations, potentially triggering social tipping points. It is within this context and transition that we need to consider the following trends.</p><p>These structural tendencies, which demand both adaptation and mitigation, are key factors in determining how we evolve and adapt in the years (if not decades) ahead. Some of these tendencies will naturally allow for evolutionary progress, while others will require significant adaptation. Understanding these tendencies from a structural perspective is crucial because they form the undercurrents that will influence long-term trajectories. Recognizing and responding to these systemic tendencies and propensities will be essential in navigating the complex landscape of our future, and shaping our decisions, innovations, and strategies for the decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>The essence of the “propensities” defined below lies in a profound transformation of our constraint space shifting our approach towards technology, society, and future planning. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these propensities have historically always existed. What is now being manifested is that those propensities are not just a functional reality for the “ignorable many”, but becoming the dominant propensity at a planetary scale.This transformation is reshaping the very notions of progress, the integration of technology into daily existence, and the structuring of institutions.</p><p>These tendencies and propensities transcend the simple adoption of new technologies or the following of emerging trends. They represent a more profound, structural evolution in our collective thought processes and approaches. They signify a departure from linear, predictable models derived from extensions of ‘the adjacent possible’ socio-technical landscape based on present-day comprehensions.</p><p>In the following sections, 7 of these pivotal propensities are presented. Readers and participants are encouraged to critically engage with these ideas, offering their perspectives and insights. These shifts appear increasingly essential in framing and supporting the magnitude of the transition and more critically the innovation landscapes necessary to provide pathways for the transition.</p>  Multi-Perspectival Pathways for&nbsp;Tomorrow  <p>The transformation towards a multipolar world is one of the most structural shifts that the world is facing and it is driving profound changes in our pathway of transition. This multipolar world view increasingly extends beyond geopolitics, permeating into foundational shifts and divergences in transition pathways for societies.</p><p>The multiperspectival approach to climate transition underscores the growing portfolio of strategies being implemented globally — either passively or actively, each reflecting unique civilizational insights, lock-ins and interests. COP28 started to crystallize this emerging reality, with a breakdown in the hegemony of a singular transition pathway.</p><p>In this context, it is important to recognise that there appear to be at least three structural principal transition perspectives emerging:</p><p>Supply Side — Asset &amp; Investment Driven Transformation<br>Predominantly observed in the U.S., this strategy emphasizes the creation and enhancement of assets to revolutionize supply chains and technologies. It entails substantial investments in new technologies and infrastructure, nurturing innovation ecosystems, enacting supportive policies and regulations, fostering public-private collaborations, and integrating global supply chains. The goal is to transform supply and technology landscapes while promoting economic growth and competitiveness. It will necessitate new market design and financial innovations.</p><p>Integrated Transition Strategies:<br>This method aims to fundamentally alter supply-side technologies while simultaneously managing or reducing demand. Its’ complexity arises from the dual focus on high-cost supply-side innovation and transitioning demand, necessitating changes in consumer behavior and infrastructure adaptation. The central challenge is to harmonize advancing supply technologies with evolving demand trends, targeting resilience and sustainability. This strategy requires robust policy and regulatory frameworks for successful implementation but perhaps more critically the capacity for societies to make legitimate decisions at the speed and scale necessary.</p><p>Offset Systems<br>In regions like Saudi Arabia, where hydrocarbon energy base costs are low, investing in offset technologies becomes a strategic focus. This includes carbon capture and storage, efficiency enhancements, alternative hydrocarbon applications, and geo-engineering. This approach, contrasting with European or American strategies, leans towards maintaining the hydrocarbon economy while seeking to reduce or mitigate future environmental It’s’&nbsp;. This strategy necessitates novel methods for managing planetary risks and innovations. Moreover, the unproven technologies that it is reliant on will most certainly accelerate climate breakdown risks in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>These divergent transition pathways will require adopting shared, dialogic and negotiation frameworks for handling different planetary risks and allocations and making provisions for them, not just within national contexts but also in relation to the planet as a whole (i.e. if we are to avoid a race to the bottom and collective self termination). holding and management of these risks on a global scale calls for an innovative form of systemic-level innovation from countries. It means rethinking and redesigning the way that risks are assessed (including historically accrued risks), addressed, and mitigated, integrating both national priorities and planetary responsibilities. Such an approach is crucial for navigating the complex, interlinked challenges that define the current era. It requires a shift towards more collaborative, integrated risk management strategies at the planetary level.</p><p>The multiperspectival nature of the climate transition calls for diverse innovation economies, national and metanational alliances, and a reimagined approach to negotiation and collaboration. Navigating this multipolar landscape requires recognizing varied transition pathways, managing geopolitical effects, balancing risks and trade-offs, and adapting to a substantial shift in global transitions. This multipolar, multi perspectival scenario necessitates sophisticated, economic diplomacy to forge a viable, and non-self terminating, equitable future</p><p>2. Planetary justice as a precursor for a planetary transition</p><p>The emergence and embedding of a multipolar world is also revealing long-standing injustices and accelerating future injustices, previously obscured by asymmetric and extractive power dynamics. The addressing of these injustices is not just an ethical imperative, but also a practical necessity for any large-scale planetary agreement on the necessary transitions ahead. The danger is not just that and equitable transitions might be otherwise being impeded by deeply rooted systemic injustices but any transition will be impeded itself progressing us to a path of mutually assured destruction. This stalemate response when confronting structural barriers has hitherto been the status quo. Tackling such injustices on a planetary scale demands substantial and concerted effort as they prevent a viable pathway towards the magnitude of change that will&nbsp;be.</p><p>3. High Interest High Inflation Macroeconomics</p><p>The macroeconomic landscape is also shifting alongside the unfurling implications of climate change intensifying in an increasingly multipolar world. We are witnessing increased market volatility and a more pressing scramble for transition materials — driven not just by market dynamics but also by existential necessities and increasing conflict.</p><p>This confluence of factors is likely to induce a sustained high-inflationary environment within the economic system and might drive a persistently high interest rate environment that will systemically restrain investment broadly especially in environments most vulnerable to planetary risks. It will throttle our capacity to mitigate the runaway risks associated with climate breakdown (i.e. with the exception of entities wielding substantial economic&nbsp;power).</p><p>Moreover, such macroeconomic factors are going to systemically accelerate the missing trillions problem, throttling the flow of capital into the real world economy. This is because as both the volatilities increase, future uncertainties increase, and the cost of capital will become increasingly prohibitive.</p><p>Moreover, this shift is poised to aggravate systemic inequalities, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable and marginalized by rapidly increasing the cost of living. As systemic inequality widens, it will threaten to destabilize nation-states. This paradigm shift presents a formidable challenge, making global economies more susceptible to fragility. Addressing these emerging vulnerabilities will require systemic innovation at the monetary level that cannot be discounted and will increasingly become a systemic throttle if not addressed.</p><p>4. Operating in a Security&nbsp;World</p><p>The transition from a world predominantly driven by free trade principles to one increasingly centered around security agreements has been accelerating over the past six years (e.g. the UK/US Atlantic agreement or UK/Japan agreement). The shift towards security-based alliances is expected to continue, with an evolving and broadening definition of security. Recent trends have started to integrate critical technologies into security frameworks, and we can foresee this expansion to further encompass areas such as nutrition, critical minerals (already a traditional focus in security) and essential health commodities and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The expansion of the security domain will also necessitate an even greater systems-based approach to security.</p><p>In a more systems-oriented worldview, the traditional concept of nation-state boundaries will undergo a fundamental change. Instead of being defined by geographical lines, states will be characterized by their critical metabolic flows that do not respect national boundaries. It is foreseen that these flows, encompassing energy, materials, and other vital resources, will increasingly become the definitional landscape of statehood. This perspective emphasizes the importance of resource dynamics and interdependencies in defining national identity and capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the increasing securitization of the world also paves the way for the weaponization of various elements. This might include areas such as food supplies, weather systems, geo-infrastructures, material goods, energy grids, and information systems. As security concerns broaden, so too does the scope of potential weaponization. This development raises fundamental questions about our response strategies. Relying solely on market transaction-based frameworks is increasingly insufficient for understanding the value and risks associated with such diverse sectors. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the complexities that they&nbsp;present.</p><p>As we begin to recognize and operationalize security within these new frameworks of entanglement, we will see planetary-scale reconfigurations. This evolution signifies a deepening understanding of our interconnectedness and the need for comprehensive strategies in addressing security challenges.</p><p>The extension of the security framework to incorporate elements like energy, critical materials, food systems, and health infrastructures is poised to significantly reshape the planetary landscape. The move from a commodities-centric free trade world to one focused on security goods and security alliances will be pivotal in determining the pathways for future transitions. This growing emphasis on security is likely to transform international relations and economic agendas, marking a profound shift in the way that global interdependencies and cooperation are perceived and navigated. This evolution marks a new era in global geopolitics, where security considerations permeate multiple aspects of international engagement and decision-making.</p><p>5. The New Environmental Right</p><p>There is an emergence of what can be described as a surge in environmental nationalism (e.g. rise of AFD in Germany and its recent positions on environmental risks). This brand of nationalism is dedicated to the protection of environmental systems, advocating for methods such as population reduction (principally l by reducing migration) as means to conserve environmental resources. This is poised to be a defining feature of the new political right wing. Environmental nationalism is set to introduce a systemic form of austerity that transcends traditional public goods. Its primary focus will be on enacting austerity measures on essential environmental resources and might be used as a lever to propel a more nationalistic agenda.</p><p>Whilst such ideology is ostensibly aimed at preserving certain environmental aspects for particular socio-economic groups, it may also serve as a driving force for increasing systemic inequality. Its selective approach to conserving and allocating environmental resources is likely to generate imbalances, privileging certain groups while disadvantaging others and/or exacerbating existing disparities. A notable characteristic of such environmental nationalism will be its propensity to externalize environmental degradation. It prioritizes the maintenance and conservation of high environmental standards within its own borders, often by shifting environmental burdens to other regions or nations. This practice, akin to a form of passive economic warfare, is expected to intensify. Nations adopting this ideology may prioritize their internal environmental quality, frequently at the detriment of the broader global environment. This leads to aggravated issues like pollution and resource depletion elsewhere. Such externalization tactics, rapidly escalating under the banner of environmental nationalism, are likely to contribute to global environmental imbalances and tensions, complicating the quest for unified, worldwide environmental objectives.</p><p>6. Labour&nbsp;Crisis</p><p>Furthermore, a labor crisis is being evidenced in advanced economies that are grappling with diminishing labor supply, particularly noticeable in care and transition sectors. For example, numerous areas are readying for substantial urban and community retrofits, but face a shortfall in the workforce that is required to carry out such projects. Moreover, demographic shifts in these economies are outpacing the development of sufficient care infrastructure and labor resources.</p><p>To overcome such labor challenges, groundbreaking strategies are required. It entails a greater reliance on automation, significant investments in demand shifting infrastructures and human capital development and a structural reevaluation and reimagination of migration policies and international relations — such as multi-tier citizenships such as digital nomad and essential services visas or multi-tier participation rights and obligations. Such shifts are vital to reconfigure how we approach the new mass demands of work — from care provision to managing large-scale transition such as retrofits in a 21st-century context (especially considering the constraints on&nbsp;labor).</p><p>These labor issues and constraints are poised to drive profound change in the innovation landscape and transition strategies. The accessibility and distribution of labor and human resources will emerge as a key systemic limitation, with its impact varying significantly across the globe. This factor will be instrumental in determining the nature and efficacy of strategies for transition.</p><p>7. Information Flooding</p><p>The seventh foundational shift reshaping our organizational structures pertains to the nature of information economies. Human systems and institutional economies are inundated with an overwhelming flow of information, fundamentally altering our information processing methods. Instead of synthesizing and comprehensively understanding this influx, we are increasingly reliant on pattern-based computations. This approach involves identifying adjacent patterns to make sense of emerging data trends — a significant departure from traditional methods of knowledge processing.</p><p>However, knowledge institutions are designed to regulate the computation of knowledge rather than pattern recognition. Therefore they struggle to keep pace with the rapid influx of information, either in the computation of information or the pattern sharing. They are increasingly unable to adapt quickly enough to new demands or develop alternative frameworks for understanding. This gap in societal processing capability opens the door to the weaponization of pattern spaces, where myths and false narratives can proliferate, filling the voids left by conventional institutional computation. We are witnessing an era where the ‘hallucination of patterns’ becomes a systematic method to manage the deluge of information.</p><p>A critical challenge will be to construct a new institutional economy that is equipped to handle the scale of information overload. It necessitates a deep understanding of how societies process information and a structural reevaluation of current systems. Addressing this will be key to enhancing our collective capacity and capabilities for managing and facilitating the transition in an era of information abundance.</p><p>It is essential to effectively address societal capability to process vast quantities of information in order to construct robust decision-making structures that are fit for an era marked by heightened complexity and built on mass distribution of agency. The challenge will lie not only in developing information processing and decision-making systems for society, but also how to build such systems as a network capability of society as a whole, rather than for a representative few.</p><p>Moreover, the building of such systems is not just an operational necessity; it is a fundamental issue that sits at the heart of our societal evolution to transcend the transition challenge. These systems must be capable of managing the deluge of information and translating it into coherent, mass multi-agent decision-making processes that are both inclusive and effective in scope and&nbsp;context.</p><p>Navigating the Shift: A New Era of Planetarity **</p><p>The effort of this post is driven by the need to perceive, acknowledge and anticipate these structural changes with regard to our investments in innovation and transition frameworks and recognising that this is essential to prevent an escalating planetary landscape that becomes increasingly in crisis and at risk of geopolitical tension and conflict.</p><p>A dual purpose is served in understanding these contextual shifts. Firstly, the structural nature of the challenges that we face are acknowledged. More importantly, it involves devising of a new class of relevant innovative strategies and domains for the adaptation and mitigation of the impact of these shifts as society transitions.</p><p>Further, as we examine such transitions, we must recognize this moment presents a move from an era defined by industrial internationalism, with its colonisation and extractionism, to a new phase of multipolarity and systemic interconnectedness. This transition, from 19th century globalization to a nascent phase of planetarism, demands care if we are to preserve essential systemic capabilities that we have built as a planetary civilization (such as those exemplified by the microchip, antibiotics, satellites etc.), whilst we systemically and justly rewire our energy, materials, nutrient and cognition systems.</p><p>As we look towards the future, it is becoming increasingly evident that our pathways will not follow a single, universal transition. Instead, it will be characterized by a highly multipolar, multi-perspective, and hyperpluralistic approach. The critical question then becomes: how can we preserve this diversity of perspectives and multipolarity while fostering a new theory of diplomacy? This theory must be rooted in coordination, empathy, and respect amidst such diversity.</p><p>Central to this endeavor may be our ability to construct a new framework for diplomacy that can facilitate negotiation and understanding between various worldviews, playing a pivotal role in crafting a planetary future capable of embracing complex diversities (hard and soft power, new relational theories and a framework that acknowledges interconnected and, shared destinies on a global scale (both human, more than human and machine capability).</p><p>In addition, innovative institutions and the development of new institutional capacities will be required. The concept of diplomacy needs to be reimagined, including by the use of computational machinery and dynamic protocols that can make diplomacy not only more efficient but also legitimate by effectively integrating non-nation state actors and different regional blocs and perspectives, wider groups such as indigenous nations, and even diplomacy that takes into account future generations and more than human species. At last, the infrastructure exists to support the most providing the necessary infrastructure to support the most diverse of plurality. This will lay the groundwork for a new planetary future — and one that harmoniously integrates an array of perspectives and approaches.</p><p>Furthermore, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that as we shift away from our current material economy — a system that has generated abundance for some segments of society and scarcity for others — we are entering an era marked by greater scarcity. This transition could potentially lead us towards a novel concept of abundance. However, this journey is not without its challenges. As we begin to encounter the limitations inherent in our economies, particularly the rise of net-zero-sum scenarios, the risk of conflict and war further escalates.</p> The crucial question is: how do we navigate this transition? How do we move from a reality dominated by the dynamics of abundance through a valley of scarcity to a new paradigm of abundance? The new abundance could be conceptualized not just in material terms but also in terms of meaning. As we constrain our material economy and reshape the social signaling functions that it serves, we need to approach this transformation with careful consideration. There is a potential, perhaps in the next 40 years, to unlock a new era of energy abundance. This could revolutionize our material economy, creating both material and cognitive abundance in ways previously unimagined. <p>While this future pathway holds a promise, it is important to acknowledge that we are entering a world characterized by diminishing — particularly 19th century concepts of abundances. The implications of operating in such a world are profound and warrant significant attention and strategic planning.</p><p>Indy Johar with support from Dm colleagues — all errors and omissions are&nbsp;mine…</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/7-structural-shifts-25c5e0801b9b">7 Structural Shifts:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Telecommunications industry, a cornerstone of global connectivity, has been going through a technological renaissance for some time, driven by innovations such as 5G, IoT, cloud computing and AI. As a result, networks have become increasingly hard to manage. There is a&nbsp;need for automation to handle routine tasks, monitor network health and respond to issues in real-time. However, the existing skill sets within communication service providers (CSPs) may not align with the evolving demands of this dynamic landscape. To succeed in the modern era, CSPs need versatile teams, including data scientists for data interpretation and operations, software developers for automation through vendor application programming interfaces (API) and service assurance engineers for designing closed loops to ensure service reliability.</p>



<p>While CSPs bridge the gap by building teams with diverse experience, they also simultaneously benefit from significant advances on a concurrent trend. Programming languages have evolved toward low-code/no-code paradigms and with the emergence of generative AI, we are at a point where foundational models can generate formal code based on natural language descriptions of the tasks. This gave the new perspective to the concept of intent-based networking (IBN), where human administrators express high-level network objectives in natural language known as “intents” and that these human intents are automatically translated into network policies and configurations. IBN has the potential to improve network management and could become a game-changer in addressing the talent gap within telcos. Taking it a step further, autonomous networks (AN) promise to utilize intents as inputs to autonomously self-configure, self-optimize and self-heal networks as their conditions evolve.</p>



<p>While we can envision a bright future for both IBN and AN, there are persistent concerns about their feasibility and program applications including intent expression, accurate translation into network configuration, system transparency and complexity among others. In this blog, we dive into the areas where their practical application hold potential and analyze the challenges they may encounter along the way.</p>



 A motivating case: introducing new services without intents 



<p>To understand the need for streamlining interactions between CSP teams and the network, we will use a new service deployment as an example.</p>



<p>We assume that the CSP network operation is automated as per the specifications outlined in the <a href="https://www.tmforum.org/resources/standard/ig1230-autonomous-networks-technical-architecture-v1-1-1/">TMF Introductory Guide 1230 (IG1230) on Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture.</a> In that context, the CSP’s OSS has (1) an orchestrator for service provisioning, automated provisioning and automated testing, (2) an assurance system with network inventory that collects data, creates insights about the network state and hence facilitates data-driven decision making in the context of closed-loop control and (3) a policy manager that steers network behavior using predefined policies, ensuring alignment with the broader CSP’s policies. In a nutshell, automated operations revolve around tight coupling of services with their assigned human-designed TOSCA service descriptors, configurations, policies and imperative workflows in which intelligence and decision-making is added by service designers during the design time. Service designers must proactively foresee a wide range of conditions that may occur in the network and provide detailed instructions on how they must be addressed—zero-touch experience is achieved as long as the future conditions have been foreseen and there are policies to handle them.</p>



<p>We use terms Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2 for different service lifecycle stages, namely service design, service instantiation and service assurance, respectively.</p>



 
 Service design comprises the development of various service assets as depicted in Figure 1. This is the task of the service design team, who need to understand the Day1 and Day 2 operations of the service and produce the workflows and scripts required. The red lines in Figure 2 depict the service provisioning process of a new service, ensuring that the service can now be ordered. 
 



Figure 1: Day 0 Service Design Process – Design of Service Assets



 
 Service instantiation occurs when the service order arrives, following a subscriber request. Today in CSPs the service order typically arrives over the TMF 641 interface from the service order manager (SOM). When the service orchestrator receives the service order, it ensures that the workflows are executed and that the requested monitoring configurations, PM/FM models and policies are deployed and running. We show the service instantiation in the Figure 2 in green lines. 
 



 
 Service assurance follows a closed-loop approach wherein the conditions of deployed services undergo continuous monitoring and automated lifecycle actions. We show the assurance closed loop in the Figure 2 in blue lines. 
 



Figure 2: Day0/Day 1/Day 2 Interactions



<p>In summary, it is the design phase that involves a substantial amount of manual work, as it is necessary to furnish the network with instructions for the new service.</p>



 What are intents? 



<p>In IBN, intents refer to high-level objectives that CSP wants to achieve in its network. Instead of dealing with complex low-level network configurations during the Day 0 operations as discussed above, the engineering teams express the objectives with intents and the logic underpinning intents translates them into the required network configuration that fulfills the intent objective.</p>



<p>Following the application of the configurations to the network, the AN then continuously monitors the deployed services and adapts the configuration to ensure that the operation remains in alignment with the specified intents. The AN extends the use of intents into Day 2 operations.</p>



 Perspectives of IBN and AN 



<p>Next, we provide some of the aspects where intents could potentially revolutionize established practices from the pre-intent era:</p>



 
 Day 0 Operations:
 
 Preparation for new services – Leverage generative AI to process natural language input to autonomously supplement service requirements. 



 Introduction of new services – Define new services using natural language, such as “provide a tailored connectivity solution for secure communication within healthcare institutions” or “enable IoT device communication across smart city infrastructure” and leverage generative AI for automatic generation of the necessary service assets. 



 Automated generation of vendor-specific resource drivers ­– Utilize generative AI to create vendor specific resource drivers, based on vendor documentation. 
 
 



 Day 1 Operations:
 
 Simplification of service order – Allows customers to request services using natural language. This user-friendly approach enables a novel service ordering experience, such as mixing and matching offerings from the catalog. 



 Feasibility checks – Streamlines validation checks as customers express their intents by efficiently assessing critical factors like fiber optic line availability. The result is reduced burden on Network Engineers, faster service validation, and more agile and responsive deployment. 
 
 



 Day 2 Operations:
 
 Dynamic service assurance – Enables networks to intelligently respond to changing conditions and user needs. Flexible intent-based policies enhance agility, ensuring real-time reliability and responsiveness of network services. 
 
 
 



 The challenges with IBN and AN 



<p>There are two main challenges to be addressed:</p>



 
 How to express and convey an intent? 



 How to execute on an intent: what does the intent handler look like? 
 



<p>TM Forum introduced the TMF921 Intent-based Networking API, offering a structured framework for defining high-level network intents. TM Forum defines the intent as follows: “Intent is the formal specification of all expectations including requirements, goals, and constraints given to a technical system”. However, the part formal specification introduces a concern: network engineers would need to familiarize themselves with this formal language to harness the full potential of the intent concept. What is more, intents with formal specification do not necessarily reduce the number of parameters that must be provided with them. This aspect challenges the anticipated streamlining of network management that one would typically associate with IBN.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by formalizing the intent specification, the intent handler, the core component of IBN that holds the logic for intent interpretation, becomes merely a deterministic interpreter of the intent formal language. The question raises on how we evolve the intent handler into an autonomous system with declarative way of operation wherein humans are not required to anticipate every potential network condition and provide specific instructions for its resolution. Otherwise, the system operation cannot successfully transition from automated to autonomous (TMF IG1230).</p>



<p>In future blogs we will address the challenges and opportunities of IBN and AN in more detail. Want to learn more?

<p>You asked, and we delivered! At Instana, addressing our customers’ needs and creating a simple tool that is easy to use is fundamental to helping our DevOps and SRE teams reduce burnout rates, allowing them to excel in what they do best. Taking all your feedback and market insights into perspective and careful consideration, we are thrilled to announce that in 2023.</p>



<p>Our team announced different product capabilities designed to simplify your teams’ ability to observe, debug, remediate and enhance your entire stack—integrating observability practices and telemetry data seamlessly into your entire software development lifecycle.</p>



<p>Here’s a comprehensive recap of everything we launched in 2023, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/crn-s-2023-products-of-the-year?page=3">awards</a> and links to the latest update and how you can get started with each enhancement.</p>



 Turbonomic integration (Beta) 



<p>&nbsp;We have launched a bi-directional integration with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">Turbonomic</a>, a milestone that holds great significance for our customers. We understand the impact of downtime, with the average cost being $220K per hour. Organizations estimate that 32% of cloud spend is wasted, prompting many IT professionals to ask, ‘How do you get the most from and for your applications?’ The answer lies in choosing integrated solutions.</p>



 
 Our cutting-edge bi-directional integration with Turbonomic is designed to empower your IT team, transforming them from reactive to proactive and preventative. 



 With this enhancement, the integration will correlate Turbonomic recommendations to an ongoing incident in Instana, providing you with greater control over your stack. 
 


<a href="https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1626327&amp;tp_key=b043e01b85">Join our webinar to explore more</a>



<p>Furthermore, users can analyze the impact of executing Turbo actions on the underlying entity KPIs. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/operationalize-automation-for-faster-more-efficient-incident-resolution-at-a-lower-cost/">Learn more in our announcement blog.</a></p>



 First-class OpenTelemetry support 



<p>Full-stack observability demands thorough visibility and comprehension. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/opentelemetry">OpenTelemetry</a> serves as an indispensable tool for achieving comprehensive visibility, facilitating streamlined practices with common instrumentation, portable formats and interoperable pipelines. OpenTelemetry instrumentation moves to become the foundation of observability for the next wave of cloud and hybrid applications. Instana has deeply integrated OpenTelemetry with our core product and has expanded the coverage that we provide:</p>



 
 Full support for OTLP metrics, traces and logs in the Instana Agent and via our SaaS API. 



 Industry-leading mixed tracing combining OpenTelemetry and Instana AutoTrace spans. 



 Enhancements to OpenTelemetry metrics in Instana, including support for metric labels and histogram instruments. 
 



 
 The Instana Agent enriches OpenTelemetry metrics and traces forwarded by any exporter, including OpenTelemetry collectors. 



 We have contributed semantic conventions for database servers and provided the open source OpenTelemetry Database Data Collector, expanding OpenTelemetry and Instana’s support for monitoring database servers. 



 We have improved the capabilities for linking entities from Instana and OpenTelemetry sources through contributions to the OpenTelemetry SDKs for JavaScript and PHP. 



 We are supporting C++ tracing and metrics through an officially maintained fork of the OpenTelemetry C++ SDK. Learn more by reading our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=tracing-opentelemetry">documentation</a>. 
 



 Synthetic monitoring 



<p>With <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/synthetic-monitoring">synthetic monitoring</a>, you can check how your application works in advance. It helps you find and solve performance problems before they bother your customers.</p>



<p>We understand that companies want to operate their business smoothly with both speed and scale. Hence, our commitment to help you achieve just that—through observability and incident response automation—especially where we have differentiated capabilities.​</p>



 
 We have extended our synthetic monitoring to make sure you get notified when your APIs and transactions are not performing properly (from any location). 



 Additionally, we have also added the capability to create synthetic browser tests. The capability is currently in open beta. With this update, your tests can mimic the interaction of the users with the main workflows in your web application, allowing you to immediately know when your main workflows are broken and take action to fix them. This feature can be used even when you are not an expert. The system enables you to code the script by using the Selenium IDE extension and then import it to Instana. 
 



<p><a href="https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1633022&amp;tp_key=e73eb918b6">Watch our new release webinar to learn more about this update</a>.</p>



 End user monitoring 



<p>We have extended our end user monitoring (EUM) support with the inclusion of crash analysis functionality, which is currently in open beta. We welcome you to try it and provide feedback.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Mobile developers will have all the information in a single tool. Full-stack mobile application traces to the backend traces generated by the application calls.</p>











<p>We have also added the capability of automatically instrument websites!</p>



 
 With this feature, you will be able to have automatic end-to-end visibility on your application’s performance from your user’s browser, all the way down to the database query that was executed without any change in the source code of the monitored application. By using this feature, your infrastructure map will be enriched to show where the websites are hosted. 
 



 SAP observability 



<p>Real-time monitoring is vital for SAP BTP cloud-native applications.</p>



 
 We extended our coverage and currently, Instana supports SAP BTP Kyma cluster monitoring. 



 We also did the same for our SAP ABAP sensor, which is used to monitor the platform and transaction metrics from the ABAP stack. While this is currently in beta, clients are encouraged to try it and provide feedback. 
 







<p>Users can integrate performance metrics from SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) into Instana to view and manage both SAP and non-SAP metrics from a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/single-pane-of-glass-monitoring">single pane of glass</a>. SolMan alerts are also forwarded enabling you to identify problems from your entire IT landscape from a single tool. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/unleashing-real-time-insights-monitoring-sap-btp-cloud-native-applications-with-ibm-instana/">Read more about this enhancement in our blog announcement.</a></p>



 Intelligent actions 



<p>&nbsp;Some of our users may have noticed a new automation icon in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM® Instana® Observability</a> main menu. We announced our action framework, where you can create new actions or reuse your existing automation (e.g., Ansible®, PagerDuty, etc.). Actions can then be associated with various Instana events and will be visible to each event occurrence as potential actions to run.</p>



<p></p> 



<p>You can also leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to get action recommendations based on event context. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/open-beta-instana-action-framework/">Learn more by reading our blog announcement</a></p>



 Differentiated logging for cloud-native environments 



<p>July 2023, we extended our coverage to support logging monitoring feature with unbounded analytics for rich log analytics and great support for the Root Cause Analysis journey.</p>



 
 With our logs in context, which are all logs correlated to appropriate infrastructure components and distributed trace data where available, logs serve as another great source of insights when analysing incidents. 



 With Instana Logging, no manual tagging or instrumentation is required to get to the high-fidelity view of logs in context! Instana automatically does the correlation and presents it in a comprehensive view directly when analyzing logs. 
 







 
 In addition, to support cloud native environments, Instana Agent now collects logs from Docker and contained runtimes automatically, with the same context support as described above. 



 Furthermore, we now run our OpenTelemtry log ingestion in a closed beta program, allowing to ingest arbitrary logs from any source into Instana. Although currently a manual approach, this is planned to be fully automatic coming during 2Q24 and 3Q24 for various technologies. <a href="https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1633022&amp;tp_key=e73eb918b6">Watch our new release webinar to learn more about this update</a>. 
 



 Business observability 



<p>Last year, we announced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/business-activity-monitoring">business monitoring</a> new capability, bringing business context to observability. The business context will add a 4th layer on top of the existing APM observability layers of end-to-end application performance, middleware health and infrastructure.</p>







 
 The new launch allows Instana to automatically understand the business context of IT issues for customers who have automated their business executions using IBM Cloud Pak® for Business Automation, Camunda and jBPM. 



 Optionally, Instana customers can extract critical business data from executing workflows to help them understand the true impact of IT issues in these environments.

<p>The windswept province of Nova Scotia lies on Canada’s Atlantic coast, and comprises part of Mi’kma’ki, the traditional districts of the Mi’kmaq First Nations people. In recent years, Nova Scotia has become a promising site for the clean energy transition, with some of the world’s fastest offshore wind speeds and potential for hydrogen development.</p>



<p>But too often, conversations about the impact of energy development in the region do not include Indigenous perspectives or are inaccessible to people outside of the energy industry. Around the world, many vulnerable communities need support to participate in the energy transition. And while climate technology is minimizing impact and helping to make informed energy decisions, the next step in a just transition is to democratize this information and put it in the hands of communities.</p>



<p>Implementing science and technology alongside Indigenous knowledge and community engagement is an essential approach to address climate challenges, one that is known as “two-eyed seeing.” To support a just transition, IBM® joined forces with nonprofit <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/">Net Zero Atlantic</a> through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a> to help enable informed climate decision-making and empower participation in the clean energy transition for Indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada.</p>



<p></p> 



 A user-first approach to climate tech 



<p>Net Zero Atlantic’s open source <a href="https://netzeroatlantic.ca/acesmodel/about">Atlantic Canada Energy System (ACES) Model</a> is a powerful tool for analyzing and forecasting energy generation and infrastructure development scenarios. To describe and interpret future energy system opportunities with accuracy, both computing power and technical knowledge are often required from the user, which can frequently make such tools feel inaccessible.</p>



<p>The IBM Sustainability Accelerator and Net Zero Atlantic set out to transform this complex resource into a user-friendly, accessible application that would support the Mi’kmaq communities’ role in energy planning and the transition to net zero, taking a user-first approach from the onset of the project’s first phase, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074472741385&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0tex7fHigwMVImFHAR3cvQgyEAAYASAAEgK1DfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Garage</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a very new way of looking at an energy system model, really looking at it from the user perspective,” says Sven Scholtysik, Director of Research at Net Zero Atlantic. “It’s usually the other way around. People try to create the most accurate and most advanced model possible—but there’s very little insight into how people use it and what motivates them to use it.”</p>



<p>The design of “ACES Lite” is focused on enabling the user to navigate complex graphs, geographical models and data interpretations with ease. The application puts user experience first, utilizing IBM technology like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics">IBM® Cognos® Analytics</a> alongside the expertise of volunteers from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting®</a> and more. And through Net Zero Atlantic’s long-standing relationship with the <a href="https://www.uinr.ca/">Unama’ki Institute of Natural Resources</a> in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, ACES Lite has undergone important interactive testing sessions with Mi’kmaq users to generate usability feedback and refine the tool further.</p>



<p>“One of our key roles is to engage community. We do science, but we also engage community to bring forth the traditional knowledge that can be incorporated into that work,” says Lisa Young, Executive Director of the Unama’ki Institute of Natural Resources. “The idea guiding this development was, ‘How can this tool inform how the community engages in the conversation about the energy transition? How does it help them make informed decisions?’”</p>



IBM and Net Zero Atlantic will continue to pilot ACES Lite with user groups in Cape Breton, while also exploring new innovations and additions.



 Two-eyed seeing and the importance of collaboration 



<p>Implementing technology alongside Indigenous knowledge is an approach known as two-eyed seeing, described by Mi’kmaq Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. Lisa Young shares that this is a guiding approach for the Unama’ki Institute of Natural Resources, and one that the project with Net Zero Atlantic and IBM has incorporated.</p>



<p>“Two-eyed seeing means utilizing the best of Western science and technology, but also pairing it with the best of Indigenous perspectives, knowledge, and wisdom—so, how to use that knowledge in a good way, having a positive impact on the environment,” says Young. “In order to bring that perspective, you have to engage community broadly, to help us bring the knowledge from the land and guide us on how we advance the work.”</p>



<p>Scholtysik emphasizes the value of collaboration on this project with both IBM and the Unama’ki Institute of Natural Resources. He notes the expertise and enthusiasm of the IBM project team as a highlight of the organization’s time in the IBM Sustainability Accelerator. Other communities in Canada, such as the government of Nova Scotia, offshore wind groups, and academic and research teams have also participated in the ideation and testing process thus far, expressing excitement about the tool’s potential applications across the province.</p>



The design of “ACES Lite” is focused on enabling the end user to navigate complex graphs, geographical models and data interpretations with ease.



 What’s next for ACES Lite 



<p>As a next step, IBM and Net Zero Atlantic will continue to pilot ACES Lite with user groups in Cape Breton, while also exploring new innovations and additions. Feedback from the community has helped to identify where the user experience can be enhanced—for example, an opportunity to enhance the visualization aspects of land usage associated with the development of diverse clean energy technologies, and incorporating a feature that represents the economic impact of such projects. Scholtysik looks forward to bringing the application to the public by the end of 2024 and can even see its potential for deployment in other regions undergoing energy transition.</p>



<p>“Energy system models are an excellent tool for people to have at their fingertips,” says Scholtysik. “Models like ACES Lite can make it easier for people to strategically plan for a future energy system that is sustainable, reliable and affordable. But what we really need to do is assess the impact of energy system transitions from a community perspective, and I think ACES Lite marks a first step in that direction.”</p>

<p>Organizations that provide an excellent customer experience (CX) can improve sales revenues by 2 to 7 percent and profitability by 1 to 2 percent, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/tr/our-insights/prediction-the-future-of-customer-experience">according to McKinsey</a>. It’s no surprise. Focusing on good CX can increase customer satisfaction and drive more meaningful customer interactions, ultimately increasing sales and customer retention. As such, more organizations are increasing their dedication to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/">CX strategy</a> and looking towards successful customer experience examples for inspiration. Their aim is to create memorable customer experiences carried out through e-commerce channels or in-store. Thankfully, customer-centric organizations have many tools, examples, and use cases at their disposal to meet the growing needs of today’s customers.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/">Read more: Key components of a winning customer experience strategy</a>



 <a></a><a></a>Great customer experience examples for driving value 



<p>Here are some of the best customer experience examples that organizations of all sizes can consider adopting:</p>



 Investing in customer onboarding 



<p>How an organization begins its CX has an outsized impact on the customer’s overall user experience. It is important to meet the customer’s needs on day one, by making an emotional connection.</p>



<p>First, the organization puts the customers’ interest first when devising marketing strategies. For example, organizations can make it easier for prospects to learn more about available solutions so that prospects can decide whether they want to purchase them or not.</p>



<p>The right cadence of messaging, tutorials, and solicitation of feedback is a great way to understand how customers are using an organization’s products and mitigate any early issues. After a purchase, the organization can send a welcome message and thank the customer for choosing them. Then they can send through any relevant instructions or tutorials that can help them derive the most value from their products. Next, they can solicit feedback or inquire if the user needs support. Finally, they can offer discounts for an accessory or a new product.</p>



 Using customer data to improve relationships with the customer base 



<p>It’s true that customers are increasingly aware of and concerned about the data organizations have on them. However, there are several great ways that organizations can use that information to provide a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-trends/">great customer experience</a>. Asking customers some information about their interests and their demographics can help create personalized experiences.</p>



<p>For example, a retailer can offer a discount or free item on the customer’s birthday. Or an experience provider can minimize unnecessary offers by limiting marketing emails to events in the person’s area. This experience can often be done through automation and personalized emails that are driven by an up-to-date <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) platform.</p>



 Creating customer loyalty rewards 



<p>It costs organizations more to attract new customers than to retain the ones they currently have. One way to improve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">customer retention</a> and create happy customers is to reward customers for repeat purchases.</p>



<p>For instance, a retailer might give a 10 percent discount on every purchase, reducing churn. They might also solicit customer feedback on what perks and rewards would best meet customer needs, such as unique products or experiences that are only made available to a select few. Organizations doing this are likely to benefit from an increase in the overall lifetime value of those loyal customers. It is also likely to increase the organization’s net promoter score (NPS), which determines whether an individual recommends products to their peer group.</p>



 Engaging in transparent pricing 



<p>Organizations will often use data-driven analysis to identify the precise price point that drives profitability. But they need to be as honest with customers as possible about that price and why they’re charging it. Customers absolutely loathe feeling that they were tricked or deceived into thinking something costs less than it does. At a bare minimum, organizations should meet customer expectations by providing the exact price that they should expect to pay. Organizations can do this by advertising their prices online, including any additional fees. </p>



<p>Organizations that do not sell directly online can help customers find where their products are retailed for less. In healthcare, organizations can do this by offering itemized bills to patients. And financial services organizations can demonstrate how the fees they charge leads to greater returns for their customers. Event promoters can show how much a ticket costs upfront, versus adding convenience fees and other costs at the checkout screen.</p>



 Establishing an empowered and efficient customer support function 



<p>Alleviating customer pain points through great customer service experience and a strong contact center is an important component of providing a better customer experience. Customers strongly dislike talking to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-types/">customer service</a> representative that is not authorized to fix their problem or does not have the right resources on hand for real-time remediation. They should do things like create a straightforward return policy. This can help ensure that customer service teams are given leeway to solve customers’ problems, such as providing refunds, discounts, or a replacement.</p>



<p>Thankfully, technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) have made it easier for employees to answer those customers’ questions. In addition, the customer support team needs an appropriate structure so that routing requests to the appropriate representative happens as efficiently as possible. Doing so eliminates the potential for negative word-of-mouth from existing customers.</p>



 Providing a stellar digital experience 



<p>Customers are increasingly comfortable communicating with organizations and making purchases online. As such, organizations must meet customer needs across the whole customer journey, including the entire omnichannel experience.</p>



<p>From self-service mobile apps to AI chatbots, organizations are using digital transformation initiatives to adapt to changing customer behavior. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">Digital experiences</a> can transform their customer experience management across multiple touchpoints. Digital experiences can improve customer engagement by making it easier to reach customers through social media or newsletters and for customers to provide feedback.</p>



 Customer experience, an investment worth making 



<p>Providing a positive customer experience can become a competitive advantage. IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade. Generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses.</p>



<p>IBM puts customer experience strategy at the center of your business, helping you position it as a competitive advantage. With deep expertise in customer journey mapping and design, platform implementation, and data and AI consulting, IBM Consulting can help you harness best-in-class technologies to drive transformation across the customer lifecycle. These end-to-end consulting solutions span marketing, commerce, sales, and service.</p>

<p>Hybrid Cloud Mesh, which is generally available now, is revolutionizing application connectivity across hybrid multicloud environments. Let’s draw a comparison between Hybrid Cloud Mesh and a typical service mesh to better understand the nuances of these essential components in the realm of modern enterprise connectivity. This comparison deserves merit because both the solutions are focused on application-centric connectivity albeit in a different manner. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we delve into the comparison, let’s briefly revisit the concept of Hybrid Cloud Mesh and a typical service mesh. &nbsp;</p>







 Hybrid Cloud Mesh 



<p>Hybrid Cloud Mesh is a modern application-centric connectivity solution that is simple, secure, scalable and seamless. It creates a secure network overlay for applications distributed across cloud, edge and on-prem and holistically tackles the challenges posed by distribution of services across hybrid multicloud. &nbsp;</p>







 Service mesh 



<p>A service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer that manages all connectivity requirements between microservices. It manages service-to-service communication, providing essential functionalities such as service discovery, load balancing, encryption and authentication. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Language libraries for connectivity have partial and inconsistent implementation of traffic management features and are difficult to maintain and upgrade. A service mesh eliminates such libraries and allows services to focus on their business logic and communicate with other services without adding any connectivity logic in situ. &nbsp;</p>



 Hybrid Cloud Mesh versus service mesh: a comparative analysis&nbsp; 



 1. Scope of connectivity 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Goes beyond microservices within a containerized application, extending connectivity to applications regardless whether they’re form-factor deployed across on-premises, public cloud and private cloud infrastructure. Its scope encompasses a broader range of deployment scenarios.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Primarily focuses on managing communication between microservices within a containerized environment. Although many service meshes have started looking outward, enabling multi-cluster any-to-any connectivity. &nbsp; 
 



 2. Multicloud connectivity 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Seamlessly connects applications across hybrid multicloud environments, offering a unified solution for organizations with diverse cloud infrastructures.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Typically designed for applications deployed within a specific cloud or on-premises environment. Many service meshes have expanded scope to multicloud connectivity, but they are not fully optimized for it. &nbsp; 
 



 3. Traffic engineering capabilities 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Utilizes waypoints to support path optimization for cost, latency, bandwidth and others,. enhancing application performance and security.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: No traffic engineering capabilities. Primarily focuses on internal traffic management within the microservices architecture.&nbsp; 
 



 4. Connectivity intent expression 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Allows users to express connectivity intent through the UI or CLI, providing an intuitive, user-friendly experience with minimal learning curve. &nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Requires users to implement complex communication patterns in the sidecar proxy using configuration files. Service mesh operations entail complexity and demand a substantial learning curve. The expert team responsible for managing the service mesh must consistently invest time and effort to effectively utilize and maintain the service mesh. Due to steep learning curve and tooling required (such as integration with CI/CD pipeline or day 0 to day 2 automation), service meshes can be adopted only after customers gain a certain scale to make the investment worthwhile. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 5. Management and control plane 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Employs a centralized SaaS-based management and control plane, enhancing ease of use and providing observability. Users interact with the mesh manager through a user-friendly UI or CLI.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Often utilizes decentralized management, with control planes distributed across the microservices, requiring coordination for effective administration.&nbsp; 
 



 6. Integration with gateways 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Integrates with various gateways, promoting adaptability to diverse use cases and future-ready for upcoming gateway technologies.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Primarily relies on sidecar proxies for communication between microservices within the same cluster. Typically features on the proxy are extended to meet requirements. &nbsp; 
 



 7. Application discovery 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Mesh manager continuously discovers and updates multicloud deployment infrastructure, automating the discovery of deployed applications and services.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Typically relies on service registration and discovery mechanisms within the containerized environment.&nbsp; 
 



 8. Dynamic network maintenance 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Automatically adapts to dynamic changes in workload placement or environment, enabling resilient and reliable connectivity at scale without manual intervention.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: Usually, the day 2 burden to manage a service mesh connecting applications across multicloud is huge due to complexity of operations required to manage dynamic infrastructure changes. It requires manual adjustments to accommodate changes in microservices deployed in a multicloud environment. There’s significant effort in keeping it running such as—upgrades, security fixes and others apart from infrastructure changes. This takes away a lot of time and very little time is left for implementing new features. &nbsp; 
 



 9. Infrastructure overhead 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Data plane is composed of a limited number of edge-gateways and waypoints.  



 Service mesh: Significant overhead due to sidecar proxy architecture which requires 1 sidecar-proxy for every workload. &nbsp; 
 



 10. Multitenancy 



 
 Hybrid Cloud Mesh: Offers robust multitenancy; moreover, subtenants can be created to maintain separation between different departments or verticals within an organization.&nbsp; 



 Service mesh: May lack the capability to accommodate multitenancy or a subtenant architecture. Few customers may create a separate service mesh per cluster to keep the tenants separate. Hence, they must deploy and manage their own gateways to connect various service meshes. &nbsp; 
 



 Take the next step with Hybrid Cloud Mesh&nbsp; 



<p>We are excited to showcase a tech preview of Hybrid Cloud Mesh supporting the use of Red Hat® Service Interconnect gateways simplifying application connectivity and security across platforms, clusters and clouds. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/service-interconnect">Red Hat Service Interconnect</a>, announced 23 May 2023 at Red Hat Summit, creates connections between services, applications and workloads across hybrid necessary environments.&nbsp;</p>

 Cloud storage is amazing — and risky 







<p>The 2000s may be over, but cloud storage is still amazing. Services such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Drive</a>, and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">OneDrive</a> all help users share files with friends, recover when a hard drive crashes, and move files between their devices. Still, hearing about data breaches[<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/dropbox-files-left-unprotected-open-to-all">1</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74qb/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts">2</a>, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/dropbox-breach-130-github/">3</a>] leaves people wondering whether their data is safe in the cloud.</p>



 Security on today’s cloud lacks end-to-end encryption 







<p>Today’s cloud storage services use fairly similar client–server architectures that start with a locally installed application that monitors a specific file folder on a user’s computer. When the app detects changes in the folder, it relays them to the user’s account on the cloud. The cloud service handles copying them to a user’s other devices.</p>



<p>One of the problems with cloud storage is that files are not end–to–end encrypted (E2EE) – meaning that files encrypted before leaving a user’s device do not remain encrypted until they return. Rather, most providers use the transport encryption + encryption at rest paradigm. In this model, transport encryption encrypts files sent to the server (e.g., HTTPS), but decrypts them upon arrival. Next, the server applies encryption at rest so that only encrypted files are stored. While providers tout the strength of their encryption algorithms (e.g., AES 256), what they don’t highlight is that the server decrypts user files before re-encrypting them and that they hold the decryption keys!</p>



<p>While this model is efficient, it is vulnerable to attack or service provider bugs and unfortunately is the mainstay of cloud storage. This leaves users wondering: Are cloud providers accessing my data? and Can hackers steal my digital files? &nbsp;</p>



 We can make the cloud safer with Decentralized Identity 



<p>Answering those questions is difficult and varies over time. So, how do individual users protect their files in the cloud? One idea is to help users layer end–to–end encryption (E2EE) on top of any features the cloud storage services provide. This is fairly easy using the cryptographic features of decentralized identity (DI).</p>



<p>The DIDComm messaging specification was created to provide a platform-independent yet interoperable encrypted messaging capability that enables users of a wide range of DI platforms to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages.</p>



<p>This E2EE messaging capability can be used to secure files stored on virtually any cloud storage platform without divulging any plaintext file data content to the cloud service. Further, by storing secure files in an encrypted messaging format, those files can potentially be activated to later perform a myriad of secure file services for security and privacy conscious users.</p>

<p>We all want to see our ideal human values reflected in our technologies. We expect technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to not lie to us, to not discriminate, and to be safe for us and our children to use. Yet many AI creators are currently facing backlash for the biases, inaccuracies and problematic data practices being exposed in their models. These issues require more than a technical, algorithmic or AI-based solution.&nbsp; In reality, a holistic, socio-technical approach is required.</p>



 The math demonstrates a powerful truth 



<p>All predictive models, including AI, are more accurate when they incorporate diverse human intelligence and experience. This is not an opinion; it has empirical validity. Consider the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Diversity_prediction_theorem">diversity prediction theorem</a>. Simply put, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small — supporting the concept of “the wisdom of the crowd.” In an influential study, it was shown that diverse groups of low-ability problem solvers can outperform groups of high-ability problem solvers (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0403723101">Hong &amp; Page, 2004</a>).<br><br>In mathematical language: the wider your variance, the more standard your mean. The equation looks like this:</p>







<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1406/1406.7563.pdf">further study</a> provided more calculations that refine the statistical definitions of a wise crowd, including ignorance of other members’ predictions and inclusion of those with maximally different (negatively correlated) predictions or judgements. So, it’s not just volume, but diversity that improves predictions. How might this insight affect evaluation of AI models?</p>



 Model (in)accuracy 



<p>To quote a common aphorism, all models are wrong. This holds true in the areas of statistics, science and AI. Models created with a lack of domain expertise can lead to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lion-of-gripsholm-castle-strangnas-sweden">erroneous</a> outputs.</p>



<p>Today, a tiny homogeneous group of people determine what data to use to train generative AI models, which is drawn from sources that greatly overrepresent English. “For most of the over 6,000 languages in the world, the text data available is not enough to train a large-scale foundation model” (from “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</a>,” Bommasani et al., 2022).</p>



<p>Additionally, the models themselves are created from limited architectures: “Almost all state-of-the-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, BART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in the foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">Bommasani et al.</a>)”</p>



<p>For generative AI to better reflect the diverse communities it serves, a far wider variety of human beings’ data must be represented in models.</p>



<p>Evaluating model accuracy goes hand-in-hand with evaluating bias. We must ask, what is the intent of the model and for whom is it optimized? Consider, for example, who benefits most from content-recommendation algorithms and search engine algorithms. Stakeholders may have widely different interests and goals. Algorithms and models require targets or proxies for Bayes error: the minimum error that a model must improve upon. This proxy is often a person, such as a subject matter expert with domain expertise.</p>



 A very human challenge: Assessing risk before model procurement or development 



<p>Emerging AI regulations and action plans are increasingly underscoring the importance of algorithmic impact assessment forms. The goal of these forms is to capture critical information about AI models so that governance teams can assess and address their risks before deploying them. Typical questions include:</p>



 
 What is your model’s use case? 



 What are the risks for disparate impact? 



 How are you assessing fairness? 



 How are you making your model explainable? 
 



<p>Though designed with good intentions, the issue is that most AI model owners do not understand how to evaluate the risks for their use case.&nbsp; A common refrain might be, “How could my model be unfair if it is not gathering personally identifiable information (PII)?” Consequently, the forms are rarely completed with the thoughtfulness necessary for governance systems to accurately flag risk factors.</p>



<p>Thus, the socio-technical nature of the solution is underscored. A model owner—an individual—cannot simply be given a list of checkboxes to evaluate whether their use case will cause harm. Instead, what is required is groups of people with widely varying lived-world experiences coming together in communities that offer psychological safety to have difficult conversations about disparate impact.</p>



 Welcoming broader perspectives for trustworthy AI 



<p>IBM® believes in taking a “client zero” approach, implementing the recommendations and systems it would make for its own clients across consulting and product-led solutions. This approach extends to ethical practices, which is why IBM created a Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence (COE).</p>



<p>As explained above, diversity of experiences and skillsets is critical to properly evaluate the impacts of AI. But the prospect of participating in a Center of Excellence could be intimidating in a company bursting with AI innovators, experts and distinguished engineers, so cultivating a community of psychological safety is needed. IBM communicates this clearly by saying, “Interested in AI? Interested in AI ethics? You have a seat at this table.”</p>



<p>The COE offers training in AI ethics to practitioners at every level. Both synchronous learning (teacher and students in class settings) and asynchronous (self-guided) programs are offered.</p>







<p>But it’s the COE’s applied training that gives our practitioners the deepest insights, as they work with global, diverse, multidisciplinary teams on real projects to better understand disparate impact. They also leverage design thinking frameworks that IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/">Design for AI</a> group uses internally and with clients to assess the unintended effects of AI models, keeping those who are often marginalized top of mind. (See Sylvia Duckworth’s <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/work-with-us/equality-diversity-inclusion/anti-racism-working-group/anti-racism-resources-march-2023-intersectionality-of-privilege">Wheel of Power and Privilege</a> for examples of how personal characteristics intersect to privilege or marginalize people.) IBM also donated many of the frameworks to the open-source community <a href="https://www.designethically.com/">Design Ethically</a>.</p>



<p>Below are a few of the reports IBM have publicly published on these projects:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-u-s-chamber-of-commerce-foundation-and-ibm-explore-generative-ais-applications-for-skills-based-hiring/">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and IBM explore generative AI’s applications for skills-based hiring</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-the-titanic-helped-us-think-about-explainable-ai/">How the Titanic helped us think about Explainable AI</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/a-framework-to-render-ai-principles-actionable/">A Framework to Render AI Principles Actionable</a> 
 



<p>Automated AI model governance tools are required to glean important insights about how your AI model is performing. But note, capturing risk well before your model has been developed and is in production is optimal. By creating communities of diverse, multidisciplinary practitioners that offer a safe space for people to have tough conversations about disparate impact, you can begin your journey to operationalizing your principles and develop AI responsibly.</p>



<p>In practice, when you are hiring for AI practitioners, consider that well over 70% of the effort in creating models is curating the right data. You want to hire people who know how to gather data that is representative and but that is also gathered with consent. You also want people who know to work closely with domain experts to make certain that they have the correct approach.&nbsp; Ensuring these practitioners have the emotional intelligence to approach the challenge of responsibly curating AI with humility and discernment is key. We must be intentional about learning how to recognize how and when AI systems can exacerbate inequity just as much as they can augment human intelligence.</p>

<p>Many managers in asset-intensive industries like energy, utilities or process manufacturing, perform a delicate high-wire act when managing inventory. Finding the right balance becomes crucial for helping ensure the success of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) initiatives, specifically the spare parts that support them.</p>



 What’s at stake? 



<p>Whether MRO processes address preventive maintenance, service failures or shutdown overhauls, the wanted results are the same: deliver increased service levels, function safely and sustainably, operate efficiently and reduce unplanned and costly downtime.</p>



<p>A recent report shows a significant increase in the cost of manufacturing downtime from 2021 to 2022, with Fortune Global 500 companies now losing 11% of their yearly turnover which amounts to nearly USD 1.5 trillion, up from USD 864 billion in 2019 to 2020. 1</p>



<p>Another study revealed:</p>







 The swinging pendulum 



<p>The MRO spare parts inventory varies depending on the industry and equipment, ranging from specific items to encompassing more basic supplies. These supplies include everything from large infrastructure items such as turbines, generators, transformers and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to smaller items like gears, grease and mops. Many asset-intensive businesses are prioritizing inventory optimization due to the pressures of complying with growing industry 4.0 regulations, undergoing digital transformation and the need for cost-cutting.</p>



<p>Over time, inventory managers have tested different approaches to determine the best fit for their organizations.</p>



<p>For many years, businesses favored just-in-time operations as the most logical approach for managing inventory and minimizing holding costs. However, recent disruptions in the global supply chain, due to the pandemic and geo-specific issues, have caught many off guard.</p>



<p>If Operations needed a spare part that wasn’t readily available, it often resulted in equipment downtime or costly stockouts. Even in the past, this method frequently led to additional expenses for expediting or shipping, along with concerns about the quality of parts.</p>



<p>Considering that IDC surveyed 37% of companies that manage spare parts inventory by using spreadsheets, email, shared folders or an uncertain approach, it becomes evident that this practice carries more risk than it might seem.2 Unless your demand forecasting is accurate, adopting a reactive approach might prove less efficient.</p>



<p>Now, consider the just-in-case approach. Some managers choose to stock excess spare parts due to past encounters with delays and other negative consequences. Maintaining safety stock is beneficial but excessive inventory incurs costs and demands significant time for management. When assets lack criticality and priority assignments, there is a risk of accumulating unnecessary parts that might become obsolete on the shelves. This, in turn, initiates a continuous cycle of spending on inventory reduction efforts.</p>



 The benefits of finding the right balance 



<p>So, when considering the drawbacks of both just-in-time and just-in-case approaches, the goal becomes finding the ideal balance that helps ensure you have the right materials to sustain business operations while providing your teams with what they need at the right time.</p>



<p>This isn’t purely theoretical. There are quantifiable benefits to balancing the dynamics of MRO spares and material demand. Many organizations lack the in-house resources or knowledge to run these necessary procedures but those capable of doing so report:3</p>



 
 A 50% reduction in unplanned downtime associated with parts. 



 A 40% reduction in inventory costs. 



 A 35% decrease in maintenance budgets. 



 A 25% increase in service levels. 
 



 How to achieve the right balance 



<p>The short answer: collect, analyze and act on data in real-time to unlock immediate value across your operations. Is it easier said than done? It can be if you rely on a spreadsheet, physical asset counts or solely on condition monitoring.</p>



<p>Consider these questions:</p>



 
 Do you have a platform that combines statistical analyses, prescriptive analytics and optimization algorithms? 



 Can you segment data from all your systems like enterprise asset management, enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management and sensor technology, by using key parameters like cost, criticality, usage, actual lead times and more? 



 If you rely on transactional ERP systems, are you missing the critical analytics and reporting capabilities you need and recognized gaps in SAP for asset-intensive industries? 



 Can you review historical data modules? 



 Do you perform baseline analyses that look at inventory value based on average price, inherited items and other criteria? 



 Can you conduct what-if scenarios to visualize your options? 



 Do you have purpose-built algorithms to improve intermittent and variable demand forecasting? 



 Can you group and prioritize work by using work queues and monitor progress by organizational areas and data sets? 
 



<p>While artificial intelligence (AI) already factors into many inventory managers’ plans, it’s worth keeping an eye on the latest iteration of the technology. Generative AI has the potential to deliver powerful support in key data areas:</p>



 
 Master data cleansing to reduce duplications and flag outliers. 



 Master data enrichment to enhance categorization and materials attributes. 



 Master data quality to improve scoring, prioritization and automated validation of data.

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">Renewable energy</a>, also known as clean energy, is produced from natural resources that are generated and replenished faster than they are consumed—such as the sun, water and wind. Most renewable energy sources produce zero carbon emissions and minimal air pollutants. Fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas) on the other hand, are finite resources and release harmful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, when burned. They are widely considered to be the main causes of climate change and specifically, global warming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the types of renewable energy sources available can be a key step towards reducing your carbon footprint and for organizations, reducing the environmental impacts of your operations and supply chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Solar energy has evolved to be efficient, versatile and resilient. Currently, there are two main ways to generate solar power: photovoltaics (PV), which is used for smaller scale applications, and concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP), which is used mainly for utility and industry-scale applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solar PV installations, which include solar panels, have a unique set of challenges including cloud movement, weather, tree location and more. To help overcome these challenges, technological advances are making <a href="https://www.cleanenergyreviews.info/blog/most-efficient-solar-panels">solar cells more flexible</a>, lighter, easier to install, less expensive to produce and more powerful by requiring less space to collect the same amount (or more) of light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, solar power is used across industries for a variety of applications. Individual homes and businesses might install rooftop solar panels to generate on-site electricity. On a larger scale, solar farms can be installed on vacant land for industrial applications, helping to reduce energy spending. Data centers, hospitals, government facilities and more use solar power to supplement energy needs.</p>



 Wind power&nbsp; 



<p>The modern wind turbine was built in 1940 and the technology has evolved steadily and significantly since. Today’s wind turbines vary from small (single home or business) to utility-scale (offshore wind farms). Wind energy is a cost-effective way to incorporate clean, sustainable energy into the power supply. And when it comes to wildlife impacts, wind power projects rank lower than any other energy source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although used for general electricity generation, localized wind power is still also used to mill grain and pump water. Wind power can also provide energy for electric vehicle charging stations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2022, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-expand-u-s-offshore-wind-energy/">White House announced</a> an initiative to expand U.S. offshore wind energy production by 2035 using large-scale floating turbines that can be placed in deeper water. This has the potential to more than double production capacity.</p>



 Hydropower&nbsp; 



<p>Water is the <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">largest source of renewable energy</a>. Hydroelectric power relies on the movement of water and is the greatest contributor of renewable electricity across the globe. It uses marine and tidal energy, the flow of rivers and streams, reservoirs and dams to move turbines that generate electricity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond electricity generation, many industries leverage hydropower for operations. For example, mining uses water in remote locations to aid in extractions and textile and chemical manufacturers may use on-site hydropower systems to power processes such as washing, fabrication, sanitation and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tidal power in particular has yet untapped potential. Several tidal power technologies are currently being researched and developed including:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Tidal barrage: Dams with turbines are placed at the entrance to bays or estuaries so that when water is released through it generates power.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Tidal current: Turbines anchored to buoys or the ocean floor take advantage of ocean current movement. &nbsp; 



 Wave energy: Wave movement and pressure are used to generate power—ocean areas with strong wind currents work best.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>While water is an abundant natural resource, it can be sensitive to environmental changes. For example, diminishing winds can affect the number and power of waves and drought conditions can reduce the amount of water in reservoirs, streams and rivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Geothermal&nbsp; 



<p>Geothermal energy systems convert heat from within the Earth (in the form of hot steam and hydrocarbon vapor) into electricity. The electricity generated from geothermal energy is used across industries. For example, it provides heat for agricultural greenhouses as well as heating and cooling for manufacturing and food processing. Geothermal energy is also used to heat and cool commercial buildings including hospitals, schools and more. Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) are used for smaller scale applications, such as powering homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both large geothermal power plants and smaller-scale GHPs require a relatively small footprint compared to other renewable energy sources. Additionally, the inexhaustible heat flow of the Earth’s interior provides a continuously replenishable source of fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Biomass energy&nbsp; 



<p>Biomass uses organic materials and byproducts to provide direct heat, generate electric power and create biofuels including biodiesel and ethanol. Biofuels can be used in industrial boilers to generate steam that powers processes. They also have the potential to replace fossil fuels in the transportation sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bioenergy offers more consistent total energy generation than solar and wind energy, but it does cause low-level greenhouse gases. These gases combined with additional environmental effects including landfill-use effects, cast doubt on how sustainable biomass energy really is.&nbsp;</p>



 What about nuclear power?&nbsp; 



<p>Nuclear power requires the rare and non-renewable mineral uranium but is still considered a low carbon emission source of energy. The next generation of nuclear power plants and generators are smaller, more versatile and energy efficient. Advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) can vary in size based on need and have a variety of applications including power generation, desalination, heating and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, nuclear power and hydropower provide three quarters of the world’s low-carbon energy, but due to safety concerns and operating costs, nuclear power generation is being reduced in advanced economies. With minimal new investment being made, nuclear power generation <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system">may be reduced</a> by two-thirds by the year 2040.&nbsp;</p>



 Understanding the power grid&nbsp; 



<p>Understanding where and how power is generated can help you determine the most effective renewable energy strategy. Many power grids use a combination of renewable power and fossil fuels to provide a stable electric supply. Microgrids—small, independent networks—connect into the main grid and use renewable power and alternative energy sources to balance load requirements. Since microgrids offer local supply with greater grid stability and resiliency, they help reduce the likelihood of energy supply disruptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many renewable energy source options available, so people and organizations can choose the best option to meet their sustainability goals. Whether with a dedicated, on-site renewable energy system, a grid that utilizes a mix of energy sources or a hybrid approach that uses a combination of both, the choice can be based on convenience, cost-effectiveness or other factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IBM, 64% of the company’s energy consumption across global operations comes from renewable sources. Of that, 49% is sourced directly from renewable power suppliers and 15% directly from the grid. You can read more about IBM’s impact <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/files/reports-policies/2022/IBM_2022_ESG_Report_and_Addendum.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Renewable energy meets emerging technology&nbsp; 



<p>Technologies including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI</a>) and data analytics are key to enhancing the benefits of renewable energy. They can help streamline and automate energy technologies, like creating create customized models to promote energy supply optimization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, data provides immense value to energy and utility companies. Insights regarding the performance and health of operational assets, including digital ones, along with maintenance, repair and replacement schedules is crucial to keeping the power on. Integrating AI can further optimize energy and utilities operations with new insights that delve into the root causes of problems as well as building a predictive maintenance framework. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/?lang=en&amp;cc=undefined&amp;lnk=mhsrch&amp;q=bruce+power">Read how Bruce Power is managing their future now with a dynamic enterprise asset management (EAM) platform built using the IBM® Maximo® Application Suite</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

 Are you the top Data Scientist in the land? Demonstrate your case for 1st place in this year’s data challenge championship season.  Introduction <p>This blog introduces the kickoff of the 2024 Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship. The<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo"> first Data Challenge of the year</a> is live on Desights now and ends on Tuesday, Jan 30, 2024. ’24 is the 3rd year of Ocean Protocol-sponsored data science competitions. This year welcomes season 2 of the championship and leaderboard points. Additional details about the 2023 Season can be found <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/2023-data-challenge-championship-leaderboard-awards-f489cc45cf99">in this blog post</a>. Some minor details have been added/subtracted to this year’s championship, which are presented below:</p> What’s New This&nbsp;Season? <p>2023 welcomed over 150 unique data scientists competing in data challenges. To accommodate an increasing number of recurring participants, we have raised the prize pool for each data challenge from $5000 USD to $6500 USD available every cycle. Due to this, the 250 OCEAN participation bonus for submitting reports &amp; proposals has concluded.</p><p>Starting with the current data challenge (<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis</a>) the $6500 prize pool will be distributed to the top 10 scored submissions per data challenge. Additionally, leaderboard points for the championship season will be rewarded for every challenge, scaled to the top 10 on a given data challenge. All participants outside of the top 10 will not receive points towards the season leaderboard. Furthermore, new data challenges will begin roughly on 2 Thursdays of each month, and each will be open to participate for 20 days. 2022 &amp; 2023 data challenges tested different time durations between 7–30 days. It has been determined that initiatives and hypothesis testing that require longer than 20 days will be tagged and executed as something other than a data challenge (data science competition).</p><p>Beyond the program structure, new features and functionalities of <a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Desights.ai</a> continue to roll out regularly. Desights is the application that the Ocean Data Science team uses to conduct data challenges. The platform continues to mature as the web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to AI &amp; ML challenges, business intelligence, applied data science, and predictive analytics.</p> How It&nbsp;Works <p>There are 3 points to pay attention to while submitting:</p>  You will need a Desights Profile to submit to a data challenge.

<p>Since its inception, Veramo has been designed as a modular framework for decentralized identity and verifiable data, utilizing a “plugin” architecture. If you need to support a new DID method, a new credential type, or an alternative storage layer, you can simply add a plugin for that functionality into your Veramo agent and continue to use the rest of the agent’s functionality without having to do a bunch of extra integration work.</p><p>Now we’ve brought this “plugin paradigm” to the Veramo Agent Explorer.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the Agent Explorer is a React application that allows you to connect to (local, remote, or in-browser) Veramo agents and interact with them through an intuitive user interface. The Agent Explorer allows you to create and manage your DIDs, create and verify credentials, and even communicate with other DIDs through the DIDComm interface.</p><p>Now, you can bring your own user experience into the Agent Explorer by creating plugins that can be loaded into this front-end dynamically. Plugins can be as simple or complex as you want, depending on the experience you want to provide. Plugins can provide custom rendering for certain credential types, additional DIDComm message handlers, or even full “windows” into your application or protocol without having to re-implement all the DID, credential, and storage management that the Agent Explorer provides.</p>Plugins page in “Settings” of Agent Explorer&nbsp;app<p>Much of the existing Agent Explorer functionality is already implemented through built-in plugins, which you’re free to turn on or off at your discretion.</p><p>To develop your plugins, please refer to the Agent Explorer Plugin documentation, available here: <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/agent-explorer/blob/main/packages/plugin/README.md">https://github.com/veramolabs/agent-explorer/blob/main/packages/plugin/README.md</a>. This page also links to several existing plugins that you might use for inspiration or as a guide for developing your own Agent Explorer&nbsp;plugins.</p><p>To celebrate this new functionality, we’re hosting a small hackathon focused on Agent Explorer plugins.

<p>When people talk about <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">onboarding and offboarding</a>, onboarding gets all the attention. We talk about how to make a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">seamless onboarding experience and get your new employee to work fast</a>. How to provide them with the birthright apps they need to do their job. But we don’t talk about what happens when it’s time to part ways with an employee and what needs to be done then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring proper offboarding is a huge concern for small businesses. When you part ways with an employee, there’s a lot you can forget that can leave you vulnerable:&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the recovery email and phone number aren’t reset, the user might be able to regain access to their account. 
 If you forget to forward the user’s email, you might miss out on important communication from your customers.&nbsp; 
 If you don’t promptly deprovision the user’s accounts from third-party applications, you might be paying more in license costs than you need. 
 
<p>Luckily, it’s not all up to you to remember every step. Here’s how you can handle employee offboarding in YeshID.</p>
 Easier employee offboarding in YeshID 
<p>To offboard someone in YeshID, select that person from your Organization, and in the side car that opens, click ‘Offboard.’ From here, you can choose:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What action you wish to perform (suspending vs deleting) 
 Who, if anyone, to assign access to the employee’s Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc. data 
 Who, if anyone, should receive new email sent to the old address 
 When you would like the process initiated 
 
<p>As long as you are <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/3-reasons-to-ditch-the-access-management-spreadsheet-for-yeshid-access-grid/">managing application access</a> in YeshID, we will also create subtasks for applications which need to be deprovisioned. This is a big differentiator from how you can manage this process in the Google Workspace console. Offboarding directly in the console only turns off “sign in with Google” accounts for the user. But what about accounts that use a work email and password? YeshID helps you track all application access to make sure the user is offboarded from any company applications they had access to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s dive into each option.&nbsp;</p>
 Offboarding with the intention to suspend 
<p>This is a good option if you want to remove access for a user but don’t want to completely delete them. For example, maybe the user was privy to critical business data that you don’t want to risk losing, or maybe it’s a seasonal contractor that you plan to reinstate later in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when you suspend a user in YeshID:</p>
 
 The user’s data will be kept, but they won’t receive emails, calendar invitations, or files as long as they’re suspended (note: this does require you to maintain a Google Workspace license for the user).&nbsp; 
 Once you specify that the user is suspended, you will be prompted to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to.&nbsp; 
 Emails are sent to the application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at specified time. 
 You can “unsuspend” a user at any time, as long as they’re not deleted. 
 
<p></p>
 Offboarding with the intention to delete 
<p>This is a good option if you know that you want to remove the user entirely. When you delete a user, YeshID will:</p>
 
 Reset the Google Workspace password, which will revoke any application-specific passwords tied to the user’s account 
 Log the user out of every Google session across all of their devices by invalidating their session cookies 
 Delete the user’s account recovery email and phone numbers 
 Revoke all <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">OAuth grants associated with the user’s account</a> 
 Prompt you to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to 
 Send emails to application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at the specified time. 
 
<p>When you delete a user, YeshID will also create a list of tasks that an admin must manually complete. While the above steps will happen automatically, these steps require confirmation from the admin to continue:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Confirm that they have transferred all email from the account they wish to save, by using the Google Data Migration Service. 
 Initiate any data transfers that were configured in the YeshID offboarding dialog (Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc.). 
 Delete the account in Google Workspace. 
 Set the old email address as an alias on another account so you can continue receiving new email for the old account.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the last step here, creating an alias, can’t be done until you delete the user. Then you have to remember to come back to create the alias. It’s an easy step to forget — thankfully you have that task reminder in YeshID. 😉</p>
 Easier offboarding with technology 
<p>The task of offboarding a user contains many distinct steps, each of which can lead to issues if forgotten. Why take the risk? YeshID uses ready-made procedures that ensure you follow offboarding best practices and keep your environment safe and running smoothly. <a href="https://yeshid.com/">See how easy it can be</a>.</p>

<p>A context note from Mary Camacho: </p><p>As the executive director of an organization exploring new models of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">human synergy and coordination</a>, I often think about how we can enable more inclusive collaboration globally.</p><p>So it was thrilling to have the chance to speak with Catherine Stihler, whose decades of experience in geopolitical relations has given her deep wisdom.</p><p>Our wide-ranging conversation covered many aspects of policy, technology, and governance. Fundamentally, it centered on a key question — how do we bridge the many divides that hinder human cooperation and collective problem-solving?&nbsp;</p><p>There were no simple answers, but identifying the barriers provided inspiration to keep striving for coherence across cultures. By exploring the intersections of technology, regulation, and how groups communicate, we identified commonalities underlying collective problem-solving. What follows is a summary of key noticings from the conversation.&nbsp;</p> Cultural Perspectives Complicate Collaboration <p>Successful <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blending-physical-digital-collaboration/">collaboration</a> requires navigating varied mindsets and worldviews — a complex challenge. As Stihler noted, “How do you culturally navigate spaces and places?”</p><p>Her multinational career has shown that coherence demands understanding perspectives. Within the EU parliament alone, discussion happens in over 20 languages, demonstrating the diversity of communication styles. Even basic terms can mean different things across cultures.</p><p>Friction naturally occurs when bringing together people with different assumptions and motivations. As Stihler experienced, this tension is integral, if sometimes uncomfortable.</p><p>During negotiations, she focused on the ultimate policy aims that transcended cultural barriers. She focused on finding common purpose-centered compromises. Still, bridging divides can be challenging, given subjective identities and priorities. We must accept messiness in sharing space.</p><p>Keeping communication open despite discomfort aids progress. And the groups who govern play a key role in establishing incentives towards mutual understanding.</p> Inclusive Governance Requires Uncomfortable Coherence <p>Governance and policy processes necessitate navigating conflicting interests to reach collaborative decisions. As noted, this process contains inherent “tension” and “discomfort.” When representing constituencies with varying needs and values, perfect solutions fail.</p><p>Progress means reconciling disagreements.&nbsp;</p><p>Stihler recounted challenging EU regulations where health priorities competed with economic ones. Compromising entailed painful sacrifices on multiple sides. However, with shared underlying aims, adversaries transformed into collaborators united by a common purpose</p><p>While universal access to collaboration and information is ideal, Stihler noted that some limitations can spur healthy competition, stating:</p><blockquote>“Not all barriers are bad. Some can encourage innovations.”</blockquote><p>For example, within a single economic market, preventing total domination by one company allows space for newcomers and alternate models like co-ops. Rules ensure stability while still providing openings for diverse contributors.</p> Overcoming Persistent Digital Divides <p>Despite the connectivity promised by digital tools, barriers still limit access and divide users. As Stihler explained, restrictions like “geo-blocking” prevent sharing media across country borders, hindering collaboration. While the EU’s “Digital Single Market” intended seamlessness, gaps remain, frustrating users across member states and other countries.</p><p>For non-EU countries, these false boundaries are especially visible. From a UK or US perspective, the borders seem technical and arbitrary, given the ability to instantly share data globally. However, preventing access contradicts the spirit of open digital space. We must keep pioneering tools giving users agency and accessibility.</p><p>While some limitations aim to encourage market competition, others serve little purpose beyond denying availability. More and more people cross borders because families, friends, and now businesses are moving. And the digital tools they use also evolve alongside this change. This is a sweet spot for Holochain because the architecture requires the consent of the users and apps built with it — rather than centralized server hosting to connect groups together.</p> Bridging Divides Through Understanding <p>Technology alone cannot solve barriers to cooperation stemming from varied cultural perspectives and incentives. However, frameworks that help build bridges and foster mutual understanding can assist with reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the EU demonstrates, keeping communication open across cultural divides provides critical conduits for compromise, even if tension persists. Institutions play a vital role in sustaining conduits for exchange.</p><p>While universal inclusion remains an ideal, moderate limitations sustaining diversity also prove essential for progress by preventing stagnant monopolies and stimulating competition. With open, equitable rules of engagement, such friction engenders innovation rather than isolation.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work evolve, integrating the magic of embodied teamwork with virtual capabilities remains imperative to human progress. For it is amidst the messiness of the human experience that the future unfolds.</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, feel free to share it or drop a comment and share your thoughts. We want to hear from you!</p>

<p>High-volume card personalization and issuance requires technology, precision, and efficiency to bring cards to life. In parallel with many principles of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">The Fourth Industrial Revolution</a> (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), including the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Big Data and Analytics, digital machine intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">SAP Supply Chain Management / Industry 4.0 Solutions from SAP / “What is Industry 4.0</a>?”</p>
<p>The Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution (PAS) is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. With each personalization trend, digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Two predominant trends continue to evolve in the card personalization, issuance, and manufacturing industries:</p>
 
 Diversification of Products and Services 
 
<p>Card personalization bureaus and regional issuance centers are expanding their offerings to cater to a broader range of market segments. They’re providing enhanced customization options on various substrates and leveraging advanced technology to offer precise control over cardholder experiences. This diversification encompasses mainstream, loyalty, VIP, accessibility, eco, sustainability, finance, digital, and identity markets. Additionally, there’s a growing focus on the acceleration of flat card migration and globalization, resulting in a complex landscape with multiple technology choices tailored to regional and market-specific demands.</p>
 
 Cost Reduction and Continuous Improvement 
 
<p>Efficiency and cost reduction have become paramount in the card manufacturing industry. Card personalization centers are investing in efficiency projects, training, data analytics, and continuous improvement initiatives. They’re also collaborating with suppliers and technology vendors to optimize operations and reduce expenses. This cost-conscious approach is essential to staying competitive in a dynamic market landscape.</p>
<p>Drivers of Personalization Trends</p>
<p>The increasing demand for cards, driven by factors such as rising debt, population growth, e-commerce, cashless transactions, and loyalty programs, has contributed to the industry’s growth. However, the overall growth rate of card volumes has tapered a bit in recent years as consumers selectively use both physical and digital credentials, leading to focused efforts around value-added services, cost-reduction strategies, and continuous improvement programs in card issuance.</p>
<p>Here are the drivers of these trends:</p>
 
 Value-added offerings – To stay competitive, personalization centers are offering a wider range of services and materials, addressing the changing market dynamics. This has resulted in complex manufacturing processes that require careful, continuous management across multiple site locations and machine types. 
 Cost reduction – Rising material and labor costs have prompted card personalization centers to focus on reducing operational expenses. They’re adopting lean and Six Sigma methodologies to enhance efficiency and reduce waste. Smart manufacturing includes processes and sometimes staff to monitor and execute cost improvement initiatives. 
 Complexities in card personalization – Personalization centers deal with various complexities, including card types, technology variations, equipment manufacturers, and numerous processes. These complexities pose challenges, but also drive the need for effective data-driven solutions. 
 Role of digital intelligence – Digital intelligence, powered by real-time analytics, plays a crucial role in identifying productivity trends, bottlenecks, quality issues, and line balancing in personalization centers. Traditional methods are inadequate for managing the intricacies of smart production environments. Advanced statistical methods and machine learning tools are employed to proactively address issues and optimize processes. 
 Importance of process management – Methodic and efficient process management is essential to minimize waste and achieve desired outcomes. Data insight, intelligence, and analytics function as measurement tools to identify defects, reduce motion waste, optimize quality checks, and improve overall efficiency. Using these tools across the enterprise allows a deeper understanding of where operational anomalies lie, from vault to warehouse, production, shipping, and beyond. 
 Production analytics – A pivotal link to next-generation card issuance and personalization is the need for real-time, digital machine analytics and trend analysis. OEE and operational efficiency is at the forefront of card manufacturing consideration and the days of “clipboard monitoring” are long gone. Platforms built on delivering this value proposition require customizable, real-time aggregated architectures. 
 Hybrid issuance – The existence of physical and digital credentials in the same ecosystem, as consumers demand flexibility in payment methods for different use cases. As this continues to trend, there’s an increasing need for optimization in smart card manufacturing. An imbalance on either side of this equation will potentially shift use-case favorability to the other. Thus, failing to recognize the importance and implementation of efficient card issuance may ultimately shift demand away from physical cards, giving way to its digital counterpart. 
 
<p>Future of Data Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and AI are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis.

<p>IBM® recently announced that it has worked with its business partner, Beijing Shuto Technology Co., Ltd. (hereafter as Shuto Technology) to help a joint venture Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in China to obtain information in an accurate and cost-effective way for on-site technicians. This makes the client’s equipment repair work more efficient and improves the reliability of its equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in 2006, Shuto Technology is a leading asset management solution provider in China that focuses on helping industry-leading enterprises build asset operation and management platforms, and empower their core competitiveness through digitalization. With the professional ability and rich accumulation in the field of asset management, Shuto provides full-stack services of asset management (EAM) for hundreds of industry leading enterprises. Shuto also combines IBM Maximo® best practices and international standards (e.g. ISO55000), various business, process and data standards, management strategies and KPI systems that cover the asset lifecycle to form the best practices of asset management (EAM) in various industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s automotive industry—with its rapid growth and increased market competition—improving equipment stability, reducing maintenance costs and improving production quality have become top priorities. However, for large automotive enterprises, the traditional equipment management and maintenance methods are faced with many challenges:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Technical difficulties in maintenance: With the continuous transformation of automotive technology and process, maintenance technology is also constantly upgrading. Maintenance workers need to consume a lot of energy to check up the equipment data to understand and learn new skills, resulting in not only low maintenance efficiency, but also leading to a decline in employee satisfaction and loyalty.&nbsp; 
 



 
 High cost of equipment maintenance: Due to the many auto parts, maintenance personnel need to master a more comprehensive failure analysis and diagnosis capabilities, resulting in a lot of investment in manpower, material and financial resources. This will make it harder to transfer existing skillsets in talents enablement.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Unstable maintenance quality: The traditional maintenance approach relies on personal experience and the capabilities of maintenance workers. It is difficult to investigate the root cause due to the lack of professional technical guidance and unstable quality of maintenance that leads to frequent failures. The stability and lifecycle of the equipment is also decreasing, which is prone to production quality problems such as low yield rate.&nbsp; 
 



<p>To cope with these challenges, a major joint-venture automotive enterprise in China needs a holistic approach to achieve rapid access to equipment knowledge, intelligent diagnosis of faults, and expert online guidance, to make the maintenance process standardized, intelligent and transparent. Likewise, the venture looks to reduce costs and increase efficiency while enhancing user satisfaction and improving the comprehensive benefits of enterprise asset management.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Based on the AI-powered capabilities of IBM Maximo Application Suite (MAS), Shuto Technology joins hands with IBM Client Success Team and IBM China Development Lab to provide intelligent knowledge mapping, AI intelligent maintenance diagnosis, and AR remote maintenance assistance for the maintenance work of this automobile enterprise, making it an AI-powered EAM assistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of these features empowers maintenance personnel with all-around support and guidance, enabling them to quickly and accurately locate problems and provide solutions, as well as realize instant assistance from remote experts through AR-augmented reality technology, which improves maintenance personnel’s digital one-man capabilities, shortens mean time to repair (MTTR) by an average of 25% and improves maintenance efficiency while dramatically reducing the cost of enterprise equipment operation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Specifically, IBM Maximo Application Suite’s Intelligent Maintenance Assistant (Maximo Assist) can provide enterprises with the following capabilities:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Intelligent Maintenance Knowledge Graphs: Intelligent Maintenance Knowledge Graph function utilizes AI technology through the import of equipment documentation, and uses knowledge extraction capabilities to establish a full-text search knowledge graph, provide a fast and accurate knowledge base, help on-site personnel give independent solution to technical problems, and provide rapid access to equipment and maintenance information.&nbsp; 
 



 
 AI intelligent maintenance diagnosis: AI intelligent maintenance and diagnosis uses AI technology and intelligent diagnostic models to guide technicians in diagnosing faults in the form of questions and answers. Likewise, it provides the percentage of fault possibility through AI diagnostic model analysis and formulates a fast and accurate maintenance plan. At the same time, the diagnostic process bolsters the accuracy of model analysis with the help of the powerful self-learning ability of AI, to continually improve through the use and feedback.&nbsp; 
 



 
 AR remote maintenance assistance: AR remote maintenance assistance uses AR augmented reality technology to realize real-time visual sharing and interaction between remote equipment experts and field personnel, providing visual maintenance guidance and technical support, and at the same time builds a platform for enterprise knowledge inheritance through the expert database and passes through the “last mile” of experts to the production site.&nbsp; 
 



 Break through the bottleneck of maintenance efficiency and empower the existing knowledge system&nbsp; 







<p>Through the deployment of IBM Maximo Application Suite Intelligent Maintenance Assistant (Maximo Assist), the automobile enterprise has gained the following benefits:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Improve the efficiency of information acquisition: Through the implementation of the IBM Maximo Application Suite, the maintenance management level of this large automobile enterprise has been successfully optimized. This has changed the traditional on-site maintenance approach where personnel used to run to the data room to flip through the information; adopting the intelligent positioning of maintenance data through on-site scope helps promote transparency, standardize the maintenance management, and automate the maintenance method. Thistop-down approach to maintenance data and document standardization provides valuable intangible assets that lay solid foundation to corporate knowledge and learning and development (L&amp;D)  



 Shorten repair time: Through the construction of fault diagnosis model, IBM Maximo Application Suite platform can accurately track down the problems, find out the root cause and provide solutions in a problem response mode called PDCA. In addition, Maximo Assist can accurately jump to the function of the document corresponding to the fault and the repair solution, and allows users to provide feedback and ratings on the repair solution. Likewise, it can provide best practice repair methods based on historical data and sort the matching degree. In addition to improving maintenance efficiency and reducing the mean time to repair (MTTR), it also provides maintenance personnel with more convenient and accurate solutions for difficult troubleshooting. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Enhance and empower existing IT systems: IBM Maximo Application Suite can be seamlessly integrated with the client’s existing work order system, asset management system and human resource management (expert database) and other systems to automatically generate maintenance knowledge graphs. At the same time, through instant training of AI models, maintenance knowledge is combined with work order and asset business to ensure that equipment maintenance information can be accurately, timely and completely reflected in the standard work of the enterprise’s own asset management platform, thus building a comprehensive maintenance knowledge base. This integrated solution ensures the data integration and information sharing within the company, enhancing inter-system data connectivity to improve the efficiency and quality of maintenance work.&nbsp; 



 Establish a “Four-Pool” knowledge system: Given the inefficient retention of skills and experience, the client and Shuto Technology created an enablement system to support maintenance skills enhancement and personnel training, also known as the “4 knowledge pools:”&nbsp;
 
 An equipment knowledge pool for knowledge accumulation and query;&nbsp; 



 An equipment course pool of learning resources for eliminating weak points in skills;&nbsp; 



 A talent pool able to quantitatively evaluate the knowledge and skill mastery of personnel with gamification features;&nbsp; 



 An expert pool incorporating experts in all relevant areas to support the maintenance guidance of field operators.&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>Through the creation of the “four pools,” around the “knowledge accumulation–knowledge sharing–skills evaluation–skills inheritance” training model, the client manages to improve equipment management and employee competence, providing a merit-based motivation mechanism of performance bonuses, promotion and recognition, with the “four pools” at the core.&nbsp;</p>



 IBM works with business partner to build an ecosystem of intelligent and efficient equipment management&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>After adopting IBM Maximo Assist, the client’s equipment maintenance efficiency improvement has begun to bear fruit, shortening average repair time from 13 minutes to 9 minutes. For next steps, Shuto Technology and IBM will continuously deepen and expand the application of the intelligent maintenance assistant, integrate with more information systems (e.g. production systems, IoT platforms etc.) of the client to optimize data sharing and business synergy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the two companies will help the client expand its use of Maximo Assist, build a unified equipment knowledge sharing and management platform, create an expert pool at the group level, and build a cross-region and cross-factory remote maintenance guidance and service center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Zhu Shufeng, General Manager of Shuto Technology said, “Intelligent digital transformation is the future of enterprises, and IBM Maximo is an ideal solution for achieving that goal. The successful implementation of this project not only reflects the leading position of Shuto Technology in the field of enterprise asset management, but also highlights our deep understanding and practice of combining innovation with equipment maintenance. Shuto Technology will maintain a close partnership with IBM, accelerate our R&amp;D efforts and deployment, and continuously innovate to build a more intelligent and efficient equipment management ecosystem that provides our clients with sustainable growth and value add.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, the travel sector has undergone remarkable changes, largely due to technological advancements and evolving consumer preferences. A noteworthy trend is the growing importance of seamless travel, accompanied by the use of Digital Travel Credentials (DTCs), which are a digital representation of a traveler’s passport data. This transformation has and will continue to have an impact on the travel experience and the industry at large.</p>
<p>Seamless Travel: A New Definition of the Traveler Journey</p>
<p>Seamless travel refers to a comprehensive and effortless travel experience achieved through the integration of various stages of travel using technology. We have seen a rapid recovery in travel almost back to pre-pandemic levels, creating a pressing need to provide a seamless, smooth, and digital travel experience. Travelers demand simpler, faster, and more secure solutions, expecting to travel at the click of a few buttons, minimizing wait times and touchpoints.</p>
<p>Transforming the pre-boarding check-in processes and border experiences with innovative identity verification solutions can achieve significant time savings for the traveler and reduced personnel needs for travel service providers. Higher traveler volumes continue to cause congestion, especially in tight spaces like airport terminals, cruise terminals, and train stations. Expanding these areas is challenging due to the need for significant capital project expenses and lengthy approval processes.</p>
<p>Benefits of the DTC Approach</p>
<p>The use of DTCs provides several advantages to both travel companies and consumers. For companies, it entails the ability to gather additional customer data (where permitted by privacy legislation), for more targeted and improved services. Consumers benefit from a more personalized experience and efficiency by registering once with a favorite carrier and reusing registration across multiple journeys.</p>
<p>Challenges and Future Prospects</p>
<p>While seamless travel via the DTC model holds immense promise, it presents challenges, too. Addressing data security and privacy concerns is vital to ensure that the personal information collected during booking and travel remains safeguarded. The DTC is tightly linked to the international standards for ePassports. ICAO, as a consensus-based organization, must constantly balance the push for innovation with the need to retain backward-compatibility with existing ePassport standards.</p>
<p>As technology evolves and consumer preferences transform, travel providers will need to adapt and provide seamless, convenient, and personalized experiences that cater to the modern traveler.</p>
<p>Sustainability and Digital Credentials</p>
<p>As environmental concerns take center stage, seamless travel and DTCs contribute to sustainability goals. Digital boarding passes and check-ins reduce paper usage, for example.</p>
<p>In a rapidly evolving travel industry where travelers demand simpler, faster, and more secure solutions, Entrust has taken the lead in transforming pre-boarding check-in processes and seamless travel experiences. Leveraging its innovative identity verification platform, Entrust has real-world experience deriving DTCs.</p>

<p>Over the years, the ways in which we get from A to B have changed based on how the mobility industry has developed as well as major world events impacting travel choices and decisions. However, finding the fastest and easiest way to get to our final destinations still remains the major priority. But not only do we want fast and easy travel but also convenience paired with cost savings, and we want to be able to know all our options.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">Shared mobility</a> such as car sharing and micromobility will continue to see growth <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/carsharing-market">over the next 10 years</a> due to increasing environmental regulations, there are plenty of choices for consumers, but how can they find the best based on their immediate needs?</p>



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop traveling shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A concept focusing on a “bundled service model,” consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment such as personal vehicles.</p>



<p>With the global Mobility as a Service market projected to <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mobility-as-a-service-maas-market-102066">grow from $236.42 billion in 2022 to $774.93 billion by 2029</a>, companies need to bear in mind where MaaS is headed and how they can become part of this growing movement.</p>



 What is Mobility as a Service (MaaS)? 



<p>Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging trend that is transforming the way we use and access transportation. The overarching idea of MaaS is that it is an integration of various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive and on-demand mobility service. Basically, everything at the touch of a button. This in effect allows users to access all types of transportation (walking, car sharing, public transportation, micromobility, etc.) in one application with a single payment channel. Say goodbye to the multiple ticket purchasing stress.</p>



<p>Instead, services are <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">becoming consolidated</a> by having one application for all their travel needs.</p>



 Why is MaaS important? 



<p>The importance of MaaS lies in the concept itself. By reducing the inconveniences associated with accessing individual transportation services, MaaS provides a one travel service from planning to booking to paying, creating a more fluid and integrated experience of transportation. This results in less congestion, fewer emissions and lower operating costs all while providing a more accessible and inclusive journey for those individuals with limited mobility. Plus, MaaS allows for the integration of smart city data to create efficient and cost-effective traffic management systems. In the long run, MaaS holds great promise for improving accessibility, affordability, sustainability and efficiency in our transportation networks.</p>



<p>Additionally, every person has their own unique needs based on their job, interests, financial profile, physical capabilities, behaviors, relationships, personal preferences and more. Putting these all together creates a specific identity that can be tailored to when it comes to transportation and exactly what MaaS will provide since alternative transport options will be available in a one-stop shop.</p>



<p>In short, MaaS could be the final puzzle piece needed to make urban life smoother, faster and cheaper for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Mobility as a Service examples? 



<p>Mobility as a Service can sometimes be confusing when wondering which apps and operators fall under which category. Some MaaS providers, such as ride hailing apps (Uber) and peer-to-peer rental services (GoGet &amp; FlexiCar) are currently good examples of MaaS that focus on one or two areas. However, with the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/mobility-as-a-service-market">expected CAGR around 7.43% over the next five years</a> and Asia-Pacific the fastest growing market, major players in the MaaS industry include Enterprise, Hertz and Moovit.</p>



<p>However, the future of MaaS looks toward apps that can provide all services in one place such as Whim based in Helsinki, but also available in the UK, Belgium, Austria, Japan, etc. Whim combines over 2,500+ taxis, car rentals and public transport options, helping users plan and book better journeys through smartphone technology. This can also be seen from the business side as well. UK-based company Mobilleo is a Mobility as a Service app specifically for businesses. Whether a self-employed business or a fleet manager, Mobilleo combines thousands of travel providers into one app to help businesses find, book and pay for their journey in one solution.</p>



 



 

 



 Digital identity: the building block of MaaS. 



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator when it comes to data collection and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. A strong <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/mix-maas-mobility-service-final.pdf">framework for data sharing</a> and identity verification therefore needs to be put in place in order for MaaS ro be successful. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The missing link: security through identification. 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having digital identity verification is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing what the mobility providers can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license or is the appropriate age to use their application. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">qualified electronic signature</a> or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, fast, seamless and automated identity verification is all that is needed.</p>



<p>Plus, as more and more services become digitalized, companies will offer the opportunity for users to store their digital identities in a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> so verification can become even more simplified and efficient while traveling. Since MaaS is housed all in one application, all needed documents, tickets, etc. will be in one place while on-the-go. Travel will be like it never has before. &nbsp;</p>



 







 Convenience is the goal. 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">assistance from digital identity verification</a>.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers automated solutions which require only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities so they can carry on with their journey.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">Fueling the demand of convenient mobility</a></p>



 A partnership leading us into tomorrow. 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consuIn today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a digital identity solution partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 In 2023, new entrants to the financial system reached a monumental milestone, for all the wrong reasons. 



 



<p>Last year, for the first time ever, crypto firms and fintechs received more fines than traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2a8c1e4-30f2-49c7-939b-73e0d1a22033">data analysed by the Financial Times</a>, crypto and digital payment companies paid an eye-watering $5.8 billion in fines due to a multitude of reasons, including non-compliance in anti-money laundering checks and failing to uphold sanctions and other financial crime issues.</p>



 Findings and failings. 



<p>In total, crypto firms recorded 11 separate fines in 2023 compared to an annual average of just two over the last five years. Meanwhile, payments firms recorded 27 fines, which was a huge increase on their annual average of five per year from 2018 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most fines levied against payments groups were to fintech groups that were less than 20 years old.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is a surprising shift in the global payments space, and just goes to show that such punishments can be levied out to even the most digital-savvy sectors.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Gone are the days where bad behavior will be tolerated by newcomers to the financial industry. With major players like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/">Blackrock recently launching its bitcoin ETF</a>, which boasts huge compliance operations as well as general risk aversion, the industry is likely, and will need to, grow up quickly in 2024 and beyond,” added Rayissa.</p>



<p>The main contributor to the astronomical amount of 5.8 billion in fines was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/binance-settlement-crypto-exchange">$4.3 billion penalty</a> levied against crypto exchange Binance, which was set “purposefully high.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reasons for the mammoth fine were attributed to violations of:&nbsp;</p>



  The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)<br>  Failure to register as a money transmitting business<br>  Violations to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).&nbsp;  



<p>“Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen was even clearer in her <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">damnation of the crypto platform</a>, stating how Binance’s “wilful” failures to adhere to AML and sanctions compliance allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, this was not the only wake-up call that should have set off alarm bells in the crypto community in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The much-publicized decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent further shockwaves through the industry. Despite such turbulence, there were also significant steps taken to stabilize crypto in 2023, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Market in Crypto Assets regulatory framework (MiCA)</a>, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds regulation (TFR)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime</a>, which neared ever closer to completion. As the regulations are finally likely to be enforced in 2024, this could not happen at a more crucial time.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">Discover which trends are likely to affect the crypto (and gambling and financial services) industry in 2024.</a>  



<blockquote><p>2024 may very well prove to be a watershed year for the crypto industry. It’s likely that the upcoming crypto regulations will have a positive impact and act as a stabilizing force, while the fines should serve as a deterrent and remind crypto firms that AML laws and regulations apply to them too.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>“However, there’s also a very real chance that firms, especially new entrants to the crypto and fintech market that are in a rush to establish themselves and onboard as many customers as possible, may bypass certain steps in customer controls. This is not advisable. KYC processes, and rigorous identity checks are in place for a reason – to protect the business and the customer.”</p>



 Light at the end of the tunnel? 



<p>Besides the aforementioned regulatory frameworks due to be enforced later this year, 2024 has already started with some reassuring developments regarding crypto regulation. Chief among these was guidance issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which extended its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-guidance-crypto-asset-service-providers">guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing</a> to crypto asset service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Council and European Parliament also recently announced that it had reached a provisional agreement on the decision to create the brand-new <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/13/anti-money-laundering-council-and-parliament-agree-to-create-new-authority/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA)</a> – a European authority with the expressed purpose of countering money laundering and financing of terrorism. Technical negotiations are expected to be ongoing for months, with a tentative aim of formally adopting final agreement by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals put forward include:&nbsp;</p>



  Requirements for financial institutions to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">enhanced due diligence</a> on wealthy individuals, or on transactions involving high amounts.<br>  Enhanced due diligence for cross-border crypto transactions.&nbsp;  



<p>While obliged entities, including financial institutions, banks, real estate agencies, asset management services, casinos, and merchants traditionally enforce AML requirements like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, the new rules now cover most of the crypto ecosystem. All crypto-asset service providers will now be required to conduct due diligence on customers, including verifying personal KYC data, with such data required to accompany transfers under the Travel Rule when transactions exceed €1000 or more.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto and fintech. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also an important requirement to comply with AML, MiCA and other crypto-related regulation. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that KYC and Know Your Business is at the nexus of this world and people are catching up to this reality – you have to know who is out there – as people go on or off chain or in and out of the traditional banking world,” warned Rayissa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintech</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity verification methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

			 Year of Tokeny: 2023’s Milestones &amp; 2024’s Tokenization Predictions 
 
<p>I hope you kicked off the new year with great energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, our people are what make us outstanding. As a remote-first team, we prioritize coming together each year for retreats to forge physical connections, align our visions, and simply share great moments.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, our journey led us to the picturesque Puigcerdà in Spain. Amidst breathtaking mountain hikes, indulgent spa experiences, and delightful culinary adventures, we also found time for some highly efficient meetings. It was truly amazing, and we had the pleasure of meeting one of our first members, Nida, who finally joined us in person after six years of dedicated work at Tokeny from Turkey.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, we are thrilled to share the highlights that have propelled us to the forefront of tokenization.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>🚀 Tokeny’s Triumphs:</p>
<p>2023 marked Tokeny’s 6th year, a milestone that brought numerous celebrations, including:</p>
 
 45 new financial institutions as customers and partners

 And, two of our team members expanded their family by welcoming a newborn 🍼.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>🌍 Eventful Year:</p>
<p>We gained global presence by attending 52 events worldwide, and speaking at 38. Additionally, we participated in 16 webinars, and featured in 2 podcasts.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>We selected some of the most interesting digital content for you:</p>

<p>🌐 Growing Network of Issuers, Asset Managers and Servicers:</p>
 
 LinkedIn Reach: We saw a 48% growth in our follower base, reaching over 8k followers on LinkedIn. 
 Newsletter Expansion: We welcomed 2.4k new subscribers, our newsletter community now stands at 9.9k, including influential institutional subscribers from top asset managers like JP Morgan, State Street, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs. 
 
<p>🔷 ERC-3643 Standardization Contribution:</p>
 
 Association Launch: We successfully launched the ERC3643 Association with 45 prominent actively participating members, including top-tier financial institutions, global law firms, and blockchain leaders like SS&amp;C, Invesco, CMS, Apex Group, and Polygon. 
 EIP Recognition: Achieving final status in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), the ERC-3643 was officially recognized as the de facto token standard for compliant tokenization. 
 
<p>Predictions for 2024</p>
<p>The upcoming year promises to be full of tokenization breakthroughs. Our predictions are:</p>
 
 5 out of the top 10 asset managers will tokenize assets:&nbsp;Tokenized products will be introduced by half of the top 10 asset managers. 
 Standardization with ERC-3643:&nbsp;The entire industry will start to build valuable use cases and form a dynamic ecosystem with a validated token standard ERC-3643 instead of reinventing the wheel. 
 Regulated entities will start tokenizing cash: A few large financial institutions will issue stablecoins, e-money or deposit tokens. 
 US regulation will open up:&nbsp;The US market is set to open up, compelling others to hasten their initiatives. 
 Institutions go public blockchain:&nbsp;It opens the door for interoperability with DeFi, driving demands from investors by adding utility to their assets and innovation. 
 
<p>As we kick-off 2024, we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities in the tokenization landscape. Your support has been pivotal, and together, we are set for an even more dynamic year ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a crucial part of Tokeny’s journey!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has many upsides, but a significant downside is its role in creating <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fakes</a> and other identity theft fraud mechanisms. The technology is increasingly accessible and affordable, manipulatable media is freely available across the internet, and detecting real from fake is growing more difficult by the day.</p>



<p>A ‘deep fake’ is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">video</a>, image, or audio of a real or fictitious person’s likeness or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165448073/voice-clones-ai-scams-ftc">voice</a> that was substantially modified or generated using <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-machine-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">generative AI</a>. The result is convincing content that looks and sounds like it comes from a specific person. In the case of the popular <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated">grandparent scam</a>, that ‘specific person’ is the victim’s grandchild whose voice and image have been manipulated to convey a fearful message, while in the growing number of corporate or <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena">political deep fakes</a>, the subject could be a CEO, political opponent or even a president.</p>



<p>Deep fakes are used to defraud money and spread disinformation. They threaten privacy, reputation, finances, and peace, potentially on a global scale.</p>



<p>The US government is moving to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">regulate</a> deep fakes, and some commercial operations have introduced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fake detection technology</a>, so there are solutions on the horizon. But a solution we see enormous potential in is <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity technology</a>, grounded in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>In a nutshell:</p>



 
 Web3 and DI technologies would deliver some secure content “locks” that could be quickly checked and verified as irrefutable proof of authenticity. 



 Blockchain would make it incredibly difficult for malicious actors to manipulate or tamper with digital content since every change would be permanently recorded and verifiable. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are a few ways to leverage this technology:</p>



 
 A person would possess an official <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) (which includes a public key) on a public blockchain. Any piece of content that person creates would be cryptographically hashed and signed with a digital signature created by the private key associated with their public key, proving its authenticity, or 



 A person would hold verified credentials for their digital persona in a digital wallet, which again would prove the authenticity of their created content. In the digital wallet, they would also store other verified real-world credentials for their digital persona, such as driver license, passport, proof of residency and so on, or 



 A person could store in their digital wallet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFT ) backed by blockchains to prove ownership of digital assets including video and voice recordings.&nbsp; If a recording is protected by an NFT owned by a reliable person or organization then the recording can be trusted and is not subject to fraud. 
 



<p>With all these solutions, anyone watching a video or listening to or reading a piece of content could be assured of the content’s author and that the content has not been modified. This provides protection against deep fakes, including those created using AI.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decentralized-signature-countering-deepfakes-julien-maldonato/">great article</a> from Deloitte summarizes the 6 ways Web3 and DI would act as a safeguard against deep fakes and other generative AI scam mechanisms:</p>







<p>1. Provenance tracking: Cryptography and distributed ledger technology makes it almost impossible to conceal manipulated origins of content.</p>







<p>2. Self-sovereign identity: DI gives the user complete control over their identity, including their content, shutting out the potential criminal element.</p>







<p>3. Tamper-proof meta data: Embedding cryptographically verified metadata such as timestamps, location, and device information, readily distinguishes authentic content from manipulated versions.</p>







<p>4. Authenticity certificates: Digital certificates attached to validated original media act as irrefutable proof of authenticity.</p>







<p>5. Algorithmic detection: Blockchain-based platforms can use deepfake detection software that algorithmically flags suspected fakes and deters bad actors.</p>







<p>6. Incentives alignment: Leveraging tokenized incentives and reputation staking, common in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> models, may discourage the production and dissemination of manipulated content.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more …</p>



<p>Interestingly, on the flip side of AI is its potential to combat the scams it actually helped create by shoring up Web3 and DI systems. AI can help secure identities and monitor social networks for suspicious activity or profiles, weeding out forgeries and inauthentic content.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/28/how-ai-and-web3-id-tech-can-defeat-deepfake-frauds/?sh=158ec8394814">Forbes</a> writer describes this “quid pro quo” arrangement between Web3/DI and AI this way: “Blockchain-verified profiles can offer a type of ‘proof of humanity,’ a place to store digital assets and identifiers, and a single point of access into the Web3 ecosystem—all while keeping the user’s privacy under their control. Meanwhile, AI can work to monitor and secure these profiles, keeping people from becoming the next victims of AI-wielding criminals.”</p>



<p>We can act right now</p>



<p>This is an interesting and rapidly evolving topic. For now, the key takeaway is that AI-driven fraud will likely remain a threat for some time, but leveraging Web3 and DI technology grounded in blockchain and even pairing it with AI technology presents a viable solution that’s available right now. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Explore the solutions we offer in Sudo Platform</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The term “eco” has morphed into a disparate moniker liberally applied across many industries. Looking no further than your wallet, one can quickly find parallel themes on your credit cards indicating recyclability, material content, sustainability, and maybe even eco-programs tied to your bank or issuer. Consumers demand these as part of doing business with them, but what exactly does an eco-card mean? Why is it important and what is the environmental significance that plastic cards play in the larger sustainability efforts we continually see across products and markets?</p>
<p>Card Composition and Global Card Circulation</p>
<p>Let us first start with a few basic assumptions around content and material properties. Predominantly, credit and debit cards cards are manufactured from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and/or other films, overlays, and plastic derivatives. We will explore a few of these further in a moment. It is important to recognize the anatomy of a card encompasses many of the following: a core substrate with a metal antenna, EMV chip, hologram, transparent coatings, films, varnish, inks, a magnetic strip, metallic foils, and other custom materials. All of these require careful design consideration per use case, as banks plan for durability and lifecycle. Like many consumables, the primary ecological concern lies within the highest material content per unit, or in this case, PVC. There are many debates about first-use PVC across global industries and its impact on ecosystems, but most alarming is the <a href="https://www.savemoneycutcarbon.com/learn-save/how-long-does-it-take-for-plastic-to-biodegrade/">400+ years required for plastics to decompose</a>.</p>
<p>The number of cards in circulation globally is staggering: approximately <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1080756/number-payment-cards-in-circulation-worldwide/">25.85 billion credit, debit, and pre-paid cards in 2022</a>, with a forecast to grow to 28.44 billion by 2027. Comparatively, payment cards are not nearly as big of an issue as other products; however, if you were to place the number of cards in circulation end-to-end lengthwise, they would encircle the globe 55 times at the equator. That is equivalent to 5.8 trips from earth to the moon and back or 1.4 million miles of plastic cards. The sheer magnitude is easy to quantify but the impacts of non-sustainable materials are a bit more difficult to realize or even see in our daily lives. Consider the following: <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/">The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> (GPGP), located between Hawaii and California, is the largest of five offshore plastic accumulation zones in the world’s oceans. It covers an estimated surface area of 617,000 square miles, an area twice the size of Texas or almost three times the size of France. Scientists have estimated there are 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the GPGP, equivalent to 250 pieces of debris for every human on earth. Credits cards are no exception to global PVC proliferation and for this reason, we see numerous eco trends to mitigate the effects on our environment.</p>
<p>Environment-Focused Trends </p>
<p>One such movement in credit cards is replacing first-use or virgin PVC with other recycled plastic alternatives or partially recycled content. In the absence of regulation or eco-card standards, the disparity of what constitutes as “eco” is wide-ranging. For example, a “recycled card” can be interpreted many ways, by replacing any percentage of the cards’ total PVC content (i.e., 1%, 25%, 50%, etc.). Alternatively, other eco products like wood, metal, or even paper have been introduced as PVC replacement materials. Each of those also have special considerations across use cases, as durability, longevity, personalization, and overall sustainability need to be assessed. As material and manufacturing trends evolve, some eco types/alternatives are emerging in card issuance and manufacturing. Here are a few:</p>
 
 Recycled PVC (rPVC) – One of the most common “alternative” materials currently, even though second-use PVC is an obvious extension of its origin. PVC can be recycled through mechanical or chemical processes that convert first-use PVC back into pellets for next-gen PVC manufacturing or extracting PVC waste to make other byproducts. PVC and rPVC are not long-term sustainable strategies as they contribute largely to microplastics pollution and higher carbon emissions. 
 Polylactic Acid or Polylactide (PLA) – A polyester made from renewable biomass, typically from fermented plant starch like corn, tapioca, cassava, sugarcane, or sugar beet pulp, designed to break down naturally in the environment. The biggest advantage of PLA is that it is industrially compostable (requires months vs. hundreds of years to break down) and does not compete with food production. 
 Ocean-Bound Plastic (OBP) – Any reclaimed plastics from oceanic or coastal territories that are converted into recycled PVC content. OBP is similar to rPVC in its recyclability but requires additional consideration due to environmental exposure (i.e., ocean salts, and additional logistical challenges with collection or processing). Several companies specialize in OBP programs that partner with third-party processors by tracking high-volume reclamation projects and linking them to end-use consumer products. <a href="https://parley.tv/">Parley for the Oceans</a> is one example of upcycling products into different verticals, including card issuance, where consumers can “connect” further by learning exactly where their products’ recycled content originates (i.e., Chile, South Africa, Sri Lanka). 
 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET), Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol, (rPETG) – One of the most common thermoplastic polymer resins of the polyester family typically used in textiles, liquid/food containers, thermoforming, and in combination with glass fiber engineering resins. Like PVC and rPVC, PET-derivatives are 100% recyclable but contribute equally to higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
<p>Industry ESG Momentum</p>
<p>Although considerable progress has been made within the industry to align eco-programs with “greener” content, a long-term alternative material strategy has not evolved. Many cite a digital card as the most eco-friendly card type, but consumer behavior, accessibility, and use cases tell us that physical cards are here to stay for quite some time. In the bigger picture, “recycling” is only successful if the net environmental impacts are positive, improving our carbon footprint and reducing greenhouse gases. That said, we continue to see many companies setting the bar high for themselves in lieu of regulatory standards, executing their own sustainability goals to reduce the use of PVC in payment cards. The magnitude of these goals varies, but it firmly positions the industry momentum in achieving greater environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals with eco-cards. Institutions like Mastercard, G+D, HSBC, Citizens, and others have taken definitive steps in this direction with program announcements like these:</p>

<p>Several other banks have followed suit with rPVC or biodegradable card programs in 2023, further accentuating the industry’s desire to move forward.</p>

<p>When North America suffered its <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later">largest blackout</a>, it cost upwards of USD 6 billion&nbsp; and left 50 million people without power for up to two days. What caused the blackout? Overgrown trees that came into contact with a power line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond causing blackouts, overgrown vegetation can also cause soil erosion and water quality problems, disrupting both our economy and the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vegetation management aims to mitigate these risks. But what exactly does <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesp/integrated-vegetation-management-fact-sheet">vegetation management</a> mean? It involves promoting desirable, stable and low-growing plant communities by using environmentally sound and cost-effective control methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we’ll explore the importance of vegetation management, its impact on multiple industries, the challenges it presents and how technology can streamline this manual and laborious process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why does vegetation management matter?&nbsp; 



<p>Vegetation overgrowth affects many industries and requires proactive management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Power utilities have an infrastructure that spans vast areas, and failures can affect many businesses and consumers. The 2003 blackout mentioned earlier wasn’t an isolated case; in some regions, vegetation causes up to half of the power outages, and in the US, this figure reaches as high as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-utilities-need-advanced-weather-analytics-for-vegetation-management-now-more-than-ever/">92%</a>, as reported by the Federal Energy Commission. In addition, poorly managed vegetation poses a fire risk when it contacts transmission lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transportation sector also suffers. High winds or other extreme weather conditions can bring down trees, obstructing railroads or highways. This not only results in revenue loss for rail and toll operations but also incurs significant cleanup costs. When critical infrastructure such as roads and railways shuts down, it disrupts our social and economic networks. For example, blocked roads can prevent people from attending important hospital appointments, meetings or family celebrations, and hinder emergency services such as ambulances and fire trucks from reaching an emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In oil and gas industries, unwanted vegetation around buildings can be a fire hazard, especially in climates prone to wildfires, such as California. Wildfires can cause devastating damage and significant disruption. Day-to-day life can become difficult for the community and local businesses can suffer losses if, for example, they are not accessible. Vegetation management is also crucial in controlling invasive plant species, for example kudzu in the US, which threaten local ecosystems and wildlife habitats. By responsibly managing vegetation on their properties, landowners can support local plants, wildlife and biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>



 The challenge of vegetation management&nbsp; 



<p>To help keep services running and enable public safety, many organizations allocate budgets for the preventive maintenance of vegetation overgrowth. However, traditional control methods are labor-intensive and don’t adequately respond to the real risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a rail operator as an example: they might have a vegetation management plan that involves regular removal of tree branches near tracks. At times, the work is done prematurely, leading to unnecessary financial costs. Other times, unexpected rapid vegetation growth due to more frequent extreme weather events might render scheduled inspections too late, complicating the inspection and management of overgrowth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across many industries, manual vegetation checks are the norm, but this approach is costly and time-consuming. It might also be difficult for an organization to gain a confident understanding of their vegetation risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations affected by vegetation risk need to identify the areas that are most vulnerable or prone to overgrowth. To do so, they need to develop a more efficient and cost-effective vegetation management planning system. Many organizations possess a wealth of potentially useful data in their internal systems, but using this data to inform vegetation management decisions remains a significant challenge.&nbsp;</p>



 How can technology support vegetation management?&nbsp; 



<p>By implementing the right technology, organizations can transform vegetation management to become less manual and more data driven. For instance, they can employ:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Satellite and Geiger-mode LiDAR data to monitor vegetation growth around infrastructure and assets, using satellite data to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.&nbsp; 



 Weather data to predict growth patterns and model trees at risk of falling due to high winds or flooding.&nbsp; 



 Plant and tree species data to predict the growth rate of vegetation and help plan when to trim.&nbsp; 
 



<p>When vegetation or cloud cover obstructs the view of assets, AI can complete gaps in satellite imagery and even identify tree species, aiding in growth pattern predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a data-driven strategy, organizations can be more proactive. They can identify overgrowth before it becomes a problem and prioritize vegetation work based on risk. These proactive steps can lead to more efficient use of limited budgets and help organizations reduce the threat to their infrastructure and assets. In highly regulated industries, it also aids in meeting reporting requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI-driven insights further help identify expansion opportunities. When determining where to build a new bridge or cell phone site, organizations can choose locations where vegetation poses less of a threat and is easier to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consolidating <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/geospatial-data">geospatial data</a> by using tools such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM® Environmental Intelligence Suite</a> enables organizations to manage vegetation more effectively. They can view their assets alongside vegetation data and receive notifications when there’s a risk of encroachment or overgrowth, making it possible to automate the process of manual inspections. This method not only reduces financial costs but also aligns vegetation management with actual risks rather than adhering to a fixed schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vegetation growth affects many industries. While traditional vegetation management can be labor-intensive and costly, it doesn’t have to be. Using remote sensing data and AI, organizations can predict and avoid real problems and achieve efficient budget utilization.&nbsp;For more on the subject, get the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RONQJ6KZ">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite Vegetation Management ebook</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Decentralized identity governance covers both the traditional remit of governance —&nbsp;who is in control and therefore accountable — with the technical policies, rules, and procedures that apply to any given use of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>This hybridity can be a source of confusion. Those from the business world may think in terms of corporate governance and those from the engineering world may think in terms of technical stacks. In merging the two, the goals of clarity and simplicity — hallmarks of good governance — run into the complexity of technology, which in the case of decentralized identity, is compounded by its recent emergence, protean capabilities, and unfamiliar concepts and terms.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to simplify and help you understand the basics so that you can start implementing the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>Let’s assume that you’ve already decided that you want to use decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology to share and verify data without the need for direct integrations or third parties.</p>
<p>To implement your solution, you need to ask yourself/team/partners the following question: Do you want to—</p>
<p>create an ecosystem of your own (by ecosystem we mean a complete system for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials/data/identity for a specific use case)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only issue credentials on an existing ecosystem</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only verify credentials on an existing ecosystem?</p>
<p>Answering “yes” to the first means you are the governance authority (or you and a partnering organization or government will co-create the governance if the solution has multiple stakeholders).</p>
<p>A “yes” to the second or third means you need to evaluate the governance of the ecosystem you’re joining to see if it meets your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are creating an ecosystem and the use case comes with a regulatory requirement to run your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network, you’ll need to create network governance.</p>
<p>The image below illustrates the decision process.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>One thing to note is that most solutions do not require creating and running your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network. There are global networks to choose from, including the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, which is purposefully designed for enterprise grade solutions. The point is not having to create a distributed ledger network radically simplifies the amount of governance you have to create and manage, something that’s not always apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One solution, three governance elements, 
<p>For the next step, we’re going to borrow a visual aid from St. Patrick, a shamrock. Right now, any implementation of decentralized identity is going to have the following governance elements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Ecosystem governance applies to the Issuers, holders, and verifiers of verifiable credentials. A governance authority establishes rules for participation and interaction. If you’re creating an ecosystem, as we’ve noted, you are the governance authority for all these participants.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to encode ecosystem governance rules — that is, who is a trusted issuer, what attributes must be presented — in a file that agent software (the software used by issuers, holders, and verifiers) can access and cache. It enables human governance rules to be automated. And because the rules are cached, credential verification is possible in offline situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network governance comprises the governance for a distributed ledger network, which includes the legal agreements for credential issuers to write to the ledger. As noted, you’re unlikely to need to create this, but you will have to evaluate other networks based on their governance and, if issuing credentials, you’re likely going to have to sign agreements to write to a network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the key governance issues in each of these elements?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To implement governance, you are going to have to make a series of policy and technical decisions on each of the bullet points in Ecosystem Governance, and evaluate competing networks on the bullet points in Network Governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the important decisions you are going to have to make when creating governance for an ecosystem&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity assurance —&nbsp;are you issuing credentials to people, organizations, or things? How much information in the credential will identify the person compared to describing&nbsp; the credential? For the personal identity attributes, do you need an identity assurance process?</p>
<p>Credential issuers — Will there be multiple credential issuers in your ecosystem? If so, how are they to be onboarded?</p>
<p>Credential types — what credential type should you use for people, organizations? Do you need selective disclosure? What are the policies and procedures for credential expiry, revocation? Are there any restrictions on who can verify credentials?</p>
<p>DID methods — What DID methods for which participants? Should you use a DID method with communication endpoints? How much durability do you need in your ecosystem?</p>
<p>Protocols — Do you need secure protocols for notification and confirmation? What device capabilities will your participants have?</p>
<p>Cryptographic keys — How will you manage key rotation?</p>
<p>Wallets — What are your options and requirements? Do you have a recognizable brand?</p>
<p>Networks — Will you use a network? Which one will you choose and how will it benefit your solution? (Learn more about the networks Indicio offers and <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">how to choose the best one to fit your needs.</a>)</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of things to consider or the place to dive in and provide analysis and recommendations. But looking at these issues and making decisions is not an Everest-summiting task. In all likelihood, you will make them in consultation with one or more partners who will likely have specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The net result will be a set of approved credential issuers (a trust list) and a set of rules for interaction between all participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly recommend encoding these rules in machine-readable files that can be downloaded by each participant in the ecosystem/use case. Why? It’s simple, it’s flexible, it makes governance portable —&nbsp;and it has provided the best solution for our customers (we’ve created a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">governance editor</a> to help automate the process).&nbsp; </p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Those are the basics. You should have a broad idea of what you need to address in order to implement or evaluate governance for your solution. It’s the starting point for understanding the decisions you need to make, and we’ll cover those decisions in future blog posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one thought to end with, it is to choose options that provide the most flexibility for future development. Technology is not static and with something as powerful as verifiable data, the only thing you can be sure of (besides the data) is that people will innovate in ways that cannot be anticipated. We always recommend building solutions that are capable of managing multiple credential formats, easy key rotation, and (quite essentially) provide communication endpoints so that you won’t find yourself at a sudden competitive disadvantage.</p>

It’s not just a token of identity but also a gateway to exclusive content and&nbsp;events.</p> Step 2: Requirements for&nbsp;Minting <p>To mint your Ontology Guild Pin, you’ll need at least 10 ONG in your wallet, plus a small amount of ONG to cover the GAS fees on the Ontology&nbsp;EVM.</p> Step 3: Bridging ONG to Ontology&nbsp;EVM <p>If your ONG is on the Ontology MainNet, you’ll need to bridge it to the Ontology EVM. Here’s&nbsp;how:</p>  Access the Ontology Bridge: Visit <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/">Ontology Bridge</a> and connect your&nbsp;wallet.  Bridge Your ONG: Follow the steps outlined in this detailed guide: <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/how-to-use-the-ontology-bridge-4b90603d45ce">How to Use the Ontology&nbsp;Bridge</a>.  Confirm the Transaction: Once bridged, the ONG will appear in your wallet on the Ontology&nbsp;EVM.   Step 4: Minting Your Guild&nbsp;Pin   Connect to Guild.xyz: Visit <a href="https://guild.xyz/ontology-network">Guild.xyz</a> and connect your Ethereum wallet on the Ontology EVM&nbsp;chain.  Complete Qualification Steps: Ensure you meet the necessary criteria for minting the&nbsp;pin.  Mint Your Pin: Follow the on-screen instructions to mint your Ontology Guild&nbsp;Pin.   Step 5: Qualifying for the Ontology Collaborate NFT&nbsp;Airdrop <p>By minting your pin, you automatically become eligible for the Ontology Collaborate NFT airdrop. Note that this is exclusive to the first 500&nbsp;minters.</p> Conclusion <p>Minting your Ontology Guild Pin is a simple yet significant step in deepening your engagement with the Ontology community. Not only does it enhance your digital identity, but it also opens up a world of opportunities, including the chance to earn an exclusive NFT. So, get your ONG ready, mint your pin, and become part of this exciting&nbsp;journey!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/unlocking-community-rewards-fd7341fc13b8">Unlocking Community Rewards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://medium.com/@finclusive/verida-and-finclusive-bring-private-verified-identity-to-web3-and-defi-ef9ffac656fc">successful Proof of Concept (PoC) between Verida and FinClusive</a>, we are excited to announce the launch of an end-to-end solution for reusable and verifiable Known Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) credentials. This solution streamlines client onboarding and associated compliance, reduces onboarding costs, increases operational efficiency and meets existing and emerging regulatory requirements for both traditional and growing alternative and decentralized financial services.</p><p>We are continuing to build on the initial PoC with <a href="https://finclusive.com/">FinClusive</a> and <a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>, who provides the infrastructure for credential issuance, verification, suspension and revocation. Together we can scale this combined application and enable financial services of all types to condense client onboarding times, while enabling portability and privacy controls for&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Interested organisations from traditional and web3 sectors, please <a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">book a call</a> with our joint representative Alex to capitalise on the benefits of reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p><p>Combined, this solution provides a plug-and-play platform for financial services’ KYC/KYB needs while providing reusability, client privacy, portability, and embedded compliance controls. The technology and capabilities provided through this alignment result in the following benefits for organisations that adopt this solution:</p>  Cost Savings: Significantly reduced costs for KYC and KYB verification, by a factor of&nbsp;10x.  Efficiency: A simplified customer experience, reducing customer drop-off rates and friction during onboarding, and making re-validation and monitoring real time. Simultaneously, for companies, it reduces manual document verifications and time-sinks through instantaneous verification and trusted&nbsp;checks.  Regulatory Compliance: Full regulatory compliance for customer onboarding and associated KYC/KYB, background due diligence (basic to enhanced and bespoke), with full real-time AML checks, risk scoring and background screenings, and an ongoing monitoring engine in keeping with global best practices and requirements.  Interoperability: Full compatibility and interoperability with other organisations issuing or accepting digital credentials, with no vendor lock-in–with a growing ecosystem of vendor/partners, our combined platform can enable multiple vendor engagement, and importantly accommodate financial institutions’ individual risk profiles and methodologies.  Enhanced and Embedded Privacy: Improved data sovereignty and privacy for customers, via holding their credentials in a self-custodied wallet and explicitly consenting to when they are shared, with whom, and what data is verified. Digitally verifiable KYC/KYB-backed credentials protect sensitive underlying personal and entity identifying information (PII/EII), as well as sensitive accounts and payments information (e.g. account numbers, wallet addresses, payments flows), that can be attached to these credentials — providing essential proofs while eliminating continual data disclosures in current practice.  Standardisation: Future-proofed technology in line with the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 regulation, and in keeping with ongoing international data standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and International Organization of Standardization (ISO).  <p>Within Q1 2024, FinClusive will be rolling out the first verifiable credentials for KYC and KYB to streamline onboarding for financial services in web2 and also regulated organisations such as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) within&nbsp;web3.</p> Solving onboarding challenges, while reducing&nbsp;costs <p>There are currently significant challenges for companies around customer onboarding and verification where it is too costly in terms of time and money, leading to inefficiencies, to build trust in their customer-base.</p><p>This “verifiable” KYC/KYB solution positions itself to solve three major challenges faced by most companies which require identity verification checks in their course of business.</p>  High costs for KYC/KYB. With digital credentials that can be reused, this solution significantly reduces the costs for onboarding and verifying customers, for industries such as financial services, as well as opening up KYC/KYB into new&nbsp;markets  Challenging and costly compliance requirements. With an instantaneous check feature for AML assurance, risk scoring and other background screenings, compliance requirements can be met more easily than ever&nbsp;before  Time inefficiencies spent on identity assurance. With verifiable data sharing, secured by cryptographic primitives, we can provide a high level of assurance without any manual effort, saving employees and employers time.  <p>Through addressing each of these problems, we are bringing significant value to the market, with reduced costs and improved efficiency.</p><p>Amit Sharma, Founder and CEO of FinClusive has commented “The rising cost of inefficient compliance in the client onboarding, KYC/KYB and verification process is both crippling for service providers and detrimental to customers’ experience and privacy. Integrating the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet to allow users to store and share their FinClusive credentials sets an industry benchmark for a regulatory-compliant digital credential application and introduces a more efficient model for the traditional finance&nbsp;sector.”</p><p>“Expanding our partnership with Verida with the support of cheqd is very exciting as we work to build a ‘consortia’ of partners. Together, we intend to securely issue compliance credentials across a decentralized finance network, modernizing the existing process. We are excited to grow these capabilities with partners in expanding a robust, globally transportable KYC/KYB verifiable credential that streamlines essential compliance processes and brings needed privacy controls and efficiencies to client onboarding and engagement in both traditional and decentralized financial services.”</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Book a chat</a> with our joint representative Alex now to create a seamless client onboarding and engagement experience while enjoying the pros of reduced cost for your organisation.</p> A feature-rich solution that meets global standards <p>As a full end-to-end solution, FinClusive integrated with cheqd and Verida can offer the following capabilities for achieving the first regulatory compliant process for verifiable KYC sharing and reliance:</p>  Identity verification: FinClusive currently supports identity verification coverage in over 170 countries.  Digital credential issuance: Through cheqd’s <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/get-started">Credential Service</a> we can issue reusable and verifiable digital credentials based on the results of these identity verification checks — for both individuals and entities (including their beneficial owners and control persons).  Credential storage and backup: Users can securely store their KYC/KYB credential in their <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Vault</a>, backed up on the decentralized <a href="http://verida.network">Verida storage&nbsp;network</a>.  Endpoints for applications and services: Applications and services can request access to this KYC credential, validating users without requiring them to repeat the KYC, creating a seamless user experience, and a value-added identity asset for clients as they engage more services from their providers and work to enable cross-services and open banking opportunities.  Real-time suspension and revocation checks: Using cheqd’s decentralized infrastructure, we provide instantaneous lookups for AML screenings and other background checks. Combined with automated ongoing client monitoring from FinClusive, credentials can be issued, managed, shared, verified, revoked as necessary in keeping with a client’s status at any given time. Further, multiple credentials can be issued and monitored in keeping with a client’s risk profile or a service provider’s risk appetite.  <p>All of these capabilities solve pain points for both traditional bank and nonbank financial institutions as well as decentralized and web-native services providers. Moreover, they facilitate a full end-to-end compliance solution while also giving customers “self-sovereign” control of their own KYC/KYB data. Not only does this have benefits in terms of data reusability, costs and data efficiency, as illustrated above, but it also meets existing and upcoming best practices for data protection requirements and eID, including:</p>  GDPR and CCPA: Achieving data minimisation and providing data subjects their rights by&nbsp;default  eIDAS: Meeting emerging European eIDAS 2.0 standards and digital credential requirements for service providers, which will set a global benchmark.  <p>In combination, this solution modernizes existing processes for both web2 and web3 regulated industries. Customers no longer need to go through a KYC process multiple times for each service they onboard to, and can be verified near instantaneously, while assuring the requisite privacy protections of their personal and financial information, which traditionally is disclosed by and between verifying institutions. This creates a more efficient market for identity verification and reduces the replication and storage of sensitive personal identification documents, while providing client control of their sensitive data and embedding the necessary protections for financial system integrity.</p> A first-of-its-kind differentiator for regulated industries <p>For most regulated industries, such as financial services, companies are obligated to put in place AML and KYC/KYB controls for their customers. However, many service providers are unaware of their obligations to conduct essential KYC/KYB beyond initial onboarding.</p><p>These extra obligations include ongoing client monitoring, dynamic risk scoring and continuous AML screening checks — required to meet various regulations across jurisdictions.</p><p>These post-onboarding obligations are vital because when sharing KYC data between two organisations, the relying party may also require “real-time” data on the client to satisfy a requisite level of assurance, minimize their counterparty risk, and to meet regulatory requirements.</p><p>Our combined solution provides such needed modernization across:</p>  Client onboarding;  Ongoing monitoring and essential compliance for regulated service providers;  Real-time compliance checks for relying&nbsp;parties.  <p>For client onboarding, our solution automates and fully digitizes the onboarding experience using digital credentials issued upon successful KYC to a users’ wallet (with FinClusive and cheqd facilitating the issuance and Verida providing the wallet and storage capabilities for the&nbsp;user).</p><p>For regulated entities and financial services, our solution automates client monitoring for dynamic risk scoring by ‘embedding’ monitoring and screening controls into an easy-to-use dashboard (using FinClusive’s existing compliance suite and tooling).</p><p>For relying parties, our solution provides real-time verification of the KYC credential AND a live “double check” of the data, feeding from on-going monitoring of the client data happening in the background (using cheqd’s decentralised and privacy-preserving status list infrastructure, in conjunction with FinClusive’s compliance suite).</p><p>“This collaboration has allowed us to innovate with real-time monitoring and verification checks in a fully decentralized and privacy preserving format. This is completely new to the market and enables us to provide a fully regulatory compliant solution for customer onboarding and monitoring, while simultaneously being future proofed for the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation for digital credentials. This can revolutionise the existing paradigm for customer data sharing, reducing costs and friction within existing regulated industries and emerging markets where identity verification is currently too costly” says Alex Tweeddale, Product Lead at&nbsp;cheqd.</p><p>Using the existing infrastructure with FinClusive, cheqd and Verida, this verifiable KYC/KYB solution can be used across various use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Financial Services: Onboarding at any bank or nonbank financial service, lowering costs and friction. Sharing reusable and trusted data between financial services, while meeting counterparty risk and compliance requirements.  Web 3.0: Reusing “Web 2.0” KYC and ongoing monitoring compliance processes to onboard to regulated Virtual Asset Service Providers at low cost and with increased efficiency  eCommerce and Online Retailers: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to purchase goods online, reducing the risk of fraud and phishing.  Age Restrictions: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to access age restricted content, such as alcohol, gambling or gaming — meeting upcoming compliance requirements for&nbsp;vendors.  Government Services: Government agencies can use reusable KYC/KYB to streamline processes for citizens accessing various public services, reducing the administrative burden on both the government and citizens.  Cross-Border Transactions: Reusable KYC/KYB can be beneficial in cross-border transactions and international business dealings, where having a standardized and recognized identity verification process can facilitate smoother collaborations.  Others: Combining KYC/KYB credentials with other credentials (e.g. employment, accomplishments, loyalty, heath) to build higher levels of assurance and digital reputation.  <p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Schedule a meeting</a> with our joint representative Alex to become a pioneer in your industry by offering a fully decentralised and privacy preserving way to verify reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p> A truly global collaboration <p>“We are thrilled to have successfully integrated the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet and work closely with the Finclusive team to provide a seamless user experience to end users to receive, store and share their reusable Finclusive credentials. This successful proof of concept is a showcase of what industry standard best practice looks like for regulatory compliant credential activities, while also demonstrating a more streamlined and efficient model for the traditional finance sector. We are incredibly excited to continue working with FinClusive and cheqd to roll this technology out across the wide range of global use cases.” says Chris Were, CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://Verida.io">Verida</a>.</p><p>Verida, based in Australia, provides a mobile wallet used by a Holder to receive, store and present their VCs. This mobile wallet also provides an embedded crypto wallet combined with the world’s leading decentralized, encrypted private data storage network suitable for storing VC’s. This provides a simple interface for end users to interact with traditional finance products and blockchain digital assets in a regulatory compliant manner.</p><p>cheqd, based in the UK, is a purpose-built network for decentralised identity. It maintains an array of packages with varying levels of integration complexity to allow its partners and customers to have a variety of ways of plugging into cheqd’s identity functionality. Via these different packages, customers and partners can issue and verify Verifiable Credentials, create cheqd DIDs, DID-Linked Resources, Status Lists and Schemas with different levels of integration effort and flexibility, enabling frictionless verification, real-time monitoring and decentralisation for resilience, uptime and efficient cross-border lookups.</p><p>FinClusive, based in the US, is a KYC/KYB and full-stack anti-money laundering and financial crimes compliance (AML/FCC) platform with due diligence coverage in over 180 countries–providing automated KYC/KYB, requisite customer due diligence (basic to enhanced) with global coverage, ongoing monitoring and transaction tracking. The platform automates the verification and/or issuance of digitally verifiable compliance-backed Identity credentials that can be verified centrally through FinClusive or decentrally in collaboration with Verida and cheqd using&nbsp;VCs.</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Arrange a conversation</a> with our joint representative Alex to start optimising your business and reduce avoidable KYC/KYC verification cost.

<p>One of the biggest security weak points for organizations involves their <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/authentication">authentication</a> processes. According to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/gcat_threathorizons_full_jul2023.pdf">Google Cloud’s 2023 Threat Horizons Report</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen credentials. Our own research found that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">60% of organizations reported authentication-related breaches</a> in the past year. Context-based authentication offers an important tool in the battle against credential stuffing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, MFA prompt bombing, and other attacks on authentication systems.</p>  
<p>Also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a> or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/risk-based-authentication">risk-based authentication</a>, context-based authentication layers on dynamic security controls that use contextual signals and other indicators of risk to make access decisions. When used in conjunction with secure passwordless authentication, it helps better protect your resources while providing better employee and customer login experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Context-Based Authentication?  
<p>Context-based authentication goes beyond traditional methods by controlling access and user authentication flows based on dynamic risk calculations. It analyzes information such as user behavior, device signals, and risk signals from other security tools to dictate access policies. This is a departure from traditional authentication, which relies solely on presenting the correct credentials. Based on this risk information it may, for example, prompt users for an additional authentication factor, require them to re-affirm their identity through a proofing process, or block access altogether. Incorporating context and eliminating insecure passwords from the authentication process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, thereby lowering the chances of a potential data breach.</p> 
<p>In its simplest terms, context-based authentication involves two parts:</p> 
  
  Establishing a baseline: In order to determine what behavior and scenarios are suspicious, the systems must first establish a baseline for each user that defines what is normal.  
  Responding to anomalies: Once a baseline is set, the context-based authentication system evaluates each login attempt against this norm. It actively scans for potential anomalies, such as login attempts originating from unusual geographic locations or suspicious VPNs, during periods of user inactivity, if the device is rooted or jailbroken, and other factors that indicate a higher risk. It also takes into account the type of access requested — for example a high-risk transaction. If elevated risk levels are detected, the system triggers additional authentication factors or verification steps.  
  
 Key Components of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Any context-based authentication system contains these basic components, although they will vary in both how they are constructed and how they get used. The best context-based authentication processes assess multiple layers and signals in order to effectively optimize for both security and user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Risk Engine  
<p>The heart of context-based authentication is the risk engine. The risk engine continuously collects and analyzes data to determine the risk level associated with each user access request. Modern authentication risk engines use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to detect malicious behaviors and threats in real time. The broader and more varied the information sources and risk signals, the more accurate and effective the risk engine.</p> 
 Context Sources  
<p>As mentioned, the effectiveness of the risk engine fully depends on its data sources. Sources include things such as device health posture, mobile, web and browser contextual signals, real-time events, user behavior and access patterns. Ideally, your sources also include risk data from EDR systems and other cybersecurity tools deployed in your organization.</p> 
 Action Orchestration  
<p>Real-time risk information holds little value if it cannot also be actioned upon in real time. Context-based authentication systems use the risk insight to enforce access policies. This can range from simply denying access, to requiring additional authentication steps, to requiring the person to prove that they are the person they claim to be using identity verification technologies.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Benefits of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Context-based authentication provides multiple advantages for organizations.:</p> 
  
  Prevents attacks: Context-based authentication operates as a continuous gatekeeper, actively scanning for anomalies and high-risk activities. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized access attempts and significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, protecting sensitive data and fortifying the organization's security posture against evolving threats.  
  Improves User Experience (UX): By leveraging contextual cues to streamline access, it ensures that legitimate users can navigate seamlessly through the authentication process. This not only enhances overall user satisfaction but also minimizes friction, making security measures more user-friendly without compromising on protection.  
  Ensures Regulatory Compliance: Context-based authentication allows organizations to continuously assess identity threats and mitigate risks as required by NIST, ISO, HIPAA, GDPR and other regulations. It also can ensure only authorized users access sensitive information in accordance with requirements underPCI, FISMA, FRCP and HITECH.  
  Enables Zero Trust Architecture: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/risk-based-authentication-essential-to-zero-trust">Context-based authentication aligns with Zero Trust</a> “never trust, always verify” principles. It assumes that no user or system is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous and ongoing verification. When used in conjunction with phishing-resistant AAL3-compliant authentication methods, it provides a strong foundation for building a Zero Trust architecture.  
  
 Implement Context-Based Authentication With HYPR Adapt  
<p>Context-based authentication employs risk-based analysis to determine and adjust authentication security controls in real time. The level of security it delivers depends on multiple factors including the sophistication of the risk engine, the breadth and depth of contextual information it uses, and the range of security controls it can affect.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> leverages a cutting-edge identity risk engine for real-time threat assessment, dynamically adapting security policies to deliver a personalized yet secure authentication experience.

 FAQs  
<p>Q: What is context-based authentication?</p> 
<p>A: Context-based authentication utilizes risk-based analysis to determine the appropriate authentication level, adjusting security measures based on real-time user actions and threat assessments.</p> 
<p>Q: How does context-based authentication enhance security?</p> 
<p>A: Context-based authentication enhances security by dynamically adapting to changing risk levels, providing a personalized authentication experience tailored to each user's unique context, thereby effectively mitigating potential risks.</p> 
<p>Q: What are some real-world scenarios for using context-based authentication?</p> 
<p>A: Adapting authentication flows to contextual information becomes especially crucial in situations such as remote worker access, to evaluate and act on indicators of elevated risk. Another important scenario is to add extra levels of security on financial transactions, such as transferring or withdrawing funds.</p> 
<p>Q: What is HYPR Adapt, and how does it facilitate context-based authentication?</p> 
<p>A: HYPR Adapt dynamically assesses potential identity threats and enforces adaptive security controls so you can effectively manage identity-related risks, even in rapidly changing environments. Its powerful risk engine analyzes signals and telemetry from numerous sources, including user behavior analytics and contextual information from mobile, endpoint and browser signals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: In new updates from the previous version of this blogpost: Microsoft Authenticator is not yet FIPS 140 compliant on Android. Microsoft Authenticator on Android is currently pending FIPS compliance certification to support our customers that may require FIPS validated cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022. Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app#fips-140-compliant-for-microsoft-entra-authentication">FIPS 140 complaint for the Microsoft Authenticator app.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this second blog of a 4-part series we are sharing some design principles that could underpin a desirable future scenario. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;two.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios?  What could a desirable future scenario actually look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?   Part 2 (of 4): Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? <p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">first blog</a> of this series we explored a number of factors that make our current monetary system incompatible with a regenerative and equitable future. Highlighting such issues feels important but it should not be the end goal. If something is threatening our shared fates, then it is our collective responsibility to try and create an alternative. Our aim is to learn from sharing these initial thoughts by inviting comments and critiques. Ultimately we hope to convene a community who have diverse skills and experiences beyond our own; a distributed team united in designing and building the alternative monetary system that we so desperately require. A first step towards that is to think carefully about what a desirable monetary system might in fact&nbsp;contain.</p><p>We are approaching this challenge in two&nbsp;parts:</p>  Firstly, by sharing ten design principles that we think should underpin a regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.  Secondly, we are in the process of developing aspirational future scenarios that respectfully explore the above principles.   Design principles <blockquote>Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of&nbsp;oil.</blockquote>Credit: Dr Martin&nbsp;Lorenz<p>The following principles underpin a vision that opens up the future rather than closing it down. Whilst it is critical to understand the constraints (such as energy and carbon), we also need to seed a desire for non-competitive, infinite economies. Value flows such as solidarity, information and care can be managed in a different way to finite economies, providing a liberating release valve to our current scarcity&nbsp;mindset.</p>  Maintain interregional stability via organised exchange: our global supply chains are complex and entangled. Currently, the major reserve currency is backed by military force rather than by the collective values of the global population. As the polycrisis² intensifies we must ensure that we have the systems in place to trade fluidly and to provide a strong incentive to maintain peaceful relations.  Uplift economically poor but regeneratively rich regions: in much of the world our conception of profit and wealth is perverse, but it can be reconceived in service of regenerative potential. Regions and communities that are regeneratively abundant should automatically derive transactional rights that can be used to uplift critical infrastructures.  Elevate decentralised, value-backed currency issuance: Bitcoin is an example of alternative currency with a link to the physical world. This is achieved by the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp">proof of work function</a> that rewards miners who solve a mathematical problem with newly issued bitcoin (or with transactional fees). This principle builds on the requirement for a tangible link with the biosphere to break the cycle of growth linked extraction which we explored in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog 1</a>. However, it seeks to achieve it by stewarding and increasing regenerative potential rather than by solving inane calculations.  Steward respectful interchangeability: we must clearly understand that finite elements of our world are not commensurate. Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of oil. We must create closed loop cycles of stewardship that ensure respectful fungibility.  Quantify rather than price: markets provide a powerful distributed allocation mechanism for private assets, but are dangerously inadequate in relation to common elements such, soil health and air quality. Our attempts to price ‘nature’ and ‘natural assets’ have to date only yielded further extraction. We thus need to think about using measurements to account for the base reality of our systems rather than their priced abstractions.  Build visceral accountability: our transactional worldview allows people to separate their lived experience from their monetary choices. To maintain healthy relationships with each other and with our ecosystems, we must reconnect our animate senses to our decision making processes. Unless we can sense and feel how our actions play out, we are unlikely to tap into the wisdom required to steward a densely populated planet.  Commit to computational collaboration: the increasing ability to digitalise living systems can be directed to help us understand diverse perspectives, including those of the other-than-human world. What would it mean to create technologies of care? Could we use computation power to build interfaces that clearly visualise and recognise the complexity of entangled value&nbsp;flows?  Drive dynamic, iterative decision making: we must avoid the conceited falsity of being in control of living systems. Instead, the data that we collect can be used to create a dynamic understanding of complex interactions. For example, how are the different elements reacting with each other? How does the picture evolve as more data comes in? What does this mean in terms of acting as a respectful ecosystem collaborator?  Strengthen participatory value governance: building on principles 7 and 8, we must design governance systems capable of understanding the collective values of nested communities. This form of open society will transcend narrow voting behaviours in service of our collective thriving.  Interweave spiritual and political logic: we must aspire to preserve the aesthetic, intrinsic sacredness of life whilst recognising the political reality of our time. Holding both perspectives, whilst the transitional reverberations rip through the fabric of society, will be a critical aspect of this&nbsp;work.   Outlining a desirable scenario <p>Imagine a situation where currencies and capital are fundamentally linked to the objective, intersubjective and intrinsic value of interconnected relationships. Where the accounting and forecasting systems allow for multivalent factors and unforeseen possibilities. Where multi-sensor inputs are connected to a continuous participatory governance structure and trans-contextual decision making is the norm. This might sound complex and opaque, but in reality the technology either already exists or is close to reaching this level of functionality. The constraints are primarily those of path dependency² and power defending inertia.</p><p>We fully acknowledge that we cannot simply transcend the structural reality of our existing socio-economic systems. The aim is therefore to present the seeds of a cohesive alternative, because whilst we cannot possibly imagine the exact form of a future monetary system, we can think about the building blocks that it might contain.

 How inclusive are your services? We explore how video verification can help give your company a competitive edge. 



 



<p>Inclusiveness escaped mere buzzword status and took some significant steps into the mainstream in 2023. This year, it’s sure to become an even more important competitive differentiator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being able to offer a truly inclusive workplace; one that is respectful of a team’s differences, whether that be gender, race, sexuality, or disability is a non-negotiable for the modern workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture has been shown to create multiple benefits, including:</p>



  Bigger talent pools<br>  More ‘heard’ and satisfied staff<br>  Better reputation among peers<br>  <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Optimal business performance</a><br>  Improved understanding of customers  



<p>But, what about a company’s actual customers? Besides the carefully crafted core values, and specific selection of stock photographs on a company’s website, how accessible are their products? How easy do organizations make it for customers to register, to use, and to integrate their services into their daily lives?</p>



 Accessibility for all. 



<p>With over <a href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-genders-list/">80 different cultural descriptions of gender</a>, amid growing sentiment that people should be able to self-identify, the challenge to offer fully inclusive identity verification has become increasingly complicated. Nobody should be denied access to online products; whether that’s opening bank accounts, renting scooters, or any other service that requires users to verify their identity.</p>



<p>There are many factors that can lead to inequality and a lack of inclusiveness in identity verification. For example, deeply entrenched racial bias has been discovered in many AI-based identity verification systems. Facial recognition software, in particular, has a long history of failing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">recognize certain ethnicities.</a> Other incidents of racial bias include black applicants receiving a disproportionate percentage of rejections via an AI-based applicant screening process. In 2022, the UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) began a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/14/uk-data-watchdog-investigates-whether-ai-systems-show-racial-bias">three-year study</a> into ‘AI-driven discrimination’ by analyzing the effects of using algorithms to sift through job applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of AI has also revealed a worrying trend to discriminate against women by, for example, continuing to use gendered terms like policeman or fireman in text creation. In AI-prompt video generation, traditionally female roles, like carers, are <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/sponsored/4148316/gender-biased-ai-sending-us">still depicted by females</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been evidence of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/4-ways-to-address-gender-bias-in-ai">higher gender identification error rates among female subjects</a> by AI-enabled computer vision systems.</p>



 Fighting bias, one face at a time. 



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow is collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">MAMMOth project.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.</p>



 Great UX for all users. 



<p>Additional factors such as age, disability, and neurodiversity are other areas that pose usability and inclusivity challenges, as is low proficiency in technology, or poor internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also the issue of those who do not have identity documents. Populations without paper or photo ID face an uphill struggle to verify themselves digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of identification has always been a barrier to economic and social inclusion, and in the digital age, without access to digital IDs and digital verification solutions, this is still the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/articles/women-in-identity-launch-code-of-conduct-project-challenging-digital-identity-teams-to-create-more-inclusive-solutions">one in four people</a> in the UK do not have traditional identity verification, yet smartphone ownership is on a steady march to capacity.</p>

 Inclusivity starts and ends with identity verification. 



<p>Bridging the inclusivity gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptation, and policies that directly address accessibility and inclusivity needs.&nbsp;</p>

 The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI. Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI? <blockquote>TLDR: The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote>Deep Thought, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (2005&nbsp;film).<p>In Douglas Adams’ science fiction series “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” a supercomputer named Deep Thought took over 7.5 million years to calculate the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” and humorously gave out the number&nbsp;“42”.</p><p>Without Deep Thought (or even ChatGPT) and million years of computation, we may answer a slightly different question:</p><blockquote>What is currently the best technology for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Decentralized Identifier (DID), and Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)?</blockquote><p>This guide argues that the answer to this not-so-ultimate question is Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI).</p> KERI Why/What/How <p>Since its invention in 2019, KERI has been one of the most misunderstood technologies and concepts in the SSI space, given its technical complexity and seemingly steep learning curve. As an attempt to demystify KERI, here, this three-part series will answer three simple Why, What, and How questions, as&nbsp;follows:</p>Adapted from “The Golden Circle” in “Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action” by Simon Sinek&nbsp;(2009).<p>Part 1 starts with the Why question. The following sections outline the evolution of digital identity systems from a centralized to a decentralized model. We will delve into the reason why blockchain is not a necessary component for building a decentralized identity system and put forth an argument as to why a KERI-based model is a better alternative and is potentially a candidate for the next generation of digital identity&nbsp;systems.</p>The evolution of digital identity. Centralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity">Digital identity</a> is defined as the information utilized by computers to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. Hence, digital identity has been around since the early days of the Internet when a computer system needed to know with whom or things it interacted.</p><p>Dated back to the 1960s and 1970s, the earliest form of digital identity was the use of usernames and passwords that allow multiple users to access shared computer resources and online services. These systems independently and centrally manage their interactions, resulting in a model known as Centralized Digital Identity. Nowadays, centralized digital identity has evolved into Federated Digital Identity in the 2000s where digital identities used by multiple computer systems are federated to a single trusted centralized entity, called an Identity Provider (IdP). Despite their prevalence, there are two major concerns with the centralized identity&nbsp;model:</p>  Single Point of Failure: A centralized identity system relies on a single centralized entity. If the central entity is compromised, all associated systems and services also become vulnerable.  Privacy Concern: IdPs with large user bases, like Google and Facebook, can collect a vast amount of user data, tracking all aspects of the users’ digital lives. These IdP platforms may monetize these data as well as abuse it, e.g., influencing the geopolitical opinions of the&nbsp;public.   Blockchain-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Decentralized Digital Identity—also known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)—promises to give “control” back to the users from the centralized platforms—enhancing trust while preserving individual privacy. Seminal works that lay the foundation include The <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a> (2005) by Kim Cameron and <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (2016) by Christopher Allen.</p><blockquote>Note: The terms “Decentralized Digital Identity” and “SSI” are often used interchangeably. However, SSI is more commonly used to describe the principles and community while Decentralized Digital Identity is more commonly used to describe the technology based on the principles of this movement.</blockquote><p>By 2015, the rise of blockchain technology started to capture the attention of the digital identity community, and several sessions on “blockchain identity” were hosted during the Spring 2015 <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW). A seminal paper on “Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)” by C. Allen, et al. was also published in the same&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>“The goal of DPKI is to ensure that, unlike PKIX, no single third party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Trust is decentralized through the use of technologies that make it possible for geographically and politically disparate entities to reach consensus on the state of a shared database.” — <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a>, C. Allen, et al., Rebooting the Web of Trust I&nbsp;(2015).</blockquote><blockquote>Note: PKIX stands for Public Key Infrastructure that is based on X.509 certificates.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: Here, we specifically refer to the term “blockchain” as a “distributed-consensus ledger with a global ordering of records”. This is because the term “blockchain” is sometimes used to refer to a hash-chained verifiable data structure.</blockquote><p>The development of blockchain-based digital identity kickstarted the SSI revolution and resulted in multiple communities of practitioners including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> in 2017 and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> in 2020 as well as multiple standards including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>.</p><p>Over the years, the popularity of blockchain has made the term “decentralization” synonymous with the term “blockchain” to the public. Unfortunately, this gave a false impression to many people that any decentralized system requires the use of blockchain technology. For example, the Internet Protocol (IP)—which was invented in the 1970s and predates the invention of blockchain—is also decentralized since there is no single entity controlling the global Internet&nbsp;network.</p><p>Blockchain indeed possesses multiple properties that make it suitable for decentralized digital identity systems, including security, availability, programmability, transparency, etc. However, blockchain is not a silver bullet without any drawbacks and is simply one implementation of decentralized systems among many. For example, one of the most common drawbacks of blockchain is its scalability due to the unsolvable problem known as the blockchain trilemma.</p><p>While you can certainly build a decentralized identity system using blockchain, it turns out you don’t have to. The following sections give a detailed reason for why this is the&nbsp;case.</p> Double Spending&nbsp;Proof <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. At its core, Bitcoin solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized manner using a distributed consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Later iterations of blockchain technology proposed other consensus mechanisms such as Poof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA).</p><blockquote>Note: The double-spending problem is a problem in a cryptocurrency system where the same single digital token can be spent more than&nbsp;once.</blockquote><p>In essence, blockchains address the double-spending problem by establishing a network of validators, which are distributed geographically and are not controlled by a single entity. These validators collectively maintain a shared ledger with a total ordering of transactional records. Updates to this shared ledger occur through a consensus mechanism agreed upon by the validators.</p><blockquote>Note: In distributed systems, a “total order” refers to a consistent and agreed-upon sequence or ranking of all events or transactions in a system. In a total order, every pair of events can be compared, and it is clear which one occurred before the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>While double-spending is a fundamental problem in a cryptocurrency system, it does not generally apply to an identity system. In a cryptocurrency system, if Alice transfers the same amount of money to Bob twice, Alice is twice as poor, and Bob is twice as rich. On the other hand, if Alice performs identical authorization operations on Bob repeatedly, their internal states may be affected by only the first operation and remain unaffected by all subsequent operations.</p>The necessity of double-spending proof for a cryptocurrency system vs. an identity&nbsp;system.<blockquote>Note: This is the property called idempotence. It is defined as follows: “An operation is idempotent if it can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.”</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency operations are not idempotent and require double-spending proof property. On the other hand, most operations in identity systems are idempotent. This can be summarized below:</p><blockquote>“An identity system does not need to provide double-spending proof of an account balance. It merely needs to provide consistency.”</blockquote> Bypassing the blockchain trilemma <p>The blockchain trilemma is a well-known fundamental problem in blockchain technology, which is widely believed to be unsolvable. It highlights an inherent trade-off among decentralization, security, and scalability in blockchain systems. Implementations of blockchain—including blockchain-based identity systems—cannot simultaneously achieve high levels of all three components. Any attempt to improve one aspect always comes at the expense of the&nbsp;others.</p><p>A good example is Bitcoin itself, which is extremely secure and decentralized while having poor scalability. Another good example is the Terra blockchain which was designed to be highly scalable at the cost of security, leading to its collapse in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The root cause of the blockchain trilemma is the fact that a blockchain network fundamentally consists of validators that must come to a consensus to make an update to a shared totally ordered ledger. Such a consensus mechanism is an essential component in a cryptocurrency system where double-spending proof is a critical property.</p><p>As outlined in the previous section, as a double-spending proof is not a necessary property for an identity system, a consensus mechanism is thus not a required component. Hence, the blockchain trilemma can be entirely bypassed—not solved—for a decentralized identity system by giving up the double-spending-proof property.</p><p>As it turns out, a means for building such a decentralized identity system already exists, and it is known as&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In a nutshell, <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> is a decentralized protocol for the management of persistent self-certifying identifiers.</p><blockquote>While blockchain was initially invented for the construction of a cryptocurrency system, the KERI protocol was specifically designed for building a decentralized digital identity&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>While, we will discuss in detail what KERI exactly is in the next part of this series, here are a few reasons why you should adopt&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain <p>One of the most common problems with blockchain-based identity systems is their scalability. For example, Hyperledger Indy—one of the most popular blockchain protocols for decentralized identity—<a href="https://github.com/lissi-id/acapy-load-test-results/blob/main/AcaPy_0-7-4/Endurance_Test/04-0_7_3_indy-200rpm/report-test-results-0-END.pdf">takes around 4 hours to issue 18,000 credentials</a>, as discussed in detail by Kaliya Young in her blog “<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">Being “Real” about Hyperledger Indy &amp; Aries / Anoncreds</a>”.</p><p>In short, blockchain is slow, and one can only make it faster by reducing security and/or decentralization due to the blockchain trilemma. This is not at all the case for&nbsp;KERI:</p><blockquote>The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote><p>Since security and decentralization are often not a concern for most implementations of blockchain-based identity systems, the most important reason for adopting KERI is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain for building decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</blockquote> Other reasons to adopt&nbsp;KERI   KERI may leverage blockchain for discovery and verification. KERI’s ledger, called a key event log (KEL), may be embedded in an arbitrary blockchain network. As a result, KERI may leverage all the advantages of using blockchain — including availability, transparency, and programmability.  KERI is portable across blockchains. KERI does not ultimately rely on blockchain. Once a KERI-based identity system utilizes a blockchain network, it may switch to another blockchain network. This solves the ledger lock-in problem where a decentralized identifier is locked to a specific blockchain network.  KERI is recoverable from a quantum attack. If a quantum suddenly becomes available and is used to attack a KERI-based identity system, the KERI protocol has the means to recover control from the attacker via a mechanism called pre-rotation.  KERI supports the right to be forgotten. Transactions in blockchain are recorded in a shared totally ordered ledger, which makes it impossible to delete a transaction that contains personally identifiable information (PII). This is not a problem for KERI since KERI’s ledgers—i.e., KELs— are not&nbsp;shared.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p><br>
Trust registries can quickly become a powerful tool for the discovery of services, including digital credential exchange services.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that trust registries are only necessary once digital credentials become widely adopted. However, I think the reality is quite the opposite. Trust registries are not just supporting systems; they are enablers of digital credential adoption.</p>
<p>What is a Trust Registry? In simple terms: Some list of authoritative identifiers that are governed. In the context of digital credentials, when a person presents a credential from their digital identity wallet to a verifier, the verifier might question the legitimacy of the issuing entity behind the credential presented. This is where a trust registry becomes invaluable. It can provide verifiers with the information needed to confirm whether the issuer is authorized by a governing body, under a governance framework.</p>
<p>The Dual Role of Trust Registries. Trust registries serve a dual purpose. Yes, they can be used by entities, such as verifiers, seeking inputs to help them make trust decisions. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly to where we’re at in the adoption cycle of digital credentials: trust registries act as discovery mechanisms. For example, if I’m looking for an authorized auditor for a specific function, a verified auditors list in a trust registry can provide essential information to initiate contact and potentially help me form business connections.</p>
<p>In the digital trust context, this could lead to forming direct connections or requesting credentials to further business processes. Therefore, trust registries are not only useful for making trust decisions during credential exchanges but also serve as powerful tools for decision-making prior to any credential exchange, acting as a strong discovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Investing in trust registries is crucial for the broader adoption of digital credentials – that’s why we’re spending a lot of time at Northern Block building foundational infrastructure for trust registries. They provide the necessary infrastructure for trust decisions and discovery, facilitating smoother and more reliable digital interactions in various business contexts.</p>

 Navigating The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>In my last piece on this subject I explored how young people are searching for community and identity online, either through aesthetics like Cottagecore, or through economics, with things like DAOs and how, as a result, they had been captured by a brutal and isolating form of “pay-to-play tribalism”. Instead of finding the true utopian community that provides “food, fire and friends beside water” their interactions have been atomized and monetized by the neoliberal hegemony. I have thoughts on how to fix&nbsp;that….</p><p>So, how do we fix that? It’s not easy, and there are lots of inherent problems to navigate.</p><p>Let’s start with thinking about the discourse between the people running DAOs and the people running old-school incorporated cooperatives in the conventional nation state&nbsp;system.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_co-operative_movement">Cooperatives</a> have worked for centuries, at enormous and truly revolutionary scale. There was a time when so much of the British economy was going to coops that the State started to suppress them to try and maintain the existing feudal-capitalist power structure. How did coops work? Basically the administrative systems of feudal capitalism, owned by the&nbsp;people.</p><blockquote>Cooperatives have worked for centuries</blockquote><p>Now this is, I think, an important distinction. The coops were not new administrative structures. Paper records, bookkeepers, shopkeepers, money, trade — it was all the same processes — but:</p><p>1) without extractive profit&nbsp;making</p><p>2) accountable to service users, not a faceless&nbsp;Lord</p><p>So we have the same structure as the capitalism of the era in terms of the business processes but different owners. This is informative. The innovation is in power but not necessarily in process. Same processes serving different masters.</p><blockquote>We have the same structure as the capitalism but different owners</blockquote><p>This is in sharp contrast to Free Software. Free Software is why we have Linux, Wikipedia, and Open Source. It started as a revolutionary movement which stated that software users had human rights. It expressed those human rights in the form of a binding legal licence applied to software distributors</p><p>Free Software was started by the most likely deeply autistic, and slightly frightening, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. I find that he’s become scary weird as he’s aged. Stallman wrote a staggering amount of software, consulted with lawyers, and gave it away under a licence agreement which enforced human rights. Stallman’s use of software licensing to enforce human rights is a stunning creative leap. It’s the kind of constitutional brilliance on which great nations are founded. He was shivved in the back by the capitalists, who took the economics of free software and stripped rights. You know this movement as the Open Source movement. Open Source took the collective, collaborative economics of Free Software — economics intended to deliver a commons in which human rights were respected — and took out the human&nbsp;rights.</p><blockquote>We live in the shell of a dead revolution</blockquote><p>It’s worth going back and reading about the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?FreeSoftwareVsOpenSource">Free Software vs. Open Source split</a> — the personality types will be familiar to anybody from the blockchain space. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">Bitcoin / Ethereum split</a> — where Bitcoin refuses to evolve smart contracts — is kinda similar. This stuff is prehistory, but the corporate capture of Free Software, stripping out the human rights stuff, and creation of Open Source as a shallow imitation of a revolution ought to be of interest to all blockchain people.</p><p>Sounds like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),&nbsp;yes?</p><p>This stuff is the real political history of the high tech age. Richard Stallman is our Jefferson, our Gandhi. He’s the one who did the key foundational thinking about human rights in the age of technology. A lot of you have never heard of him and this is not by accident, OK?</p><blockquote>You have never heard of Richard Stallman, and this is not by&nbsp;accident</blockquote><p>So what I want to point out here is the dynamics where revolutionary cultural innovations are stripped of the elements which empower ordinary people, and then co-opted by capitalism or feudalism or whatever form power takes at the moment. Blockchain people do have this fear too. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">Elsewhere</a>, I’ve talked about the dire need to reform the blockchain and bring in ways to purge it of rampant scamming. If we don’t, that’s what will happen; everything we value about it will be stripped out and the husk co-opted by the established hegemony for uses it was never meant for and of which its originators do not&nbsp;approve.</p><p>So let’s go back to young folks and DAOs. The dream is simple: economic and cultural empowerment through new mechanisms for effective collective action. Community that really works for people. Everybody puts their money into a bucket. They vote on how the money is used. Revolutionary stuff gets done. Money flows&nbsp;back.</p><p>What DAOs have found in practice are all the same human-nature problems which plague cooperatives:</p><p>1) members are&nbsp;passive</p><p>2) managers wind up doing all the work, and getting all the power as a&nbsp;result</p><p>3) wasting other people’s money is easier than watching it&nbsp;closely</p><p>Manageable? Maybe. DAOs with seriously activist membership are theoretically possible but it’s like looking for political parties where the entire membership are actively engaged in policy debates. Rather than what we get in practice: people just show up to vote and otherwise live their life. And so we wind up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">Principal-Agent Problem</a>&nbsp;(PAP)</p><p>The people working on your behalf to manage your DAOs or coops or banks turn out to be working on their behalf not yours. They know the business better than you too, so they’re super hard to watch. Something very complicated and subtle happens here. We inject an ultra low transaction cost environment with the potential for very, very cheap audits and tight control of administrators via smart contracts into a known-difficult area of human&nbsp;affairs</p><blockquote>The managers turn out to be working on their behalf not&nbsp;yours</blockquote><p>What changes? Solution? Well, certainly not so far. The various governance and management problems of DAOs are pretty well known. The archetype is that even the well-governed and well-managed DAOs are&nbsp;either:</p><p>1) run by three people in a pub running the multisig, or</p><p>2) clueless popularity contests for&nbsp;$</p><p>This has clear parallels with all sorts of similar problems too: DAOs and holders, voters and representatives, shareholders and management, supporters and team owners, fans and record companies, and so on. Experts with power do what they can get away with; or “the people” are in charge, but clueless.</p><p>Can this problem be fixed with technology?</p><p>Efficient, transparent administration watched over by an activist population that takes the time to understand the issues and expresses their political power consistently and coherently?</p><p>Never going to happen. Not a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So now&nbsp;what?</p><p>Let me just double down on this for a moment. The Principal-Agent problem is an unsolved repeating pattern in human society from the beginning of time. DAOs simply restate that problem in a new way with new tools, but nothing about those tools presents a solution to the PAP. The blockchain presents a pretty decent solution for the CAP Theorem (a fundamental problem in distributed systems engineering) but it does not obviously present a solution to the PAP. I think we need to face this head on: we can get to the PAP in record time, but THEN&nbsp;WHAT?</p><blockquote>DAOs simply restate that problem in a new&nbsp;way</blockquote><p>Let me link to an old thread about <a href="https://x.com/leashless/status/1492888622227505153?s=61&amp;t=JS-omg-hSIjQHBCkIFYmEA">“Meditations on Moloch”</a> which looks at Moloch as the dark god of zero sum games, in particular iterated zero sum games, and why Moloch is a worse problem now than in previous ages. The perspective is that fundamentally Moloch is a thing humans have always managed to defeat by changing&nbsp;culture.</p><p>David Graber and David Wengrow looked at the archaeological and anthropological evidence for social evolution and culture change in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything">The Dawn of Everything</a> and showed we lived in large, complex, but decentralised communities for millennia and that the current centralised, capitalist, nation state is not inevitable; all kinds of other structures have worked just as well, if not better, for humans. They also found that repeatedly humans have turned their back on ways of managing communities that no longer work, reinventing structures and systems so that they suit people better, usually without violent upheaval and revolution. This is the kind of thing we need to do again, and the blockchain gives us one way of doing&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Repeatedly humans have turned their back on ways of managing communities that no longer&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>We need to look at DAOs and the rest of it in the <a href="https://x.com/leashless/status/1492896859903475717?s=61&amp;t=JS-omg-hSIjQHBCkIFYmEA%20now%20what?">context of a response</a> to a Moloch-type lock-in where the global economy is stacked by the Boomers against the young, and stacked by everybody against future generations because of climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>A simple NFT drop with no further involvement from the team gets rid of the Principal-Agent Problem by not having Agents. Each person owns their NFTs. They’re in it together, alone. Community etc. are “soft” not administrative. But if those NFTs are being used as a way of fundraising for something like a video game or a cartoon show something changes. The NFTs represent property which is made more valuable depending on the success/failure of the Agents — the owners of the brand who are continuing to work. This probably has some interesting implications for securities law down the line but I’m going to leave that can of worms to the lawyers. It’s a hard problem no-doubt. Ditto ERC20 type tokens or shitcoins: here there’s almost always a principal-agent factor, a team&nbsp;working.</p><p>DAOs have split functions.</p><p>1) They’re social anchors: people buy into the group and so will stick around. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-blockchain-save-the-young-from-themselves-0639b24b335c">People can invest in getting to know each-other.</a></p><p>2) They’re profit-making enterprises with Principal-Agent problems.</p><p>This is where they fail as social organisations, they are enabling that “pay to play tribalism” that gives the illusion of community, but in fact opens participants to rapacious exploitation. So what does it take to provide buy-in tribalism without having the Principal-Agent Problem turn into members being exploited by their administrators?</p><p>The answer would be to remove the agents from communities. Issue 200 seats or whatever. No more will be issued. No further work. You literally wind up with collectible badges: 200 seats here, 500 seats there. The seats become more valuable or useful, they change hands. But “useful” can’t refer to central services offered by administrators acting as agents for the holders. It can’t be a fundraising thing.</p><blockquote>The answer would be to remove the agents from communities</blockquote><p>Ironically I think something very clever could be done by selling seats in some kind of scheme where the proceeds of the sale are split *equally* among all the people that bought in. The folks who buy in early do better financially. Those who buy in later do worse. But 0 agents. And that approach leaves no kitty to be managed: scarcity is demonstrated on the buy-in, but after that the token’s paid for and you get your cut of the proceeds. I don’t know if that would work in practice, but it’s a way of issuing scarce badges for money without creating&nbsp;PAP.</p><p>And if the DAOs and NFTs are about creating small communities in an endless anonymous sea of the internet, maybe that function should be strictly separated from the economics of Ponzi schemes and starting investment funds together. Because binding these together is a problem. You can easily see how it happened: economic necessity, Ponziconomies, and social isolation resulting in a fusion of team-and-tribe into a Strong Bond which then just causes a ton of common PAP problems: fraud, incompetence and laziness from agents &amp; apathy from membership.</p><blockquote>Can we take the “cult” out of subculture?</blockquote><p>Because if you think it’s bad with DAOs and NFT projects, wait until you see the social fallout from failed <a href="https://protocol.com/policy/srinivasan-network-state">Network State </a>projects. It’s all the same social dynamics, but now with real estate and law in the&nbsp;mix.</p><p>I don’t mean to be a Luddite here, or anti Weird Futurist Culture, but I think we have a predictable set of problems here and “let 1000 flowers bloom” does not help when they are weeds growing on toxic brownfield soil.</p><p>The combination of social solidarity and commerce is unsafe, which takes us back to the Cooperative movement and the Labour unions. With an educated and engaged population these institutions thrived. But as people became depoliticised and disengaged, unions turned into corrupt corporations and the coops diminished into&nbsp;shops.</p><blockquote>The combination of social solidarity and commerce is&nbsp;unsafe</blockquote><p>To go forward, we need to decisively separate the commercial from the social. We need to have clear rules, we need law so that when agreements are made, their basis is clear, and so that when someone buys or sells something it is clear what is being bought and sold to and by whom. The combination of the blockchain and what we are doing at Mattereum makes this possible.</p><blockquote>We need to decisively separate the commercial from the&nbsp;social</blockquote><p>The outcome is a situation where the community building can go on independently of money games because people are no longer relying on charming and exploiting other community members to extract money from them. It puts a stop to the zero sum game, where for every winner there has to be a loser, and makes the whole space deeply unappealing for scammers. Communities are built on trust, and clear rules and fair processes build that trust. DAOs have the potential to be the basis for the kind of community people yearn for, but the governance needs to be sorted out, to separate the grift from the community and lay down the bedrock of trust on which to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to build the structures that make eradicating grift and building community possible, and we’ll keep doing it. We need a better world and if we have the power to help make that happen, we need to use&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/how-the-blockchain-can-save-the-young-from-themselves-edac3e7062bc">HOW THE BLOCKCHAIN CAN SAVE THE YOUNG (from themselves)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The age old method of keeping track of who has access to different applications is typically a spreadsheet. People on the left, and apps on the top. A new person comes or goes, and you update the spreadsheet. Easy enough, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except that your head of engineering gave Jira access to someone and forgot to tell you.</p>
<p>And then there was that time that you were on vacation and didn’t get to personally handle offboarding, so who knows what did or didn’t get deprovisioned. Oh, and of course, there’s that one contractor who just needs access to a few things — wait, are they still doing work for you?</p>
<p>Suddenly what you’re calling access management doesn’t feel reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, it’s time to ditch the spreadsheet in favor of technology that makes your life simpler. Today, we’re excited to introduce Access Grid for YeshID, the only identity and access management platform purpose-built for companies running in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>Access Grid might look like what you’re used to, but it’s much more powerful and easier to maintain. By reducing the orchestration of access management, we make it easier to be efficient and compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three reasons to ditch your spreadsheet this year.</p>
 
  A spreadsheet is static. 
 
<p>Your spreadsheet is just that — a spreadsheet. It’s simply a list you have to maintain. Your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically send an email or remind someone of a provisioning task.&nbsp; Updating a field in Access Grid, on the other hand, kicks off a workflow, allowing you to track access as it’s being granted or revoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you check a box to indicate that a user should have access to an app, a task is automatically created and assigned to the administrator of the app. Access Grid shows a grayed box, indicating that it’s still to be provisioned. Once the administrator confirms that they’ve granted access, Access Grid is automatically updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is manual. 
 
<p>Unlike with your spreadsheet, Access Grid has the ability to automatically identify <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshid-integrations-an-easier-way-to-manage-app-access-for-smbs/">users for commonly used applications</a> that YeshID is integrated with. That means you don’t have to manually input who has access to your organization’s instances of Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Depending on the size of your organization, this can save tons of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is “all you.” 
 
<p>Access Grid’s centralized workflow makes your spreadsheet a living access table — and that means it’s not solely on you to ensure it’s always current. Once you kick off that workflow, you can set, forget, and let Access Grid handle the rest. By automating requests to your internal application owners, you can take yourself out of being the middleman.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Ditch your access management spreadsheet 
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. What’s more, access management isn’t just about ensuring internal accuracy. It presents a <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2">security and compliance risk</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re ready to ditch the spreadsheet for a more <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">streamlined way to onboard/offboard</a> and a more secure way to manage app access, look no further. YeshID is <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and has a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Learn more</a>!&nbsp;</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF73 is live today, Jan 18. It concludes on Jan 25. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF73   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.

To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF73 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

<p>Identity forms the foundation of the modern workplace. Nearly every task depends on the ability to securely access systems using valid digital credentials linked to verified employees. Identity and access management (IAM) must constantly balance between security on one hand, and convenience and productivity on the other.</p>  
<p>The increasing interconnectedness and decentralization of systems, together with the surge in digital identities, are placing tremendous strain on these IAM processes, and attackers have been quick to take advantage. The past year saw regular reports of identity-related breaches, with increasingly severe consequences. Take the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">2023 hack of MGM Resorts</a> — their systems were down for ten days after hackers impersonated an employee and tricked service desk personnel into granting them access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to better understand what we can expect in 2024, the research team at Vanson Bourne surveyed IAM security leaders across the United States about the current identity security practices and pain points in their organization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Identity Challenges Abound  
<p>Our research shows that all organizations still struggle when it comes to securing their workers’ identities. The top pain point, cited by 40%, is employee <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a>/verification. Many organizations use a series of manual processes that are disconnected from their primary identity systems. Authentication comes in at a close second challenge, with 37% admitting that their authentication processes are vulnerable to phishing and credential attacks. Other top challenges include implementing continuous risk assessment and reducing authentication application sprawl, both named by 35% of organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Contend With Frequent Identity Risks  
<p>The findings show that employees engage in risky activities on a regular basis. Around seven in ten organizations (71%) report detecting risky user behavior or unexpected changes in the risk environment multiple times each week; nearly a quarter experience daily risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moreover, In all likelihood, these risk figures skew much higher. Organizations admit their visibility into identity risks remains incomplete. On average, they monitor fewer than half (49%) of their employees’ identities on a daily basis for risk or indications of compromise. This potentially leaves a large swath taking risky actions that go undetected.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Find It Difficult To Verify Employees in Real Time  
<p>More than ⅔ of organizations spend over two hours performing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a> checks when an employee needs to replace a device, when a risk is flagged by security systems or when employees change roles. In some cases the average time spent is much higher. For example it takes an average of 8.52 hours to verify identity when an employee changes roles.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Identity Fraud Is Rampant and Costly  
<p>The widespread reliance on insecure identity security solutions is leaving the door wide open to security threats, with undeniable consequences. Identity fraud is so prolific among organizations that over three quarters (77%) report falling victim multiple times within the last 12 months.</p> 
<p>Organizations are feeling the impact in their balance sheets. On average, identity fraud cost organizations an average of $4.33 million in the last 12 months.</p>

</h3>

   Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive a

<p>Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive and financial data are stored there, and yet individual users may be less vigilant with their security than in some other verticals. Once bad actors gain access to an ecommerce account, they can make purchases with the card on file, but they can also view sensitive personal data such as credit card numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Not only does this example show how an ecommerce platform can be damaged by ATO, but it also highlights how ATO is used for identity theft. Similarly, a bad actor may seek access to an online banking portal in order to transfer funds or to harvest enough PII to use elsewhere – for example, at another financial institution to apply for a loan under a stolen identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATO is a problem in most industries that do business online. The following industries are especially common targets for ATO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Financial services</p>
 
 <p>Online retail &amp; ecommerce</p>
 
 <p>Healthcare</p>
 
 <p>Social media</p>
 
 <p>Video streaming &amp; entertainment</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming</p>
 
 Utilities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common ATO Red Flags 
 &nbsp; 
 
 <p>Odd Login Behavior: Logins from new devices, new locations, new times, or anything outside of previous common behavior is considered a red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Large Number of Failed Login Attempts: When multiple login attempts occur in a short period of time, this may indicate a brute force attack, which involves repetitive attempts to “guess” a password based on minimal pieces of PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Login Spikes: Bots are commonly used to flood the system, similar to a brute force attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Account Detail Changes: If there are changes to an account’s preferred email, phone number, or security/account recovery details, especially all at once, this can indicate an ATO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Suspicious Activity: High volumes of chargebacks or purchases from new locations should be considered suspicious.

				  2024 will be a huge year for verifiable data. As the industry continues to develop, our team wanted to call some interesting trends to your attention and put together some predictions for what we think will happen this year.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>AI technology exploded in 2023, with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year">60% of organizations</a> reportedly using generative AI in some capacity. Two major categories of AI use cases are when an AI does things on a human’s behalf—such as an <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">AI assistant</a>—and when a human uses a generative AI to create things—such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT</a>, which can create written documents or images. Our team believes that as AI grows in popularity, particularly in business deployments, the need for identity integrations for both of these categories will grow with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to acting as an assistant and doing things on a user’s behalf, AI will need to be able to prove that it is authorized by a human to act on their behalf. It’s very usefulness as an assistant&nbsp; is tied to whether you can trust it with your secure information. For example, an AI that you can ask to play music for you is useful — but an AI you can trust with your credit card and ask to buy groceries, pay a bill, or even book a vacation? That is what people will pay for. To achieve this level of trust in a robot will require more security than passwords have proven they can provide; it will need mutual authentication and verifiable identity from both the user and the AI.</p>
<p>Generative AI has already caused quite a stir, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/12/30/ai-generated-art-was-a-mistake-and-heres-why/?sh=cc26b683fef3">particularly from artists</a> whose work these platforms have been trained on. While the internet has always been somewhat murky on the origins of work, the ability to give a&nbsp; computer a series of prompts and some guidelines and have it generate a visually-believable image or a plausibly correct article creates a whole new level of skepticism. This problem can also be solved by using verifiable credentials at the point of creation to record a digital “signature” that will allow anyone to check with certainty where a piece originates from and if it has been altered since that creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-Credential Systems</p>
<p>Recently, organizations have realized that there is no one “golden” credential type that fits every use case. In fact, our team has seen several platforms moving to support combinations of JSON-LD, SD-JWT, and AnonCred credentials as projects using multiple credential types gain traction. As ecosystems grow and begin to overlap, we will continue to see multiple credential types being used due to their unique benefits, not just due to competing ideas and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Will Be Folded into Existing Systems</p>
<p>Businesses have begun and will continue focusing on combining verifiable credentials with their existing systems, rather than approaching decentralized identity as an independent technology. Verifiable credentials almost always need to be paired with existing workflows to unlock the value of verified data — once you are certain of the data, then you need to do something with it. In addition, once you have established a trusted digital relationship using the inbuilt secure, bi-directional communication features, a series of other powerful use cases become possible. Some examples include mutually authenticated chat (confirm it’s a real Nigerian prince before you engage with him), faster, more secure interactions with organizations such as your bank, and a better way for employers to manage access for employees.</p>
<p>One real world application that Indicio has been working on in partnership with SITA and the Government of Aruba is verifiable credentials for travel. Using verifiable credentials as the underlying means of data transfer and authentication, travelers can store all the information they need to get through the airport quickly and efficiently, including their passports, VISAs, and boarding passes. Any of these credentials can be stored and verified with a single scan, resulting in a much faster experience at various touch points in a travel journey. And because these credentials draw on the information embedded in an official document, they eliminate the errors that inevitably occur when people are asked to fill in paper forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credentials are an integral part of the equation, many travelers will never think twice about them, and may not even realize they are using decentralized technology.&nbsp; We see this simplicity and speed driving adoption in many other industries, as they realize the time and cost savings to be gained.</p>
<p>Better Awareness of Full Ecosystems</p>
<p>Our team predicts that, as we move through 2024, more people will realize the idea of credential ecosystems as ways to unlock all the benefits&nbsp; of decentralized identity. Being able to verify the integrity of a credential is a huge step forward, but equally important is being able to verify the issuer. For example, if you have a digital driver’s license and you use it as proof of identity to take out a loan, the bank would need to trust that your driver’s license hasn’t been tampered with AND know which authority issued it. From there the bank can make the human decision of whether or not we trust that source. As we continue to build this technology, more people will realize that without a mechanism to decide if you can trust the issuer, a credential alone is insufficient</p>
<p>Organizations Will Learn That They Can Go to Production with What They Have Now</p>
<p>Many organizations have been hesitant to openly adopt this technology or go to market for a&nbsp; variety of reasons, including a feeling that the technology isn’t ready or complete and concerns about needing permission to proceed or authorization from central gatekeepers, such as governments or standards bodies. But this technology is ready right now, and is already in use today. It doesn’t require a huge lift and shift, can be rolled out at whatever scale comfortable with to start, and most importantly, it provides a better way for organizations to manage their tremendously valuable data and implement the governance of their ecosystems. In 2024 our team sees many realizing that they can move forward without the need to wait for others to solve root trust issues or grant them permission to manage their own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Overall 2024 will certainly be one to watch for decentralized identity!</p>

 Prague Land Ownership Mapping — Unearthing the Foundations of Affordability Crisis  Charting a Course for Equitable Urban Development through Data Transparency <p>This blog post on urban land ownership in Prague is the 3rd article in the <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping?source=post_page-----eb13bfbbded1--------------------------------">series</a>. The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) resulted previously in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a> and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens and&nbsp;Lisbon.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to question the importance of ownership data protection rules in the context of Europe’s rising costs of living crisis. The difficulty of access paralyses the research arena and informed public discourse on distribution of wealth and social responsibility (incl. involvement of journalists, academics, city administrations, etc.) further jeopardizing spatial justice. Ultimately, this hinders facilitation of adequate policy, law enforcement and action against exploitative practices such as property flipping, foreign investments, tax avoidance, money laundering and future responses to climate&nbsp;impacts.</p> Introduction <p>Across Czechia, housing prices rose by more than 130% between 2015–2021 (<a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=86&amp;katalog=31782&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;str=v136&amp;c=v136~8__RP2021">Czech Statistical Office</a>) and continue to do so. The average gross income, on the other hand, only grew by 40%. Today, an average Prague resident needs ca <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/presse/at-deloitte-property-index-2023.pdf">14.3</a> average gross annual salaries to buy a 70 m2 new dwelling, making Prague one of the least affordable housing markets in the EU. These numbers are even more stark if net annual salaries are considered (see: <a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=CEN13A&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=5072&amp;katalog=31782&amp;pvo=CEN13A&amp;evo=v57575_!_VUZEMI-97-100JM_1&amp;c=v57576~8__RP2021#w%5Bk%5D=metainfo&amp;w%5Bp%5D%5Brozsirene%5D=A&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bk%5D=metainfo&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bident%5D=1063971089&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpodpis%5D=ecc5422e268cdcb4faf377c61d9b8dbd&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Btyplnk%5D=INT_HODNOTAMETAINFO&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bcele%5D=IyMjLCMjIywjIzA%3D&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Breal%5D=IyMjLCMjIywjIzA%3D&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bdate%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvo%5D=CEN13A&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bverze%5D=-1&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bnahled%5D=N&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvokc%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvoch%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bhash%5D=3a0a602ba3f268f19b313ec9fe6a3ed229faebf46a7222f1228b6ce16e4e4792&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bcasrazitko%5D=a33ef07f889afac38003251fd6c74fa5115109ce3168a13b7f216160363fa94b&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bhash2%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5BudIdent%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5BpoznamkaCislo%5D=null&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bkp%5D=false&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bh%5D=">Prices</a>, <a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt-vyhledavani&amp;pvo=MZD08&amp;vyhltext=wages&amp;bkvt=d2FnZXM.&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;katalog=all&amp;c=v3~8__RP2021#w%5Bk%5D=metainfo&amp;w%5Bp%5D%5Brozsirene%5D=A&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bk%5D=metainfo&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bident%5D=979346183&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpodpis%5D=d4ad2df2b287d990741fd0ef9156fab7&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Btyplnk%5D=INT_HODNOTAMETAINFO&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bcele%5D=IyMjLCMjMA%3D%3D&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Breal%5D=IyMjLCMjMA%3D%3D&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bdate%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvo%5D=MZD08&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bverze%5D=-1&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bnahled%5D=N&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvokc%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bpvoch%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bhash%5D=766a64d08bfd35beb2452a63c20b0f2fbf7ae98e48c47aabec0ac15fc9360b14&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bcasrazitko%5D=0c901fe1ba6f1f5eff24197df18c37e8a6aa68086f5f806720fafd5b01bac96d&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bhash2%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5BudIdent%5D=&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5BpoznamkaCislo%5D=null&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bp%5D%5Bkp%5D=false&amp;w%5Bh%5D%5Bh%5D=">Gross Incomes</a>, <a href="https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/8-zivotni-podminky-kyr9ms1rg6">Net Incomes</a>) or if one looks at the <a href="https://www.sreality.cz/hledani/prodej/byty/praha?plocha-od=67&amp;plocha-do=75&amp;cena-od=6000000&amp;cena-do=7500000#x=14.424826013397222&amp;y=50.07426272657104&amp;z=12">actual current prices</a>. Even when earning high salaries, Prague residents who do not own property have been priced out from access to housing, not to mention the more vulnerable groups.</p><p>Ownership mapping in Prague started with a conversation with the <a href="https://cities4rent.journalismarena.media/">Cities for Rent: Investigating Corporate Landlords Across Europe</a> project. This initiative, coordinated by the <a href="https://journalismarena.eu/">Arena for journalism in Europe</a>, “marked the first step towards more cross-border collaborative research into the crisis of housing affordability and how it affects people’s lives”. <a href="https://www.europeanpressprize.com/people/preparatory-committee/gaby-khazalova/#:~:text=Gaby%20Khazalov%C3%A1%20%2D%20European%20Press%20Prize">Gaby Khazalová</a>, winner of the European Press prize, investigated several issues including land ownership, data transparency, housing policy flaws, sale of municipal land or <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/34054-skryte-imperium-manzelu-tykacovych">The hidden empire of the Tykač family</a> which controls over ca 350 short-term rental apartments in the centre of Prague and has linkages with tax havens (Cyprus, Bahamas and the Panama papers case). In <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">her article</a>, the author rightly points out that while the majority of attention in housing crisis debates focuses on the lack of apartments on the market for purchase or rent, “what lies beneath” is the fundamental factor shaping our cities: i.e. land ownership.

The application is intended exclusively for data viewing (plot by plot), as any acquisition or extraction of data by automated means is not&nbsp;allowed.</p><blockquote>Core institutions have limited&nbsp;access</blockquote><p>Our investigation revealed that the <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/o-nas">Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City Prague</a> (IPR Praha) — Prague’s main policy-making unit for urban architecture, planning, development, design, and administration — as well as the City of Prague itself only has partial access to the cadastral registry of land ownership.</p><p>This is because the cadastre aims to disseminate data for smaller areas, a common demand. Public entities have the privilege of accessing cadastral data pertaining to their administrative area at no cost, but its use is limited to public administration purposes and cannot be redistributed to third parties&nbsp;(IPR).</p><blockquote>All about&nbsp;money?</blockquote><p>We were informed by the cadastre office that the range and condition for CN data provision are ruled by the <a href="https://www.cuzk.cz/Predpisy/Pravni-predpisy-v-oboru-zememerictvi-a-katastru.aspx">Decree Nr 358/2013 Coll</a>. Large quantities of data can be acquired, with pricing per plot ranging between 50 Kč to 100 Kč (2–4 euro depending on level of information provided). For a dataset covering the entire city of Prague, we were quoted a figure of 931 928 Kč (ca. 38.200 EUR), a figure prohibitive for this project, but also for many researchers, journalists, and the general&nbsp;public.</p><blockquote>Prevention against automated data harvesting methods is in&nbsp;place</blockquote><p>As the <a href="https://www.cuzk.cz/">State Administration of Surveying and Cadastre</a> prohibits any form of automated data scraping we chose not to engage with this method. We, however, performed a test to what extent such an option would be technically possible. Our test revealed that data is hard to access this way, but that it is possible to check plot ownership one by one through <a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/VyberParcelu/Parcela/InformaceO">this website</a>.&nbsp;Example:</p>  Katastrální území Název/kód katastrálního území: 73012, and&nbsp;then  Parcelní číslo:&nbsp;2415/1  <p>After solving CAPTCHA which aims to prevent scraping, a list of owners should appear — in the example above we chose a site of Bubny Development.</p><p>We attempted to utilize the cadaster office’s API, developing a script with the Puppeteer JavaScript library. This script was designed to navigate the necessary webpage, complete the form, and interact with buttons. However, our progress was impeded once more due to the CAPTCHA. Even when attempting to use a headless browser to circumvent this challenge, the website failed to load without JavaScript enabled. In essence, it appears that intentional measures have been implemented to make accessing the data difficult.</p><p>With current machine learning methods, it is possible to overcome captcha, however, this method would enter clearly (dark) grey zone legal&nbsp;grounds.</p> Prague’s largest landowners <p>Revealing Prague’s largest landowners is not an easy task. We leveraged a mix of GIS analysis, a manual check of the data register, literature review and interviews. As obtaining a whole data set for Prague is beyond the budget of the project, we were only able to scratch the surface and point to major actors in the city who are widely known to local researchers and journalists. This list includes the main developers of large-scale sites, particularly:</p>  <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/project/66/bubny-zatory">Bubny Zatory</a> — CPI,&nbsp;EPH  <a href="https://www.praha3.cz/aktualne-z-trojky/o-praze-3/naucna-stezka-prahy-3/nakladove-nadrazi-zizkov/eng">Zizkov Freight Station</a> (<a href="https://www.central-group.cz/page/o-nas?jv=3">Central Group</a>, <a href="http://www.pentainvestments.com/en/default.aspx">Penta</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sekyragroup.com/">Sekyra</a>)  <a href="https://developerske-projekty.cz/projekty/letiste-letnany/">Letiště Letňany</a>&nbsp;(PPF)  <a href="https://www.sekyragroup.com/large-development-areas/smichov-city-north">Smichov City</a> (Sekyra&nbsp;Group)  <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/project/129/kyje-hute">Kyje-Hute</a> (City of&nbsp;Prague)  Vysocany (Prague 9 + private developer)  <a href="https://www.idnes.cz/praha/zpravy/letnany-avia-nova-ctvrt-byty-tramvaj-zeleznice-odien.A220816_133021_praha-zpravy_baky">Letňany</a> (Sekyra&nbsp;Group)  <a href="https://www.sekyragroup.com/large-development-areas/rohan-city-1st-phase">Rohan City</a> (Sekyra&nbsp;Group)  <a href="https://cijeurope.com/pl/pds-starts-project-preparation-for-the-change-of-urban-land-on-palmovka/post.html">Palmovka</a> (PDS — a company launched by the city three years ago to restart the development of municipal housing)  <a href="https://www.central-group.cz/lokalita/192">Tesla Hloubětín</a> (Central&nbsp;Group)  <p>This <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/projects">map</a> reveals further major urban developments.</p><p>Our investigation revealed that Prague’s largest type of landowners are:</p><p>This distribution shows that the City of Prague as well as the state still own substantial assets that, coupled with adequate policies, can be leveraged against the developments of the last decades which led to increasing unaffordability.</p><blockquote>How much and what kind of land the city has with potential for the construction of residential housing is still not fully mapped. The contribution organization Pražská developerská společnost, which is supposed to register vacant city plots and plan their development, has a certain overview. According to its representative Martin Červinka, unlike many cities in the west, Prague has relatively enough land for the next few&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>The Prague development company currently has land with the potential for the construction of six to eight thousand apartments. According to Červinka, however, it can be estimated that the city may still have land for approximately another ten to twelve thousand apartments.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">— Denik Referendum</a>, (Gaby Khazal — <a href="https://urbanjournalism.org/">Urban Journalism Network</a>)</blockquote>Fig 2.

Some of the most interesting compositions are e.g. plots larger than 5000 sqm &amp; owned by “Remaining domestic legal entities” — this means companies.

However, the lack of supply and increased demand only tell part of the&nbsp;story.</p><p>As cheap mortgages were available for years, housing became a popular investment product resulting, for example, in ca 220,000 investment flats in Prague, mostly in the historical centre. Furthermore, some of the following factors helped push homes out of reach for&nbsp;many:</p>  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/26609-restituce-privatizace-deregulace-a-politika-bydleni-je-v-troskach">housing policy which has deregulated the market</a>, leading to an increase in privatisation and commodification, coupled with recent attempts for its&nbsp;renewal  little incentive to <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/32627-mesta-v-pronajmu-delat-bytovou-politiku-znamena-zacit-sbirat-data">create accessible, coherent datasets</a> that might reveal uncomfortable truths e.g. about the concentration of&nbsp;wealth  slow bureaucracy (e.g. <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/362481530288062060-0080022018/render/EUSNDBCZLaunchFactsheetEnglish.pdf">slow construction permitting</a>) resulting in stretched planning across political cycles,  low property taxation that does not reflect the value of land (flat tax per district, i.e. in the same district tax on the most fashionable street can be the same as on the peripheral areas), as well as lack of preventative measures such as e.g. <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/08/03/pragues-housing-crisis-surfs-brownfield-wave/">dynamic property taxation</a> for owners that leave investment apartments empty or developers that leave land banks&nbsp;fallow,  little land-value capture (LVC) utilisation (<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/408eaca3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/408eaca3-en">OECD</a> classifies the developer obligations, land readjustment and strategic land management instruments of the LVC as “used rarely” in Czechia), with only the recent introduction of limited <a href="https://www.praha.eu/file/3254972/metodika_kontribuce_investoru.pdf">developer contributions</a> in forms of cash, schools, parks or other public amenities (see: Bubny-Zatory or Zizkov Freight Station brownfield developments).  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">continuous sale of municipal land</a> (albeit we can also a see positive signs of declaring a halt to those practices)  <p>These policies have reinforced the emerging global narrative which depicts city authorities as powerless in the face of developers, but this myth can be debunked through recognition of a new set of capabilities within administrations.</p><blockquote>Municipalities can recognize the power of ownership data and its usage as tools for regaining agency in city development.</blockquote><p>As European real estate prices keep rising under the prevailing economic, taxation and housing policy regimes, many urban problems call for reforms around land ownership, its leverage power, and data transparency at the EU, national and city&nbsp;levels.</p> Pledge for data transparency <p>Lack of easily accessible ownership datasets of land ownership, human-business networks and real estate transactions creates a condition where speculation can happen behind the scenes, away from the civic eyes and sense-making capabilities. In an attempt to protect individuals, GDPR data protection rules end up hiding exploitative behaviours, for example by making it impossible to reveal linkages to tax havens, uneven accumulation of wealth through the ownership multiple apartments or land sites, shell companies, and more. As a consequence, the right to land, and housing are further undermined.</p><p>Unfortunately, the European Court of Justice recently declared that the public access of registers containing information about beneficial owners of businesses breaches the right to privacy. Consequently, not just Luxembourg but also the Netherlands has restricted access to the registry of real owners following the verdict. This further sets a precedent for other member states despite having been highlighted by <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/34655-rozhovor-ztizeni-pristupu-doevropskych-registru-vlastniku-jevelky-krok-zpet">Denik Referendum</a>, journalists and experts as a significant regression in endeavours to enhance transparency and uncover unjust financial transactions.</p><p>In the Prague context, wide transparency and ease of access for all to land, real estate ownership, transaction and business register data would&nbsp;entail:</p>  ease of access for download of whole-city datasets for city administration, politicians, journalists, researchers, and eventually the general&nbsp;public.  ability to search through the register by owner’s&nbsp;name  ability to link and visualise individuals and their connections to companies and owned land (historical and&nbsp;present)  ability to show transactions.  <p>Current land registry systems are predominantly centralized with data maintained by the govenrmnet or a central authority making the system vulnerable to corruption, hacking, fraud, registration gaps. An update through a transformation of land registry to a blockchain database could alter the data governance framework and render beneficial effects. While <a href="https://journals.muni.cz/mujlt/article/view/11622">benefits and dangers</a> should be taken into consideration this idea has already numerous examples in practice (initiatives undertaken by governments in Republic of Georgia, Sweden, Ukraine, as well as Ghana, Brazil, Honduras, India and&nbsp;Japan).</p><p>All of this could play a key role in improving housing affordability by unlocking:</p>  measures to capture real estate value uplifts due to e.g. public investments, through spatial taxation (see: <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Smart-Commons-A-new-model-for-investing-in-the-commons">Smart&nbsp;Commons</a>)  progressive taxation on the among of land&nbsp;owned,  taxation of empty housing stock or multi-apartment ownership (hindering speculative behaviours)  real estate developer contributions (large and small) in exchange for usage or plugging in to the municipal assets such as heavier usage of roads, electricity grid, parking space, pressures on the water systems and infrastructure, urban green&nbsp;etc.  greater possibility of building affordable housing thanks to better overview of municipal assets and their relation to other city landowners  expansion of multiplicity of actors able to research, analyse and engage with the data (e.g. urban heat islands and climate adaptation of streets — researchers could develop models which include mostly affected citizens, owners, and tenants to inform and organize collectively towards climate adaptation, as well as whole-city retrofit, and&nbsp;more)   Necessary alliances <p>In this context, the current continuation of the aforementioned <a href="https://cities4rent.journalismarena.media/">Cities for Rent</a> initiative — the <a href="https://urbanjournalism.org/">Urban Journalism Network</a> and its project Ground Control aims to gather investigative journalists from around Europe to address land ownership issues.

Section 5 describes how v0.2 addresses the challenges of v0.1. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. About pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We released <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> when we launched Predictoor in September 2023, and have been continually improving it since then: fixing bugs, reducing onboarding friction, and adding more capabilities (eg simulation flow).</p><p>The first official release was <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0</a> on November 20, 2023; with subsequent v0.1.x releases. It is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/LICENSE">Apache V2</a>, a highly permissive open-source license.</p><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/predictoor.md">last v0.1 predictoor bot README</a>, the flow had you do simulation, then run a bot on testnet, then run a bot on mainnet. Let’s elaborate.</p><p>Simulation. You’d start simulation with a call like: python pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py. It grabs historical data, builds models, predicts, does simulated trades, then repeats, all on historical data. It logs and plots progress in real time. It would run according to default settings: what price feeds to use for AI model inputs, how much training data, etc. Those settings were hardcoded in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script. To change settings, you’d have to change the script itself, or support&nbsp;code.</p>A snippet of parameters from v0.1 <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script<p>Run a bot on testnet. First, you’d specify envvars via the terminal: your private key, envvars for network (e.g. RPC_URL), and envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER,TIMEFRAME_FILTER, SOURCE_FILTER). Then you’d run the bot with a call like:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3. It would run according to default settings. The 3meant predictoor approach #3: dynamic model building. To change predictoor settings, you’d have to change&nbsp;code.</p>Setting envvars in&nbsp;v0.1<p>Run a bot on mainnet. This was like testnet, except specifying different envvars for network and perhaps private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Any further configurations, such as what CEX data sources to use in modeling, would be hardcoded in the script. To use different values, you’d have to modify those in your local copy of the&nbsp;code.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/trader.md">last v0.1 trader bot README</a> had a similar flow to the v0.1 predictoor bot&nbsp;README.</p> 3. Challenges in pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We were — and are — proud of the v0.1 predictoor bot &amp; trader bot flows. We’d streamlined them fairly well: one could get going quickly, and accomplish what they needed to. To go further and modify parameters, one would have to jump into Python code. At first glance this might have thought this a problem; however target users (and actual users) are data scientists or developers, who have no trouble modifying code.</p><p>Yet there were a few issues. First, it was annoying to manually change code to change parameters.</p>  We could have written higher-level code that looped, and modified the parameters code at each loop iteration; however code that changes code is error-prone and can be dangerous.  Trader bots and predictoor bots had the same issue, and worse: the py code for parameter changes was scattered in a few places. Even if the scattering was fixed, the core issue would&nbsp;remain.  <p>Second, envvars didn’t have enough fidelity, and adding more would have led to an unusably high number of&nbsp;envvars.</p>  Recall that we used envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER, etc). This wasn’t enough detail for all our needs. For example, in running a predictoor bot, one couldn’t use envvars to specify the model output feed (what feed to predict) and model input price feeds, let alone non-price feeds for model&nbsp;inputs.  And, putting it into envvars would be sloppy and error-prone; if we weren’t careful, we’d have a crazy number of&nbsp;envvars.  <p>Third, a messy CLI was organically emerging.</p>  Recall, one would run a predictoor bot with a custom call directly to the script, such as:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3, where 3meant approach 3. Similar for simulation or trader&nbsp;flows.  Support for CLI-level parameters was pretty basic, only lightly tested, and was implemented on a per-script basis. Then, from our own runs of predictoor bots we were starting to do basic analytics, and a new&nbsp;./scripts/directory emerged, with each script having its own custom CLI call. Things were getting messier&nbsp;yet.  <p>Finally, we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.</p>  We have big plans for our “make $” experiments, and for these, we saw the need to extend functionality by a&nbsp;lot.  We wanted to build out a proper analytics app. We wanted to professionalize and operationalize the data pipeline, for use by simulation, the bots, and the analytics app.  We wanted to extend simulation, into a flow that supported experiments on realtime data and with the possibility of live trading. Doing this would have means even more parameters and flows; if we kept the v0.1 parameter-setting and messy CLI then complexity would become unwieldy. We needed a cleaner base before we could&nbsp;proceed.   4. Introducing pdr-backend v0.2 <p>We’re pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.2.0">pdr-backend v0.2</a>. It solves the issues above 🎉 via a good CLI, and a YAML file to set parameters. It’s live now in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend repo</a>.</p><p>The rest of this section describes the heavily-updated CLI, the YAML file, and changes to the pdr-backend architecture for a good data pipeline and analytics.</p> 4.1 Updated&nbsp;CLI <p>You get started with Predictoor like&nbsp;before:</p> git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend<br>cd pdr-backend<br>python -m venv venv # create &amp; activate virtual env't<br>source venv/bin/activate<br>pip install -r requirements.txt # install modules<br>export PATH=$PATH:. # add pwd to path <p>Then, you can type pdr to see the interface at the command-line:</p> $ pdr<br>Predictoor tool<br><br>Usage: pdr xpmt|predictoor|trader|..<br><br>Main tools:<br>  pdr xpmt PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr predictoor APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr trader APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr lake PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr claim_OCEAN PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr claim_ROSE PPSS_FILE<br><br>Utilities:<br>  pdr help<br>  pdr &lt;cmd&gt; -h<br>  pdr get_predictoors_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --PDRS<br>  pdr get_predictions_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr get_traction_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr check_network PPSS_FILE NETWORK --LOOKBACK_HOURS<br><br>Transactions are signed with envvar 'PRIVATE_KEY`.<br><br>Tools for core team:<br>  pdr trueval PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr dfbuyer PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr publisher PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr topup PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pytest, black, mypy, pylint, .. <p>There are commands to run experiments / simulation (pdr xpmt), predictoor bot (pdr predictoor), trader bot (pdr trader), and for people running predictoor bots to claim rewards (pdr claim_OCEAN, pdr claim_ROSE).</p><p>There’s a new command to fill the data lake (pdr lake), and several new analytics-related commands (pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network ). Remaining commands are typically for use by the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>To get help for a given command, just type the command without any argument&nbsp;values.</p> 4.2 New: YAML&nbsp;file <p>The default file is <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">ppss.yaml</a>. Most CLI commands take PPSS_FILE (YAML file) as an input argument. Therefore users can make their own copy from the default ppss.yaml, and modify at&nbsp;will.</p><p>The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters.</p>  To minimize confusion, there are no envvars. All parameters are in the YAML file or the CLI. One exception: PRIVATE_KEY envvar is retained because putting it in a file would have reduced security.  <p>The YAML file has a sub-section for each bot: a predictoor_ss section, a trader_ss section, etc. The web3_pp section holds info for all networks.</p><p>Below is an an example of the predictoor_ss section in the YAML file. Note how it specifies a feed to predict (predict_feed), as well as input feeds for AI modeling (aimodel_ss.input_feeds).</p> predictoor_ss:<br>  predict_feed: binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>  bot_only:<br>    s_until_epoch_end: 60 # in s. Start predicting if there's &gt; this time left<br>    stake_amount: 1 # stake this amount with each prediction. In OCEAN<br>  aimodel_ss:<br>    input_feeds:<br>      - binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>#      - binance BTC/USDT ETH/USDT BNB/USDT XRP/USDT ADA/USDT DOGE/USDT SOL/USDT LTC/USDT TRX/USDT DOT/USDT ohlcv 1h<br>#      - kraken BTC/USDT 1h<br>    max_n_train: 5000 # no. epochs to train model on<br>    autoregressive_n : 10 # no. epochs that model looks back, to predict next<br>    approach: LIN <p>Most CLI commands take NETWORK as an input argument. The YAML file holds RPC_URL and other network parameters for each network. Combining this, the NETWORK CLI argument selects from them. Therefore to wants to use a different network (e.g. testnet → mainnet), then one only needs to change the network name in the CLI. Compare this to v0.1 where several envvars needed changing. A bonus: the new setup allows convenient storage of many different network configurations (in the YAML&nbsp;file).</p><p>When the whole YAML file is read, it creates a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/ppss.py">PPSS</a> object. That object has attributes corresponding to each bot: a predictoor_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/predictoor_ss.py">PredictoorSS</a>), a trader_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/trader_ss.py">TraderSS</a>), etc. It also holds network info in its web3_pp object (of class&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/web3_pp.py">Web3PP</a>).</p> 4.3 New: Good data&nbsp;pipeline <p>We refined pdr-backend architecture to have a proper data pipeline, in new directory /lake/. It’s centered around a data lake with tiers from raw → refined. We’ve moved from storing raw price data as csv files, to <a href="https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=What%20is%20Parquet%3F,handle%20complex%20data%20in%20bulk.">parquet</a> files, because parquet supports querying without needing to have a special database layer on top (!), among other benefits.</p><p>In conjunction, we’ve moved from <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> dataframes to <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> dataframes, because Polars scales better and plays well with parquet. (We are already seeing intensive data management and expect our data needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.)</p> 4.4 New: Space to grow analytics <p>We’ve also updated pdr-backend analytics support, in the new directory /analytics/&nbsp;. First, what used to be ad-hoc scripts for analytics tools now has proper CLI support:pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network. These analytics tools now use data from the lake, and continue to be evolved. Furthermore, we are building towards a more powerful analytics app that uses python-style plotting in the browser, via streamlit.</p> 5. How pdr-backend v0.2 Fixes v0.1&nbsp;Issues <p>Here’s how v0.2 fixes each of the four issues raised&nbsp;above.</p>  Issue: Annoying to manually change code to change parameters  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters. The YAML file holds parameters that were previously envvars, or somewhere in code. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">Here’s</a> the default YAML&nbsp;file.  Issue: envvars didn’t have enough&nbsp;fidelity  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. In the YAML file, each bot gets its own subsection, including which feeds to work with. The YAML has far more fidelity because it also includes variables that were previously in&nbsp;code.  Issue: a messy CLI was organically emerging  v0.2 fix: now we have a clean CLI. Previous calls to scripts for simulation, predictoor bot, trader bot, and various analytics are all now folded into the CLI. The CLI is implemented in new directory /cli/; its core modules <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_arguments.py">cli_arguments.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_module.py">cli_module.py</a> use argparse, the best-practices CLI library for Python. The CLI has <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/tree/main/pdr_backend/cli/test">unit tests and system&nbsp;tests</a>.  Issue: we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.  v0.2 fix: YAML &amp; clean CLI give a less-complex, more flexible foundation to build from. And we’re now nicely along in our progress: as we were building v0.2, we have also refined its architecture to have a proper data pipeline (in /lake/), the beginnings of a more powerful analytics app (in /analytics/), and are about to upgrade the simulation engine for more flexible and powerful experiments.   6. Conclusion <p>With Ocean Predictoor, you can run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. With pdr-backend v0.2, the interface to use predictoor bots &amp; trader bots just got a lot simpler, via a CLI and using a YAML file for parameters. It also refactors backend code such to that we can do more powerful experiments around making&nbsp;$.</p><p>Get started at the pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">README</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Two 1.86M values is a coincidence.

  <p>There’s a plethora of data connectors for Microsoft Sentinel, from Microsoft and Azure services to third party sources and custom logs. This data is only as good as the analytical value it brings. During investigations – both proactive and reactive – visualizing data in different formats offers value into finding anomalies, patterns, and insights difficult to spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with data which includes geographic related information such as Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, visualizing the data through a proper medium is essential to making the most use of the data. This is where using interactive maps for Sentinel and Log Analytics workspace comes into play. As of the writing of this blog article, it’s not possible to use the interactive map directly within the Logs section of Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace. Instead, the Azure Data Explorer web app or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer">Kusto Explorer desktop app</a> must be used. This article will use Azure Data Explorer for all examples. The setup required for this is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to go to the <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/">Azure Data Explorer</a> web app and click on Add in the top left of the screen, and then select Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Adding connection to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, a window will appear asking for a connection. To connect to a Sentinel instance (it’s actually the Log Analytics workspace), the following information is required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Subscription ID 
 Resource group name – this is the resource group where the Log Analytics workspace is in 
 Log Analytics workspace name 
 
<p>All of these can be found simply by clicking on Settings in the Sentinel menu and then clicking Workspace settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking on Workspace settings, the information required will be available on the screen as shown below. This is also true if you’re connecting to a Log Analytics workspace without Sentinel. By going to the Log Analytics workspace’s page, the page below will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection URI needs to be in the following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://ade.loganalytics.io/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourcegroups/&lt;resource-group-name&gt;/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/&lt;workspace-name&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection URI has been updated with the required values, it can be added to the section in Azure Data Explorer, and once a display name has been entered click Add. Ensure that the Log Analytics workspace configured in the connection URI is in the tenant shown at the bottom of the window. If the Log Analytics workspace is in a tenant other than the one signed in as in Azure Data Explorer, the tenant can be switched on this screen as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Adding the connection URI to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection has been set up, it should be viewable under Connections in the left menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 A table from the newly configured connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To query the tables, select the workspace and enter the query as you would normally do in the Sentinel Logs screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 Running a query in ADX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using the interactive map 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the interactive map, the data must contain longitude and latitude data. Mapping based on country, state, or city names will not work. The format of the longitude and latitude should be in decimal degrees. This means that 41.40338 and 2.17403 will work but 41°24'12.2"N and 2°10'26.5"E will not work. Most tables in Sentinel will have geographical data in the correct format already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The render operator must be used followed by “scatterchart with (kind=map)” to generate the interactive map. There is documentation about parameters which affect <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/geospatial-visualizations">geospatial data visualizations</a>. One rule is the first two columns of the query output must be the longitude and latitude values, in that order. While the specific columns for longitude and latitude can be selected manually after running the query, it adds an extra step that’s easily skipped by ensuring the proper order of columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will take count of Entra sign ins from each location and then visualize it on an interactive map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates)
| extend Latitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["latitude"])
| extend Longitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["longitude"])
| summarize Count = count() by Longitude, Latitude
| project Longitude, Latitude, Count
| render scatterchart with (kind=map)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the map is interactive, you can zoom in and move around freely. Clicking on the objects will show the values based on the query output. In the query example above, the number of sign ins from that location were being calculated and therefore this is shown when clicked on the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running the query in the Azure Data Explorer page, a menu will appear to the right of the results. This section will allow you to change settings of the visualization of the query results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 9 Settings options on the right which allows you to configure which outputs will affect size on interactive map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible to set the circle sizes proportional to the number of sign ins (or any other numerical value that may exist in the query output). To do this, the Size section needs to be turned on by toggling the Hide toggle and then the column which will determine the size can be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of configuring the Size section can be seen below. Note how the circle sizes are now different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10 Ability to select which output determines the size of the items on the map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 11 Interactive map result of query with point sizes based on output values</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visualizing geographical data can give insights that may be difficult to find when using other visualization methods. Once a connection has been setup from Azure Data Explorer Sentinel logs such as Entra ID, sign-in logs can be queried and visualized on an interactive map, making investigations much more effective.</p>

  <p>One of the best practices for securing your organization's data is to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users the minimum level of permissions they need to perform their tasks. Microsoft Entra ID helps you apply this principle by offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">wide range of built-in roles</a> as well as allowing you to create custom roles and assign them to users or groups based on their responsibilities and access needs. You can also use Entra ID to review and revoke any role assignments that are no longer needed or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of role assignments if admin activities are not carefully audited and monitored. Routine checks of role assignments and generating alerts on new role assignments are one way to track and manage privileged role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that when a user with privileged roles is approached, they’ll say they need the role. This may be true; however, many times users will unknowingly say they need those permissions to carry out certain tasks when they could be assigned a role with lower permissions. For example, a user will be able to reset user passwords as a Global Administrator, but that does not mean they can’t do that with another role with far less permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Defining privileged permissions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#terminology">Privileged permissions in Entra ID</a> can be defined as “permissions that can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.” Entra ID roles each have a list of permissions defined to them. When an identity is granted the role, the identity also inherits the permissions defined in the role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to check the permissions of these roles. The permissions defined in all built-in roles can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">here</a>. For example, there are a few permissions that are different for the Privileged Authentication Administrator role than the Authentication Administrator role, giving the former more permissions in Entra ID. The differences between the authentication roles can be viewed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#compare-authentication-roles">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of having differences between similar roles is for the end user administration roles. The differences and nuances between these roles are outlined in detail <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auditing activity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decide if a user really needs a role, it’s crucial to monitor their activities and find the role with the least privilege that allows them to carry out their work. You’ll need Entra ID audit logs for this. Entra ID audit logs can either be sent to a Log Analytics Workspace or connected to a Sentinel instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to get the events of carried out by admin accounts. The first will make use of the IdentityInfo table, which is only available in Sentinel after enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/enable-entity-behavior-analytics">UEBA</a>). If you aren’t using UEBA in Sentinel or if you’re querying a Log Analytics Workspace, then you'll need to use the second method in the next heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Microsoft Sentinel 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ingest Entra ID audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Entra ID data connector must be enabled, and the Audit Logs must be ticked as seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Entra ID data connector in Sentinel with Audit logs enabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IdentityInfo table stores user information gathered by UEBA. Therefore, it also includes the Entra ID roles a user has been assigned. This makes it very simple to get a list of accounts that have been assigned privileged roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will give a unique list of activities an account has taken, as well as which roles the account has been assigned:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give results for all accounts that carried out tasks in Entra ID and may generate too many operations that were not privileged. To filter for specific Entra ID roles, the following query can be run where the roles are defined in a list. Three roles have been added as examples, but this list can and should be expanded to include more roles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let PrivilegedRoles = dynamic(["Global Administrator", 
                               "Security Administrator", 
                               "Compliance Administrator" 
                              ]);

                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     )

<p>Once the query is run, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant and what roles those accounts have. In the example below, the top two results don’t pose any problems. However, the third row contains a user that has the Global Administrator role and has created a service principal. The permissions needed to create a service principal can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, this user can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because there is no table that contains the roles an identity has been granted, you’ll need to add the list of users to the query and filter them. There are multiple ways to get a list of users who have been assigned a specific Entra ID role. A quick way to do this is to go to Entra ID and then select Roles and administrators. From there, select the role and export the identities that have been assigned to it. It’s important to have the User Principal Names (UPNs) of the privileged users. You’ll need to add these UPNs, along with the roles the user has, to the query. Some examples have been given in the query itself. If the user has more than one role, then all roles must be added to the query.</p>

                            tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                        )

| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, Operations, OperationsCount, Roles, ActorID 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you run the query, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant by the users you have filtered for. In the example below, the top two results can cause problems. Both have the Global Administrator role, but their operations don’t necessitate to have that role. The permissions needed for these operations can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, these users can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Actions taken by users in Entra ID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this user still requires the Global Administrator role then the Security Administrator role will become redundant as the Global Administrator contains more permissions than the Security Administrator role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping accounts with privileges that are not required is keeping your attack surface greater than it needs to be. By ingesting Entra ID Audit logs, you can query and identify users who have unnecessary and over-privileged roles. You can then find a suitable alternative role for them.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is a digital signature and how does it work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In the form of a coded message, a digital signature securely links a signer to a document in a recorded transaction. Digital signatures employ a standardized and widely accepted format known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the utmost levels of security and universal acceptance. PKI entails the use of a digital certificate for identity verification.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How do digital signature works? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Digital signatures, similar to handwritten signatures, are unique to each signer. Providers of digital signature solutions, such as InfoCert, adhere to a specific protocol known as Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. PKI mandates that the provider utilizes a mathematical algorithm to generate two long numbers, referred to as keys. One key is public, and the other is private.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a signer electronically signs a document, the signature is formed using the signer’s private key, which is securely held by the signer. The mathematical algorithm functions as a cipher, creating data that matches the signed document, known as a hash, and encrypting that data. The resulting encrypted data constitutes the digital signature. Additionally, the signature is timestamped with the time of document signing. If the document undergoes changes after signing, the digital signature becomes invalid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, John signs an agreement to sell a timeshare using her private key. The buyer receives the document along with a copy of John’s public key. If the public key cannot decrypt the signature (via the cipher used to generate the keys), it indicates that the signature either does not belong to John or has been altered since it was signed. In such cases, the signature is deemed invalid.</p><p>To uphold the integrity of the signature, PKI mandates that the keys be created, managed, and stored securely. This often involves the services of a reputable Certificate Authority (CA). Digital signature providers, like InfoCert, comply with PKI requirements to ensure secure digital signing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What’s the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A digital signature is a form of electronic signature that demands a higher level of identity verification through digital certificates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The broader category of electronic signatures (e-signatures) encompasses various types of electronic signatures. This category includes digital signatures, which represent a specific technological implementation of electronic signatures. Both digital signatures and other e-signature solutions enable the signing of documents and authentication of the signer. However, distinctions exist in terms of purpose, technical implementation, geographical usage, and the legal and cultural acceptance of digital signatures compared to other types of e-signatures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the utilization of digital signature technology for e-signatures varies significantly between countries following open, technology-neutral e-signature laws, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and those adopting tiered eSignature models favoring locally defined standards based on digital signature technology. This includes many countries in the European Union, South America, and Asia. In the European Union, governed by the eIDAS regulation, two levels of digital signatures exist: Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES).</p><p>Furthermore, certain industries also endorse specific standards rooted in digital signature technology</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Navigating the Digital Identity Landscape 
<p>While eIDAS 2.0 centers on fostering interoperability and setting standards for digital identity, the EUDI Wallet serves as a tangible tool for users, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive digital identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Electronic IDentification and trust Services Regulation, more commonly known as eIDAS, aims to create a unified digital identity framework, promoting interoperability and trust in cross-border interactions. eIDAS 2.0 represents a paradigm shift, addressing key challenges that hindered the initial eIDAS regulation's widespread adoption. Its revision was triggered by low implementation of eIDAS by European Union (EU) member states. The revised eIDAS 2.0 plans to provide private individuals a trusted and secure means of sharing verified identity and data attributes with not just public but also private services.</p>
<p>Key to the eIDAS regulation is the digital wallet, with each member state responsible for providing a digital identity wallet to every citizen who wants one. With the ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)699491">80% of EU residents using a digital identity by 2030</a>, the idea is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials. As a result, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5651">final agreement</a> on eID was reached by the European Parliament and the Council on November 8, 2023.</p>
 Things to consider 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kuppingercole-analysts-predict-verified-identitys-market-/">KuppingerCole market sizing research</a> indicates that the financial, government, and health care sectors already see the highest use of a verified digital identity to remotely onboard and enroll users. While these may be the most frequent users of verified digital identity, other industries are rapidly showing interest. This expected growth is in line with the overall growth of this segment, marked by increasing maturity of technologies, increasing adoption across a wider range of industries, and an increased use of eIDs and digital wallets. However, the true potential lies not in restricting these technologies to specific use cases but in embracing their capacity to simplify a multitude of interactions.</p>
<p>Far from being a mere tool, the EUDI Wallet could serve as a means for the adoption of digital services by providing a unified approach to identity management. From e-commerce to government processes and beyond, the EUDI Wallet and eIDAS 2.0 have the potential to integrate decentralized identity principles into existing applications and build new digital services that benefit from them. Nevertheless, ensuring security and interoperability will be challenging - especially at the massive scale of users and use cases the EU is targeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the digital identity issuance and applicability must not just be for one organization or use case – if a user has access to a verified, digital identity, they must be able to use it for many different purposes, with many different service providers in disparate industries, and even with public institutions. Therefore, solutions must be flexible and extensible: flexible to provide adjustable levels of assurance to each use case or flow, and extensible to address the increasingly complex interoperability needs and security considerations.</p>
 Reaping the benefits 
<p>The wallet's full potential extends far beyond specific use cases, encompassing its applicability in e-commerce, organizational and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/leveraging-decentralized-identity-enterprise-eic2023">enterprise settings</a>, government interactions, and more. Key components to consider when selecting the right technology mix for a digital identity solution will include high functionality with exceptional user experience. The crucial factor here is the widespread acceptance of the EUDI Wallet, which hinges on its user-friendliness, security, and global functionality. Achieving acceptance becomes feasible when the system is easier to use and seamlessly works on a global scale.</p>
<p>Done right, the economy stands to gain significantly from the simplification brought about by the EUDI Wallet. One of the primary benefits is a reduction in drop-off rates, as the streamlined and user-friendly nature of the wallet ensures a smoother process, preventing potential users from abandoning digital interactions midway. Additionally, the simplification enabled by the wallet helps reduce overall process costs. Eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and reducing in the time required for various transactions further bolster the economic benefits.</p>
<p>In essence, the key to unlocking the full potential of the EUDI Wallet lies not only in its technical capabilities, but equally in the investments made to educate users, promote transparency, and cultivate a user base that recognizes the transformative impact of digital wallets on both the personal and economic landscape. Emphasizing the versatility of the EUDI Wallet in various economic facets is critical for user adoption, which ultimately leads to a more efficient and connected economy. User education will therefore be an important part of success, as will an iterative approach.</p>

<p>Safety is core to social media. Transparency is essential to building trust in moderation efforts, and the data we are providing here is a first step towards full transparency reports. We hope these early disclosures provide some visibility into our behind the scenes operations, and we intend to deliver more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 High-Level Overview 
<p>Over the past year, the Bluesky app has grown from a handful of friends and developers to over 3 million registered accounts. We have hired and trained a full-time team of moderators, launched and iterated on several community and individual moderation features, developed and refined policies both public and internal, designed and redesigned product features to reduce abuse, and built several infrastructure components from scratch to support our Trust and Safety work.</p>
<p>We’ve made a lot of progress, and we know we still have a long way to go to deliver on the vision we set out — including <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a>, mute words, temporary account deactivation, and collaborative programs to combat misinformation (such as Community Notes). We will have more to share in coming weeks! But first here is an overview of 2023.</p>
 Reporting By The Numbers 
<p>One of the most obvious and visible forms of moderation on Bluesky is the report-and-review feedback loop. Any user can report content such as posts, accounts, or lists through the app. We then review reported content and behavior against both the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/support/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/support/tos">Terms of Service</a>, and take action when appropriate.</p>
<p>Our team of proactive and very-much-appreciated full-time moderators have provided around-the-clock coverage since spring. We’re doing things differently than a lot of social media sites, and hired our moderators directly, rather than relying on a third-party vendor. While we might use automated tools to handle reports in the future, right now every single report filed has been reviewed by humans, with no automated resolution. In 2023 we reviewed 358,165 individual reports.</p>

The report categories in this graph&nbsp; are based on the `com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonType` schema. Currently, these categories do not clearly align with the in-app copy for reports. The categories shown in-app will be updated and harmonized soon. <a>Download the raw data as a TSV file here</a>.
<p>A relatively small fraction of accounts was responsible for creating the majority of reports, and separately a small fraction of accounts received the majority of reports. In total 76,699 individual accounts (5.6% of our active users) created one or more reports, and 45,861 individual accounts (3.4% of our active users) received one or more reports (either on the overall account, or on a piece of content created by the account). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we take action on a report, our interventions have ranged from sending warning emails, to labeling, to takedowns of content or entire accounts. Takedowns can be either temporary suspensions or take effect permanently. While we used all of our interventions over the course of 2023, this post only includes a breakdown of takedowns: 4,667 accounts taken down, and an additional 1,817 individual pieces of content taken down.</p>
<p>In addition to reports from the community, we have a number of automated tools to proactively detect suspicious or harmful conduct without a user first reporting it to the moderation team, such as slurs in handles and spam accounts. Some of these tools take direct action on visual content by applying labels like "gore" to violent imagery, while others simply file automated reports for human review. Users can appeal labels applied to their account through the same in-app reporting flow, which the moderation team will then take another look at. The numbers above do not include the large volume of reports created by our own automated systems.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), is obviously unacceptable anywhere on the Internet, including Bluesky. We built AT Protocol and Bluesky to ensure we can rapidly identify and remove this content anywhere it appears on our network, even when federation becomes available in the future. To help proactively detect, take down, review, and report CSAM to the applicable authorities (including NCMEC in the United States), we partnered with an established non-profit vendor who provides both hash matching APIs and specialist web apps for review and reporting. While any instance of this behavior is dangerous and warrants prompt action, to date we have thankfully not yet encountered a significant volume of such content in the network. However, our systems proactively identified four instances of potential CSAM, of which two were statistical false-positives, and two were confirmed to meet reporting requirements and were reported to NCMEC.</p>
<p>For this report, we are not yet including counts of legal requests and the fraction of requests serviced, nor are all of our moderation actions (such as labels) fully represented in the numbers we’ve shared here. We look forward to providing more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 Interaction Controls 
<p>No amount of reactive moderation will help if the base design of a product rewards abuse or inflames inter-community conflict. In 2023, we added a number of app and protocol features that give individuals and groups more control over their interactions in the network, with the aim of building safety options into the design of Bluesky itself.</p>
<p>Moderation lists can be used for muting and blocking. Individuals can maintain curated lists of accounts for an entire community, reducing duplicated efforts. Lists themselves are always public, and the behaviors of lists match the privacy of individual-level actions: blocking a list is public, while muting a list is private. Like all technical safety features, lists have both advantages and disadvantages as a moderation primitive. They can be a vector for harassment and abuse (and thus themselves require moderation), become difficult to maintain at larger scale, and have no built-in affordances for collaborative control or accountability. On the other hand, they are relatively familiar and easy to understand, have a low barrier to adoption, and integrate easily with everyday use of the app.</p>
<p>Self-labeling of individual posts lets authors ensure appropriate content warnings are in place for viewers. This feature is currently limited to posts with visual images and adult content, but there is a clear path to expanding the scope to more labels.</p>

  
  
    The self-labeling feature.

<p>Reply controls give authors choice over who can interact in their threads, including the ability to close all replies to a post.</p>

  
  
  
      The reply controls feature.

<p>There are several more basic interaction controls in development or on the horizon. The ability to hide individual posts and to appeal labeling decisions on your own posts are both available now as beta-quality features. We are also tracking requests for the ability to mute keywords, and for users to be able to temporarily deactivate their own account. We’ll share more about these planned features in the coming months.</p>
 Supporting Tools and Infrastructure 
<p>Trust and safety efforts rely on tooling — and a lot of our work has been building the supporting tooling and infrastructure for this work from scratch. We’ve made a lot of progress in 2023 behind the scenes to support our moderation teams and policies.</p>
<p>Our moderation review tools have gone through major refactors and workflow improvements over the year, based on feedback from our moderators and policy experts. What started as a minimal admin interface can now handle tiered review queues, templated email workflows, moderation event timelines, and more. From a technical perspective, the APIs driving this system, both reporting and review, are defined the same way as other atproto endpoints, which supports interoperability with other alternative clients and workflow systems. We named the front-end interface of the moderation review system Ozone, and we plan to open-source it soon. We’re also in the process of pulling out the moderation back-end as a standalone service that other organizations can self-host.</p>

Screenshot of the Ozone web interface, from a development environment.
<p>Lastly, we have developed a rule-based automod framework to augment our moderation team when battling spam, and to proactively flag unacceptable content before it gets seen and reported by human users. This has helped identify some patterns of engagement farming and spam, and we will continue to develop and refine abuse detectors as we move towards open federation and growing the network.</p>

 Proactive Cyber Security needs TDIR 
 
<p>Organizations and society in general have become more and more dependent on IT delivered services.&nbsp; This has increased the potential impact of risks from cyber-attacks.&nbsp; Cybersecurity needs to meet this challenge by moving beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response.</p>
 Limit Attacker Free Time 
 
<p>The old model of a risk arising from a largely static threat exploiting a known vulnerability to cause damage is no longer adequate for today’s cyber environment.&nbsp; The cyber “<a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf">Kill Chain</a>” explains how threat actors are active within the cyber infrastructure well before a vulnerability is exploited.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not sufficient simply to remove known vulnerabilities - it is essential to detect cyber threat activity prior to the attack to actively prevent this from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: TDIR to Limit Attacker Free Time</p>
<p>The level of risk from cyber-attacks such as ransomware is now so high that it is a question of when not if a cyber-attack on your organization’s business critical cyber infrastructure will succeed.&nbsp; However, while most organizations have invested heavily in cyber prevention, surveys reveal that they are less well prepared to recover from a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>Authorities around the world have recognized these challenges and are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
 Threat Detection and Incident Response 
<p>All these factors taken together have led to a growing market in Threat detection and Incident Response tools and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80959/getting-ahead-of-the-cybercriminals-understanding-the-external-threat-landscape">Threat intelligence</a> – the threat actors reuse and repurpose the techniques, tools, and processes (TTPs) that they use. This makes it vital that where these are identified, this information can be securely shared amongst potential victim organizations. This information Information about threats, TTPs, and devices that adversaries employ; the systems and information that they target; and any other threat-related information that provides greater situational awareness.</p>
<p>Organizations should join the cyber threat intelligence networks relevant to their industry and location. They should also make sure that their cyber-security teams or service providers receive and share cyber threat intelligence from trusted suppliers.</p>
<p>Threat Detection – there is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80845/architecting-your-soc-to-defend-against-today-s-attack-vectors">a wide range of tools</a> that are intended to help to detect abnormal activity within and around the organizational systems. These include Security Event Information Monitoring (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR).&nbsp; In general, these tools ingest the vast amount of data logged by the various sensors around the IT infrastructure and provide capabilities to filter and analyze this data to detect anomalies.&nbsp; The challenges are the sheer volume of data and avoiding false positive overload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations should implement or outsource these activities in a way that is integrated with relevant threat intelligence.&nbsp; Look for the application of Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches to improve the detection of actual threats. Look for integration with attack path analysis and to help to prioritize the actions needed on threats detected.</p>
<p>Attack Surface Management – business applications and the cyber infrastructure upon which they depend will contain vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp; Many of these will already be known and documented as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for which there are patches or workarounds to remove them. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">Attack Surface Management tools</a> help organizations to find these vulnerabilities and together with attack path analysis tools to prioritize and close them.</p>
<p>Organizations should implement a continuous vulnerability detection and assessment process to remove known vulnerabilities. They should subscribe to and act on feeds providing newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Data Resilience – <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-resilience-is-key">data is the most important asset of the modern organization</a>, and it needs to be protected against ransomware as well as loss. Cyber adversaries use various techniques to infiltrate an organization’s IT systems and make changes that prevent the organization from accessing their data and using their IT services. Cloud services create challenges and cloud infrastructure is data defined.&nbsp; Organizations can misunderstand the shared responsibility model and believe data protection is the sole responsibility of the cloud provider.&nbsp; In addition, Big Data and massive data lakes held in cloud services create additional data resilience challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80804/cloud-backup-for-ransomware-protection">Backup and Disaster Recovery tools</a> provide important controls that are needed to recover data and restore services following cyber-attacks. Organizations need to implement and regularly these tools as part of their Business Continuity processes.</p>
<p>Incident Response - <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80209/responding-to-cyber-incidents">Organizations need a plan for managing incidents</a> and this must be prepared and tested in advance of an incident occurring. When a major incident is suspected there must be a clear process for invoking a major incident response. The key elements of this are having an incident response team who know what their roles are and that can be assembled when needed. A command structure with a clear chain of command and definition of responsibilities. A communications plan to manage communications with all those involved when and incident occurs. Recovery and restoration – the process for removing the vulnerabilities, restoring the affected systems and data, and then safely resuming their normal operation. Notification – the process for meeting your organization’s statutory obligations for notifying regulators and customers about the incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hacked-72-hours-of-a-ciso-nightmare-cre23">Organizations should retest this plan at regular intervals</a>.</p>
 Dynamic Cyber Security 
<p>Cybersecurity spending will never be able to grow as fast as attacks increase. Just trying to defend is not sufficient – organizations must get ahead of the cybercriminals and move beyond current approaches to cybersecurity by understanding the external threat landscape. Cybersecurity needs to keep up with this rapid pace of change by taking their focus beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response, to become proactive.</p>

<p>In writing the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">recent blog post</a> on W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO mdocs, I found a rat’s nest of options and choices that made understanding the landscape ridiculously challenging. When talking about verifiable credentials, you’re actually talking about a collection of format and protocol specifications that sometimes overlap. In order to understand the space, I needed to sort out several points:</p>



 
 What is a digital credential? 



 What is the difference between a format and a protocol? 



 What are the formats and protocols that are most relevant when talking about verifiable credentials? 



 How does someone decide what technology to pursue, and where do they find out more? 
 



<p>Because of the competing use cases, siloed focus, and general market politics, some of the concepts below are more of a continuum than clear distinctions from one area to the next. And that is part of why the space is so confusing. As there is no single<a href="https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/arbiter+of+good+taste"> arbiter of good taste</a> when it comes to how the Internet functions, all this confusion only gets sorted out through years of discussion, debate, testing, adoption, and evolution.</p>



 Digital Credentials 



<blockquote>
<p>A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.</p>
Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt</blockquote>



<p>To understand everything else in the world of verifiable credentials, first, you need to know what a digital credential is. Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt described it in their <a href="https://pages.scmagazine.com/rs/188-UNZ-660/images/Identiverse%202023%20-%20Verifiable%20Digital%20Credentials%20Comparison%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Emerging%20Issuance%20Protocol%20Standards%20-%206.01.pdf">Identiverse 2023 presentation</a>: “A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.” So many important words there! My translation is that a digital credential is a collection of information about a person or thing (in more generic terms, a subject) that has been packaged based on what was in a particular repository at a single point in time. How trustworthy the data is, how secure it is against tampering, all that is actually out of scope for what it is. A digital credential is the keystone to building an ecosystem; it isn’t all that interesting until we figure out how to use it.</p>



 Credential Issuance Formats and Protocols 



<blockquote>
<p>A format is a the structure of the data.</p>



<p>A protocol is how you move that data around.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you have a digital credential in a format, but you haven’t issued it to the entity that needs it, what good is it? This is where issuance formats and protocols start making verifiable credentials usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the W3C’s specifications, issuance and presentation formats are all contained within the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, described in more detail later in this post.</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OpenID4VCI, which is barely shorter than the name of the specification), is an issuance protocol. This issuance format can be used with just about any issuance format. ISO’s mdoc, W3C’s Verifiable Credentials, it’s open to most everything. The purpose of the protocol is to make sure that the credentials are transported in a standardized way. OpenID4VCI is still in draft, so it is something of a moving target for anyone not deeply embedded in the space already.</p>



<p>But OpenID4VCI isn’t the only issuance protocol under development. The&nbsp; ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 committee is working on <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/86783.html">23220-3</a> – Cards and security devices for personal identification – Building blocks for identity management via mobile devices – Part 3: Protocols and services for issuing phase. My expectation is that this work will align more closely with the mdoc/mDL work and its more restricted underlying assumptions, but I am not closely tied to the ISO efforts.</p>



<p>If you want to truly dig into the rabbit hole of comparing credential formats, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X93ptJcmfX1NZEo5E7ElnqJ-knDS4Dj6JOYSJ_2PsUw/edit#gid=1084392809">Credential Format Matrix</a> is the place to start.</p>



 Credential Presentation Formats and Protocols 



<p>Now we have the concept of a digital credential, it’s been issued, and we want to use it. That means putting it in a machine-readable format to present to something else and defining the protocols to use to get it there. There are a variety of requirements and constraints that influence what that format needs to be for any given use case.&nbsp;</p>



 W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 



<p>The W3C wants to create credential issuance and presentation formats for the web. The use cases this model supports are intended to allow for All The Things. From uber-secure data like government-issued credentials to meh-secure data like movie tickets, the W3C Verifiable Credential specification “provides a standard way to express <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.” They came out with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">official version</a> of their data model in 2022. However, specifications of this level of complexity rarely survive contact with reality. And so, people within the W3C are working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">new version</a> that will include breaking changes from the first version.</p>



<p>My “ahHA” moment when researching this came from a conversation with <a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> when I asked if the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model was a credential presentation format or credential issuance format. He said, “The issuance format is called a Verifiable Credential.&nbsp; The presentation format is called a Verifiable Presentation.”</p>



<p>The format for a W3C Verifiable Presentation credential consists of three major parts: the metadata about the credential (e.g., who issued it, when it was issued, etc.), the claims that make up the credential (the details of the entity being described), and one or more proofs (see ‘digital signatures’ below).</p>



 Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC) 



<p>According to the IETF Internet-Draft abstract, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT VC draft specification</a> “describes data formats as well as validation and processing rules to express Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads based on the Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT) format.”</p>



<p>A few things make SD-JWT VC’s format different from the W3C’s Verifiable Credential format. First and foremost is its <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-01.html#section-1.2-6">explicit mention</a> that it does not use the W3C’s data format in v1, v1.1, or the draft v2. While both are general-purpose credential formats, the W3C requires the use of JSON-LD (described below in the section on data serialization). The SD-JWT VCs, on the other hand, focus on regular JSON payloads and the SD-JWT format. Some people find the restriction of JSON-LD too much to bear, which makes the SD-JWT VC format a more appropriate option for them.</p>



 ISO mdoc 



<p>As <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> noted in a Mastodon thread, “The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.” mdoc uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), a language that can be used either the CBOR or JSON data serialization formats. mdoc is standardized in ISO/IEC’s 18013-5, a specification on the in-person presentation of mobile driving licenses (mDL). There is a very readable description of mdocs and mDLs in ENISA’s <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards/@@download/fullReport">Digital Identity Standards</a> write-up from July 2023.</p>



<p>While this format can be used for other digital credentials, its standardization in the mDL specification results in people (like me) conflating mdoc and mDL regularly. It’s hard to pinpoint <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/17167105/20211005_ISO_IEC_18013_5_INTRO_W3C_CCG.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633559852634&amp;api=v2">when standardization started</a> for mdoc; probably the best one to point to is 2014, when ISO/IEC kicked off the task force, resulting in ISO publishing 18013-5 in 2021. There is still plenty of work to do, particularly around how you’d take this credential presentation format and use it in a remote (rather than in-person) setting. That’s being covered in ISO/IEC 18013-7, still a work in progress.</p>



 Data Serialization Formats 



<p>You have a digital credential. You understand the choices you must make to decide what format it needs to be in. Now, you need the best way to transmit it to the thing that will consume it. That’s where data serialization formats come in. In the digital credential space, there are a handful that most people talk about.</p>



<p>If we’re talking more about tiny devices and digital credentials about things, then using something that focuses on keeping the format really, really efficient is critical. That’s something that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8152/">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</a> exists for. If that level of efficiency isn’t necessary and more features are required, then <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7165/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> is probably better. Whether you find <a href="https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/cbor/">one better than the other</a>, from an outside but still geeky perspective, is like arguing between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">emacs and vi</a>. If you’d like something more structured and optimized for an environment where the data pieces are related to each other (for example, all parts of a single schema), then <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD)</a> is a great choice. Complicated, or so I’m told, but great.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more! Continuing with the JSON theme, work is underway within the IETF that focuses on the selective disclosure (rather than all-or-nothing disclosure) of data in a JSON structure. That’s the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">Selective Disclosure for JSON Web Tokens </a>(SD-JWT) draft. If you’re more interested in work being developed within the European Union, the European Commission’s European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) project’s <a href="https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/ecosystem/-/blob/3f2d4283e5756c2cb0fe51119e00e496755dd0d9/drafts/sd-jws.md">EBSI Improvement Proposal (EBIP) on selective disclosure</a> might be a fit, even though it refers back to SD-JWT.</p>



<p>As individuals focus on their core use cases and the best formats to support them, they will drift apart in terms of the functionality supported and the terminology used. That, in turn, creates complications for people and organizations that need to support more than one use case that brings in more than one credential presentation format. Every additional format involves support overhead to maintain it. Wouldn’t it be better if we just … picked one?</p>



 Digital Signatures + Credentials 



<p>Now, let’s consider the security of all this. Looking at the fundamentals of security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, what is the best way to secure the presentation and transmission of a digital credential? That’s where digital signatures come in. TechTarget has an excellent article explaining digital signatures. The tl;dr of it is that digital signatures are a way to cryptographically secure one or more pieces of data such that someone (or something) can look at it later and say, “Yep, that was signed and sent by who I expected and hasn’t been changed since it was sent.”</p>



<p>That’s important information, but now there are choices to make. What exactly should be signed when it comes to digital credentials? Do you include the signature in what you’re presenting so it’s a core part of the credential, or do you put a wrapper around it like an envelope? Or both? The answer to that is, as with so many things, it depends. Do you expect all the devices to be able to handle this kind of cryptography on the fly, possibly without access to the Internet? Are the devices powerful enough to handle all the math?</p>



<p>Taking this down a slightly different dependency path, depending on what data serialization format you’re using, you’ll have another set of specifications to learn about that tells you how to sign, encrypt, and decrypt the different possible formats.</p>



<p>The IETF created the JSON-based building blocks of JSON Web Token (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA). <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/guest-post/what-are-jwt-jws-jwe-jwk-jwa/">LoginRadius</a> has a great article describing each of these and, at a high level, how they fit together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the IETF is working on similar building blocks based on CBOR, including the CBOR Web Token (CWT) rather than JSON. For those organizations more committed to a CBOR-based model, the COSE working group is where to learn more.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So much of this work is either still in draft or very early deployment. That means it is all subject to change. The descriptions of the technologies above may be lacking in several ways. My hope is that this post will help you understand where the debates are happening and the work is still in progress. If you think any of these efforts are going in the wrong direction, please engage in the conversation rather than creating Yet Another specification effort. The fragmentation in the space is not helping move this work forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is probably the least SEO-friendly post I’ve written in ages! Thanks for getting through it, and I hope it was as helpful to you as it is to me in understanding how all these parts are supposed to fit together. I encourage those more deeply involved in specification writing than I am to offer their feedback, either agreement or correction, in the post comments! It will help me learn and possibly help others as well.</p>



 But Wait, There’s More! 



<p><a href="https://mas.to/@aniltj@infosec.exchange/111760759756293917">Feedback from Anil John</a>:</p>



<p>There are two additional items missing from your formats and protocols listing:</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>It’s the start of another year and as I’m preparing for our annual sales kick off event it’s a great time to reflect on 2023 and look forward to where we are going in 2024.</p>
<p>Globally, I think it’s safe to say that 2023 was not the year that was hoped for, knock on effects from the war in Ukraine have seen inflation and interest rates rise. Beyond that we’ve seen large reductions in force across the IT sector as organisations correct their hypergrowth bets. Given all that as the backdrop we’ve had a great year in 2023, our growth continues on the same trajectory currently sitting at &gt;6x in 5 years, that certainly helps to keep our shareholders happy. &nbsp;Our profits continue to rise allowing us to power more growth in 2024.</p>
 The Organisation Identity Landscape 
<p>We’ve seen some disruption in the organisation identity landscape this year with the exit of GMEI as an accredited Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuer. This has settled down reasonably quickly and we’ve been quick to assist our customers in the consolidation of their LEI portfolios, simplifying their management and providing a more cost effective solution.</p>
<p>We have also maintained our position as number 1 in LEI Issuance and in December ‘23 we issued 28% of all new LEIs. This is a great testament to the team we have and the ‘platform’ they have created, which allows us to give best value to our LEI partners and customers.</p>
 Combining Organisation Identity &amp; Individual Identity 
<p>While we continue our mission to champion organisation identity as described by our shared vision for the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combining highly assured organisation identity with strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I explored in my last blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="The Value of Identity Context">The Value of Identity Context</a>, identity is contextual and it is critical to understand that context in a dynamic, fine-grained manner to ensure security, privacy accountability. It was great to see Gartner starting to embrace organisation identity as a discrete identity class at the 2023 IAM summit in London. We will continue discussing this important topic at the upcoming Gartner 2024 IAM summit, where we will be joined on stage by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>Our development team launched many new features into the IAM platform, both the on-premise and cloud deployments, throughout 2023. As a result we have seen a number of great successes and the growth of our existing customers. It’s a privilege to be working with them as they transition from national to international players in their respective areas. The continuing benefit and the globalisation assistance that is afforded by digital identity is clear to see.</p>
 The growing importance of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>2023 has seen an increasing awareness of the need to verify identity statements and correspondingly the increasing maturity of verifiable credentials is providing a framework to that end. We’ve seen this in our involvement in both EU Digital Identity (EUDI) and GLEIF verifiable LEI projects. vLEI especially, although early stage, is showing great potential with some significant interest from large regulators. We are seeing wider recognition of the underlying technology layer, a maturing of that layer and an increasing eco-system of supporting tooling and technology. I’d like to think we have played our part in this as we progress towards becoming a Qualified vLEI Issuer in 2024. The requirement on legal entities of having and being able to present a verifiable organisation identity will be a growing requirement by business and regulators.</p>
 Looking forward 
<p>Like everyone else, we are hopeful that the macro-economic situation will improve during 2024, we’ll know that when we see the interest rates start to drop, fingers crossed for H2-24. In the meantime, we will charge on regardless, growing our LEI footprint, becoming a qualified vLEI Issuer delivering the next evolution required to progress towards a universal implementation of our vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<p>As we all look to increase security, reduce fraud, and simplify business interactions, having the correct rights for the context you are in, driven by the organisation you are representing will become a fundamental requirement.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule has been active in the US since&nbsp;2013.  The minimum threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule comes into force in the US is&nbsp;$3000.  To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, US VASPs must verify and share customer identities, ensuring compliance with AML and CFT standards.  <p>About <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/crypto-adoption-index-statistics/">33.7 million Americans</a> own cryptocurrencies in the US, whereas the crypto ownership rate in the country is 13%. Another <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">study</a> reveals that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that about 63% of current crypto owners want to obtain more crypto, with 21% of non-owners saying the first Bitcoin ETF, which was finally approved in the US on Jan 10, 2024, makes them more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.</p><p>In light of the growing crypto adoption in the country, it is imperative to understand the regulatory aspect, especially the Crypto Travel Rule US. So, let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Background of the Crypto Regulations &amp; the FATF Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>In the US, there is no formal regulation surrounding crypto as of yet, but they are the focus of both the state and federal governments.</p><p>The Treasury Department treats Bitcoin as a currency while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally treats crypto assets as securities, and the CFTC refers to Bitcoin as a commodity. For federal income tax purposes, crypto is classified as property.</p><p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they must adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and have to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT) policies.</p><p>Then, there is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">Crypto Travel Rule</a>, which was introduced in June 2019 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog. The FATF brought cryptocurrencies under the scope of Recommendations 10 to 21 and, most importantly, Recommendation 16 — the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>It’s not as if the Travel Rule itself was conceptualized in 2019, as it has been in existence for many decades as part of the US Bank Secrecy Act to strengthen financial rules and establish communications between traditional financial institutions and law enforcement across borders. In 2012, the FATF included it as one of its Recommendations, and soon, the rest of the world also adopted the FinCEN Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>Initially, the FinCEN Travel Rule only applied to banks and required financial institutions to share information about their customers and report any suspicious activities. Then, in June 2019, it was also applied to the crypto industry to prevent illicit activities and ensure compliance with AML policies.</p><p>While the FATF doesn’t clearly explain just how virtual asset service providers (VASPs) should comply with the Travel Rule, the agency does provide general requirements.</p><p>Under the Crypto Travel Rule US, VASPs, including crypto exchanges, OTC traders, hosted wallets, crypto custodial solutions, banks, and other financial bodies, are required to share the identities of their users who are involved in virtual asset transfers exceeding a certain threshold. VASPs must obtain and verify customer identification as well as share it with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>A VASP is defined as a legal person who transfers, exchanges, or stores virtual assets or participates in or provides financial services related to virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The user information that a VASP has to share while processing crypto transactions depends on the transaction value. The Fincen Travel Rule requirements for a value below the $3,000 threshold include:</p>  The name of the sender, i.e., originator, and the recipient, i.e., beneficiary  Both the sender and recipient’s virtual asset wallet address or a unique transaction reference number  <p>If the value of virtual asset transfer exceeds $3,000, VASPs must&nbsp;collect:</p>  Originator’s name, date and place of birth, wallet address, physical address, national identity number, or customer identification number  Beneficiary’s name and wallet&nbsp;address  <p>VASPs must also carry out a counterparty VASP check to confirm that they are dealing with a registered/licensed VASP and that they have sufficient AML/CFT supervision. Moreover, VASPs also have to constantly monitor transactions in order to report any suspicious activity as part of a risk-based approach to AML and&nbsp;CTF.</p><p>VASPs must be licensed and registered in their jurisdiction. Additionally, they are required to screen customer wallets and to share any blacklists with other VASPs and relevant&nbsp;parties.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Through the Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs prevent malicious individuals and entities from using cryptocurrencies for their elaborate money laundering and terrorist financing plans.</p><p>This is achieved by requiring cryptocurrency businesses to collect and share customer information without exposing it to cybersecurity attackers while navigating its varied implementation from country to country. VASPs must also perform due diligence on beneficiary VASPs, maintain records, and report to relevant authorities.</p><p>However, the major challenge with the Crypto Travel Rule is that FATF only provides recommendations, which means it’s up to the member countries to decide whether to implement the rules and how, resulting in varying regulations.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">the United States</a> and Canada have been among the relatively early adopters of the Crypto Travel Rule, while <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the United Kingdom</a> only recently put the rule into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Not only has the enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule been at varying rates in different jurisdictions, but it is also interpreted differently and requires different information. Also, the threshold for affected transactions is different, with the FATF recommending $1,000, lower than $3,000 in the&nbsp;US.</p> Country <p>Implementation Year — Transaction Threshold</p> United States <p>2013 — $3,000</p> United Kingdom <p>2023 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Singapore <p>2020 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Japan <p>2023 — ¥100,000</p><p>To address these challenges, it’s crucial for VASPs to adopt a flexible and comprehensive approach, such as a fully automated Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>. This solution can adapt to the diverse regulatory requirements of different jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Veriscope can provide a unified platform that simplifies the process of collecting, verifying, and sharing customer information securely across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>By implementing such technology, VASPs can effectively navigate the complex landscape of international regulations like the FATF Travel Rule, maintain high standards of customer privacy and data security, and ensure compliance with the varying thresholds and requirements set by different countries.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As crypto adoption continues to grow globally, countries around the world have been ramping up their efforts to regulate the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In 2023, over 40 countries engaged in myriad initiatives to develop crypto-focused regulations and legislation — targeting licensing and listing guidance, stablecoin regulation, Travel Rule compliance, and crypto framework development.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">a PwC report</a>, the vast majority of jurisdictions are discussing the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Besides the Travel Rule, regulators are taking a range of approaches to regulate crypto with varying degrees of strictness. Some common approaches adopted include licensing and registration requirements, AML/CTF regulations, consumer protection measures, and determining the appropriate tax treatment.</p><p>In 2023, the US enforced most penalties and took strong legal action against major crypto players, including Binance and Coinbase. This is despite the fact that the country still lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework and has taken the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach. However, a lot of legislative progress is being made on crypto laws, though there remains a lack of guidance from US regulators.</p><p>This has resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape in the US, where the SEC regards crypto as securities while the CFTC regulates crypto derivatives, and FinCEN sets the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a> requirements for crypto businesses.</p><p>The European Union is all set to apply its unified regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>, to ensure financial stability, market integrity, and investor protection. The law came into force in June 2023 and is expected to apply by 2024-end. Meanwhile, the UK plans to bring a range of crypto activities within existing laws governing financial services&nbsp;firms.</p><p>While China has taken a restrictive stance towards crypto, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> recognizes them as legal assets, and India is considering a comprehensive crypto regulation framework.</p><p>Meanwhile, the likes of Singapore, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">the UAE</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> are developing robust regulatory frameworks, demonstrating a global shift towards the regulation of digital assets. This trend is exemplified by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, which has launched a registration regime for digital asset businesses. Similarly, in the Middle East, Dubai has taken a proactive step by launching VARA, or the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, to offer specific zones and guidelines for crypto&nbsp;trading.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The regulatory crypto landscape is constantly evolving, with governments around the world trying to strike a balance between taking advantage of the nascent technology &amp; encouraging innovation and protecting consumers &amp; financial stability. Here, the Crypto Travel Rule aims to play a crucial role in preventing crypto’s usage in money laundering and terrorist financing. However, complying with the Travel Rule requires guidance, a comprehensive solution like Veriscope, and collaboration with other entities and global regulators.</p><p>As the rapidly growing crypto ecosystem continues to mature, we will be seeing regulatory developments and more clarity that will shape the future of this industry.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the minimum transaction threshold for the application of the Crypto Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US? <p>In the United States, the Crypto Travel Rule comes into effect for virtual asset transfers exceeding $3,000.</p> Q2: How must US VASPs comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The US-based VASPs must comply with the FATF Travel Rule by verifying and sharing customer identities to meet anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p> Q3: Does the Crypto Travel Rule apply to all types of cryptocurrencies and transactions in the&nbsp;US? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrencies and is triggered for transactions over the specified threshold of $3,000, regardless of the type of cryptocurrency involved.</p> Q4: What are the implications of the FATF Travel Rule for individual cryptocurrency users in the&nbsp;US? <p>While the Travel Rule directly impacts VASPs, individual users may experience stricter identity verification processes and data sharing when transacting amounts over $3,000 through regulated platforms.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				  It’s only a matter of time before generative AI renders current methods of identity verification for financial transactions useless.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf">paper</a>, “Increasing Threat of DeepFake Identities,” published by United States Homeland Security put it:</p>
<p>[People have a] “natural inclination to believe what they see, and as a result deepfakes and synthetic media do not need to be particularly advanced or believable in order to be effective in spreading mis/disinformation.”</p>
<p>This paper was written two years before the long, 2023 reveal of exponential advances in commercially available generative AI technologies. The ability to deepfake reality is now spectacularly believable and the tools to do so are all easily available.</p>
<p>While the problem space for deepfakes in 2021 was the threat of political malfeasance and misrepresentation—how you could make a politician, expert or celebrity say something prejudicial or wrong—now, that space has metastasized to incorporate the daily business of “knowing your customer” —&nbsp;aka KYC.</p>
<p>KYC is critical to trust in digital banking and finance. Selfies and liveness checks using facial biometrics are used to onboard customers remotely for accounts, approvals, and transactions without the customer having to show up in person to be verified.</p>
<p>But, as TechCrunch’s Kyle Wiggers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/gen-ai-could-make-kyc-effectively-useless/?guccounter=2">recently noted</a>, an attacker using generative AI “could download a selfie of a person, edit it with generative AI tools and use the manipulated ID image to pass a KYC test.”</p>
<p>While Wiggers points out that it hasn’t happened yet (but to the best of his knowledge—right?), the article details emerging capacities that threaten to disrupt an entire layer of advanced identity and data verification tools based on images, facial biometrics, voice, and video.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@harishhacker3010/bypassing-kyc-using-deepfake-e11f0722c722">a recent post</a> on Medium, security researcher and masters student Harish SG claims to&nbsp; bypassed “multiple liveness detection and deepfake detection APIs used in several applications.”</p>
<p>At best, innovation in AI will create an arms race, with the advantage seesawing between fraud and fraud detection.</p>
<p>If images, liveness, and voice checks can all be faked with easily available tools and the right digital skill set, the impact on business, government, and social trust is potentially vast. Consider how reliant the IRS is on ID.me performing liveness checks on U.S. taxpayers. How long will it be before we see a generative AI, KYC-related scandal that will make global headlines? Given the innovation we’ve seen in 2023, it is reasonable to think in terms of months rather than years.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and KYC</p>
<p>The capacity to deepfake a liveness check completely disrupts any verification process dependent on a liveness check. One of the weakest targets is remote KYC, which will&nbsp; send customer account creation back to the pre-internet era.</p>
<p>But there is a simple fix: portable, reusable KYC — a simple, unfakeable way to prove you are who you say you are over and over again. Relying on math rather than imagery, this KYC&nbsp; can be easily shared with, and verified by, any organization that needs to know that you are who you say you are. In short, a KYC credential.¹</p>
<p>A trusted, local organization such as a bank would undertake an in-person liveness check (or a full KYC) and then issue a verifiable credential to that person attesting to having verified their identity. This credential is unique to the person and can be thought of as a container for&nbsp; holding any kind of data, including biometric data. The person can’t add to or change the data in the container without breaking the container. The container is linked to the organization that created it, and this link cannot be altered due to the use of cryptographic keys. Anyone with the right software is able to verify the origin and integrity of the container.</p>
<p>When the person needs to do KYC remotely, the organization contacted can verify that the container came from the issuing organization before interacting, and they can verify the information hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>Of course, a local bank or financial institution can also do a full KYC on their customers and issue “full” KYC credentials with all the relevant data needed for interaction with other businesses or organizations. In addition to mitigating fraud, this also saves institutions and organizations from having to do complex KYC over and over again.</p>
<p>In both cases, device binding and biometric checks bind the credential to the person’s mobile device and wallet software, preventing misuse by others, and the verifiable credential could then be used, anywhere, and in conjunction with further liveness checks to facilitate remote KYC.</p>
<p>The result is seamless identity verification and immediately actionable data. A customer can simply and quickly prove that they are who they are and wherever they are. And they get privacy-preserving features and the capacity to provide the continuous verification needed by zero trust approaches to security².</p>
<p>The inevitable threat of generative AI can only be met by adding verifiable credentials. But the good news is that verifiable credential technology is easy and quick to add to existing systems. Indicio provides a complete, award-winning solution — Indicio Proven® — including a <a href="https://indicio.tech/know-your-customer/">KYC credential</a>.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials will also be essential to releasing the full value from using AI agents to simplify and manage interactions and transactions involving analysis of personal data and integrated payments. For more on this, see our position paper, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/ai-position-paper/">A Trusted Copilot</a>, on using decentralized identity to manage an AI virtual assistant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1) Verifiable credentials are a form of decentralized identity. They enable you to verify the source of any data (using decentralized identifiers) and whether it has been tampered with (digital signatures) without having to check in with the source of the data or check in with a third-party identity provider. 
 2) For a more expansive explanation, see our <a href="https://indicio.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-identity-July-25-2023.pdf">Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>.

Generated by Microsoft Bing<p>The Tenth of January saw a landmark for the crypto industry, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) that track Bitcoin. While the SEC appears to have been rather grudging about this, primly pointing out that they remained skeptical about cryptocurrencies, it nonetheless represents a major step forward for crypto and is a sign of a maturing ecosystem, which Mattereum can only&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>So, why is this so important? Well, for a start, it is the first time in ages that the SEC has done anything remotely positive towards crypto, but more than that, it represents a further step into the financial mainstream for cryptocurrency. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> is based on the belief that there is more to the blockchain than an opportunity for grift, hype, bubbles and get-rich-quick scams; that the underlying infrastructure is sound and has huge potential for being the basis for international trade in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The ETF ruling is important because what an ETF does is allow people to invest in assets or groups of assets without having to directly purchase the assets themselves. For Bitcoin, what this means is that instead of needing to have your own digital wallet, or an account on a crypto trading platform you can invest in an ETF based on Bitcoin, run by an investment fund. This immediately widens the market to people who like the potential returns of Bitcoin investment, but who have been put off so far by either the technical requirements of buying Bitcoin themselves, or the appalling reputation for instability and outright fraud that crypto exchanges have earned. ETFs mean that people can now invest in crypto through established fund managers like Fidelity and BlackRock, plus funds can easily trade ETFs on stock exchanges, which has not been possible for crypto&nbsp;before.</p><p>While this is great, investment analysts are voicing concern about crypto ETFs. They believe these could put too much risk and volatility into Americans’ retirement accounts, given that the price of bitcoin is prone to wild fluctuations, often without warning and for reasons that are not immediately clear. Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody’s Analytics has been quoted as saying “The notorious price volatility of bitcoin&nbsp;… could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks”. This is a weakness of pure crypto as an investment vehicle, but fortunately there are other options on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>It has been clear for some time that the mature use case for the blockchain is for trading real world assets (RWA), not for running a limited currency. Bitcoin chose <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">not to evolve</a> into a system that could run smart contracts, so Ethereum (ETH) was developed to meet that need. On ETH and similar chains it is possible to tokenize and fractionize RWAs and trade them on chain. While Bitcoin ETF are definitely a step forward, they are a relatively small one in the grander scheme of things, it is on chain RWA that have the greatest potential for the future. Starting with high value assets like gold and real estate, tokenization increases liquidity and hugely simplifies what are currently complex and lengthy transactions, which will open the market in such things to far more people than the relatively niche Bitcoin ETF will. RWA have the potential to hugely smooth and accelerate international trade, which will have a far greater impact in the long term. Ultimately, I would suggest, it is investment in RWA and in tokens issued by key RWA players that will have the biggest effect over time. It is good to see Bitcoin ETF bringing crypto into the mainstream, but it will be the RWA that follow that enable the blockchain to revolutionise business going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum has worked hard and invested millions in developing unique and innovative lawtech solutions to make that possible. The <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a> maps the development of new technologies, and shows that they go through a period of rapid growth driven by hype and often disreputable actors that creates a bubble, and when this bursts, the technology goes through a period of being seen as radioactively disreputable before any underlying functionality is adopted by mature users and put to work for successful, unflashy, purposes that finally generate real value. We have seen the blockchain go through hype, boom and bust and the ETF approval is one of the first major signs that we are now moving into the next phase, where we see it being taken up by more sober users and taking its place in the financial mainstream. Mattereum sees itself as one of those&nbsp;users.</p><p>To this end, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s innovations are specifically designed to reinforce the value of RWAs by providing the missing link in the system — a means to legally tie the on-chain token representing the RWA to the physical asset itself, so that ownership can be defended in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. With this, almost any asset, physical or virtual, can be traded on chain, with both parties secure in the knowledge that ownership is clear and uncontestable. This is the revolution that is coming, and Bitcoin’s new-found respectability is paving the&nbsp;way.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETH ruling is great — but it is just a taste of what is to come with&nbsp;RWA.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETF takes crypto assets and dresses them in the clothes of tradfi financial assets: shares in a fund, where the fund owns a bunch of bitcoin. The fund shares then trade on an exchange: it’s literally an Exchange Traded&nbsp;Fund.</p><p>But in the reverse direction, Mattereum will take real world assets like gold bars and apartments — tradfi assets if you will — and dresses them in the clothes of defi financial assets: NFTs and ERC20 fractional ownership tokens.</p><p>This two way traffic between the tradfi and defi world can only benefit both worlds. Defi needs the sheer volume of the real world assets. Tradfi desperately needs transparency, openness, efficiency, and above all innovation, to better finance the world’s need for goods and services.</p><p>As defi and tradfi learn how to work together we can build a new system with the best features of&nbsp;both.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-bitcoin-etf-ruling-opens-the-doors-for-the-mainstream-blockchain-667a3d5bd403">THE BITCOIN ETF RULING OPENS THE DOORS FOR THE MAINSTREAM BLOCKCHAIN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF71 rewards. DF72 runs Jan 11 — Jan 18,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 71 (DF71) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 4, 2024 and ended 12:01am Jan 11. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF72 is live today, Jan 11. It concludes on Jan 18. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF72   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF72 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $20.5K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Jan 4, 2024: $0.4785 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.1279 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.4785 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $17,944&nbsp;USD  $0.1279 / ROSE * 20,000 ROSE = $2,558&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,944 + $2,558 = $20,502 ≈ $20.5K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

This is the perfect time for Google Workspace Super Admins to do a check to ensure they’re following <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">best practices when it comes to identity and access management</a>.</p>
<p>Unsure where to start? Here are three things you can do today.</p>
 1. Audit all apps and limit scopes where needed 
<p>OAuth is a widely used protocol for granting access to resources. OAuth also represents one of the largest surface areas for data to be unknowingly leaked is through <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">an unmanaged application through OAuth in Google Workspace</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user grants an application access to their Google Workspace data through OAuth, they may not be fully aware of the scope of access they are giving to the application, and the application may have access to more data than the user intended. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/new-from-yeshid-data-visualization-for-google-workspace-access/">a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications</a>. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
 2. Review your authentication settings 
<p>Reviewing your authentication settings to ensure they align with internal policies is paramount. We recommend you use one of these two approaches:</p>
 The traditional 2FA and strong password approach 
<p>First, enforce strong passwords that contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and are at least 12 characters long. Using a unique password for each account is important because if a hacker gains access to one password, they will not be able to use it to access your other accounts. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/passwordmanagement?journey=62">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password (usually a code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or a physical token). 2FA makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your accounts: Even if they have your password, they also need to have access to your second form of authentication in order to log in. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/2sv?journey=32">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 The more modern passwordless approach 
<p>A more secure (and easier to use) choice is to adopt the passwordless setting. It has several benefits:</p>
 
 You stop using the vulnerable password 
 You handle the two-factor requirement with a simpler user experience 
 
<p>Turn on <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/managedsettings/352555445522/passwordless">Google’s passwordless beta</a> or try <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID’s simple passwordless approach</a>.</p>
 3. Streamline your onboarding/offboarding process&nbsp; 
<p>If you’re still onboarding new users manually in Google Workspace the old way, it might be time to think about updating your process. Fortunately, that doesn’t have to mean putting weeks into procuring a tool or hiring an employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By augmenting Workspace’s hard-to-navigate console with a user-friendly dashboard and enhanced controls, YeshID <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/stepping-lightly-a-guide-to-avoiding-onboarding-and-offboarding-missteps/">makes streamlining onboarding and offboarding a breeze</a>. Scheduled workflows, flexible controls, and customizable templates help automate onboarding/offboarding and provisioning tasks, ensuring the right users have the right access at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
 It’s your year!

 The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>One of the arguments for why Octopuses have not managed to make the jump to high technology in the past few million years is that, despite being spookily intelligent, their young are free floating little sea creatures rather than being raised by parents. No way to build culture. EVERY GENERATION STARTS FROM&nbsp;ZERO.</p><blockquote>Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations.</blockquote><p>Today’s younger generations are as adrift on the internet, on the infinite seas of the information environment, as baby octopuses are in the vast depths of the open ocean. The only things which are stable reference points are archaic (religion) or capitalised (product-based identities). Equally&nbsp;abyssal.</p><p>But Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations. Some say cave paintings were used to teach younger people how to hunt! We have been at this a&nbsp;while.</p><a href="https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/">https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/</a><p>So I’m thinking again about how to handle the political disenfranchisement of young people through the blockchain, building on something <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">I wrote a while back</a>. The hopes and dreams of a better world where people have individual agency and great collective power are deep-rooted in blockchain culture. Can we deliver that&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I believe we can but it needs some careful cultural thinking about how young people got so screwed over by the economy and socially atomized, and what might be needed to fix it. It’s all about “frontier” and getting away from incumbents to places where it’s genuinely possible to create something.</p><p>Also humans live a really, really long time which means you can have me — a Gen X “90s kid” — tell you what I think about the situation. In contrast Octopuses only live about five years so their elders are pre-school. But in the 1990s we had almost exactly the same obsessions that the current generation has and my hope is that we can help you find a way&nbsp;fowards.</p><p>Does any of this look familiar? Hell we’re even fighting the same companies.</p><p><a href="https://www.trippingly.net/burning-man-musings/burning-man-1996">Burning Man 1996: Helco - Trippingly</a></p><p>Can we deliver the&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I was part of an internet community in the early 1990s. People all over the world. Our symbol? A simple “@“ because nobody else had a cultural identity as an email&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just think about that for a second. You’re driving around in some suburb looking for your friend’s house, that you only know from the internet, and you pass a mailbox with an “@“ symbol printed on a piece of paper and taped to the outside of the mailbox. “Internet People Here”. It’s like seeing the Bitcoin logo on a shop, or the Ethereum logo on a conference.</p><p>You know that in this place you’re part of The&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Go back to the age of rail and there were <a href="https://popularmechanics.com/technology/a25174860/hobo-code/">Hobo Code symbols</a>. The “@“ symbol was our technomad code. “Internet People&nbsp;Here”.</p><p>That’s 30 years ago. It’s as distant from 2023 as the 1960s were for us in the 1990s. It’s an entire world&nbsp;away.</p><p>Fashion used to play the same role. Subcultural branding and tagging and identity all woven together. You’ve seen these guys? London in the 1980s had one of the most extreme fashion subcultures ever seen. That version of punk was expensive in money and opportunity costs. Social&nbsp;proof!</p><p>The people that paid that cost were in it together against the world — out-in&nbsp;group.</p><p>Of course, with those people it&nbsp;was:</p><p>Today, by and large, young people are not responding like this; it is notable that in the 21st century the thriving ferment of street subcultures has largely died out except as nostalgia trends (although, even then, no one has brought back<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/30/big-quiffs-zombies-and-dead-crows-the-wild-world-of-psychobilly"> psychobilly</a> — no one should bring back psychobilly).</p><p>So now everybody’s on the internet. Young people who skipped college are sitting around at home trading crypto in their teens, and then moving to Singapore for tax reasons in their 20s (or whatever). In an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR187jpNODAxVTpycCHZNtAngQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1C5A1iHCmD1C2gAcAB4AIABY4gBngSSAQE2mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=AsyeZZHOKNPOnsEPk9uJwAc&amp;bih=751&amp;biw=1314&amp;client=safari">infinite sea of faces</a>, who are your people? Who do you invest in knowing? And I do mean “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a19712238/how-many-hours-best-friends/">invest in knowing</a>” — relationship building takes time, and young people invest in it very, very,&nbsp;hard.</p><blockquote>Who do you invest in&nbsp;knowing?</blockquote><p>Today, while young people still deal with this through <a href="https://youtu.be/ti4PGYISY44?si=6l0tcL5F96xQLu9G">aesthetics</a>, these are wider ranging and more diffuse than just clothing, and they do it through social media. Let’s talk social media’s “aesthetic” obsession. From <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cottagecore">Cottagecore</a> to <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Academia">Dark Academia</a>, what does social media’s obsession with creating aesthetics say about us? And why is it such a problem? The aesthetic subcultures folks follow “alpha” (information) flows, and you need money to buy in. You become a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti4PGYISY44&amp;t=89s">VSCO girl</a>” or go “Cottagecore” and it costs you a few dozen hours of analysis and a few thousand dollars of purchases. Now you look like Those Other People. Outside of college campuses etc. the Cottagecore Community doesn’t really meet in reality. This is all online. It’s much the same economic cost as buying into a mid-price NFT project. It’s almost like we’re all trying to anchor in the enormous full emptiness of the internet.</p><p>You can see the same thing in the photography “community” — all the Fuji buyers making “film like” into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKk3MlP9ypk">thing</a>, while the Nikon buyers are showing off their P1000 shots of birds feeding their babies 4.5km away with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sM7882GmuRg">superzoom</a> goodness. It’s markets being used as community mediums. Buy this product to find your&nbsp;people.</p><p>Other people anchor through economics. I think that the heavy slant of the blockchain space towards libertarianism, autism, Asperger’s, Nerd Culture, and the general social blunting that comes with working with machines (I could hardly talk when I was a computer graphics engineer) is partly responsible for this. Crypto-socio-economics — binding people together with economically shared incentives through things like NFTs or DAOs is a nerd response to living in an atomized society. — with people for whom aesthetics don’t appeal, economics may do the job of bringing people together.</p><blockquote>Other people anchor through economics</blockquote><p>So I think what’s happening in the NFT space, and to a limited degree in stuff like L2 chains or crappy little L1s, is a similar kind of social anchoring. “You’ve got $20,000 of Dogecoin? Well we’re 100% on the same team. Go Doge!” Because otherwise people just drift away online. There’s no cost to leaving the community so people do, often silently.</p><p>The only way we know how to answer the question of “who are you?” Is socially.</p><p>Family names. “John of Sudbury”. “Joe Baker”. Given names. I travelled all over America in the 1990s on “@“. The story of “who am I?” was tightly coupled to the social technology of the day: email lists. I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto projects, particularly DAOs and NFT communities. Now that I’m seeing this head-on, it all makes so much more sense. A single framework with aesthetic and “<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/core-words-cottagecore/">-core</a>” cultures, NFTs and DAOs together. This also neatly explains the early adopter communities on Twitter, Instagram and, earlier than that, Flickr (really the first social network for people that made images rather than writing as a way of expressing their identity) — influencers as social leaders: reference point organisers. In ancient times this was one of the functions of soap operas: people who worked in the same office but lived in different communities could gossip about people they both “knew” outside of the workplace, those being the cast of Friends etc — Yes, I know this sounds incredibly dumb. But 30 years ago (!) there were academic publications as people discovered this phenomena!</p><a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf">https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf</a> Who’s writing the equivalent paper today about&nbsp;NFTs?<p>I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto&nbsp;projects</p><p>So the idea that what we have is <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/history-co-operative-movement#:~:text=In%201844%20the%20Rochdale%20Pioneers,surplus%20to%20benefit%20the%20community.">economic responses to social atomization</a> is not a new one but I’m seeing it in a new way because I’ve got it from two sides right now: “aesthetic” culture from YouTube etc. and NFT/DAO from&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>This is almost gendered, women and men.&nbsp;Almost.</p><p>As we have transformed our physical and social environment further and further from the environment that we evolved in, it becomes harder and harder for us to find the true happiness which is harmony between our own nature and nature itself. We love dogs and BBQs beside water. No form of happiness is more universal than a few families and friends gathering to grill food on a beach or by a lake. That’s where we evolved. That’s our native environment at its&nbsp;best.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Food, fire and friends beside&nbsp;water.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Friends, dogs, and faint wood smoke</a></p><p>Ape Utopia.</p><p>That’s what people are seeking in these internet cultures, but are they finding&nbsp;it?</p><p>Once, in the ’90s, when the internet was young, we did this with mailing lists and newsgroups, we had little social communities where like-minded people found each other and generated whole new friendship groups that didn’t rely on geography or finding the right pub. There’s even an archived list of all the “<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/UXU/UXU-148.TXT">cyberpunk</a>” email lists from the 1990s. Isn’t that amazing? It was all DIY and profoundly uncommercial. but this was basically commodified and destroyed by social media that first co-opted it, then corrupted it by filtering the messages and monetising the interactions, so the groups no longer felt like&nbsp;“home”.</p><blockquote>This was commodified and destroyed by social&nbsp;media</blockquote><p>You can see why an entire generation of innovators latched on to crypto because it seemed like it could, in theory, reinvent that uncommercial sense of online community by owning the commercial aspects collectively, and then offer social solidarity at the “tribal” and potentially even the “municipal” level through larger projects like Ethereum.</p><p>Ethereum Nation.</p><p>But it’s all stretched. We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse. The people who own the same NFTs as you do might be too far away and too alien to babysit your kids. The core biological reality of our lives is only very slightly improved by online community. Life still happens in the real world and this is what’s producing the crazy addictive (often life damaging) effects: it doesn’t matter how much you drink wine if what you need is coffee. The strongest online communities are still only reflections and shadows of “food, fire and friends beside water.” Social media does not give people what they actually need. That’s why we keep scrolling.</p><blockquote>We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse</blockquote><p>People are growing up untethered: fashion doesn’t indicate identity when you can drop $200 at Shein and walk out with an entirely new wardrobe. There’s no social cost to weird hair. There’s no geographic binding after high school really. The idea that what we have is a set of broad pathologies based on the conditions of internet atomization resulting in community inclusion being mediated by products, in other words you have to buy your friends, is fucking brutal. I’ve heard it before, but only understood it for myself now; it is a desperate position for a social monkey to find itself&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>Community inclusion being mediated by products is fucking&nbsp;brutal</blockquote><p>This is not the utopia you are seeking — it’s “pay to play tribalism”. This is unfortunate. You can see the perfect opportunity for people being exploited: you want to join a tribe and get to know people. You want to make money. The two impulses are joined in the DAO structure: a community you buy into. It’s a little bit like having a cult with elected leadership, or a multi-level marketing scheme which is owned by the members. The social dynamics are very similar to both cults and MLMs. The social dynamics fuse capitalism and society in a new and probably kinda dangerous way.</p><blockquote>It’s “pay to play tribalism”</blockquote><p>Clearly there’s a social binding force — but with that come problems. The combination of social solidarity and commerce is unsafe. We cannot make an atomized population powerful with either shallow social organisation or technology. To save the world — and here I’m thinking climate change — we need the most profound de-atomization imaginable (or maybe geoengineering).</p><p>We’re in a&nbsp;maze.</p><p>We’re building technologies without the end goal in sight. What people want at a shallow advertising-driven level and what people need at a “my life is whole and makes sense to me” level are way different. Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your sister. And this is the fundamental challenge of the “real world assets” phase of Ethereum. OK, now we can handle real estate on the blockchain in tokenized form. We really can:<a href="http://mattereum.com/land"> http://mattereum.com/land</a> is a real deal and there’s <a href="https://swarm.com/swarm-partners-with-mattereum-to-securitise-real-world-assets-on-chain/">way more</a>&nbsp;coming.</p><blockquote>Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your&nbsp;sister</blockquote><p>But can we solve the social problems too? We’re already seeing the broad outlines of this attempt: Network States are “crypto communities do real estate” with kinda strange Silicon Valley logic&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Once you tease out the projects that are the Silicon Valley equivalent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement">Sovereign Citizen</a> play (i.e. opting out of existing nation state structures to avoid tax and law, while still physically living in the state) what they are is electronic communities organised around money rather than community: the people grew up atomized: never felt community. We get regular pings from people with ambitions of doing community land projects and building physical settlements with crypto finance as an integral part of the start up plan, often with community governance done using DAOs or other crypto voting&nbsp;methods.</p><p>People are reaching.</p><p>This is really the&nbsp;key.</p><p>If we’re going to ship large-scale community-oriented real estate development projects that actually deliver “food, fire and friends beside water” at scale we’re going to need to figure out the sociological issues which have made modern community so hard. Winding up a Network State that failed is going to be much harder than winding up a company or shuttering a community.</p><p>People think they want tokenized real estate. They need community. They won’t be happy with tokenized real estate unless it delivers community.</p><p>That is part of why there is so much interest in DAOs and Network States. People want to be reconnected to each other. That’s the fundamental human drive at the heart of all of this. Yes, professional real estate clients want faster transactions and so on. Yes, Mattereum can deliver that. But their clients want community. The enormous cultural push towards de-atomizing society and returning to interconnected forms is unstoppable: it is human nature returning to being human after centuries of industrial oppression.</p><p>Post-industrial society is like post-war society: an attempt to return to&nbsp;peace.</p><blockquote>Professional real estate clients want faster transactions but their clients want community</blockquote><p>As we move down the pathway towards tokenized community real estate projects, whether they be Network States or start-up villages or just plain old electronic communes, we’re going to wind up having to try and bring wisdom about community, not just the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> legals.</p><p>It’s not like I haven’t lived in communities and studied them in detail for more than 30&nbsp;years.</p><p>I do have grounded opinions about how to do this, and I think if we invested in researchers and worked closely with clients we could actually deliver functional community templates. And that is, after all, probably the highest good that <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> can deliver to retail customers: better arrangements for buying their houses and managing shared assets with their neighbours.</p><blockquote>The highest good that Mattereum can deliver: better arrangements for buying houses and managing shared&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>Professional finance needs precision and efficiency. But homeowners need warm relations. Bad governance and bad finance produce stone cold grinding poverty: Homeowners Associations and sharecropping. If we actually go into this tokenized real estate thing with a clear sense of the end goals in mind it might be a lot easier than we think: nobody’s tried with lawyers. “Good fences make good neighbours”, and a contract is nothing but a fence of written words. The legal structures are all there: there’s no reason for Homeowners Associations to be terrible.</p><p>There’s no reason shared ownership has to be predatory. Societies do not have to be the way they are; we can change&nbsp;them.</p><p>So — what does this all mean? Well, my parents’ generation were part of the post-war economic boom. The economy was buoyant and everyone, whatever their income was, floated up on the tide. Until, basically, the 1980s; Thatcher, Reagan and neo-liberal economics, which, as a matter of policy, was “every person for themselves” — there’s no such thing as society. Those who had money were able to leverage more at the expense of those with less, because money translates to power, allowing them to become obscenely rich while everyone else’s income stagnated.

Young people today are priced out of owning a house, or even stably renting one, there’s no expectation of long-term jobs or even a single career through your working life, let alone staying in the same place. But they still want “food, fire and friends beside water” (and also cats) and where they are looking for it is online, but the neo-liberals got there first and have commodified, monetized and corrupted the will for online community, so they end up basically with “pay-to-play” friends. Is it any wonder people are starting to have romantic relationships with AI Chatbots? The blockchain offers a way round that, a means to create a self-generated trusted community, to build structures that are egalitarian, supportive and nurturing through DAOs and similar. To do this needs more than good will, it needs law, it needs appropriate fences to keep out the thieves, scammers and profiteers. The current global operating system is broken, its head has been severed and it is running on reflexes, not quite aware it is dead yet. Politicians pull the levers and wonder why they no longer work, resorting to “dead cat” distractions to hide the fact they have no functioning policies.</p><p>Nettles need to be grasped and the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem</a> needs to take&nbsp;form.</p><p>There are ways forward.

<p>ID Document Verification was introduced to solve many of the issues that raise from services that require higher levels of authentication. Certain services require more reliable authentication methods, which offers higher assurance of the user’s identity. However, this can cause issues, especially for users of different nationalities. Lower-level authentication methods can often be used by all users regardless of their country of origin, whereas in the case of higher-level methods, it is not always the case. However, with the use of ID Document Verification it becomes easier for all users to prove their identity. In this blog, I will explore the basics surrounding ID Document Verification and some of the main features that support these solutions.</p>
 What is ID Document Verification? 
<p>The basic concept is that – instead of using a &nbsp;user ID and password to sign into an eService, I identify myself by scanning my identity document and taking a selfie or a video clip to prove who I am. I can scan the document by taking a picture of it according to instructions given by the service provider. The service uses different highly sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) driven technologies to verify that the person in the picture or a video matches the one shown in the document.</p>
<p>There are several ID Document Verification service providers in the markets and as you can imagine there are some differences in the principles of how these services function. You might be interested to know how many different countries are supported by the solution, which ID documents are accepted, whether is there a need to install an app, is ID Document chip scanning supported, where is the ID document information stored, what type of fraud detection systems the solution uses and what is the price per authentication transaction, especially during the initial registration.</p>
<p>The most common ID documents accepted by these services are driver’s licenses, national ID cards and passports but depending on the country I am from there can be over ten different documents including residence permits and work permits among others that I can use to prove my identity. Depending on the service provider I can scan the identity documents using a web browser-based or app-based user interface. The result is the same, after the initial ID document scanning procedure I get access to the eService. But what happens when I want to access the same eService again?</p>
<p>The benefit of a browser-based version is that I don’t have to install a new app on my smart device. Generally, it can be a good solution for a one-time authentication. However, if the goal is to reuse my identity again without re-registration, then my ID document information must be sent to the service provider’s servers. Even though the information is stored in an encrypted format, many users do not necessarily like the idea that non-governmental 3rd party operator stores this kind of information in their servers.</p>
<p>The benefit of an app-based solution is that it provides me with the possibility to store the scanned identity document information in an encrypted format on my smart device. I have the option to remove this information at any point I want. However, many eService providers do not want to ask their customers to install additional apps on their smart devices.</p>
 How reliable is the ID Document Verification? 
<p>Can ID Document Verification methods be considered strong authentication methods? Often, strong authentication methods utilise at least two factors from the list of something the user knows (e.g. password, pin code, answer to a security question), something the user has (e.g. security token, digital certificate, an ID card, a &nbsp;phone with a built-in hardware token, software token), and something the user is (e.g. typically biometrics such as fingerprint, iris scan, vein scan etc.).</p>
<p>ID Document Verification uses a variety of AI-driven fraud detection mechanisms, such as face matching to confirm that the person who took the selfie or a video is the same as on the document. Texture analysis makes sure that the pictures or videos are genuine and not copies. In addition, features such as audio processing, face tracking and mouth tracking – where they have to say some specific words, turn my head, blink my eyes etc. – can be utilised to further verify that we have the right person trying to access the service. And if the algorithm is still not sure if it is the right person, some solutions provide an option to ask a trained employee to verify the user and make the final decision. From this perspective, we can say that ID Document Verification Authentication methods can provide strong authentication.</p>
<p>However, as an example, in Finland the official strong authentication methods include BankID, national ID cards (requires a card reader) and Mobile PKI (Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish). These methods have gone through a complex certification process to prove the maturity of the solution. This is indicated by using a Level of Assurance (LoA) levels. LoA levels use the international 4-step scale and the EU 3-step scale in parallel in the following way:</p>



International scale
EU scale
Notes


LoA 1
Not used
(EU uses 3-step scale)


LoA 2
eIDAS Low



LoA 3
eIDAS Substantial
BankID, Mobile PKI


LoA 4
eIDAS High
National Identity Card



<p>eIDAS = Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services</p>
<p>Since ID Document Verification method vendors are private companies, they do not have such LoA certifications. From a security point of view, it is important to make sure that the vendor follows the latest developments in the standards and technology used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>Also, it is good to notice that in some European countries, it is possible to open a bank account online using ID Document Verification authentication, indicating that these banks trust their selected vendor’s solution – which is a noteworthy seal of approval.</p>
<p>One way to improve the reliability of the scanning procedure is to scan the microchip in the ID Document. The chips inside of passports and national ID cards include user-specific certificates that are very difficult to forge, thus they can be used to increase the reliability of the document verification procedure. To do this, I have to make sure I have an NFC (Near-Field Communication) chip in my smart device. In addition, some solutions can run backend queries to external databases to validate documents’ ID attributes and execute fraud evaluation against fraud databases.</p>
 Which services can use Identity Document Verification? 
<p>While ID Document Verification authentication methods have often been used in banking services, there are also many other services where they are very useful. This is especially useful where the eService requires a higher assurance of identity verification but the users cannot use the official strong authentication methods of the given country.</p>
<p>One good example of this is the universities. Very often these educational institutes have foreign students and teachers who need to authenticate themselves to access the university eServices to attend online lectures, examinations etc. Username and password methods are just not strong enough in these cases, but reliable online authentication methods are not available. This type of issue can be solved with ID Document Verification Authentication. Notice that the new European Digital Identity (EUDI), which is a part of the eIDAS regulation will allow EU-level cross-border strong authentication services. It will solve this issue for people who have EU-level digital identities. Read more about it here: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/">https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/</a></p>
<p>In addition, several other eServices can use ID Document Verification for more convenient, passwordless authentication. Instead of writing my username and password I can just take a selfie (biometric facial recognition) or scan a QR code to access the service. Also, if the service has a password, I could reset it by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Integrating an ID Document Verification Authentication service with a CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution such as Ubisecure’s Identity Platform makes the onboarding of new users frictionless. This type of solution can utilise the registration form autofill feature during the initial phase of the procedure. Many of the required attributes can be scanned directly from the ID document, thus users do not have to type them in manually.</p>
<p>The integration procedure can be established using the tools provided by the CIAM system. If the ID Document Verification Authentication service supports standard authentication protocols, such as SAML or OIDC, then it is a very straightforward procedure. If the service uses proprietary APIs, then a separate adapter needs to be created to establish communication between the CIAM and the service. This type of solution allows you to easily take the ID Document Verification Authentication service to use for all of your eServices with just a few mouse clicks.</p>
 Pros and cons of ID Document Verification 
<p>Below, I have listed some positives and negatives of the ID Document Verification Authentication services. It is good to remember that the solutions vary between different vendors. So, depending on your needs you can choose a vendor that fulfils your requirements.</p>



Positives
Negatives


+ International authentication method, not limited to one national ID
– Chip scanning requires a phone with NFC functionality


+ Passwordless authentication utilising:<p></p>
<p>+ QR-codes</p>
<p>+ Selfies</p>
<p>+ Videos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial registration can sometimes be cumbersome


+ Difficult to forge (especially the methods based on chip scanning)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Not all countries have centralised registries for attribute verification<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Possibility to confirm scanned information from external registries<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Cannot cover 100% of customers. Some manual customer service processes still required for certain users<p></p>
<p>– The service can cover a maximum of just over 200 countries at best (depending on the service&nbsp; provider)</p>
<p>– Not all users have the smart devices required available</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the documents required</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the know-how to complete the registration process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ The possibility of doing a password reset using a recheck of a selfie or a video<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial authentication can be a bit expensive (for the eService provider)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Frictionless onboarding of new customers with registration form auto-filling when combined with CIAM<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Some solutions require the user’s ID Document information to be stored in an external DBs<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Good for services that are subject to stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) requirements.
– There can be differing levels of accuracy different skin tones, genders and ages, enquire with your vendor about bias mitigation.

<p>As we have seen, the official strong authentication methods are usually national-level solutions. Even with the EUDI service, we can offer only EU-level solutions for the problem. The ID Document Verification Authentication services can offer an option for strong authentication for global users. In addition, it can simplify the onboarding processes and provide passwordless sign-in to eServices. Its AI-powered biometric identification engines for facial recognition and anti-spoofing technologies make it a safe option for a variety of eServices.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how a small piece of plastic could be your key to enhanced security and operational efficiency? This article dives into the intricacies of smart card technology, a robust solution in an era increasingly plagued by security breaches and data leaks. You’ll understand what intelligent cards are, how they function, and why their advanced authentication methods are becoming indispensable in various sectors. By the end of this read, you’ll be well-equipped to make informed decisions on integrating this technology into your security infrastructure.</p>
 
Basics of Smart Cards 
 
What is a Smart Card? 
<p>A smart card is a physical card that contains an embedded integrated circuit or chip. This chip can be either a secure microcontroller or an equivalent intelligent device with internal memory or microprocessor components.<br>
Smart cards are often used for personal identification numbers, authentication, data storage, and other applications like secure transactions. They can communicate with readers through direct physical contact or remote connections using contactless radio frequency (RFID) technology.</p>
<p>The utility of smart cards extends across multiple sectors, including banking, healthcare, transportation, and secure access control systems. These cards serve as a secure, portable platform that can perform various functions depending on the programmed data and the applications in which they are used.</p>
 
Types of Smart Cards 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are generally three types of smart cards: contact cards, contactless cards, and hybrid cards. Contact intelligent cards require physical contact with a reader to function. They are commonly used in ATM transactions, secure computer logins, and point-of-sale systems.<br>
On the other hand, contactless hybrid intelligent cards or cards use radio frequency to communicate with the card reader without direct contact. These are often used in public transportation, access control, and quick payment services.<br>
Hybrid cards combine features of both contact and contactless cards. They contain two chips, one for contact operations and another for contactless operations, providing versatility to the user and the systems they interact with.<br>
They are often used in multifunctional systems that require both types of functionality, such as a driver’s license or university ID card that also serves as a payment and access control card.</p>
 
Components of a Smart Card 
<p></p>
<p>Smart cards typically have a microprocessor or memory chip embedded in a plastic card. The chip has an operating system that manages data and provides security features, including cryptographic algorithms.<br>
Smart cards also possess a storage area for data, including personal information, cryptographic keys, or funds for transactional purposes.<br>
The physical form factor of the card can vary. Standard size resembles a typical credit card but can come in other shapes and sizes, such as key fobs, private keys, or even embedded modules in smartphones.<br>
Depending on the card type, the interface may be exposed to electrical contacts, an embedded antenna for contactless communication, or both.</p>
 
How Smart Card Authentication Works 
<p></p>
<p>Smart card authentication is a method that employs the embedded chip in the card to verify the identity of the user certificates.<br>
The chip can generate or store authentication data through cryptographic algorithms that a reader can verify. This approach makes the authentication process for debit cards highly secure and reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access.</p>
 
The Authentication Process Explained 
<p>When a smart card is inserted into a reader or a competent card certificate brought within the proximity of a contactless reader, the reader initiates a challenge-response mechanism. First, the reader queries the card for specific information.<br>
The card’s chip then processes this query and generates a response using its information stored in cryptographic keys. To confirm the card’s authenticity, the reader verifies this response against its data.<br>
A back-end server might be involved in more advanced systems to validate the transaction further. This multi-step verification ensures that even if someone gains physical access to a user account or a debit card, it is tough to forge or manipulate the authentication process.</p>
 
Common Protocols and Technologies 
<p></p>
<p>Smart cards often use standard protocols such as ISO/IEC 7816 for contact cards and ISO/IEC 14443 for contactless cards. Other technologies like EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa) are popular in the banking sector for secure transactions.<br>
These protocols and technologies govern the physical characteristics, radio frequencies, and data transmission between the intelligent card reader and the reader.<br>
Different sectors might have specialized protocols or custom configurations to make magnetic stripe cards meet specific security or functional requirements.<br>
However, adherence to globally accepted standards ensures interoperability and wider acceptance of the smart card technology.</p>
 
Benefits of Smart Card Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>Smart card authentication brings a plethora of advantages to the table. This technology adds sophistication and efficiency to any integrated system, from enhanced security to streamlined operations.</p>
 
Enhanced Security Features 
<p>The most obvious advantage of using smart card technology is the security improvement. The embedded chip in the smart card can securely store cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.<br>
Because the private key and data are stored in a chip rather than a magnetic stripe, it is much more difficult for unauthorized persons to copy or manipulate the data. This adds a strong layer of security against cloning, skimming, and other forms of fraud.<br>
Additionally, the chip can execute complex cryptographic algorithms, allowing for secure communications between the smart card user and the reader. With the integration of multi-factor authentication, smart cards provide users with a robust defense against many security threats.</p>
 
User Convenience and Efficiency 
<p>While intelligent cards offer users high security, they are also incredibly user-friendly. For most applications, users have to tap or insert their cards into a reader, making the process quicker and more streamlined compared to traditional methods like manual entry of passwords or PINs.<br>
This not only enhances user experience but also improves operational efficiency. In a corporate environment, a single smart card security token can serve multiple purposes—such as access control, secure data storage, and even digital certificates and signatures—reducing the number of credentials a user has to manage.</p>
 
Scalability and Adaptability 
<p>Smart cards are highly scalable and can be easily integrated into existing systems. As organizations grow, the smart card system can be expanded without significant changes to the infrastructure.<br>
Moreover, the cards are adaptable to new technologies and can be updated to meet evolving security standards or to add new functionalities.</p>
 
Challenges and Limitations 
<p></p>
<p>Despite its many advantages, smart card technology is not without its drawbacks.</p>
 
Costs and Budget Constraints 
<p>Implementing a smart card system can be expensive initially. The cost includes not just the cards themselves but also the readers and the back-end infrastructure.<br>
While the long-term benefits may justify the costs, budget constraints can be a significant barrier for smaller organizations or projects with limited funding.</p>
 
Technological Hurdles 
<p>Interoperability can be challenging for smart card devices, especially systems requiring multi-vendor collaboration. If not properly planned, this can lead to compatibility issues.<br>
Moreover, older smart card systems may become obsolete as technology advances, requiring upgrades or replacements.</p>
 
User Training and Acceptance 
<p>While smart cards are generally user-friendly, they do require some level of user training. Understanding how to use the cards correctly, what to do in case of loss or theft, and how to manage PINs or other secondary authentication methods are all essential for the practical usage of intelligent health cards. User acceptance can also be a hurdle, particularly for those who are not tech-savvy.</p>
 
Best Practices for Implementing Smart Card Authentication 
<p>Several best practices can guide the process when implementing smart card technology.</p>
 
Vendor Selection and Compatibility 
<p>Choosing the right vendor is crucial for a successful implementation. Look for vendors who adhere to global standards to ensure interoperability and future scalability.<br>
Also, consider the range of products and services offered by smart card vendors, including the availability of updates and customer support.</p>
 
Software and Hardware Requirements 
<p>Before deploying smart cards, thoroughly assess the existing infrastructure to determine what upgrades or changes are needed.<br>
This includes evaluating the software to manage the smart card system and the hardware that supports smart cards, card readers, and servers. Make sure they meet the required security and operational standards.</p>
 
Ongoing Maintenance and Updates 
<p>Once the smart card system is up and running, it will require regular maintenance to ensure it stays secure and functional.<br>
This includes regular software updates, monitoring for unusual activities, and periodic reviews to assess the need for system upgrades or new features.<br>
Implementing smart card authentication can significantly improve both security and efficiency in a wide range of applications.<br>
While there are challenges for smart card users to consider, the benefits of user authentication often outweigh the drawbacks, making smart cards a worthwhile investment for many organizations.</p>

<p>Warm or cold, good or bad, global climate constantly changes in various ways. This data challenge used carbon emission rates sorted by each country to prove or debunk common climate change assumptions with data science. Understanding trends of the past and simulating future outcomes through available data seeks to lead to better awareness, business intelligence, and policy shaping in years to&nbsp;come.</p> Introduction <p>This Data Challenge ran from November 23 to December 12, 2023, and was the last challenge of the 2023 championship season. The purpose of was challenge was to dissect carbon emission statistics and rates by each country, and then develop predictive models for future emission rates on a continental scale.</p><p>The Carbon Emissions data challenge gave a stepping stone to understanding emission rates for intensive purposes of the data challenge experiment. Later R&amp;D on this subject routes to dynamic analytics, data-informed decision-making, and stride to mitigate asymmetric facts and truth about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>To execute, the Ocean Protocol Data Science team and the challenge participants used the provided data made available by the European Commission <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023">EDGAR — Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research</a>. Two Data Sets were used to weigh carbon emission rates under two different metrics: Co2 (Carbon Dioxide) and GHG (Green House Gases). Each data set weighed its metric at the country level, sector-specific data, per GDP, and Per Capita emission&nbsp;rates.</p><p>The key objectives of this data science competition were to analyze the influence of different industry sectors and countries, exercise statistical and machine learning models to derive assumptions, and forecast what the short-term future may look&nbsp;like.</p> Winners <p>Participants were tasked with analyzing trends and patterns in the historical data and identifying key drivers of emissions per country per industry sector, per capita, and per GDP. Then, apply these findings to indicators by continent. Beyond the data set provided, participants were encouraged to assess the impact of different sectors and economic activities on emission levels. 13 reports were entered, and 3 have earned podium finishes for USDC prizes and points accrued to their standing in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship &amp; Leaderboard.</a></p><p>Podium finishers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1st — Andrey Bessalov — $2500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:a08d2b52d21ad4660db8da92536f930ba88accc917eca95721f9c70d6ccad96f">here</a>.</p><p>Andrey’s report was the best prepared and thorough. The key conclusion was that Asia is the most polluting continent, with recent emission levels reaching approximately 33 Gt GHG and 25 Gt CO2 per year, constituting about two-thirds of the total global emissions. Conversely, Australia is identified as the least polluting continent. This highlights a significant disparity in emission levels across continents, underscoring the crucial role of regional factors in global emission&nbsp;trends.</p><p>2nd — Elisa Anderson — $1500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>A key standout in the proposal made by Elisa was the development and application of a sophisticated predictive model. This model, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, is designed to forecast CO2 and GHG emissions by continent. The model demonstrates varying levels of predictive accuracy across different regions, highlighting the unique factors influencing emissions in each&nbsp;area.</p><p>3rd — Colin Chan — $1000&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:64b4f1ff8b085b3acaf6772b7ba6334c750c85f43761f8314a876fc6c51de3b3">here</a></p><p>The most interesting takeaway from Colin Chan’s report, “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents,” is the discovery that Africa has experienced the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling over the observed time period (30 Years). This sharp increase is attributed to the continent’s industrialization and rising demand for transportation services, driven by urbanization and population growth. Conversely, Europe has shown a decrease in CO2 emissions, thanks to investments in renewable energy, strict environmental regulations, and the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading System. This contrast illustrates the diverse paths of development and environmental impact across different regions.</p> Results <p>Global warming is the long-term increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Since the pre-industrial period (1850–1900), the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a> has concluded that it is extremely likely that human activity is the main cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. One noteworthy insight derived from this challenge found in this data challenge, that goes against common perception, is that CO2 emissions in Europe have been only declining for the last 30 years, whilst CO2 emissions in Asia for the last 30 years have steadily increased.</p><p>Through this exercise, we were able to assume a few key metrics that influence carbon emission rates via Co2 and GHG and define these assumptions before further&nbsp;reading:</p><p>The main source of carbon emissions and increased rates globally is burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power cars and trucks, and heat homes and businesses. Other sources of carbon emissions include deforestation, waste management, alternative energy production, industrial processes, urbanization &amp; population growth, and agriculture.</p><p>Global warming is already having several negative effects on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>These effects are expected to become more severe in the future. Some of the most serious effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, changes in animal and plant life, and soil health &amp; erosion. Here we use data science to diagnose the issues and propose better practices to treat our planet better than the last 30&nbsp;years.</p> Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA) <p>In Asia, the surge in CO2 and GHG emissions is closely linked to rapid population growth, industrialization, and the rise of emerging economies. This region’s dynamic economic development, often driven by energy-intensive industries and expanding urban centers, has significantly increased its carbon footprint.</p><p>Meanwhile, continents like Oceania, Europe, and North America have witnessed a decline in emissions, largely attributable to effective environmental policies and a shift towards cleaner energy sources. This contrast highlights the varying trajectories of different regions in addressing climate change, underscoring the need for tailored solutions that consider economic and social contexts.</p><p>The same phenomenon is reflected in GHG emissions with Europe improving in its environmental efforts while the rest of the world continues to increase its emissions as&nbsp;Africa</p><p>leads the rise. Europe contributed 26.44% of total GHG emissions in 2022, down from 37.40% in 1970. On the other hand, Africa’s contribution rose from 12.70% in 1970 to 20.65%. This dichotomy is largely reflected and expected based on the aforementioned analysis of CO2 emissions.</p> Co2 vs GHG correlation <p>The heatmap indicates a strong positive correlation between CO2 emissions and overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a correlation coefficient of&nbsp;0.99.</p><p>This suggests that in the dataset analyzed, as CO2 emissions increase or decrease, GHG emissions tend to follow very closely. Given that CO2 is a major component of GHG emissions, this high correlation is expected.</p> Industry Sector Contribution Correlation The trend of Co2 Emission Rates by Sector&nbsp;GloballyTrends of GHG &amp; Co2 Emission Rates by Industry&nbsp;Sector<p>The graphs below show the absolute values of sectoral CO2 and GHG emissions expressed in Mt CO2/yr on the left, and the shares of these values from the total contribution on the&nbsp;right.</p><p>The most polluting sector is the Power Industry (generating energy). In recent years, the value of CO2 emissions has reached 30 Gt per year, which is approximately 30% of total GHG emissions, and 40% of total CO2 emissions. The least polluting sector in terms of GHG emissions is&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>- The agriculture sector is a significant contributor globally, necessitating sustainable farming practices.</p><p>- The building and fuel exploitation sectors call for energy-efficient construction and cleaner energy&nbsp;sources.</p><p>- Industrial combustion and the power industry sectors require enhanced regulations and adoption of cleaner technologies.</p><p>- Increased waste sector demands improved waste management sustainability globally.</p><p>- The transportation sector emphasizes the urgency of sustainable mobility solutions.</p><p>Following Per Capita and Per GDP metrics, it was recognized that global average CO2 emissions per capita decreasing from 1990 to 2022 indicates a positive trend towards lower individual carbon footprints. Because GDP and Per Capita benchmarks are continuously increasing, further reasoning for a decrease in correlation could mean several things: Improved energy efficiency, introduction of renewable energy, increased awareness, and policy measures.</p> Temporal Analysis <p>In Temporal analysis, research was tasked with Examining the temporal trends in CO2 and GHG emissions across continents. Then, scoring was made on the ability to identify notable patterns or shifts over time, pinpointing periods marked by significant increases or decreases in emissions. Explain these trends, considering policy changes, economic shifts, technological advancements, or natural events that might have influenced the observed patterns. The summary to solve this question is briefed based on averages of the submitted reports.</p><p>Over time, all continents recorded a rise in CO2 emissions except for Europe. In the meanwhile, Africa led the pack with the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling throughout the time. This can be possibly explained by the industrialization of Africa as the amount of CO2 emissions from transport rose dramatically in the continent. These include railways, buses, and ferries as the countries experience urbanization and population growth, increasing the demand for transportation services. These signs of economic development often go in tandem with trade and business activities, necessitating transportation services to move goods and people. Furthermore, as Africa’s GDP gradually increases, this enhances the affordability of citizens in the region to purchase vehicles, leading to elevated emissions.</p><p>However, with the lack of government policies and public awareness, it fails to sufficiently curb these emission activities and promote sustainable emissions.</p><p>As for sectoral composition, agriculture led the greatest fall (23.10% to 19.59%) in contributions to total GHG emissions while Processes contributed the largest rise (10.94% to&nbsp;14.64%).</p><p>Livestock, especially cattle, contribute significantly to methane emissions. The implementation of improved livestock management practices, such as dietary changes and methane capture technologies could contribute to lower emissions from the agriculture sector. As for processes, this could be plausibly explained by the changes in consumer demand and trade patterns which shifted to more energy-intensive manufacturing techniques such as computer parts and electronic equipment, due to the rise in income per&nbsp;capita.</p> Prediction Model <p>For predictions, two different approaches were exercised by challenge participants. Drawn between 1) Time Series Analysis, by analyzing historical trends and patterns in the data, time series models like ARIMA and ARIMAX can be employed to predict future emission levels. And 2) Machine Learning by the vehicle of algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks was trained on the provided data to learn complex relationships and patterns.</p><p>For one example, this linear regression model is described here to forecast future global CO2 and GHG emission rates based solely on historical emissions data. The model utilizes the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method from the Statsmodels library in Python. The dataset used for training and prediction consists of two columns: ‘Year’ and ‘Emission’, where ‘Year’ represents the respective year, and ‘Emission’ denotes the total CO2 or GHG emissions for that year. The objective was to develop a predictive model that can estimate future total global CO2 emissions based on historical data.</p> Understanding Emission Rates, Climate Change, &amp; What to Do About&nbsp;It <p>The “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents” challenge has been a pivotal journey in understanding the complex dynamics of CO2 and GHG emissions globally. Through meticulous data analysis and advanced modeling, we’ve uncovered distinct emission trends across continents and the substantial impact of various sectors on these emissions. Our models have forecasted emissions for the upcoming three years, providing a crucial tool for policymakers and Environmentalists.</p><p>The analysis paints a world where geography and economy intertwine with emissions. While Asia grapples with the environmental costs of rapid growth, the West shows the feasibility of stabilizing emissions. Africa’s trajectory points towards a need for sustainable development models. The insights call for a global response, balancing economic needs with environmental sustainability.</p><p>This was the last data challenge of 2023.

 In IDnow’s latest webinar, experts gathered to discuss the challenges of preventing fraud, and the crucial role of identity verification services in the fraud capital of Europe. 



 



<p>If we are ever to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK (which currently claims the dubious honor of being fraud capital of Europe), then more must be done to educate the public of the real harm, according to participants of IDnow’s recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">webinar, ‘The future of fraud and identity verification in the UK.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel discussion, which is available now on-demand, gathered an eclectic bunch of experts, including Philipp Mind, Director Digital Technology and Innovation at UK Finance, Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud, and Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Philipp, who was the moderator for the session, started by setting the scene, which included sharing some startling statistics of just how dire the problem of fraud is in the UK. (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s problem with fraud here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>It then seemed only fitting to begin by speaking with the once dubbed “Britain’s greatest fraud star” to give his opinion on the state of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Criminals have now got more tools and data streams available to them than ever before. When I was a criminal, getting someone’s information was quite difficult, it wasn’t the process that it is now with Telegram, and the dark web, and all these places where criminals can harvest information, so it’s a lot easier to commit than it ever was before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tony added that the cost-of-living crisis has a part to play in people committing fraud, as does the role of social media in creating unobtainable lifestyles that persuade people to “get involved in deetsing [acquiring funds from account details].&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They don’t even realize the consequences of their actions. They just want to get that item that they see others have. I think that’s a massive part of why we see the numbers [of fraud] we do nowadays.</p>Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud</blockquote>



<p>Paul, who has been historically at the opposite end of the interview table throughout his career, agreed with Tony, but also added that it was the ‘white collar’ perception of fraud that had a damaging impact on its prevalence, and often had the police deprioritize investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud is still seen as just a business crime by a lot of senior officers, but fraud is also about the emotional harm as well as the financial crime. However, some police divisions like Merseyside Police [where Paul worked] are moving away from solely focusing on the financial harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul believes that it is this perception, or misperception, that is key, citing how police divisions will invariably prioritize more ‘serious’ crimes like burglaries or murders, for example, as the harm is clear, and the public outrage if such crimes weren’t investigated, would be massive. Paul did say that times were slowly changing, though, and that the days of police fraud teams only taking on fraud cases if over a million pounds had been lost, are (in most areas) coming to an end…&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As a police force, and a society, if we can move toward acknowledging the actual harm that fraud causes, and not just see the financial element, then I think that will make a big difference.</p>Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd</blockquote>



 The effect of KYC: A blessing and a curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It’s clear that technology and especially AI has facilitated an increase in new types of fraud (eg: deepfakes) in the UK. Thankfully, other types of technology like digital identity verification and eKYC were helping massively in the fight against fraud. However, while it’s important to be aware of new fraud trends, it’s also important to not forget the basics. For many organizations that means ensuring they have a robust and comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) process. For Tony, however, that acronym means something completely different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do it differently at We Fight Fraud; we call it Know Your Criminal. From a criminal’s perspective, if an organization does have a thorough KYC process in place, then they will often abandon the onboarding, and just go to a company that doesn’t have such a robust KYC process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, companies that comply with the bare minimum of KYC and AML requirements (in order to onboard customers quicker or offer a more attractive customer experience) are not only putting their business at risk, but also their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s some great technology out there, especially in some of the banking apps, such as liveness scan functionality. When it’s configured correctly and working as part of comprehensive process, it’s great, but sometimes the drive to onboard customers means some businesses skip steps,” explains Tony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few years ago, we (We Fight Fraud) tested some organizations’ onboarding processes, and I was able to onboard my face with my colleague’s ID, and then we reversed it and used my ID document with her face. We even tried and succeeded wearing a bright yellow balaclava and were able to onboard with all three accounts, and deposit and withdraw money. It was a really easy process because the process hadn’t been configured properly or the liveness check wasn’t working in the way it should have been, and everyone’s worried about deepfakes! Let me make it clear, this was not IDnow!”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Biometrics, as Tony said, is very important. Identity verification vendors need to ensure the same face cannot be onboarded twice and the same document cannot be onboarded with another face, and most identity verification vendors cannot do that. You need risk analysis. You need heavy checks, what we call document and selfie checks, but it needs to be a holistic approach.</p>Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow</blockquote>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week I am joined by Craig Ramsay from Omada, here to discuss the importance of identity governance and how it is helping to solve problems in real-world. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello, for today’s episode about Identity Governance and Administration, mostly known as IGA, we have invited a super interesting guest who is Craig Ramsay. He is a Senior Solution Architect at Omada. He’s from Edinburgh, Scotland. He has worked for Omada for three years and has previously worked at RSA Security and different financial services organisations in the United Kingdom within their identity functions. Outside of work, Craig’s main interests are hiking and travelling. Hello, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig Ramsay: Hey, Oscar. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice talking with you.</p>
<p>Craig: Thank you, you too.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, let’s talk about digital identity. As usual, we want to hear more about our guests. Please tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, thank you for the introduction. And I guess, in terms of my journey into identity, it was a little bit by fluke rather than by design. I studied Computer Science and when I graduated, I joined an operational IT graduate scheme. They had recently started a new IAM project, because I think back in 2008, identity and access management, identity governance wasn’t as mature as it is now. It was still kind of seen as an operational IT project rather than an information security principle. So, the drivers there were more about the efficiency, automated provisioning and stuff. But yeah, they were looking for a graduate on that project. That was me.</p>
<p>And apart from a few years where I decided to try what it was like being a policeman, I have worked in identity ever since either for, as you said, financial services organisations doing the work at the coalface or for vendors, either in project delivery or, and you know pre-sales in my solution architect role.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, let’s go first with the basics. We have not talked about IGA yet in this podcast, have not focused on that. So, tell us, what is that? What is Identity Governance and Administration, IGA? What is important?</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, identity governance, when you focus on it, at its core, it’s a solution that will ensure the right individuals have the right access for the right reasons at the right time in your organisation. So, it’s protecting the authorisations or the resource assignments within your organisation. And that’s often policy-driven to ensure that all of, and I think the important distinction here when we talk about IGA, that’s traditionally your internal identities, maybe your third parties and contractors.</p>
<p>And then in terms of the overall importance of identity governance, as I said, it’s evolved over the years from being primarily driving and focusing, looking at the provisioning element of things. But as governance has become more and more important, as we start to take a more holistic view at identity, when you look at the adjacent technologies; privileged access management, cloud infrastructure and tailored management, user endpoint, behaviour analytics, identity governance is now really being seen as the kind of control plane across that identity fabric. So, I think it is becoming crucial. And there’s a lot of visibility on the importance of identity now, right up to C-level and maybe wasn’t 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned this concept about identity fabric. Could you also explain a bit more about that in this context?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, identity fabric is a term that’s been coined in the last maybe few years by a lot of industry analysts out there. It’s maybe a new phrase, but I think the concept isn’t necessarily that new. So, I think we also hear people calling it an enriched security ecosystem. So, it’s where you look at these solutions in the PAM space, UEBA, your SIEM solutions, etc.</p>
<p>Those traditionally have worked in perhaps a bit more of a siloed manner. And the integrations have been maybe limited and not as seamless. Whereas now, I think this concept of that enriched security ecosystem, that fabric is that these things should be joined up and they should be – the convergence of intelligence and data between those solutions, I think is becoming more and more important so that you can take a holistic approach to reducing your identity-related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is very important, as you said, because there will be anyway, other solutions working together with IGA. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What are the main problems, just – I’m sure there are many, but what are the top main problems that IGA solves?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so from a business problem or business challenge perspective, I think the main thing that we always focus on when we’re helping people build their IGA business case, is that we focus on security, compliance and efficiency. So, it’s looking to increase the efficiency and productivity of your end users and their experience, all whilst ensuring that you’ve got increased compliance, increased security and reduced risk.</p>
<p>So, when we look at that, some of those common challenges and problems within that would be reducing the attack surface in the organisation. So, removing unneeded access, adhering to the principle of least privilege, making sure that your identities only have the access they should. I mean, combining those two things is going to reduce the likelihood and the impact of a potential breach in the organisation. It provides you with a unified view of access across the organisation, which a lot of people often haven’t had previously. So, understanding who has what access.</p>
<p>And then there’s the automation around identity lifecycle management. So that’s reducing the time taken to provision your joiners, your movers, your leavers. You’re putting governance and auditing around all of these processes too. So, when people are requesting access, you’re ensuring they’re getting it for the right reasons with the appropriate approval. And you’re cutting down on things like rogue IT administration and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So that’s high level, there is more obviously, but I think those are the high-level ones that we see frequently when we’re speaking to prospects out there in the market.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a security compliance, and efficiency. Yeah, we’d like to talk about this. But before actually it will be interesting to – so people can understand the broader concept, how we try to imagine in their minds.</p>
<p>If you can see in a real-world example, how work for a typical corporation that uses IGA. So, tell us what are these main processes that you say, mostly employees, right? What are these main processes? Let’s say a new employee goes from beginning until the end.</p>
<p>Craig: Yes. I mean, if we’re going to talk – the phrase we kind of, is from hire to retire. So, when I try and explain this to my friends, maybe aren’t so technically minded when they ask what I do, I sort of give them an example. I say, OK, you join an organisation, and you are working in their HR department. So, from day one, you should have access to be able to log into the network, an email account, access to various file shares to do with HR to enable you to be productive from day one.</p>
<p>So, the IGA solution will help you identify the policies to automate that process, to make sure that you are productive and also make sure that you’ve only got access to what you should. So, if you’re joining HR, you shouldn’t be getting access to any file shares to do with finance, R and D, anything like that. And then as you move around the organisation or your needs change, you should be able to request access that goes through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>It should be reviewed regularly to make sure that it is still appropriate as you go through your life cycle as an identity in the organisation. If you are promoted or changed departments, that should change automatically in line with those policies too. And if you either leave the organisation, be it permanently or temporary for maternity leave, garden leave, that kind of thing, your IGA solution should then disable or provision that access in a timely manner too, to make sure you’re reducing risk.</p>
<p>So, I mean, those are kind of some of the high-level things that it’s that right access for the right people at the right time for the right reasons is kind of trying to, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, that was in a nutshell, very, very easy to understand. Thank you for that. Some of these at least main problems and how these are being solved. But IGA, let’s start with security as you put security first, how IGA is helping with security?</p>
<p>Craig: So, in terms of how it contributes to, you know, maybe security and risk management, I think, it’s providing stronger access control. So, it’s starting to limit access to your sensitive and privileged information. So, when you start to look at either personal identifiable information, financially sensitive information, or privileged access, so this is when you start to look at integrations with adjacent technologies in the PAM space, you’re ensuring that the access control is limiting that access.</p>
<p>Reducing risk. I already talked about the fact that that principle of least privilege means that if there is a breach in the organisation, the identity of the account that’s breached should have only the access needed to do the job that it can, and it shouldn’t have any elevated permissions permanently. The ability to traverse the network or to have a much more impact on that breach should be reduced. You’re also reducing the likelihood by integrating with identity providers to perform strong authentication. And those unneeded accounts or unwanted accounts or unused accounts have been removed over time as well. So that should be helping you reduce the risk and then improve your security posture.</p>
<p>In combination with that as well, if you look at some of the real-time monitoring and identity incidents or detection and prevention you’re starting to see integration with abnormal access patterns, maybe you know impossible logons, for example, we integrate with the Azure identity risk subscription so that’s looking at – user logged on from Edinburgh one minute and they’re trying to log on from Beijing the next. That’s impossible, so that may be an indication of compromise. And then your IGA solution could lock down that account.</p>
<p>So, there’s many ways you could do that and it’s obviously a maturity journey, you need to crawl before you can walk before you can run. But it’s a maturity journey you go on to take a holistic view in reducing your identity related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. From basic essential functionalities of security to much more advanced like some of the ones you described.</p>
<p>The second one is, of course, we’re interested about compliance is very common that someone comes, start to ask someone from Omada, or from another company even Ubisecure, we also do identity access management and one of the key drivers for them is compliance especially in some industries, it’s more important that. So, tell us about compliance.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, I mean, when you go out there in the market and you’re speaking to organisations like more and more and more we are speaking to organisations that operate on a global basis. So, you’ve got country or region-specific things like GDPR, SOCS, HIPAA, PCI, DSS etc that are external regulatory compliance frameworks that you must comply with. And you know we keep a track on with things like Schrems II as well. We’re always keeping an eye on that to ensure that the solution we provide is compliant with those things.</p>
<p>But then we’re also helping our customers comply with how they are storing, processing and managing the data in relation to those things. So, if you look at what I often say is that an identity governance solution is a technical translation of your business processes. I think you always have to look at making sure your people process and technology are working in harmony with each other. Technology alone will not resolve your problems. So, I think as part of a wider identity information security strategy you should ensure that your internal policies and standards are created in such a way that it will help you comply with those external regulations if they apply to you.</p>
<p>But you should always look, I think it’s a healthy thing for any organisation across any vertical to have these well-defined policies and standards and ensure that they can comply with those. And as I said that’s where identity governance comes in, because it helps you comply with those things by defining policies that can detect when you’re non-compliant, you’ve got that audit trail. So, it offers – you’ve got transparent auditing for your internal and external users to prove compliance. You will go through regular recertification, attestation, reviews, whatever you want to call it. But that also ensures that you’re demonstrating regular compliance.</p>
<p>And then we already talked about risk management as well, but compliance and risk often do overlap each other. So, you’re identifying and mitigating compliance risks through the definition and enforcement of these policies as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, there is some reports that can be directly created, right, from the IGA system. And that can be directly taken by the compliance officer or whoever requires it, right?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The other you mentioned there was the operational efficiency, right? So, as you mentioned, it’s one of the three main problems. Let’s – I’d like to hear more about that as well, how IGA helps.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. And I think that’s one of the things that I think separates IGA and the information security market sometimes. That it’s not always focusing on risk reduction and things that are maybe potentially seen as negative. So, you talk about fear and certainty and doubt within the sales process, etc. When you’re doing that, it can often be quite a hard sell because it’s hard to quantify the risk. We can’t help with that. There are formulas out there of calculating the impact of a risk based on, you know, and the likelihood, the cost of the actual breach, etc.</p>
<p>But to bring it back to what you actually asked about from an efficiency perspective, if you look at – if organisations are still heavily manual in their provisioning and their processes, there’s a huge cost to that from areas like your service desk, your operational IT administrators. And often it leads you to the potential for human error as well. So, if you start to automate those things, you see a reduction in numbers of calls to the desk, a number of manually created events and things that are being done. And you can put a pound, euro, dollar sign against that clearly from an efficiency and a cost reduction perspective.</p>
<p>From an end user perspective as well, I mean, it’s always, I think there’s – we’re still trying to shake off the thing that security is a barrier to efficiency. There’s an old adage that I keep using for it regularly that ‘efficiency is insecure, but security is inefficient’. And I don’t think that’s true anymore. I think if you correctly apply your policies in a way that apply the appropriate level of risk, your users – to them, it should be seamless pretty much all the time. They shouldn’t see these processes as an action. They should see it as; they request the access they need, it gets granted to them in a timely manner. When they move around the organisation, a lot of that should happen automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, you should see an increase in productivity. Your line managers aren’t getting frustrated when people join the organisation and they’re having to submit 10 different requests to get them functioning from day one. So, it’s overall operational efficiency and cost reduction. But the productivity. And end user experience of it as a result of a well-delivered IGA program, I think is clear to see as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cost reduction is clear and is a great reason to buy a product like IGA. Absolutely. Well, if you quantify that to a buyer, it’s like, wow, you can convince him or her very easily. Yeah.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure, we are working with CIAM, and I experienced directly that sometimes requests come from potential customers, and they are looking for identity and access management. And when we review closely, we see that sometimes what they need is IGA or what they need is both IGA and customer identity and access management. So, and in those cases, the customer will need to deal with these two types of system, right? The IGA and CIAM.</p>
<p>So, what is your perspective from your experience working integrating these two types of tools? What are the main things that a buyer bought from business and technical perspective should know at least?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so, I mean, funnily enough, I have worked on a couple of opportunities where Omada and Ubisecure have been working together on those kinds of joint proposals where people are looking for IGA and CIAM. And I think it’s interesting because you can make a very strong case about where the overlap is, but you can also equally make a very strong case about why they should be separate because of the nature of the requirements.</p>
<p>From a CIAM perspective, you’re looking for that seamless, really quick response for all your consumers. And then you should be able to deal with high demand periods when you’re very, very busy, when your consumers are consuming your services. And from an IGA perspective, you’re very much looking at the internal and the control and the level of these privileges that we’re talking about. And there are similarities in the capabilities in terms of, you know, being able to provision in a timely manner, deprovision in a timely manner, ensuring that it’s the level of appropriateness.</p>
<p>So, if you look at it from an integration perspective, a unified management of the identities, I think, could be important whilst treating them differently. I think your end user experience again should be important. So, you’re balancing security and efficiency for your internal and external customers. And then you should be able to have that from a scalability perspective by seeing those things integrate well with each other as well.</p>
<p>I think what is important when you’re speaking to people, understanding their requirements is crucial. So, when they’re talking about, you know, B2B or B2C capabilities and requirements, it’s OK, well, how do you manage your B2B and B2C use cases? Because I think if you take software or technical organisation where their consumers consume their services in a far, far different way to maybe a retail bank or a supermarket. The requirements for end users from that perspective, they’re opening up a loyalty card in a store and you’re processing their personal data in that manner is very, very different to maybe a software company where people are having accounts created and consuming those services.</p>
<p>So, as you can probably tell, not an absolute expert in the CIAM space, but I think whenever those opportunities arise, I think the first important question is why? To understand what it is exactly they’re trying to achieve. And then you map the use cases to the functionality in each of the appropriate solutions to make sure that it’s well matched. There will be overlap in some cases. But as I said, there’s a strong case for when there’s similarities and when they should be managed separately. But ultimately, it’s part of that wider identity fabric we mentioned earlier that it’s kind of all identity in the end, I guess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Indeed. As you say, you put it very clear, the importance of really knowing very well the requirements because in a conversation, they might tell you we need this one, two, three, five things and can be also in a written Excel file or whatever. But then you have to go deeply to understand what they meant by saying this B2B or anything, right? So, yeah. Indeed. Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>Looking now at the present and future, let’s say, because IGA, as many other types of products have been evolving, are evolving all the time because there are different needs. So what customers are asking today when they are clear that they need an IGA software? What they’re asking today and what are these new problems that need to be solved, are being solved now and need to be solved if they are not solved today?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, it’s a very timely question. To be fair, we recently released a <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA for 2024 report</a> at Omada and we did a webinar discussing the findings of it and it did exactly that it looked at how seriously people were taking identity. And then as you said what are they looking for currently and what are they looking ahead at as well. So, and we just talked about the why and the use cases, so I think, number one that we still see is that the solution they’re looking at adapts and meets to their changing business needs. So, the requirements they have now and the requirements they think they’ll see in the future, it’s the core capabilities must adapt and must comply with that.</p>
<p>We’re seeing an increased importance being put on the ability for the solution to integrate as part of that security ecosystem we talked about. So being able to play nicely with the adjacent technologies across the identity fabric. And then from a connectivity perspective, I mean I talked earlier about a unified view of access across the board, the nature of organisations has changed massively in terms of on-premises systems to a lot more cloud services being consumed. So the ability to extend and integrate with a growing list of different target systems is important for them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we do see AI and Machine Learning coming up again and again. And I think when we see that it’s important to take those as separate things. So, from ML perspective, you know, if you look at kind of the role mining capabilities that have been there for some time, recommendations during reviews, recommendations for decisions or decision support for approvals, that stuff has been around for a little while.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective, I mean there’s a huge buzz around what’s happening in AI. Just now Google just released their Gemini Chatbot to rival Chat GPT and that the generative AI stuff and the practical uses of that are going to start to be seen. So, you know integrating generative AI, we have stuff where it’s looking at… you can ask questions about the documentation. So, like what is this object in Omada and like what’s the difference and it’s starting to respond to that so we’re in the process of testing and releasing that.</p>
<p>And then looking further down the line, it’ll be generative AI within the solution. So, user logs in and it says, “What are you trying to do today?” “I need the same access as my colleague Allison.” And it’ll say, “OK she’s got this, this and this. Maybe this is what you need to request.” Or it’s becoming more mature and more complex or sophisticated in what it can do.</p>
<p>So, I think ultimately what people are looking for is ensuring that the solution they have can do what they need to do today and can do it well, it’s scalable, it’s easy to upgrade, it’s easy to maintain. They’re reducing the complexity of management of it so they’re simplifying it from that perspective. But looking ahead they’re needing that generic connectivity that can allow them to connect to any of the systems they have now and ones they want in the future. And then being able to take advantage of the advances in the AI and ML space to improve end user experience and also the maintenance and administration of the system itself for their administrative users.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you believe that machine learning and the other what we call artificial intelligence is going to be used. It’s to be solving those problems that today customers are bringing up.</p>
<p>Craig: I think it’ll augment, and I think – because that’s the thing people get worried about AI replacing us and whatnot. And maybe somebody using AI more efficiently than you might replace what you’re doing but AI itself can’t and I think any algorithm that – it does do in the output of it still needs human validation particularly in a field like IGA where OK it’s taken a huge amount of data, provided this output and most that might look OK. There’s probably some human context in terms of exactly what that business does that’s needed to say, “Yes I’m still OK with that.” Because ultimately the human’s going to have to be accountable for the decision that’s made. I don’t think and I don’t think we’re going to see algorithms being fined or sent to jail for data breaches you know, I mean.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a human will go to jail anyway. Hopefully not. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Craig: No, hopefully not that’s what we’re trying to prevent. You’re right, we’re trying to prevent that but yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah definitely. Also, one thing you mentioned, it comes back to what we discussed earlier these identity fabrics. Yeah, the way to coexist all this all these tools, IGA, PAM, CIAM all together that’s also, as you say, it’s something that is becoming more important because the environments are getting more complexes.</p>
<p>Final question for you, Craig. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Craig: So not to spoil the magic of the podcast but we’re recording this just before Christmas towards the end of the year and I don’t know when it’s going to be released but that’s always a time for reflection and looking at where you’re at and where you want to be going. And I think for any business leader right now, I think conducting an identity maturity assessment is something that you can do actionably right now. So, look at where you’re at from an identity maturity perspective and identify gaps that you need to start filling, or priorities looking ahead and aligning that with your business goals, your business risks to ensure that your information security strategy, your policies and standards support your overall business objectives.</p>
<p>And then from that, building a plan of continuous improvement, some milestones as well. And I think any well-delivered IGA project should be doing that. It shouldn’t be looking to boil the ocean or deliver everything at once at big bang. It should be continuous improvement and continuous demonstration of value.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate that might be – that’s not something cutting edge or brand new or innovative, but I think it is really something actionably you can do now to take a step back, assess exactly where you’re at and then build that plan and start to try an action that. Do that at the end of the year, at the start of the year. There’s never a bad time to take a step back and reflect and put that plan in place. But I think that’s definitely something actionable that they could put on their agenda right now to do from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more an assessment, absolutely. It’s something needed. Yeah, it takes time. And it’s very actionable, as you said. Yeah, thank you very much, Craig, for having this very interesting conversation about IGA and other topics, related topics.</p>
<p>So, let us know for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, or follow you, or find out more about what you do, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, absolutely. So, you can find me on LinkedIn, Craig, I think my username is Craig86. Obviously, I work at Omada Identity, but that’s, again, if you search for Omada, you’ll find us there. I mentioned our <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA 2024 report</a>, you can download that free from omadaidentity.com. And there’s also an on-demand webinar where myself and Rod Simmons, our VP of Product Strategy, discuss that report in-depth.</p>
<p>But yeah, please do feel free to reach out and connect. If you want to chat about all things identity or just want to know a bit more about Omada or myself. But yeah, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, Oscar, as well. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure as well. Well, all the best. Happy New Year. Now, this coming the new year, 2024, I wish you all the best for you, Craig, Omada, and everybody who is doing all this great job in the identity space. Thank you. All the best.</p>

<p>In the fast-paced digital era, recent revelations, as stated in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/moitra-admits-she-gave-login-password-to-hiranandani-denies-taking-cash-9002703/#:~:text=Trinamool%20Congress%20MP%20Mahua%20Moitra,the%20Central%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation.">the report</a>, surrounding the sharing of login credentials by a distinguished Member of Parliament illuminate the pressing need for advanced identity management systems. Traditional methods of securing parliamentary access, such as relying on usernames and passwords, have proven susceptible to human error, phishing attacks, and unintended information sharing. This discourse delves into the transformative capabilities of decentralized identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), and verifiable credentials, underscoring their pivotal role in averting unauthorized access and fortifying the safeguarding of sensitive information.</p><blockquote>This blog explores the potential paradigm shift from traditional security models to the transformative power of passwordless authentication in mitigating security&nbsp;lapses.</blockquote><p>The Limitations of Traditional Authentication</p><p>The traditional reliance on usernames and passwords has proven to be a weak link in the security chain, leaving online systems (parliamentary systems in this case) vulnerable to a spectrum of threats. As technology advances, so do the tactics of malicious actors. Phishing attacks, inadvertent credential sharing, and the complexities of managing multiple intricate passwords have underscored the need for a paradigm shift in authentication methods.</p><p>Unleashing the Potential of Passwordless Authentication</p><p>To address these challenges and fortify security, the adoption of passwordless authentication is a transformative step. Passwordless authentication (combined further with MFA — Multi Factor Authentication) eliminates the need for users to carry physical IDs and remember intricate passwords. Instead, it relies on advanced technologies that enhance security while simplifying the user experience.</p><p>1. Passkey Authentication:</p><p>Passkey authentication stands as a pinnacle of precision and security, utilizing unique physiological markers to verify users. It provides an advanced and secure alternative to traditional passwords, especially when accessing digital systems, ensuring a seamless and highly secure means of&nbsp;access.</p>  More accurate Precision: Passkeys can be dynamically generated using a variety of methods, ranging from advanced cryptographic algorithms to unique user-specific patterns. These passkeys serve as a highly secure substitute for traditional passwords, significantly enhancing the overall security posture of the authentication process.  Elimination of Password Dependency: By eliminating the need for passwords, passkey authentication eradicates vulnerabilities associated with password-based systems, offering a more secure and user-friendly experience.  Resistance to Impersonation: Passkeys exhibit inherent resistance to impersonation, making them a formidable defense against unauthorized access. Even if someone attempts to intercept your passkey, it rapidly becomes useless, making it exceptionally challenging for anyone to gain unauthorized access to your account. This level of security is crucial, especially in the face of continually evolving phishing attacks that aim to trick individuals.  <p>2. Mobile-Based Authentication:</p><p>Mobile-based authentication solutions represent a harmonious convergence of convenience and security. Through dedicated authentication apps, users can seamlessly navigate secure access without the need for traditional passwords.</p>  Consent-based Authentication: Control of Authentication is shifted in the hands of the individual.  Push Notifications: Authentication apps leverage push notifications to deliver secure, real-time authentication requests directly to users’ mobile&nbsp;devices.  <p>3. Hardware&nbsp;Tokens:</p><p>Hardware tokens introduce a tangible and secure element to the passwordless authentication landscape. By leveraging physical devices such as USB tokens or smart cards, parliamentary members can further enhance the robustness of their authentication process.</p>  Secure Authentication Codes: These devices generate secure authentication codes, adding an extra dimension of complexity that enhances the overall security of parliamentary systems&nbsp;access.  Reduced Vulnerability to Cyber Threats: Unlike purely digital authentication methods, hardware tokens are less susceptible to certain cyber threats, providing a resilient defense against various forms of online&nbsp;attacks.  <p>4. Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://ayanworks.com/">Decentralized identity</a> and verifiable credentials herald a paradigm shift by empowering individuals, including parliamentarians, with control over their digital identities. This goes beyond the limitations of traditional credentials.</p>  User-Centric Identity: Users gain control over their digital identities, reducing dependence on central authorities and introducing a user-centric approach to identity management.  Selective Personal Privacy Information Disclosure: Verifiable credentials enable selective disclosure of information, ensuring that only necessary details are shared, enhancing privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.<br>Example: Imagine you’re registering for an online platform that requires your age and address. In a traditional setup, you might have to provide your complete identification, including information like your full address. With verifiable credentials, you can share only the necessary details for the registration process. You present a credential confirming you are over 18 without disclosing your address. This way, you selectively share information, maintaining your privacy while fulfilling the platform’s requirements.  Enhanced Security: By reducing reliance on traditional credentials and introducing cryptographic verification, decentralized identity and <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> enhance the overall security posture of parliamentary access.  <p>Advantages of Passwordless Authentication</p><p>1. Security Fortification: Mitigate the risks associated with traditional methods, including password breaches and inadvertent sharing, with our state-of-the-art authentication technologies.</p><p>2. User-Centric Experience: Simplify the user experience by eliminating the need for memorized passwords, thereby reducing friction and enhancing accessibility.</p><p>3. Operational Efficiency: Streamline administrative processes by minimizing the need for password resets and support, resulting in cost savings and increased operational efficiency.</p><p>4. Privacy Assurance: Uphold privacy standards by allowing users to control the information they share, aligning seamlessly with evolving data protection regulations.</p><p>Unlocking the Future of Digital&nbsp;Security</p><p>In conclusion, the recent incidents underscore the urgency for a paradigm shift in security. Embracing passwordless authentication is not just a technological upgrade, it’s a commitment to safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining the integrity of digital systems, and empowering users with secure and user-friendly access. As we navigate the digital age, adopting advanced identity management systems is not just an option, it’s a necessity to uphold the trust and security of our democratic institutions.</p><p>Recently, we achieved significant recognition, securing a top-three position in the ‘FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 — India’ (<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-awards-winner-and-top-finalists-of-developer-challenge-india/">see an official announcement</a> from FIDO Alliance), The theme for this challenge was ‘Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication’.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Reality and Digital Reality 
<p>Navigating these two worlds isn't always seamless, especially when it involves translating our physical identity documents into the digital sphere. Just recall the last time you witnessed your passport being scanned for digital records when opening a bank account. Going from physical to digital is usually not the most secure or smooth process. Particularly for identity documents, it's a challenge to ensure they maintain their trustworthiness and verifiability in the transfer.</p>
<p>Going from physical to digital has been a bumpy ride, which is why a digital “wallet” populated with digital credentials that are shared in both digital and physical ways is a game changer for individuals and organizations.</p>
 The Game-Changer 
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable verified IDs</a>—a game-changer in seamlessly navigating our digital and physical worlds. A verified identity refers to digital identities that have been verified to describe a real-world identity in digital form, and that the verification remains valid throughout the identity lifecycle. Reuse means that the verified identity can be used in multiple contexts. This ranges from being used by the issuing organization multiple times – like using a verified attribute like facial biometrics as an authentication factor – to enabling the verified identity to be reused by organizations independent of the issuing organization – like an employer accepting a verified education credential for a new hire.</p>
<p>Reusable verified IDs give an opportunity to leap the hurdle posed by the evolving landscape of a multi-reality, multi-wallet, and multi-credential world. Reusable verified identities are held by the individual that it describes, allowing them to travel with the individual through different applications – be it in virtual interactions or in person.</p>
 Interoperability: Critical for Success 
<p>This individually-held verified ID presents a valuable opportunity for organizations to securely and smoothly identify their customers, employees, partners, or things, but requires interoperability across multiple dimensions: with an organization’s own systems, and with other reusable verified identity solutions. The reusable identity community is unique in that from very early on it accepted that in order to achieve mass adoption of the method, it must adhere to commonly agreed upon standards. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification is one of the foundations that is being used to ensure interoperability between otherwise competing reusable verified identity solutions.</p>
<p>As technology advances and standards for secure digital identities evolve, the potential for a smoother, safer, and more efficient exchange between our physical and digital identities becomes increasingly tangible. It's a transformative step towards harmonizing our existence across both realms, promising a future where our identities move with ease, irrespective of the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>, we will be discussing the role that reusable verified identities play for the enterprise, along with many supporting technologies, like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/decentralized-identity">decentralized identity</a> and identity verification. Join us in Berlin this June!</p>

 The World of Web 3 



<p>Web 3 represents a revolutionary convergence between the physical and digital worlds, triggering an unprecedented cultural, technological and mindset transformation. This new digital era not only redefines our interaction with technology, but also reshapes our perception of digital identity, ownership, security and community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By integrating advanced technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality, Web 3 facilitates immersive and personalized experiences, expanding the scope of our digital existence and redefining the structure of our social and economic relationships. This innovative fusion of the physical and digital not only enhances our daily lives, but also drives a mindset shift towards greater interconnectedness and global collaboration.</p>



<p>Having said that, the distinction between Verifiable Information and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is extremely important for Web 3. While SSI focuses on the self-management of personal digital identity, allowing users to control and distribute their own information, Verifiable Information has a broader scope. This concept extends to areas such as records, customs, security and contracts, where authenticity and verification are critical. Here, Verifiable Information is not limited to personal identity, but encompasses any data or information that can be used to verify the authenticity of a person’s identity.</p>



<p>In other words, SSI is a very relevant use case within the immense potential of Verifiable Information.</p>



Digital Identity in Web3



<p>Both systems ensure greater efficiency and speed in processes such as data verification, thus reducing operational costs. They also improve security and trust in digital transactions, which is essential in an increasingly interconnected and technology-dependent world. In short, these technologies – properly implemented – offer greater value and a better experience at a lower cost in a world that is already embracing these technological innovations in various sectors.</p>



 “Digital self-sovereignty,” “Decentralized Identity,” “Blockchain Identity?” 



<p>Defining the concept of “sovereignty” in the context of SSI presents a particular complexity in addressing human and non-human identities. Inspired by politics, sovereignty implies control and power over others. By exploring the notion of “self-sovereignty” and “autonomy” in these identities, it is intended to go beyond mere individual data management.</p>



<p>While terms such as “decentralized identity” or “blockchain identity” are used, self-sovereignty implies the autonomous issuance of identities while ensuring their portability and verification independently of specific networks or blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other concepts, such as “self-managed data,” might apply in certain contexts, none fully captures the duality of being self-issued and, at the same time, globally portable and verifiable.</p>



<p>Whether using terms such as “self-sovereignty,” “autonomy,” “decentralized identity,” or “blockchain identity,” the essence is quite similar: the aspiration is to decentralize, protect, and empower users by granting them full control over their identities. Autonomy of issuance, combined with portability and independent verifiability, represents our fundamental commitment to providing a more secure and empowering approach to managing identities, both human and non-human.</p>



 SSI Use Cases 



<p>The following use cases demonstrate the versatility and positive impact that Verifiable Information and SSI can have in a variety of industries, driving significant advancement in efficiency, security and user experience.</p>



 
 Customs: streamlining identity verification processes for the clearance of goods, improving security and reducing waiting time. 



 Contracts: facilitates authentication of the parties involved, ensuring the validity and transparency of agreements. 



 Medical and legal records: enables secure and controlled access to sensitive information, maintaining privacy and confidentiality. 



 Banking: improves security in financial transactions, reducing fraud, high cybersecurity costs and identity theft. 



 Enterprises: optimizes employee and customer identity management, improving operational efficiency. 



 Security and cybersecurity: strengthens authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting against unauthorized access. 



 Identity recognition: applied in access control and customer verification, improving user experience and security. 



 Public and private services: Simplifies registration processes and access to services, guaranteeing the integrity of user data. 
 







 As a conclusion 



<p>This article has explored the immense potential of Web 3 in merging the physical and the digital. We have differentiated between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Information</a> and SSI, highlighting their varied use cases. We also clarified concepts such as “decentralized identity” and “sovereignty” in the <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/the-global-decentralized-id-self-sovereign-identity-journey/">context of SSI</a>.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 24th December to 7th&nbsp;January <p>Welcome to our first 2024 overview of the regulatory landscape worldwide. In this Veriscope Regulatory Recap edition, we focus on a number of key developments — from Nigeria’s policy turnaround to the UAE’s stringent AML&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Developments <p>As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, regulatory landscapes are shifting in response. From Nigeria’s reversal of crypto bans to the UAE’s new AML regulations, nations are acknowledging the significance of these emerging&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Nigeria’s Regulatory Reversal: In a notable policy shift, Nigeria’s Central Bank has lifted its ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This move aligns with efforts by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a digital asset framework. Banks and financial institutions are now authorized to provide services to crypto firms under stringent regulatory adherence, marking a significant change from the February 2021 prohibition.</p><p>Indonesia’s Exchange Mandate: Indonesia is steering its crypto exchanges towards a centralized bourse, the Commodity Future Exchange (CFX). The move aims to streamline crypto transactions for tax purposes and improve market oversight. With a burgeoning number of crypto traders surpassing stock traders, this mandate could reshape Indonesia’s digital asset landscape.</p><p>China’s Call for Global Crypto Cooperation: China’s Central Bank has proposed a six-point blueprint for DeFi security, emphasizing global collaboration. Through this initiative, the Chinese Central Bank seeks to target insider trading and volatility risks, proposing enhanced supervisory measures and regulatory harmonization.</p><p>UAE Adopts FATF Travel Rule: The UAE is fortifying its anti-money laundering efforts by incorporating the FATF Travel Rule in digital asset transactions. With this approach, the UAE aims to enhance transaction transparency and combat illicit activities, signaling the UAE’s commitment to a stringent regulatory environment.</p><p>These developments reflect a global trend towards integrating digital assets into formal economic structures. As nations grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies, the global financial community watches keenly. This period of regulatory recalibration and adaptation will likely shape the future trajectory of the digital asset industry.</p> Indonesia Imposes New Bourse Registration Directive on Crypto Exchanges <p>Indonesia marks a significant shift in its cryptocurrency framework by introducing a mandatory registration requirement for all crypto exchanges with the newly established national bourse, the Commodity Future Exchange (CFX). This directive aims to address the rapidly growing interest in cryptocurrency within the country, where the number of crypto traders surpasses that of stock&nbsp;traders.</p><p>The impact of this move on the crypto ecosystem is multifaceted. Positively, it could enhance investor confidence by fostering a more regulated and secure trading environment. This structure potentially increases global investor interest and legitimizes the crypto market in Indonesia.</p><p>On the downside, the requirement for registration and adherence to new guidelines might pose challenges for smaller exchanges and startups, possibly hindering innovation and competition in the sector. Furthermore, the focus on transaction tracking for tax purposes raises concerns about privacy among crypto enthusiasts.</p> UAE Tightens Crypto Oversight with New AML and Travel Rule Adherence <p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">has updated its Anti-Money Laundering rules</a>, incorporating provisions for digital assets. This includes enforcing the FATF’s Travel Rule and enhancing transparency in virtual asset transactions. The move aims to align with global standards against money laundering and terrorism financing, extending requirements beyond traditional financial bodies to include varied financial actors.</p><p>The updated rules also recognize digital assets as a legitimate payment method, signaling greater acceptance in the financial system. This dual approach of stringent compliance and legitimization could boost the UAE’s standing as a crypto-regulatory leader while potentially affecting the operational ease of crypto entities due to enhanced scrutiny.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">User Signing Now Available on Shyft Veriscope</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/2023-in-review-shyfts-pivotal-steps-toward-trust-on-the-blockchain">2023 in Review: Shyft’s Pivotal Steps Toward Trust on the Blockchain</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;Kingdom</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 The Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM) confirms that IDCheck.io, the AI-based identity verification solution, is suitable for age verification in accordance with the youth protection treaty in Germany 



<p>Munich, January 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announces that its fully automated, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">AI-based solution IDCheck.io</a> has been positively assessed by the German Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (<a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/">Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz, KJM</a>) for the use of age verification. With this latest confirmation, IDcheck.io joins the extensive list of IDnow solutions already rated as positive by the KJM for age verification. Previously, the videochat-based VideoIdent, AutoIdent, IDnow eID and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> were among the solutions approved for age verification by the Commission.</p>



<p>Protection of minors via age verification systems</p>



<p>The German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag, JMStV) stipulates that certain unsuitable content, such as AO-rated video and browser games, gambling offers or pornography, may only be distributed online if the provider ensures that it is only available for adult user groups. In order to ensure such closed, adult-only user groups, age verification systems (AV systems) are used. The KJM publishes a list of evaluated age verification systems which fulfil the legal requirements to provide legal and planning security for providers and operators of such content.</p>



<p>“There are corners of the internet that contain content best unseen by child or adolescent eyes. However, curious young minds will often go searching for these, so there needs to be a method of gatekeeping on these websites that goes beyond asking a user to simply click a button to confirm or deny their adult status, which is what the KJM stands for in Germany. With IDCheck.io, IDnow is pleased to offer yet another solution for online age verification, which has been rated positively by the KJM. With our broad range of identity verification methods, IDnow remains a strong partner for the protection of minors, especially in the gaming and gambling space,“ says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>

<p>Digital wallets are necessary but not nearly sufficient for effective verifiable credentials. Here I look at the essential details for verifying credentials that have nothing to do with wallets.</p>
<p>We use metaphors to make sense of novel phenomena in everyday terms. In technology, successful metaphors reduce non-intuitive concepts to concise, clear mental images. Metaphors shape how we think about things (noting that shape is itself a metaphor!)</p>
<p>Really catchy metaphors can capture our imagination to the extent that we stop thinking about how things really work. A powerful metaphor can distract instead of illuminate.</p>
<p>For example, the passport metaphor has dominated digital identity. In the early 2000s, Microsoft even named its e-commerce single-sign-on service “Passport”. It has taken the industry many years to wean itself off the single global identifier implied by that metaphor and graduate to a more nuanced model of contextualised credentials (see also “<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/no-such-thing-as-a-passport">No such thing as a passport</a>”).</p>
<p>So now I wonder if the popular metaphor of digital wallets is similarly diverting attention from the important work that needs to be done to make verifiable credentials truly verifiable at scale. </p>
<p>Renowned payments and digital identity commentator David Birch sees digital wallets as “<a href="https://dgwbirch.com/speaker/">the central organising principle for consumers [in the metaverse]</a>”. But I think the real organisation of payments and credentials is done well outside the digital wallet.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are certainly necessary, as personally controlled stores of credentials and secure carriers of our all-important private keys. The wallet is the graphical user interface to what is essentially a container of credentials and private keys. But wallets are not nearly sufficient to enable digital credentials to be meaningful and verifiable. If we focus too much on the container then we may overlook where the hard work remains to be done.</p>
 What are wallets for? 
<p>The wallet metaphor of course is all about cards. Our traditional wallets hold lots of them: payment cards, driver licences, government and professional IDs, employee IDs, transit cards, health cards, student cards, loyalty cards, club membership cards and so on. Most of these are candidates for analog-to-digital conversion.&nbsp; Indeed, payment cards and driver licences are the leading examples of cryptographically verifiable credentials. The Apple and Google wallets started with payments and are now adding driver licences (slowly and carefully).</p>
<p>Digital wallets will become quasi-standard doorways into much of cyberspace, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/digital-wallets-to-be-as-essential-as-browsers-openwallet-foundation-calls-for-builders">perhaps as crucial as web browsers</a> have been. With big tech poised to monopolise the way consumers exercise their digital credentials, the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/02/01/the-wallet-wars-are-not-about-money-they-are-about-identity/?sh=149889fe314a">wallet wars</a>” are looming.</p>
 The real action is outside the wallet and beyond the cards! 
<p>Credit cards are a modern-day miracle when you think about it: I can present an Australian credit card to almost any merchant in almost any country to buy most anything.&nbsp; The merchant doesn’t know me but what really matters is it doesn’t need to know my bank either or anything at all about the Australian financial system.</p>
<p>How is it possible? The answer illuminates the real role of the card and wallet, and the unsung power of the business networks.</p>
<p>A credit card is just a container of data which is issued by a customer’s bank and which needs to be conveyed to the merchant’s bank. It is clearly one instance of a general pattern: the card carries data about its holder, provided by a recognised issuer, to be presented to and ingested by a relying party.</p>
<p>But there is more to the story than carrying data. The essential complexity goes unnoticed by cardholders and extends way beyond the card:</p>
 
 card manufacture and customisation, in specially managed secure production plants 
 secure distribution and activation of cards (not to mention the test of the card lifecycle including renewal, replacement and retirement) 
 anti-counterfeiting technology to assure the merchant that the card presented is valid 
 a choice of standardised interface technologies for presenting cards to diverse retail systems (e.g. merchant terminals, kiosks, and remote card-not-present arrangements) 
 and above all, the legal and business arrangements whereby branded cards are accepted by merchants and payments then cleared between customer and merchant banks. 
 
<p>So a wallet is just a container of containers.</p>
 The network effects 
<p>Card schemes are more about business networks than the cards.</p>
<p>A card scheme operates a two-sided network which caters to both cardholders and merchants, via their respective banks. The scheme sets a raft of participation rules for the issuance of cards to customers and the acceptance of cards by merchants.</p>
<p>Cardholders and merchants are joined to the scheme via their respective banks. An issuing bank creates credit accounts for its customers and issues branded cards under a given scheme, such as Mastercard or Visa.</p>
<p>An acquiring bank provides merchants with credit card acceptance equipment and/or software services under a standardised merchant services agreement and takes care of the payment processing.</p>
<p>(A credit card acquirer does a whole lot more, such as providing payment guarantees, deposit timing, additional layers of security and fraud controls, to name a few, but these extras do not concern us right now; the current discussion is just about card acceptance.)</p>
 What made digital credit cards so much better? 
<p>The credit card has just one job to do: securely convey a copy of the cardholder’s details to the merchant together with signals to give the merchant confidence that the customer presenting the card is legitimate.</p>
<p>Over several decades, credit card technology has evolved to make the presentation of cardholder details more reliable, especially in regards to theft and illicit replay or tampering.</p>
<p>Old fashioned magnetic stripe cards store cardholder data in a short ferrite tape, much like a cassette tape stores music. There is no encryption; the data is held in a standard plaintext format, making it easily scanned and copied using commonplace equipment. This is what enabled large scale criminal skimming and carding to take over customer accounts.</p>
<p>Chip cards are very different, in two respects. Firstly, they carry cardholder details in a data structure that is digitally signed by the issuing bank when the card is manufactured, thus proving that each credit card is original and genuine.</p>
<p>And secondly, when cardholder details are transferred to a merchant terminal in a transaction, they are dynamically signed by the chip, thus proving that the card has been unlocked (it won’t operate to produce the signed transaction otherwise) and is therefore likely to be in the right hands.</p>
<p>The static and dynamic cryptographic functions make counterfeiting or copying chip cards infeasible.</p>
<p>Upgrading credit cards from magnetic stripe to chip was the single most important enhancement in the history of card payment security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile virtual credit cards share the same cryptographic security techniques as chip cards, but the crucial details are hidden from the cardholder; all they see is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphic</a> wallet user interface and its familiar images.</p>
 The lessons of credit cards for verifiable credentials 
<p>As mentioned, digital wallets are getting all the attention in the move to cryptographically verifiable credentials.&nbsp; But why do we spend so much time designing digital experience and trust frameworks around a component that has played no part in system security?</p>
<p>Why do we bother with the wallet metaphor at all? Real world wallets are actually an uninteresting part of the payments system.</p>
<p>It is the credit card network that critically enables digital credentials from vetted issuers to be securely loaded to a customer’s card.</p>
<p>Being prepared to accept credentials requires extensive arrangements to be made in advance, including knowing what types of credentials to expect, and having the right public keys with which to verify the various digital signatures on the credentials and the presentations.</p>
<p>It’s this last aspect that needs the most attention for verifiable credentials to scale. Verifiable credentials need to be legible when the RP is at arms’ length from the issuer and can’t afford to make its own arrangements regarding all the different credentials and issuers, and which of them are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>I agree wallets are important, yet carrying cards is the easy part of payments and credentialing systems. The wallet metaphor does not illuminate much of the real problem to be solved in verifiable credentials, omitting the essential underlying infostructure needed to (a) load the right verifiable credentials from the many issuers coming onto the market, and (b) make credentials legible at scale.</p>

 An increase in candidate fraud is presenting a real risk for the HR industry, especially for remote recruiters. We delve into the history of document fraud, and explain how businesses can protect themselves from the different types of recruitment fraud. 



 



<p>In 1934, Albert Einstein wrote: “Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors.” Although he was likely referring to his discoveries of the atom, and what, just a few years later, was to become the atomic bomb, Einstein’s quote also sums up the responsibility of those who create and rely on the latest technological advances. Thanks to the rapid pace at which the world has gone digital, technological innovation has produced risks that must be navigated in every industry, even in the recruitment sector.  </p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">Document fraud</a> has always existed, from the earliest days of identity documents. For example, in 16th century France during the reign of François I the emergence of the first attempts to curb this already widespread scourge started occurring when people falsified their identity papers to avoid paying taxes. According to Christophe Naudin in his publication Document fraud: the explosion of a cross-disciplinary crime at the crossroads of all forms of trafficking he states,&nbsp;“To avoid paying tithes and gabelles (taxes for the church and for common goods), Jean du Moulin, who generally signed his name with a simple anonymous cross, claimed to be called Jean Meunier or Jean Blanc or Leblanc, or even Moulinier, swearing before God and all his saints that he had fulfilled his duties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud is one of those reprehensible acts that persist and mutate constantly, despite the inventiveness and ongoing technological advances developed to curb it. Thanks to the democratization of digital tools, the explosion in mobility and widespread access to the Internet, this type of crime is becoming increasingly popular among unscrupulous individuals who are prepared to falsify documents and information to achieve their ends. And the HR industry is no exception…</p>



 Understanding the different types of hiring fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>To grasp the impact of document fraud on recruiters and companies likely to hire a fraudster, it is necessary to understand the risks, and therefore the types of fraud.</p>



 Application fraud. 



<p>Application fraud refers to any information provided by the candidate that is invented or altered by him or her. Examples include, falsifying the ability to speak a foreign language, lying about experience abroad or exaggerating involvement in a project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Difficult to identify when reading a CV or application file, application fraud is nevertheless easily detectable when the candidate is confronted with his or her lie during an interview or the first few days on the job. For example, a simple foreign-language proficiency test during the interview will suffice to reveal the fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often of low intensity, application fraud is extremely widespread: in 2022, 62% of recruiters in France admitted to having already observed falsified CVs during recruitment. However, application fraud often only materializes through slight alterations, with the “enormities” rarely going unnoticed. The final risk for the recruiter is therefore relatively low.</p>



 Document fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>Document fraud involves the creation or use of falsified documents by the candidate. This may include forging identity documents, falsifying diplomas or forging credentials. It differs from application fraud in that the fraudulent candidate will attempt to “justify” the invented information by producing documents attesting to the accuracy of the lie in question. In some cases, it may also involve identity theft. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a fraud scheme can <a href="https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/rttn/2022/2022-report-to-the-nations.pdf">last 12 months before detection and costs companies a loss of $8,300 a month</a>. </p>



<p>This method of fraud is becoming increasingly widespread, facilitated by the use of technological tools (not to mention the use of Artificial Intelligence). Today, easy access to DarkWeb platforms, for example, enables anyone to obtain false papers for just a few hundred euros. Such is the democratization that it is now possible to find resellers of false identity papers on mainstream applications, such as SnapChat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud, unlike application fraud, is a major challenge for a growing number of institutional and private players. Mainly centered around the falsification and creation of false identity documents (CNI, passport, etc.) or proof of identity (invoices, transport tickets, etc.), it presents a significant multi-factorial risk for end employers:</p>



<p>Legal: the irregularity of certain documents, particularly identity documents, can lead to severe legal consequences for the final employer: closure of the company, criminal liability of the director or even substantial fines. In France, regulations place the responsibility for verifying identity and professional documents on the employer, particularly in the event of an incident involving the fraudulent employee.</p>



<p>Reputational: The reputational stakes for companies that fall victim to fraud can be substantial. Organizations that are perceived as exploiting vulnerable, irregular or law-breaking workers risk damage to their brand image, which is sometimes more damaging than a simple fine.</p>



<p>Regulatory: In some sectors, companies require licenses or authorizations to operate. The employment of illegal workers can lead to the revocation of these licenses or authorizations, and seriously hinder company operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to document fraud having been identified as a critical issue by a growing number of players, there has been an increase in the number of training courses and job openings aimed at combating it, both within institutions and private companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it is the main threat facing recruiters today, document fraud and its implications for recruitment processes will be the main focus.</p>



 Document fraud and legal obligations.&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to recruitment in the EU, each country is regulated by law, and can be subject to regular checks by various government bodies. For example, the recruitment of an illegal worker can have a severe impact on a company, even if the latter demonstrates in good faith that it was unaware of the fraud.&nbsp;Plus, it is the company’s right to <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/employment-contracts/employment-terms/index_en.htm">ask a potential employee their abilities such as foreign language skills</a> as long as they correlate to the job posting.</p>



<p>This legislative and jurisprudential framework is constantly evolving and requires dedicated regulatory monitoring.&nbsp;Even in the UK, Crowe, a UK-based accountancy firm along with the University of Portsmouth, <a href="https://www.crowe.com/uk/croweuk/-/media/Crowe/Firms/Europe/uk/CroweUK/PDF-publications/The-Real-Cost-of-Recruitment-Fraud-2019.ashx?la=en-GB&amp;hash=1EFDFE2F6EEFFC4C71781638A0B8A354DAA00404">carried out Resume and CV checks</a> of an unnamed organization’s 5,000 employees and found 80% contained discrepancies, with 20% using inflated job titles and 12% falsifying educational grades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deal with these threats while complying with European regulations (notably the GDPR), technological solutions have emerged to facilitate the work of recruiters. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is at the heart of these solutions. But the democratization of technologies enabling the falsification or creation of documents that can be used as proof of identity (passports, proof of residence, licenses, etc.) now requires the implementation of more robust, granular and detailed processes and solutions, in order to get to know candidates properly.</p>



<p>To this end, IDnow has developed various technical solutions to respond to these new threats:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">Real-time document capture</a>: using a web or mobile SDK that can be easily integrated into an existing interface, this increases the level of security while saving considerable time thanks to its many advantages (real-time photo or video capture, fluid, multi-channel UX, NFC chip reading, etc.).&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">Facial recognition and live detection</a>: biometric face capture enables us to use a video verification to ensure that the user is who they claim to be on their documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/verification-documents/">Instant document verification</a>: as a stand-alone API or integrated into an architecture, it enables virtually instantaneous verification (averaging 12 seconds) of the authenticity and validity of documents submitted.&nbsp;  



<p>These solutions enable recruiters to detect document fraud, and are capable of detecting the most elaborate forgeries.</p>



 Identifying the right solution: what are the key criteria?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous solutions, such as those from IDnow, have appeared over the last 10 years to enable recruiters to work while protecting their companies from fraud. But are all solutions the same?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finding the right solution involves more than a simple economic calculation. It must offer a number of advantages, which can be prioritized as follows:</p>



  Reliability: The reliability of the tests carried out by the identity verification solution is the main criterion recruiters should aim for. The solution must provide its user with guarantees as to the results provided.&nbsp;  Transversality: The solution should incorporate the latest technologies for advanced fraud detection, with the option of live detection, face-matching or state-of-the-art occlusion techniques. It should also include the option of additional expert checks.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The solution should offer a wide range of options in terms of the type and range of documents covered, enabling checks to be customized according to the candidate’s profile, the documents provided, the employer’s expectations and the relevant regulatory framework.&nbsp;  Speed: It’s important that the solution delivers fast, near-instantaneous results, so as not to overburden the recruitment process and congest the recruitment department.&nbsp;  Rationality: The solution should meet the economic constraints of the recruiter and its organization, and be adapted to its needs: volume of candidates, frequency of recruitment, type of checks required, etc.  



<p>To meet these challenges, IDnow has developed a range of solutions and tools tailored to the risks identified. Using the established typology, here’s how IDnow addresses the issues identified:</p>



  Reliability: With 99.9% document fraud detection reliability, IDnow’s remote identity verification solution brings peace of mind to its users. In case of doubt, fraud experts can intervene to verify or complete the analysis made by the automatic solution.&nbsp;  Transversality: Based on the latest technologies in terms of occlusion, live detection and face matching, IDnow’s solutions are constantly updated by teams of dedicated document fraud experts to identify the latest fraud trends.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The IDnow solution can be customized, enabling recruiters to adjust their checks intuitively and efficiently.&nbsp;  Speed: with an average processing time of 12 seconds, the speed of verification brings unrivaled fluidity to recruitment, particularly in the case of high volumes.&nbsp;  Rationality: Available in several formats and options, the IDnow sales team is committed to offering its customers and partners solutions tailored to their needs and budgets.

  <p>Let’s continue our discussion on preventing data exfiltration. In previous blogs, we shared Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">approach to securing authentication sessions</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) and discussed <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">securing cross-tenant access</a> with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">Tenant Restrictions v2</a>. Today our topic is stolen authentication artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stolen authentication artifacts – tokens and cookies – can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to everything the victim had access to. Up until a few years ago, token theft was a rare attack and was most often exercised by corporate Red Teams. Why? Because it’s simpler to steal a password than a cookie. However, with multifactor authentication (MFA) becoming more prevalent, we’re seeing real-life attacks involving artifact theft and replay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before diving into details, it’s important to note that Microsoft recommends that the first line of defense against token theft is protecting your devices by deploying endpoint protections, device management, phishing-resistant MFA, and antimalware, as described in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/16/token-tactics-how-to-prevent-detect-and-respond-to-cloud-token-theft/">Token tactics: How to prevent, detect, and respond to cloud token theft | Microsoft Security Blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s discuss types of authentication artifacts and what techniques are recommended for each type to minimize the impact of theft. All authentication artifacts can be roughly divided into two buckets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Sign-in session artifacts, maintain single sign-on (SSO) and app state between the client and Entra ID. 
 Apps session artifacts, grant data access to client applications. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be obvious that the first priority would be protecting the most powerful device SSO artifacts - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token">Primary Refresh Tokens</a> (PRT). The good news is that PRTs on all operating system&nbsp;platforms have been hardened against theft from day one. The level of protection depends on operated system capabilities, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token#how-is-the-prt-protected">Windows offering the strongest protection</a>. PRT protection is not controllable by policy and is always on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering similar protection for all artifacts is on our roadmap, but delivering these capabilities is going to be a multi-year journey. If you want to learn more about various challenges of building comprehensive protection against token theft, watch this <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2022/token%20theft%20hip%20kids%20are%20doing%20it%20now%20what%20are%20we%20going%20to%20do%20about%20it">RSA presentation</a>. In the meantime, you can reduce token theft by carefully orchestrating Entra ID security products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of sign-in session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756#:~:text=Token%20Protection%20ensures%20that%20tokens%20can%20only%20be,users%20and%20data%20against%20breaches%20involving%20token%20theft.">Conditional Access: Token protection policy</a>&nbsp;offers cryptographic protection against replay of stolen tokens. This feature leverages and builds on top of already existing cryptographic protections of PRTs. When token protection policy is on, use of unprotected sign-in sessions is blocked. In combination with PRT protection always being on, it extends cryptographic protection to all renewable artifacts. Token protection is in public preview for Office and Outlook on Windows. Start in report-only mode first to evaluate the impact for your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client Applications that are not yet in scope of token protection can be protected by enabling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">compliant network check</a> for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a>. This policy will ensure that authentication artifacts always come from your organization’s network. It means that stolen tokens can only be replayed from your organization’s network, thus significantly reducing blast radius of the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of app session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your network configuration, you might be able block usage of stolen access tokens and workload cookies outside of your corporate network by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">Conditional Access: Block access by location</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">strictly enforce location policies for continuous access evaluation (CAE)</a>. This new CAE enforcement mode blocks access from outside allowed IP ranges, thus blocking any usage of stolen tokens from outside your network and significantly reducing blast radius of the attack. To take advantage of this capability, your users must access both Entra ID and workloads from enumerable IP addresses. CAE strictly enforce locations policy can be enforced for corpnet users accessing data via Entra Global Secure Access (GSA) because Entra GSA is able to pass along IP address of user’s device. When configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/security/conditional-access-framework#named-locations">Named Locations</a> in Conditional Access (CA), make sure to include range of IP addresses from which your users access both Entra ID and workloads (e.g. SharePoint Online).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Detecting token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To detect stolen artifacts, you can enable risk detections with Microsoft Entra ID Protection to elevate user risk when token theft is suspected. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">Anomalous token</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#token-issuer-anomaly">token issuer anomaly</a>, and adversary in the middle detections can be indicative of token theft. Each detection is calculated offline, whereas anomalous token can also be calculated in real-time at sign-in to catch the threat and flag the sign in as compromised. To take full advantage of these detections, we recommend configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">risk-based access policies</a>&nbsp;to ensure your users have the proper policy controls applied when token theft is suspected. When risk-based access policies are applied against token theft detections, it forces the user to complete multifactor authentication and reset their password, and when applicable, require an admin to revoke user tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> works together with risk-based access policies to block resource access with tainted artifacts. When user risk increases, CAE issues signals to all CAE-capable workloads to enforce risk-based access policy immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As token theft attacks are becoming more prevalent Microsoft constantly improves defenses against such attacks. Stay tuned for new updates in this area soon.</p>

  The UK Crypto Travel Rule has no minimum threshold, as VASPs must collect basic information from all parties in a transaction, regardless of its&nbsp;value.  However, the breadth of information required depends on the transfer value, notably increasing for transactions exceeding £1,000.  With the Crypto Travel Rule active in the UK since September 2023, VASPs must diligently collect, verify, and share virtual asset transaction data to meet compliance standards.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">on September 1st</a>, 2023. This event was a result of a series of regulatory actions, starting on July 22nd, 2021 when <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/amendments-to-the-money-laundering-terrorist-financing-and-transfer-of-funds-information-on-the-payer-regulations-2017-statutory-instrument-2022">the HM Treasury published</a> a consultation seeking views on amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017.</p><p>It took up to mid-October that year to conclude the consultation, and by July 2022, the United Kingdom had published the amended regulations.</p><p>As part of the new regulations, UK authorities rolled out <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, a key requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The introduction was followed up with a public consultation on Travel Rule guidance, which concluded on August 25th,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>In between, the FCA had also clearly set out expectations on the nature of compliance that UK VASPs were required to&nbsp;follow.</p> The Genesis and Evolution of the Crypto Travel: UK and Elsewhere <p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">Financial Conduct Authority</a> was transparent and articulate about its motivation to implement the Crypto Travel Rule in the country. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFCA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1692166998225010747%7Ctwgr%5Ed1576ae642f907dbed1fd32e3b15eabbc9d640a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-crypto-travel-rule-comes-into-effect">tweet</a> dated August 17th, 2023, the FCA&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“The Travel Rule is designed to bring greater transparency to crypto asset transfers, making it harder for criminals to use crypto for illegal activity.”</blockquote><p>In brief, the Travel Rule requires UK-based VASPs to “collect, verify and share information” on crypto transfers.</p><p>For inbound payments from an overseas jurisdiction that has not implemented the Travel Rule yet, the VASPs were asked to conduct a risk-based assessment to ascertain whether the beneficiary qualifies to receive the transfer. The same should apply to outbound transfers.</p><p>Implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in the United Kingdom had global precedents, as countries like the United States, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, Canada, South Africa, Netherlands, etc., have already adopted&nbsp;it.</p><p>Singapore, for instance, implemented the Travel Rule as early as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">January 28th, 2020</a>. In Canada, it came into effect on <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">June 1st, 2021</a>. South Korea and Estonia implemented the travel rule on March 15th and 25th, respectively. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> enforced the same since June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>More countries began implementing the Travel Rule after the FATF called out countries to adopt it urgently, after its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html"> March 2022 survey</a> found only 29 of 98 jurisdictions had enforced&nbsp;it.</p> UK Crypto Travel Rule Compliance Requirements <p>The UK Crypto Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to UK-based crypto asset businesses, abbreviated as CBs. The regulations define these businesses as crypto asset exchange providers or custodian wallet providers.</p><p>Crypto asset exchange implies entities that facilitate the exchange of the crypto assets or arrange for it. On the other hand, the job of a custodian wallet provider is to offer services of holding crypto assets and cryptographic keys for its customers or make arrangements towards the&nbsp;same.</p><p>When it comes to CBs collecting, verifying, and sharing the relevant information, the quantum of information to be dealt with depends on the transfer amount. If the crypto asset transfer is worth below 1,000 pounds sterlings, the information includes the name and account number of the originator and the beneficiary.</p><p>If the transfer is worth above 1,000 pounds sterlings, the quantum of information to be collected increases. If the sender or originator of funds is a firm, the CBs would have to ask&nbsp;for:</p><p>(i) Customer Identification Number<br>(ii) Address of the&nbsp;firm.</p><p>And when the sender is an individual, the CBs would have to collect the following:</p><p>(i) Birth certificate number</p><p>(ii) Passport number / National identity card&nbsp;number</p><p>(iii) Date and place of&nbsp;birth</p><p>To be compliant with the regulations, the UK-based CBs would have to conduct rigorous due diligence. It is the firm’s responsibility to become compliant with the Travel Rule, even if the firm is leveraging the services of a third party. The implementation of the rule has to be regularly supervised.</p> How Does the UK Crypto Travel Rule Impact the Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets? <p>The UK’s adoption of the Crypto Travel Rule has significant implications for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, altering how they operate and interact within the global market. It mandates a new level of compliance, directly affecting various aspects of their business.</p> 1. Increased Responsibilities <p>UK-based cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers now face additional duties due to the Travel Rule. They must establish systems like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> or hire third-party services to collect, verify, and share transaction data. This means more work and investment in resources.</p> 2. Cost Optimization and Efficient Data&nbsp;Handling <p>VASPs need to manage the added workload efficiently and cost-effectively. They must develop systems that can securely and swiftly handle data collection and transmission.</p> 3. Transaction Threshold Management <p>A key aspect is managing the transaction threshold, which is set at 100 pounds. Due to the high volatility in the crypto market, determining whether a transaction meets this threshold can be challenging.</p> 4. International Disparities <p>With varying implementations of the Travel Rule globally, UK crypto firms must make strategic decisions on how to interact with jurisdictions that haven’t adopted similar regulations.</p> 5. Gather Necessary Information <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provides clear instructions for handling transfers to and from jurisdictions without the Travel Rule. UK firms are required to attempt to gather necessary information for outbound transfers and conduct risk assessments for inbound transfers from non-compliant jurisdictions.</p> 6. Adapting to Regulatory Evolutions <p>Lastly, these companies need to keep up with the changes in the Travel Rule and adapt accordingly as global regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies continue to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Travel Rule in the UK vs the World: A Comparison <p>Staying within the broad framework of FATF, different countries have tried different ways to optimize crypto travel rules in their&nbsp;country.</p><p>The United States, for instance, has a threshold of US$3,000. The European Union is yet to activate a threshold as the grace period is ongoing at present, with an enforcement date target of December 30th, 2024. Then, there are countries like Estonia that have already enforced the Travel Rule but have not kept any transaction threshold yet.</p><p>There are also differences in terms of how self-hosted wallets are approached across jurisdictions.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the requirement is that of collecting information from the VASP’s customers, whereas, in <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a> and Germany, the requirement goes a notch higher for identity verification of the unhosted wallet owner. In Switzerland, the requirements ask to establish proof of ownership over and above the identity verification needs.</p><p>With more and more countries implementing the FATF Travel Rule in their jurisdiction, new similarities and differences will&nbsp;emerge.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While evolution and amendments would be a reality throughout the lifetime of the regulation, the authorities would always have to be mindful of the core purpose of the Crypto Travel Rule, which is to advance the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering</a> mechanism and put a stop to financial crime.</p><p>To achieve this objective, the VASPs need to ensure that suspicious transactions are promptly detected, and effective screening is carried&nbsp;out.</p><p>Fraudulent actors often exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain technology, which only requires knowing the wallet address of the beneficiary and the private cryptographic key of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>While implementing the Travel Rule is a difficult requirement for crypto businesses to fulfill, it is for the benefit of the industry and its players that the Crypto Travel Rule UK implementation is dealt with utmost sincerity.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: Is there a minimum transaction threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in the&nbsp;UK? <p>No, there is no minimum threshold. VASPs must collect basic information for all transactions. However, for transactions over £1,000, VASPs need to collect more detailed information compared to transactions below this&nbsp;value.</p> Q2: When did the Crypto Travel Rule come into effect in the&nbsp;UK? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in the United Kingdom on September 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Q3: What are the compliance requirements for UK-based crypto businesses? <p>The UK-based crypto businesses must rigorously collect, verify, and share transaction data to comply with the Crypto Travel Rule. This includes detailed information on parties involved in transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Q4: How does the Travel Rule impact crypto exchanges and wallets in the&nbsp;UK? <p>It requires them to establish systems for efficient transaction data collection and management, impacting how they handle transactions and interact with global&nbsp;markets.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Dear Community,</p><p>Metadium continued to make significant advancements in DID in the year’s second half. As we express our gratitude to everyone who has been with Metadium in 2023, we would like to take a moment to review and summarize the key achievements and developments from the past six months before launching our new goals for&nbsp;2024.</p> Summary   From October to December 2023, 10,191,291 transactions and 41,912 DID wallets were&nbsp;created.  Bokbunja hard fork was successfully applied to the&nbsp;mainnet.  Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed following Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork.  The staking contract for Metadium Governance was upgraded.  Announcements were made regarding changes in BP and FeeCollector addresses, staking amounts, and META circulating supply.   Technology Updates:  Q4 Monthly Transactions <p>During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were f 10,191,291 transactions, and 41,912 DID wallets were created.(as of January&nbsp;2nd).</p> Launch of Wepublic&nbsp;Wallet <p>The existing DID wallet service, MYKEEPIN, was renewed and rebranded as Wepublic Wallet. Metadium’s DID technology was implemented in Wepublic Wallet, contributing to Wepublic DAO participants’ identity verification protocol.</p><p>Wepublic supports four decentralized protocols: identity proofing, credentialing, result proofing, and balance proofing. Metadium aims to enhance transparency in society and services within the DAO platform ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/mykeepin-renewal-open-with-wepublic-wallet-and-adding-dao-functionality-6d733c3f5ad3">here</a>.   Explorer Renewal <p>With the Bokbunja Hard Fork on October 31, the Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed. The Explorer was redesigned for improved functionality and usability, serving as the foundation to provide better services to the Community.</p><p>The renewal included a visually comfortable design, easy confirmation of transactions and DID creations, a reflection of Bokbunja Hard Fork details, adding the Name Tag&nbsp;feature.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-explorer-renewal-5db583d05b8a">here</a>.   Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork <p>On October 31, at 12 PM, the Bokbunja Hard Fork was successfully implemented on the mainnet -this groundbreaking upgrade aimed to enhance the Metadium network by introducing features, including fee delegation.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-update-bokbunja-hard-fork-8147ea32080e">here</a>.   Governance BP&nbsp;Upgrade <p>The staking contract is where Metadium governance members store their staking assets. A bulk transfer of staking assets was carried out to upgrade the staking contract. All the assets within the staking contract were transferred to the BP1 node wallet, serving as the contract owner. The total staking amount within the BP1 node wallet was subsequently moved to the newly upgraded staking contract.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-governance-upgrade-dabc9cc693a7">here</a>.   BP Staking Contract Asset&nbsp;Transfer <p>Assets were transferred to standardize the number of staking contracts to 5 million. If the BP quantity exceeded 5 million, the excess amount was unstaked and withdrawn. If the BP quantity was less than 5 million, an additional deposit was made for the insufficient quantity. The remaining amount was transferred to a non-circulating wallet that does not contribute to the circulating supply. Throughout this process, there was a change in the total staking&nbsp;amount.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/bp-staking-contract-asset-movement-amount-320b2e32126e">here</a>.   BP, FeeCollector Address Change and Circulating Supply&nbsp;Update <p>Voter addresses of BPs were changed, and the address of FeeCollector was registered. This change aimed to separate Voter addresses from Staker addresses and directed transaction fees to accumulate in the FeeCollector’s address.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-bp-update-details-b775447240dc">here</a>.   Business Partnerships:  Purchasing META for THEPOL&nbsp;Rewards <p>THEPOL purchases META from the market to use as a reward for app users. As the number of THEPOL users and activities increases, the reward demand grows, and THEPOL buys additional META from the market. This signifies the growth of Metadium’s DApp in&nbsp;action.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/thepol-has-bought-metadium-meta-to-use-as-a-user-reward-f4722257f047">here</a>.

<p>In this article, we explore the vLEI (verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) and KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). KERI is the technology that vLEI is built on.</p>
 What is vLEI? 
<p>vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity representing a secure digital form of a conventional LEI. To understand these concepts first, we have published <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/" title="articles introducing both LEI and vLEI">articles introducing both LEI and vLEI</a>.</p>
<p>vLEI is also an implementation of Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials">read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials</a>. In short, “verifiable” means each vLEI credential has cryptographic proof that enables a recipient or Verifier to cryptographically verify its integrity and authenticity.</p>
 What is KERI? 
<p>KERI is a modern Distributed Key Management System (DKMS) and is the protocol on which vLEI is built.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at how vLEI builds on the KERI architecture and what the most important KERI features are for vLEI.</p>
 &nbsp;KERI Architecture 
<p>This diagram represents a typical KERI architecture for vLEI. See below for a description of each term included in the diagram.</p>
<p></p>
 Signify Client 
<p>The end user or controller uses a Signify Client instance to perform KERI operations. Only the Signify Client has access to the private keys of the controller. It implements a “Signing at the edge” concept where the private keys are never exposed outside the context of the Signify Client. The Signify Client adds controller signatures to key event log entries.</p>
<p>Signify Client is not an end user application itself. Instead, it is a library that is embedded as a component in other applications, such as mobile wallets, web applications etc.</p>
 KERI Agent 
<p>This is the backend of a Signify Client. The KERI Agent manages the key event logs of each Signify Client and publishes signed key event logs to witnesses.</p>
 Witness Network 
<p>A KERI Witness receives key event logs with controller signatures from KERI Agents. For authenticity, the witness adds witness signatures to the key events, then makes the key event logs available to Verifiers.</p>
 Verifier 
<p>A controller uses Signify Client to create digital signatures and to send presentations of verifiable credentials to Verifiers. The Verifier will access key event logs provided by KERI Witnesses when verifying digital signatures and credential presentations. Comparing key event logs from multiple witnesses lets the Verifier mitigate against duplicity and other types of threats against key event logs.</p>
<p>Many types of applications can act as Verifiers. For example, Verifier functionality could be integrated in the backend of a web application or in document management systems where signatures of signed documents are verified.</p>
 KERI Features 
<p>The KERI key management system has many features. Below I expand on some of the most important features for vLEI.</p>
 Key management 
<p>Key management is the main function of KERI. Key management solves problems such as:</p>
 
 How do you make sure you are using the correct keys with your peers? 
 How do you signal to your peers you have changed or terminated your keys? 
 
 Key Event Log 
<p>The Key Event Log (KEL) is the basic construct of KERI. The KEL is a hash linked chain of key events. A KERI identifier represents a single distinct KEL. The KEL is the cryptographic ledger or block chain of KERI.</p>
<p>Inception, rotation, and interaction are examples of common events in a KEL. Every KEL begins with an inception event followed by other events. The hash value of the first inception event becomes the KERI identifier of a KEL. Many key event logs will be relatively small and rather static with only a few entries.</p>
<p>The controller of a KEL adds its controller signature to each event that gets added to a KEL. As events are added the controller continuously publishes the KEL to one or more witnesses who add their witness signature to each event in the KEL. Once the KEL has been published to witnesses, the KEL becomes immutable, and no past entries in the KEL can be modified or removed. The witness makes the KEL available to Verifiers.</p>
<p>By comparing KELs from multiple witnesses a Verifier can make sure the KEL is authentic and has not, for example, been duplicated, branched, or otherwise tampered with.</p>
 Pre-rotation 
<p>Pre-rotation is a unique feature of KERI, where only the current public key or keys are published in a KEL. Only the hashes or commitments of the next public keys are published. Pre-rotation improves security because no parts of the key material of the next keys are made public.</p>
 Delegation 
<p>KERI delegation is a cooperative mutual agreement between two KERI identifiers. Delegation requires cryptographic commitment from both parties. KERI delegation delegates signing authority to the delegate.</p>
<p>In vLEI, delegation is used between the GLEIF root (a KERI identifier that links back to everything within the eco-system, this link is what provides the delegate-able abilities to vLEI) and external identifiers, and between the GLEIF external and QVI identifiers.</p>
 Multi-sig 
<p>KERI multi-sig is a KERI identifier formed from a group of public keys. Each multi-sig may be given a signing threshold to control who has signing authority and to improve resilience. </p>
<p>For example, a group with a signing threshold of three out of three always requires participation of all members. This threshold sets a strict control on signing authority but does not improve resilience. If any of the members lost control of their key, the group could no longer operate and recover from the loss.</p>
<p>In vLEI currently, the GLEIF root has a threshold of three out of seven. GLEIF external is two out of five. The minimum requirement for QVI and Legal Entity identifiers is a group of two members.</p>
 ACDC credentials 
<p>The wider ‘KERI’ ecosystem provides a verifiable credential format known as Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. Credential chaining is a unique feature of ACDC credentials compared to most other Verifiable Credential formats present today.</p>
<p>When verifying an ACDC credential the Verifier will check the revocation status of the received credential and each of the chained credentials. This allows implementing advanced use cases where, for example, credential revocation authority is delegated to other actors than the issuer of the credential.</p>
<p>In vLEI, every credential is on a chain that leads up to the QVI credential issued by GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation) to the QVI.</p>
 vLEI Trust Model&nbsp;  
<p>The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework describes the trust model of vLEI in full. This is a distilled view of the most important roles and types of credentials.</p>
 GLEIF 
<p>The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) controls the vLEI root of trust with two multi-sig identifiers: GLEIF root and GLEIF external. The two identifiers are established with a delegation agreement. A member of the GLEIF multi-sig groups is called GLEIF Authorized Representative (GAR). The GARs will perform identity verification needed to issue QVI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI credential is issued by the GLEIF external identifier to Qualified vLEI Issuers. The root identifier will never issue any credentials. This way the root identifier can remain offline, while only the KEL of the root identifier is made public.</p>
 <p>Figure 2 – GLEIF identifiers for vLEI root of trust.</p> 
 Qualified vLEI Issuer 
<p>The Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) is an organization that has been qualified by GLEIF to act as an issuer of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members and that has established a delegation agreement with GLEIF external. </p>
<p>In addition, a QVI credential is issued by GLEIF external to the QVI. The QVI credential claims contain the LEI code of the QVI. The QVI credential is the top-most credential in the chain of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>A member of the QVI multi-sig group is called Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representative (QAR). The QARs will perform identity verification needed to issue vLEI, OOR and ECR credentials.</p>
 <p>Figure 3 – GLEIF authorizes the QVI by setting up delegation and issuing a QVI credential.</p> 
 Legal Entity  
<p>The Legal Entity (LE) is an organization that receives the vLEI credential.</p>
<p>The LE controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members.</p>
<p>A LE-vLEI credential is issued by the QVI to the LE. The LE-vLEI credential claims contain the LEI code and name of the LE. The LE-vLEI credential is chained to the QVI credential of the issuer. </p>
<p>A member of the LE multi-sig group is called Legal Entity Authorized Representative (LAR).</p>
 <p>Figure 4 – The QVI issues a vLEI credential to the Legal Entity.</p> 
<p>The LE may issue OOR and ECR authorization credentials to a QVI, to authorize the QVI to issue individual OOR and ECR credentials on its behalf. The LE may also directly issue individual ECR credentials.</p>
 OOR and ECR Authorization Credentials 
<p>Authorization credentials are issued to the QVI by the LE. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and role. The authorization credentials are chained to the vLEI credential of the LE. This way the LE has authority to revoke any OOR and ECR credentials. </p>
 OOR Credentials 
<p>Official Organization Role (OOR) credentials are issued to an individual person by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and official role as defined by ISO, from the authorization credential. The OOR credential is chained to the OOR authorization credential.</p>
<p>The QVI will verify information about Official Role assignment such as Chairman of the Board, CEO etc. from public records and perform identity verification needed to issue the OOR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 5 – An OOR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p> 
 ECR Credentials 
<p>Engagement Context Role (ECR) credentials are issued to an individual person either by the LE itself or by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and context role. The role name is context specific and defined by the LE. The ECR credential is either chained to the vLEI credential or the ECR authorization credential.</p>
<p>If the LE issues the ECR credential, then it is the responsibility of the LE to perform identity verification to a level that satisfies requirements of the LE.</p>
<p>If the LE authorizes the QVI to issue the ECR credential, for example to external contractors, then the QVI will perform identity verification needed to issue the ECR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 6 – An ECR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF71 is live today, Jan 4. It concludes on Jan 11. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF71   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.

DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

   Ready to get a start on understanding the latest digital identity credential standards? Two influential standards, ISO/IEC 18013 and W3C's Verifiable Credentials, offer different solutions for digital identity. Is one clearly better than the other? Well, no. Whether one is better than the other depends on. your use case. Choosing among these standards depends on your users' needs, the browsers you

<p>Staying informed about the latest digital identity standards and technology is more than a full-time job. Even focusing on just what’s available for the<a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/16/"> identifiers</a> that provide a way to recognize a (digital) identity is enough to keep a person gainfully occupied for a few years. Why a few years, you ask? Because these standards are still under development in many ways – this is a bleeding edge of digital identity. Let’s talk about the two of the most influential standards under development that inform so much of the activity in this space: the ISO/IEC 18013 specifications and the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 The tl;dr 



<p>The<a href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=18013"> ISO/IEC 18013</a> family of documents specifies the technical and operational requirements for physical and mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). The mdoc format, part of ISO/IEC 18013-5, refers to the structure and specifications for mobile driver’s licenses and similar electronic ID solutions. (18013-5 and the in-progress 18013-7 are the ones most identity people focus on). If you would like to read and implement according to these standards, be prepared to pay money to access them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> is a standard developed by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group within the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium. You can use Verifiable Credentials for any type of credential, from educational degrees to government IDs. Unfortunately, the identity industry has confused matters by using the generic term “verifiable credential” to sometimes mean something more or less different from the W3C Verifiable Credential format. If you want to read and implement according to the W3C Verifiabl Credential data format, go for it. Access to the specification is free.</p>



 Comparing mdoc/mDL and Verifiable Credentials 



&nbsp;ISO/IEC 18013-5W3C Verifiable CredentialPurposeDesigned explicitly to represent driver’s licenses and possibly other official IDs in a mobile format. It can be used for “secondary use cases,” such as anything you might use a physical driver’s license for that doesn’t involve driving. The ultimate case of YMMV.A standard that<a href="https://gataca.io/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials/"> can be used</a> for any type of credential, from educational degrees to memberships, and not limited to driving licenses or IDs.Standardizing BodyISO/IEC (a treaty-based, government-supported standards organization)&nbsp;Be prepared to pay to read the standard. If you’d like to<a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html"> participate</a> in developing the standard, you have a few more hoops to jump through.W3C (an industry-based standards organization that uses a tiered model for membership and engagement)&nbsp;Access to the standards is always free. The ability to vote on approving the standard requires a (paid)<a href="https://www.w3.org/membership/"> membership</a>. The ability to be a part of developing the standard or incubating an idea can be part of (paid) membership or (free) invited experts.Privacy and SecurityPrivacy is a strong consideration, but the focus is on a government credential and how governments need to use it. Protections are built in to ensure that data is shared only when necessary and (mostly) based on individual control. Because of the complexity involved, the use of am mDL is, at least as far as the specification is concerned, an in-person action. Remote use of these credentials is still a work in progress.Privacy is a strong consideration for the W3C as well. Since this specification is designed to support a broader set of use cases, there are privacy considerations to help the individual control what data is shared. There are also considerations about what data is collected since not all use cases require the same data.InteroperabilityThe ISO/IEC 18013-5 specification is trying to ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions, ensuring that a mobile driver’s license issued in one state or country can be read and verified in another, assuming both places follow the same ISO standard. Other use cases may take advantage of being interoperable if everyone uses the same format, but it’s worth remembering the underlying assumption of government use.The W3C VC specification is, as noted, designed for broad interoperability across the web. Interoperability means ensuring that various platforms, websites, and services can understand and verify the credentials. The underlying assumption here is that these credentials must be able to support use on the web by anybody, whether they be a company, a government, or the local pizza delivery service.



 Drama! Intrigue! Big Tech! 



<p>What we appear to have here is a general versus specific-purpose identifier format. Why not just use the one that fits your use case? Why all the drama?</p>



<p>In part, it comes down to resource availability. The costs grow for every standard or technology an organization has to support. Developer costs, UX designer costs, support team costs, they all add up. Even organizations the size of Google and Apple would very much like to limit what technologies they have to support. Anything else gets crazy expensive AND frustrates the individuals using their platforms with too many options.</p>



<p>In this case, Apple has<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/get-started-with-verify-with-wallet/"> focused on supporting</a> the ISO specification only, which frustrates some developers. Google hasn’t decided whether it will support one or both of these standards. Outside of browser-land, the European Union is working on an<a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/"> entire digital identity ecosystem</a>. It will support use cases in education, social security, and other services; their<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework"> architecture</a> specifically mentions both the W3C  and the ISO work.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the technology sector loves its ideology wars. From the command line<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"> editor wars</a> between vi versus emacs to decades of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars"> browser wars</a>, technologists get attached to their favorite tools. This also appears to be playing out here in the mdoc versus VC drama.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Both ISO’s guidelines and the W3Cs specifications are still evolving. Several critical features are still under active development, sometimes in other standards organizations (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID Foundation</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=selective+disclosure&amp;sort=&amp;rfcs=on&amp;activedrafts=on&amp;by=group&amp;group=">IETF</a>). Some of those features are raising <a href="https://github.com/WICG/identity-credential/blob/main/custom-schemes.md">significant concerns</a> from privacy advocates.  If you are going to implement something, be prepared to be flexible to future changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exploring these formats is necessary if you’re moving to a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) model. But that said, it’s not just about the content of the specifications. Also, review the use cases they are designed to support, what browser you expect your users to use, and even where you are in the world.</p>



 ETA: A Few More Thoughts 



<p>I love it when my posts spark discussion and feedback! <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> offered some great insight in a thread on Mastodon that I’m sharing here (to keep it in one place) with permission:</p>



<p>❖ The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM is a data model for describing a broad range of credentials and does not explicitly define the protocols used to move credentials defined using the VCDM from point A to Point B (provisioning and presentation)</p>



<p>❖ The ISO mDL is a tightly coupled mix of an explicitly defined set of data attributes that make up a digital version of a driver’s licence AND a protocol interface description for moving a credential composed of those attributes from a mobile device to a reader/verifier using NFC, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Aware protocols (in-person presentation); how that credential is provisioned to the mobile device from an issuing infrastructure is explicitly out of scope for the ISO mDL standard.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM supports and encourages the use of attribute and vocabulary transparency akin to how schema.org works; the ISO mDL vocabulary is part of the standard and as such is under the control of the ISO working group.</p>

Verida Mainnet is&nbsp;live Verida Network Mainnet is&nbsp;live <p>On December 28th, 2023, Verida Mainnet officially went live, marking the arrival of the first private self-sovereign data network for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>The Verida Network is the first self-sovereign database network for storing private data. The Verida Network is decentralized public infrastructure (DePIN) providing secure and private database infrastructure for users to own and control their private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today marks a massive milestone for the Verida community. The network is now a reality four years after its beginnings, and two years after the release of the Verida Whitepaper.</p><p>The Verida Testnet has reached over 35,000 accounts in late 2023 and we are excited to migrate those users across to Mainnet as soon as possible.</p> A new era for data control with&nbsp;DePIN <p>The Verida Mainnet launch signifies more than just Verida going live. It’s the start of a new era for personal data ownership. A time where anyone can choose to take control and ownership of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Whether you’re checking into a hotel, signing up for a new app, going to a doctor and filling out patient forms, or joining a crypto exchange, you’re always finding yourself in a situation where you’re handing over licence numbers, passport details, your home address, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>One in two people are victims of data breaches, caused by the centralization of user data, while large corporations have a monopoly over how to use our personal information.</p><p>We have no agency over what information we can share and what we can keep private in any given situation. Every time we share information, we increase our risk of being exposed in a data leak and falling mercy to data&nbsp;theft.</p><p>Verida is changing this status-quo and providing a new architecture for data ownership and application development that puts users front and centre, in control of their digital identity and personal&nbsp;data.</p> The growing Verida ecosystem <p>Verida is not enabling the personal data ownership vision alone. A growing ecosystem has emerged to contribute new capabilities and extensions to the infrastructure stack.</p><p>We’ve been working with key partners across web3, crypto and identity and data ecosystems to bring privacy-preserving decentralized technology to the&nbsp;world.</p>Verida Ecosystem<p>Explore the Verida Ecosystem further&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">here</a>.</p> Introducing the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>The Verida Mainnet is the production ready deployment of the Verida network for storing private, user data on mainnet storage nodes, controlled by private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>This release includes the deployment of the Verida DID method on Polygon PoS blockchain, enabling users to manage their self-sovereign identities. The Verida developer SDKs now support both Verida Testnet and Verida Mainnet for building dApps that handle private user data. See Developer Docs for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Existing <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/demos">demo applications</a> have been upgraded to operate on the Verida Mainnet, while the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> has been upgraded to support data storage using the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p> Getting started on the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>You will need to update to the latest <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> (iOS and Android) to access the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>We strongly recommend all Acacia Testnet users migrate their accounts to Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p><p>The <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions</a> rewards program will continue on the Verida Mainnet. It’s critical that existing Testnet users who have completed activities on Verida Missions, migrate their Testnet account to Mainnet, in order to retain their existing XP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a new Mainnet identity from scratch in the Verida&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Important: The Verida Wallet blockchain wallet currently supports testnet blockchain networks. Mainnet blockchain network support will be available shortly. Do not send mainnet tokens to your testnet addresses. See our <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides">user guides </a>on using testnet faucets to send tokens to your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Use your Mainnet identity to connect and use these&nbsp;apps:</p>  Verida Missions: <a href="https://missions.verida.network/">https://missions.verida.network/</a>  Markdown Editor (Demo): <a href="https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/">https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/</a>  <p>Explore the Verida&nbsp;Network:</p>  Network Explorer: <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">https://explorer.verida.network/</a>  <p>Get started with the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide">Verida Mainnet launch user&nbsp;guide</a>   How to migrate to the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>Users on the Acacia Testnet are recommended to migrate to Myrtle Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p> Verida Wallet&nbsp;Users   Update to the latest Verida Wallet version (available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault">Google Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  Choose the Testnet identity you want to migrate, and select “Migrate to Mainnet” on the home&nbsp;screen.  <p>Important: Do not close the Verida Wallet or switch to a different app while it is migrating. As a decentralized network, your mobile device is responsible for replicating your data between networks. It will likely take 2–5 minutes to migrate your data, depending on how many applications and how much data you have stored on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>See the<a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide"> Verida Mainnet Launch guide</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Application developers <p>Developer documentation has been updated to include details on switching between testnet and mainnet. There are two key changes for application developers to upgrade their applications to use the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  Update to latest&nbsp;SDKs  Change network from “TESTNET” to “MAINNET”  <p>See the Developers<a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/migrate-mainnet"> Migrate to Mainnet page</a> in the Developer Portal for more information.</p> Verida Missions and XP&nbsp;Rewards <p>Verida Missions and the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-missions-now-live-join-the-mission-and-pave-the-way-for-a-decentralized-future-8e9da990c5bb">incentivized testnet program</a> has been instrumental in testing the performance of Verida network infrastructure and Verida applications.

<p>Leading travel industry analyst publication <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/phocuswire/">PhocusWire</a> has chosen Indicio as one of its “<a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/Travel-movers-shakers-newsmakers-2023?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Movers and Shakers</a>” of 2023 for developing-award-winning seamless travel technology (with our partner SITA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathercdahl?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAG1mncB9siO_1vzhRrWgNAtko4MTLPxB4M">Heather C. Dahl</a> was named along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/">OpenAI</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> CEO Brian Chesky; Steve Hafner, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kayak/">KAYAK</a>; Vanessa Hudson, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/qantas/">Qantas</a> Group; Robert Isom, CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-airlines/">American Airlines</a>; Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and group CEO, and Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and chief product and technology officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixigo/">ixigo</a>; Alix Boulnois, chief digital officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accor/">Accor</a>; Ben Drew, president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/viator/">Viator</a>; Ethan Lin, co-founder and CEO, and Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder and COO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/klook/">Klook</a>; Rathi Murthy, chief technology officer and president of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/expedia/">Expedia Group</a> Product &amp; Technology; Andreas Slettvoll, co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chooose/">CHOOOSE</a> ; Johnny Thorsen, vice president of business development for content distribution, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spotnanatechnology/">Spotnana</a> ; Richard Valtr, founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mewssystems/">Mews</a>; and Rose Yao, vice president of product management, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/">Google</a> for transforming travel in 2023 — and among those to watch in 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s what Dahl had to say about the news.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be listed among leading innovators who are changing how the world interacts and moves. We founded Indicio to do just this — to remove the friction, the obstacles, and the limitations of how we move through the world, digitally, and to make every interaction simple, seamless, instant.</p>
<p>For travel, this meant reimagining airports without lines, where everything, from check in to border crossing would be digitized and managed with the traveler’s consent — from their sofa.</p>
<p>The solution would be simple to implement across airline systems and radically improve operational efficiency. It would be secure and trustworthy and protect privacy. Everything would be seamless, streamlined, and stress-free. Everything could be integrated from booking to rewards programs to airport services, hospitality and beyond. People could just go and keep moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, thanks to partners SITA and the Aruba Tourism Authority, that’s what we delivered with the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-873429964.html">Digital Travel Credential</a>. A seamless solution that works on any system and provides award-winning (<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">KipplingerCole</a> EIC and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Constellation SuperNova</a>) privacy protection.</p>
<p>What it means today: You can now cross a border in the time it takes to smile.</p>
<p>What it will mean in 2024: Everything you need as a traveler will be accessible seamlessly — car rental, hotel check in, event booking, you name your need, we’ve got a simple, secure way to integrate it into your experience.</p>
<p>And, because verifiable credentials have digital superpowers, everything can be configured, with the traveler’s consent, to provide boss-level personalized interaction.</p>
<p>We’ve even <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">shown</a> how verifiable data and identity are essential for AI to access and leverage personal data.</p>
<p>In 2024, travel will show the world a new way of interacting digitally. It’s both a practical solution and a metaphor. With Indicio, we’re broadening the horizons of where you can go and what is possible when you bring the real and digital worlds together.</p>

It leveraged a primitive home grown cloud agent, mediator agent, and edge wallet. During the pandemic times, we were super busy in integrating the platform with Aries Python Cloud Agent, thus making the solution more compliant and standards driven. Post pandemic days, our team was focused on serving a few customers.</p> V2.0 (Q2/2023) — What’s&nbsp;new? <p>This release was unique. Beginning in the year 2023, we completely revamped the architecture of <a href="https://credebl.id">CREDEBL</a> Platform &amp; ADEYA SSI Mobile App / SDK to make it more lightweight, scalable and easy for developers to start developing digital identity solutions on top of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Keeping priority for population-scale demands, we shifted from Aries Python Agent (ACA-Py) to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ), besides having a single codebase for both cloud (org) agents &amp; mobile edge agents. Now you can set up your organization and AFJ-based multi-tenant agent quickly and thus, be able to start using the platform.</p><p>Some of the key features we added in V2.0&nbsp;are:</p>  Ability to deploy CREDEBL on your own cloud environment, or use&nbsp;SaaS  Aries Framework JS support resulting in — i) W3C JSON-LD credentials, Multi-tenant org agents, ii) Support for did:web, did:key, did:peer, did:cheqd, iii) Mobile &amp; Cloud agents using the same AFJ code&nbsp;base  Bulk issuance of credentials  Passkey authentication using FIDO&nbsp;WebAuthn  Supabase as a database for CREDEBL Platform — using Auth&nbsp;module  Option to deploy the new CREDEBL Studio (UI) on Deno Deploy or on your&nbsp;cloud  CREDEBL Docs built using&nbsp;Astro   DPG Status <p>In October this year, CREDEBL was announced as Open Source under Apache 2.0 license and <a href="https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10902">registered</a> under the DPGA (Digital Public Goods Alliance) — an United Nations endorsed entity which assesses the DPGs globally and maintains <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">the registry</a>.</p><p>With the DPG status, CREDEBL is also being used by several Governments for implementing population-scale decentralized digital identity solutions for citizens benefits.</p> Release — v0.2 — beta.03&nbsp;Features <p>We are keen to listen to the demands and expectations from the customers, so are our future roadmap for&nbsp;CREDEBL.</p>  Out-of-band by issuance for multiple credential records  Delete organization invitations  Token based authentication for Aries Agent&nbsp;(AFJ)  Pagination and sorting for tables on connections, issuance, and verification screen  Set organization to private by&nbsp;default  <p>See the full details of the latest release — <a href="https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases">https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases</a></p> What to expect in next major&nbsp;release   Issue &amp; verify JSON-LD credentials  Support for Polygon &amp; Hedera as VDR (Verifiable Data Registry) for writing DIDs, Schemas &amp; Credential Definitions  Support for Keycloak as an IDP &amp; for OpenID4VC  Support for Post-quantum crypto such as Crystal Kyber, Crystal Dilithium  <p>As Simon Sinek says ‘Business is an infinite game and your competition is your former self’, one should continue to improve..</p><p>With that in mind, we look forward to an even brighter and successful 2024.</p>

<p>Celebrating a landmark year, <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO</a> has set a new bar for what it means to be a successful community-focused DAO building a vibrant and informed community through learning, creating, and, of course, having&nbsp;fun!</p> The Launch and Evolution of the Shyft Ambassador Program <p>The year kicked off with <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/shyft-dao-ambassador-program-official-launch-4db44656e6c7?source=collection_archive---------1-----------------------">the launch of the Shyft DAO Ambassador Program</a>. It was all about getting together to learn, create, and connect. And wow, did it take&nbsp;off!</p><p>By the end of February, it turned into a home for all dreamers, builders, and crypto buffs. It’s been amazing to see how our dedication, teamwork, and innovation brought us all together.</p><p>As the months flew by, we saw so many new faces join. Our Ambassador Program wasn’t just growing — it was thriving.</p><p>And <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/meet-the-wotnot-made-of-fire-release-shyft-dao-nfts-for-all-ambassador-program-members-170b33d855c9">those WotNot Made of Fire NFTs</a> we introduced in June?

Our leaderboard was buzzing with activity, celebrating everyone’s hard work and achievements. It was all about being fair and giving a pat on the back to everyone who contributed.</p><p>We didn’t stop there, though. Extending the NFT minting period and bringing in special NFTs for our Level 2 Ambassadors was our way of saying, “Hey, we see you and appreciate you!”</p><p>Later in the year, we shifted gears to make our engagements even more meaningful. Thanks to your feedback, we brought in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/shyft-daos-november-review-strategic-shifts-fair-play-focus-and-nft-ideas-81279881e161?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">qualitative tasks in November</a>, which added so much more depth to our interactions.</p> Tracking the Roadmap Milestones <p>2023 wasn’t just about community vibes. We made some serious gains on the tech side,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Remember the Veriscope Campaign? That was all of us getting deep into all things Veriscope and breaking it down, collectively exploring every aspect of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Plus, <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/unleash-your-inner-chameleon-discover-the-new-shyft-dao-website-4e52075fcff8?source=collection_archive---------7-----------------------">our new website</a> and those awesome community contests were all about making our digital space as lively and engaging as our community.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Looking forward, we’re not just stepping into 2024.

 Stakers can claim DF69 rewards. DF70 runs Dec 28 — Jan 4,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 69 (DF69) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Dec 21, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 28.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF70 is live today, Dec 28. It concludes on Jan 4. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF70   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF70 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

This partnership helped mark a significant step towards establishing a more secure and compliant environment within the crypto space, enhancing safety and regulatory adherence for both entities and their&nbsp;users.</p> Tokenomics <p><a href="https://data.shyft.network/public-dashboards/9e1235893c184f17b4f29583294efeb1?orgId=1">As of December 28th, 2023</a>, the purchasers hold 40% of SHFT tokens (431M vested to purchasers of the 1.06B circulating). The Economic Metagame and Core Team are allocated 20.0% and 17.9%, respectively.</p><p>The Shyft Treasury holds a strategic reserve of 6.6%, earmarked for long-term network health and growth, whereas 44.173% of SHFT tokens are vested. Specific to the Treasury, 17.009% of tokens are vested, with 10.558% in the Token Reserve and 9.394% for Strategic Purchasers, mapping out a controlled release that supports steady growth and market absorption. These figures are stated as fractions of the total vested to&nbsp;date.</p><p>The total allocation of SHFT tokens is 2.52 billion, of which 977 million SHFT tokens are vested to date. The Block Rewards stand at 279 million, alongside 841 million tokens unlocked, contributing to a circulating supply that now totals 1.06&nbsp;billion.</p> Marketing <p>Following our strategy to build, engage and educate our various audiences, we kept a close eye on the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom">major crypto regulatory developments</a> and dissected their potential implications on the industry’s future. In line with this focus, we have launched three editorial series this year: The Shyft Perspectives, The Dev Deep Dive, and long-format analytical blogs.</p><p>Our analysis focused on the lead developments and intricacies of the crypto regulations in various territories. We’ve examined diverse approaches from North America to Australia as governments and regulatory bodies grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by the burgeoning crypto industry.</p><p>The goal behind our editorials remains clear: to build a stronger trust in blockchain economies, a commitment we consistently highlight to our community and the broader industry.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we reflect on the milestones and growth of Shyft Network in 2023, we look forward with optimism to the opportunities that lie ahead. This year has been a testament to our resilience, marked by key partnerships and technological advancements that have strengthened our foundation and expanded our reach within the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Looking to the future, we are excited to continue this journey, committed to innovation and excellence. And as the new year approaches, we are ready to embrace the possibilities it brings, driving forward the mission of global adoption and contributing to a more connected and compliant world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 ERC-3643 Validated As The De Facto Standard For Enterprise-Ready Tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Ready for an exciting year of tokenization?</p>
<p>Last week, the ERC-3643 standard achieved a significant achievement by attaining<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/ethereum-community-approves-erc3643-as-the-first-tokenization-standard?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;‘Final’ status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)</a>. This indicates its validation by the official Ethereum community.</p>
<p>The EIP is a rigorous process mandatory for all Ethereum-based standards, including prominent ones like ERC-20 and ERC-721. Achieving the final status signifies a major milestone for the tokenization industry, as&nbsp;ERC-3643 now provides an official token standard for compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>As the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, we identified an essential requirement for a unified standard to achieve interoperability. From its inception, we committed to an open-source approach. Initially known as the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) protocol, this protocol embodied our vision for a more interconnected and efficient tokenization ecosystem with built-in compliance.</p>
<p>In 2021, we submitted the T-REX protocol to the EIP, aspiring to establish it as an official standard. This journey, though extensive and intricate, involved the process of evolving from Draft to Stagnant, then to Review, and ultimately achieving Final status after two years of dedicated effort.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Today,&nbsp;ERC-3643 is the de facto standard for enterprise-ready tokenization,&nbsp;with highlights including:</p>
<p>✅ Validated&nbsp;by the Ethereum community: Earning&nbsp;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">the ‘Final’ status</a>&nbsp;ensures official recognition and trust from the EVM developer community.</p>
<p>✅ Audited&nbsp;by Hacken:&nbsp;The audit results yielded&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">a flawless score of 10/10</a>, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>
<p>✅ Supported&nbsp;by institutions: Prominent institutions and firms, like Apex Group, Invesco, Aztec, CMS, DLA Piper, and Polygon have formed<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;a non-profit association</a>&nbsp;to catalyze worldwide adoption of the ERC-3643.</p>
<p>✅ 6-year track record:&nbsp;The standard has been used to tokenize over&nbsp;$28 billion in assets for hundreds of projects over the past six years.</p>
<p>2023 marks the dawn of institutional tokenization, and we believe that institutions will increasingly embrace tokenization.&nbsp;The audited and validated ERC-3643 standard is set to expedite this shift in 2024!</p>

<p>“Fast” and “frictionless” onboarding for customers, workers and citizens is an elusive goal. Sure, identity verification is crucial, but so is verifying claims such as educational qualifications, an industry certification, health data, citizen status, residency and more. Striking the right balance with defenses against another, less desirable “F” word—fraud—in a manner that protects privacy and reduces the chances of compromise, yet another challenge</p>
<p>Whether it’s for onboarding, new customer account origination, or provisioning additional digital services to qualified requesters, organizations need to replace and digitally transform outdated and manual verification using AI, data triangulation and machine verification of identity and credentials. The new and better way to do this is to give users reusable, verified “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/07/20/why-reusable-smart-credentials-will-win-over-physical-analog-identity-verification/?sh=6349fdf03373">smart credentials</a>“neatly packaged in a digital identity wallet that users keep up-to-date, present on demand, and grant specific sharing permissions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials leverage data registries that include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. The credential holder mediates between the registry or trusted “issuer” and the verifier authenticating the holder—creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20(VCs)%20are%20digital,ownership%20of%20a%20bank%20account.">triangle of trust.</a> A holder’s credentials can be verified without any data being exchanged – a zero knowledge proof. In this way, verification is assured, privacy concerns are ameliorated, and the risk of identity theft or compromise is minimized or eliminated. Here again, the 1Kosmos architecture excels because this all needs to be done in an auditable, tamper-evident way to ensure high assurance and trust.</p>
 IAM Verified–Quickly, Easily, and Accurately 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Two</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">Three</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/the-immutable-chain-of-custody-why-distributed-ledger-is-critical-to-modern-iam/">Four</a> in this series, we explained how the<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/"> 1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a secure and reliable way to verify user or applicant identity and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometrically authenticate</a> them with 99.6% accuracy via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms within our BlockID solution, including a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">reusable digital identity wallet</a> while removing the centralized PII honeypot hackers target for exploitation.</p>
<p>The final pillar of the 1Kosmos <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">architectural advantage</a> is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verifiable-credentials/">Digital Claims and Credentials Verification</a>, which delivers automated, cryptographically secure verification of identity, qualifications, competencies, authority, and more while respecting an individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>Why did we feel this pillar was so important? Because it provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes—from worker or contractor onboarding to new customer account origination to the provisioning of new digital product lines and beyond. Often, there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized, depending on use cases that span:</p>
 
 Education: Utilize a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential-repository">credential repository</a> service to provide digital transcripts and digital credentials representing certificates or degrees verified to be earned by the individual 
 Finance: Perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC)- and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification using government-supplied <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and issue a digitally-signed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential">credential</a> 
 Retail: Verify retail and payment account ownership, payment amount, and sufficient permission to approve payment 
 Healthcare: Facilitate patient-approved sharing of electronic healthcare records with a Qualified Health Information Network (AHIN) 
 Government: Enable government agencies to function as Credential Service Providers by performing Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and issuing a digitally-signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credential certified to NiST 800-63-3 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> standards 
 Enterprise: Share current and past employment to prospective employers and other entities that need to verify status 
 
 A Trustworthy Method for Verifying Claims and Credentials 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID automates manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, reducing errors and improving accuracy. High assurance along with cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust, and seamless re-verification by business partners or by additional lines of business. Key features of the 1Kosmos solution include the following.</p>
 Data Triangulation to Verify Claims Across Trusted Data Sources 
<p>To reach identity verification and authentication assurance to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, BlockID triangulates claims across multiple verifiable sources. These include personal details such as the individual’s full name, date of birth, address, place of birth, photo ID, phone number, employer, etc. The triangulation is based upon government- or bank-issued documents such as a driver’s license, national ID card, passport, credit card, and Social Security Number.</p>
<p>Information can be matched across multiple sources to validate documents as current, or flagged as lost or stolen. Our verification accommodates government-issued credentials in 205 countries with +99% identity proofing accuracy and spoofing/counterfeit detection. Verification at lower levels of assurance is achieved through banking, telco (SIM binding), email, Social Security Number, phone number, and more.</p>
<p>This kind of digital verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents while also including additional assurances against fraud, such as a digital signature.</p>
 Standards-based Design for Maximum Interoperability 
<p>With 1Kosmos, verifiable credentials allow for the digital proofing of an individual’s claims information through public-private cryptography. Our solutions follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> defined at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>, which provides a common mechanism for the interoperable implementation of digital credentials that are cryptographically secure, tamper-evident, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.</p>
<p>A standardized data model enables credential packaging, cryptographic signing, and proof expression. This creates a verified credential (VC) ecosystem with interoperable credentials that can be processed and understood across and between disparate systems.</p>
 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Administration and DevOps Tools 
<p>We developed the 1Kosmos BlockID platform to require no custom coding, special firewall rules, or unique security configurations. Deployment is simple and fast, with over 50 out-of-the-box <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrations</a> and a robust SDK/API framework that complies with the strictest GDPR, SOC2, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">ISO 27001</a> certification standards for handling and retaining sensitive data.</p>
<p>This enables ID proofing to be quickly integrated into native apps via an API, mobile, web, or desktop integration. This flexible, standards-based approach can meet the needs of virtually any workflow and enables BlockID to satisfy both workforce and customer identity verification.</p>
<p>Our cloud-based administration panel makes configuring and managing the BlockID platform easy. And our <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/">DevX portal</a> provides a hosted sandbox for developers to test FIDO-based authentication and verification options integrated into your applications. The <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Developer Sandbox</a> offers an easy, hands-on way for developers to test use cases using available APIs for FIDO-based <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=passwordless">authentication</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=fidowebauthn">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=magiclinks">Magic Links</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Driver’s License Verification</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=vc">Verified Credentials</a>, and more.</p>
 A Modern IAM Architecture That Means Business 
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in/forensic-integrity-services/ensuring-fraud-free-hiring-with-technology-powered-employee-background-check">Ernst &amp; Young survey</a>, nearly 70% of organizations report having manual verification processes that are riddled with errors, highly time-consuming, or both. By automating manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, BlockID eliminates errors, improves accuracy, and reduces administrative overhead. Its high assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing, help establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification by business partners or additional lines of business. And its automated machine verification, combined with the high level of trust from a tamper-proof design, reduces the need for manual reviews and enables digital processes to scale or evolve rapidly. All while providing a fast, frictionless user experience—while kicking that other “F” word to the curb.</p>

<p>The end of the year is always an exciting time, from reflecting on everything we’ve accomplished to planning for the exciting projects that lie ahead.</p><p>For SpruceID, 2023 has been a positive year of growth and change. We grew our company, participated in many events that helped expand our community, enhanced our products and platforms, and more.</p><p>Let’s take a walk down memory lane through 2023 and revisit some major highlights of the past year together!</p> 👪 Our Team <p>We gained even more Sprucers this year and remain to be a small but mighty global team. From engineering to product development, marketing, and design, we’re excited to continue to build up our talent to meet the demands of our growing company.</p><p>Although we are a remote-first company, we hold offsites every six months for one week at a time to focus on relationship building, align on strategy, and more. This year, we met in Lisbon, Portugal, and Dublin, Ireland!</p><p>Interested in joining our awesome team? <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Check out our open roles here</a>.</p> 🎤 Events and Hackathons   SpruceID attended ETHDenver this year and connected with others in the decentralized identity space! Our booth offered an interactive experience where visitors could test out claiming a credential to prove they visited our booth and then plant a tree after verifying that credential.&nbsp;  In March, we hosted <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-did-day-an-exploration-of-decentralized-identity-at-ethdenver-buidlweek/">did:day</a>, a half-day event during ETHDenver’s #BUIDLWeek with a mission to create a forum dedicated to educating about decentralized identity, how it impacts web3 and beyond, and how to increase adoption. The event consisted of several lightning talks and panels on user-controlled identity, decentralized social media, and more.  This summer, we<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/"> participated in the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon</a>. Over the course of four weeks, university students from blockchain clubs across the world learned about decentralized identity, built projects, and competed for prizes. Read more about our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/">bounties</a> and the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-our-encode-hackathon-bounty-winners/">winners</a>.  At the end of August, SpruceID <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">hosted the first fully remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations</a>. This event provided a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7). Read more about the event results <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/iso-iec-18013-7-interoperability-event-results/">here</a>.  We rounded out the year by hosting a webinar with GovTech featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, SpruceID Co-Founder and CEO, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV. <a href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/apollox/mainEvent?eventid=4419861&amp;sessionid=1&amp;username=&amp;partnerref=&amp;format=fhvideo1&amp;mobile=&amp;flashsupportedmobiledevice=&amp;helpcenter=&amp;key=2C578405F3FE22F30ADF478630724166&amp;newConsole=true&amp;nxChe=true&amp;newTabCon=true&amp;consoleEarEventConsole=false&amp;text_language_id=en&amp;playerwidth=748&amp;playerheight=526&amp;eventuserid=653726278&amp;contenttype=A&amp;mediametricsessionid=561697865&amp;mediametricid=6227059&amp;usercd=653726278&amp;mode=launch&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch the webinar</a> to learn more about:  How the California DMV is offering mobile driver's licenses and other digital credentials, such as car registrations, to its residents and best practices for success  The importance of open-source development to enable myriad use cases across public and private sectors for verifiable digital identity  The security and accessibility advantages of digitally verifiable credentials     🛠️ Our Products<br>  Credible <p>This year, we’ve been honing in on Credible — an entire credential lifecycle management product with security and privacy at its core. From credential issuance and presentations to updates and revocations, Credible is made to integrate into high-assurance environments that require certain safety and security certifications.</p>  After working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for 18 months to bring mobile driver’s licenses to residents of California, we were thrilled to help launch the pilot program to allow California residents to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone in August of 2023. This project demonstrated a successful implementation of Credible and our open-source libraries.  We ended this year on a high note with a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for Government</a>. The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles won this award for their Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials, which was built by SpruceID. We couldn’t be more proud to have played a role in winning such a prestigious award.   SpruceKit <p>If you’ve been keeping up with our developer community, you may be familiar with many of our open-source libraries, such as Sign-In with Ethereum, DIDKit, and TreeLDR. This year, we moved these open-source libraries all under SpruceKit, an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity. SpruceKit enables secure wallet construction by allowing builders to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with data vaults.</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p>  As of the end of this year, Sign-in with Ethereum has 2,890,141 total downloads on NPM (and 2,000,000 just in this year alone), as well as 53,848 downloads on PyPI!  This year, we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">integrated Sign-In with Ethereum into Metamask</a>. These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase users' confidence in interacting with dapps.  <p>Kepler</p>  Kepler had an extensive refactor to extract the core logic into a new crate separate from the HTTP API and to implement its state tracking using SQL (SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL are supported) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #143</a>).  This year, we added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #134</a>).  We moved host key management into the OrbitDatabase in kepler-core via the Secrets trait and provided an implementation of the trait based on simple per-orbit derivation from a static secret (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>).  <p>SSI/DIDKit</p>  Support for DataIntegrityProof proof suites was introduced (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/515?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#515</a>).  We rewrote our VC API implementation in Axum (didkit <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/pull/351?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#351</a>) and added it to the W3C-CCG interoperability test suites (<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations/pull/64?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#64</a>).  A major refactor of ssi was initiated. This refactor will help us to handle Linked Data better and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.  <p>TreeLDR</p><p>This year, we improved every aspect of TreeLDR: layouts, DSL, and generators.</p>  Layouts:  We introduced a new version of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them. We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts. This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on making all TreeLDR features work with these new layouts.    DSL:  We started using RDF as our intermediate representation for layouts. This change will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. Besides the TreeLDR DSL, the compiler supports N-Quads (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #108</a>) and RDF-Turtle (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/119?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #119</a>).  The DSL is not yet compatible with the new layouts. As a first step, we extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This standalone RDF engine is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so the compiler can focus entirely on its primary purpose: layouts.    Generators:  We redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #143</a>), generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (such as numerical constraints, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #145</a>), support for default values (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/147?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #147</a>), and more. In addition, the procedural macro used to embed TreeLDR layouts directly in Rust can now use external modules, allowing modular code generation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/130?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #130</a>). The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first to support the new layouts</a>.    <p>Rebase</p>  We've added large amounts of prototype work to support two new flows, POAP ownership and NFT ownership (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/44?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#44</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/45?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#45</a>), and added basic credential verification to the Rebase witness (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/47/files?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#47</a>).  We've added the ability for Rebase Witnesses to arbitrarily validate any VCs that have types supported by ssi (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/69?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #69</a>).  We’ve added the ability to support delegate keys to allow users to issue their own credentials without a signing prompt for each one (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/82?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #82</a>).  <p>SSX</p>  We released support for NextAuth via our ssx-react package <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth?ref=blog.spruceid.com">with an example</a> to show how to integrate it.&nbsp;  We reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization, which is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>, which can be used as a faucet for credentials.  <p>Example Apps</p>  In June, we released three new reference apps, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">The Sprouts</a>, to demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open-source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build. These included an AI chat interface, an app for book reviews, and a sample social networking app.   📝Standards and Working Groups   <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">We joined OpenWallet Foundation</a> as one of their founding members. The OpenWallet Foundation is a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe. This collaborative effort will develop best practices for open-source digital wallet technology.  This year, we continued participating in working groups or global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. These include W3C working groups, ISO working groups, OpenID Foundation working groups, and more. To learn more about standards we’re contributing to, whitepapers we’ve published, and more, see an example of our quarterly Standards and Working Groups update <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/q2-2023-wgs-udpate/">here</a>.   See you in 2024 <p>2023 was an exciting year full of opportunities and growth. We can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2024 as we continue on with our mission to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. Here’s to a fresh new year!</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>VASPs can now take advantage of Veriscope’s <a href="https://demo.usersigning.shyft.network/">User Signing</a> feature to comply with the FATF Travel Rule. This feature not only assists VASPs in meeting their Travel Rule obligations but also equips them to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, which is essential for validating withdrawals and reinforcing the self-custody process.</p><p>The Travel Rule, as established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), requires Virtual Asset Service Providers to share specific information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers. It is aimed at adding transparency to digital asset transactions, which is a key consideration for VASPs that strive to align with international standards while preserving the integrity of their operations.</p><p>To address these regulatory requirements, Shyft Veriscope is specifically designed to help VASPs comply with the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, with a keen focus on user privacy and data security. This balanced approach is significant in the crypto industry, where the exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) among VASPs is a sensitive matter.</p><p>Through its innovative features like User Signing, Veriscope not only provides a secure and transparent method for compliance but also sets a new standard in the crypto compliance space, demonstrating how regulatory needs can be met without compromising on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>However, User Signing is just the beginning, as it paves the way for future developments, such as user consent features based on cryptographic keys, furthering our vision of a more empowered, secure, and transparent digital asset ecosystem.</p> Technical Aspect <p>User Signing streamlines the Travel Rule compliance process by providing a VASP-branded interface that guides users from the initial withdrawal request on the VASP’s platform to creating a Veriscope Address Proof with their hardware wallet or other non-custodial wallet, such as those supporting WalletConnect, Metamask, or bitcoin hardware wallets such as Ledger and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>The interface seamlessly directs users to the Veriscope User Signing application, where clear instructions and animation help them complete the signing process with their personal crypto wallet. After this, they are automatically redirected back to the VASP’s withdrawal page.</p><p>For more technical details, please refer to our documentation on<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/latest/learn/addressproofs.html"> address&nbsp;proofs</a>.</p> Installation and&nbsp;Hosting <p>Here’s a brief on the installation process to implement our new&nbsp;feature:</p>  Start by copying the project contents and run scripts into a docker container or final machine destination.  Next, configure your server environment using nginx or your preferred HTTP&nbsp;server.  The HTTP Verification Server: This is vital for the VASP’s backend.

Nevertheless, cross-border commerce is hindered by the diverse practices, standards, and regulations used by individual countries, presenting a substantial obstacle for businesses.</p><p>The global challenge of identifying businesses saw a significant step forward with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the 2010s. While LEIs have proven to be a successful and reliable means of identifying organizations on a global scale, there remains a gap in effectively identifying organizations’ representatives.</p><p>Consequently, GLEIF has introduced an innovative solution to address this gap through the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>. The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide. Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO, has articulated the necessity and significance of this revolutionary approach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=F4WGybUNjElwWjeT&amp;v=3mhuL9_q-hs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Organizational Identity and the&nbsp;LEI</a>.</p><blockquote>The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide.</blockquote><p>The vLEI harbors the potential to revolutionize the dynamics of digital interactions among organizations, fostering seamless global business transactions online. It is imperative for large organizations and regulators worldwide to diligently heed this transformative advancement.</p><p>In this blog, we provide a visual guide for GLEIF’s vLEI ecosystem and explore how it stands out from any other organizational digital identity infrastructures.</p> vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework <p>In 2022, GLEIF introduced the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)</a>, aligning with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Specifications and Templates. The vLEI EGF meticulously outlines the following details:</p>  Rules, responsibilities, and obligations for all stakeholders involved in the vLEI ecosystem, including GLEIF&nbsp;itself.  Hierarchical relationships among the stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.  Identity Verification processes for all human stakeholders.  Detailed qualification processes for vLEI issuing stakeholders, known as qualified vLEI issuers&nbsp;(QVIs).  Technical specifications for the management of cryptographic keys and self-certifying identifiers, known as autonomic identifiers (AIDs).  Technical specifications for six types of vLEI credentials.  Rigorous technical and business processes governing the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.  <p>According to Drummond Reed, a member of the Trust over IP Foundation Steering Committee, the strategic choice to build vLEI EGF on the ToIP governance model is poised to foster a secure and interoperable system on a global scale. This move has the potential to revolutionize the global digital trust ecosystem, bringing substantial benefits to businesses and individuals across various industries and international borders.</p><p>As of December 2023, the vLEI EGF stands out as arguably the most comprehensive digital identity framework to&nbsp;date.</p> vLEI Stakeholders <p>Within the vLEI ecosystem, there are four key stakeholders that are issuers and holders of vLEI credentials. The key stakeholders include GLEIF, qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), legal entities (LEs), and organization representatives. The first three in the list are organizations, which are made of representatives who are authorized to participate in the vLEI ecosystem. The overview of all vLEI stakeholders is displayed below.</p>vLEI Stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.<p>1. Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF): GLEIF appointed representatives, called GLEIF Authorized Representatives (GARs), to participate in the vLEI ecosystem and issue the QVI vLEI Credential. There are three types of GARs as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Root GARs: The root GARs collectively serve as the root of reputational trust of the entire vLEI ecosystem. Root GARs do not directly participate in the vLEI ecosystem but, instead, delegate their authority to internal GARs and external&nbsp;GARs  Internal GARs: The internal GARs participate directly in the vLEI ecosystem as a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential.  External GARs: The external GARs are responsible for the issuance and revocation of QVI vLEI credentials as well as performing identity assurance of&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: There are two types of trust in a digital identity system: reputational trust and attributional trust. The former is the human side of trust whereas the latter is the technical side. In the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF serves as the root of reputational trust, providing trust for identity assurance of all stakeholders. The attributional trust, on the other hand, is purely cryptographic in the vLEI ecosystem and is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI protocol</a>.</blockquote><p>2. Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI): A QVI is an organization that is qualified by GLEIF to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as an issuer of vLEI credentials. Prior to being a QVI, a candidate organization has to undergo thorough qualification processes by GLEIF to ensure that they are capable financially and technically of issuing vLEI credentials. QVI authorizes two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of a QVI is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with GLEIF and legal entities. The DAR designates and replaces the QARs of the&nbsp;QVI.  Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs): The QARs are a collective holder of a QVI vLEI credential. The QARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke LE, OOR, and ECR&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>3. Legal Entity (LE): Within the vLEI ecosystem, an LE is an LEI-registered organization. The LEs also appoint two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of an LE is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with a QVI. The DAR designates and replaces the LARs of the&nbsp;LE.  Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs): The LARs are a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential. The LARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke ECR and AUTH&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>4. Organization Representative: An organization representative is a person who is authorized to represent an LE. Representatives are categorized by either their official or functional roles within their&nbsp;LE.</p>  Official Organizational Role Person (OOR Person): An OOR person represents an LE in an official organizational role.  Engagement Context Role Person (ECR Person): An ECR person represents an LE in a functional role.  <blockquote>Note: A person may hold any number of role vLEI credentials from a single or multiple&nbsp;LEs.</blockquote> Official Organization Role&nbsp;(OOR) <p>In <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80603.html">ISO 5009</a>, an official organization role (OOR) is defined as an “official role of a person within an organization or legal entity within a particular jurisdiction that is publicly discoverable in formation, registration or other official documents of the organization or legal&nbsp;entity”.</p><p>GLEIF has released the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-5009-official-organizational-roles-code-list">Official Organizational Roles (OOR) Code List</a>, comprising over 2000 OORs across 89 jurisdictions. While this list provides an overview of OORs in respective native languages, it is by no means exhaustive, and there are still numerous countries awaiting inclusion.</p><p>A legal entity may assign an OOR that is not in the official OOR code list as long as the OOR is publicly discoverable in a business registry or defined in official documents of incorporation for the organization. For example, Stephan Wolf has an OOR as the CEO of GLEIF. While GLEIF is registered in Switzerland, the CEO role does not exist in the official OOR code list for Switzerland.</p> Engagement Context Role&nbsp;(ECR) <p>An engagement context role (ECR) is loosely defined by GLEIF to widely include as many use cases as possible. Here are some examples of&nbsp;ECRs:</p>  ECR as an “unofficial” organization role: An organization role that is neither publicly discoverable nor defined in official documents may be considered an ECR. For example, an employee could have an ECR as a software engineer.  ECR as an internal functional role: An ECR could be defined and used internally within an LE. For example, an employee who is officially a software engineer could also have an ECR as a Cultural Ambassador.  ECR as an external functional role: An ECR could be defined and used externally to an LE. For example, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking Authority (EBA)</a> may define an ECR called an “<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">EBA Submitter</a>”. An LE may designate an employee to be their EBA Submitter so that the employee may submit a financial report to&nbsp;EBA.   Collective Identifiers for&nbsp;vLEIs <p>The vLEI ecosystem is designed to be used by organizations that are made of humans and inevitably prone to human errors and shortcomings. For the vLEI to be reliably used on the global scale with the utmost trustworthiness, the vLEI EGF chooses a decentralized approach to digital identity management, also known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), to eliminate a single point of failure to the entire ecosystem by a single human administrator.</p><p>On the flip side, the absence of an administrator leaves an organization without a safety net in the case of disastrous mishaps. Consequently, the architecture of decentralized identity management for an organization should prioritize fault tolerance, avoiding dependency on a singular person or key. Otherwise, there’s a potential risk of an organization permanently losing control over its digital identity — such as in the unfortunate event of a key employee’s sudden&nbsp;demise.</p><p>The section outlines how the vLEI EGF specifies the usage of a collective identifier for an organization that is collectively controlled by multiple individuals using the KERI protocol and a multi-signature autonomic identifier.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure <p>To achieve the highest level of security, scalability, and decentralization for the vLEI ecosystem, the vLEI EGF chooses the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Invented in 2019 by Samuel M. Smith, KERI is a decentralized protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and identifiers that utilizes hash-chain data structures in a similar manner to traditional distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchains. Unlike traditional distributed ledgers, the KERI protocol is not subject to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma">blockchain trilemma</a> because KERI does not rely on a distributed consensus mechanism such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.</p><blockquote>Note: For more information and a glossary related to KERI, I recommend <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/">KERISSE</a>, which is the KERI Suite Search Engine, and an upcoming browser extension <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/test/kerific?level=3">KERIfic</a>.</blockquote> Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) <p>As mentioned above, GLEIF only provides the root of reputational trust — i.e., human trust — within the vLEI ecosystem. The root of attributional trust — i.e., technical trust — is purely cryptographic and provided by <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifiers (AIDs)</a>.</p><p>Without going into too much technical detail, an AID is a variant of a self-certifying identifier (SCID), which is used within the KERI protocol. This means an AID is derived by a cryptographic protocol in a decentralized manner. An AID has the following properties:</p>  An AID does not rely on any centralized entity, e.g., a human administrator. An AID is derived and controlled purely in a cryptographic manner.  An AID is persistent and is suitable for long-term use. This is because an AID is not tied to a single cryptographic key pair via a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0a82">pre-rotation</a>.  An AID does not rely on a distributed ledger. However, it may be used in combination with one or more distributed-ledger networks.  An AID is portable across multiple platforms. In the case that an AID is used with a distributed ledger, an AID is not locked to that specific ledger and may be migrated to another&nbsp;ledger.  An AID is quantum-recoverable. In the case that an AID is attacked by a quantum computer, the control over the AID can be recovered from the&nbsp;attack.   Collective AIDs <p>In the KERI protocol, an AID may be cryptographically controlled via a multi-signature scheme that allows multiple individuals, called controllers, to collectively control a single identifier. This makes the KERI protocol and AIDs particularly suitable for organizational uses.</p><blockquote>Note: It is called the multi-signature scheme because multiple digital signatures from multiple private keys are required to control a single&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><p>Arbitrary levels of control authority over an AID may also be given to its controllers. For example, an AID of an LE may be controlled by three LARs — a CEO, an IT administrator, and a human resource manager — with the following control authority:</p>  The CEO of the LE has “2/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The IT administrator has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The human resource manager has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  <blockquote>Note: This type of scheme is called a fractionally weighted multi-signature scheme.</blockquote><p>A multi-signature AID requires signatures with a combined control authority of “1” or more. In the above example, the CEO may authorize a transaction with either the IT admin or the HR. However, the IT admin and the HR—without the CEO—are not able to authorize a transaction since their combined control authority is only “1/3” + “1/3” =&nbsp;“2/3”.</p> Multi-device AIDs and&nbsp;MFA <p>The multi-signature scheme also allows an AID to be controlled by multiple devices. For example, an ECR person may control their AID using a mobile phone and a laptop, each having control authority of “1”. In this example, the ECR person may either use their mobile phone or laptop to, e.g., sign a contract with the ECR vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: To be more technically precise, the ECR person uses a private key that is associated with an AID to sign the contract. The AID must be the same as the AID specified in their ECR vLEI credential.</blockquote><p>The multi-signature scheme could be utilized to enable KERI-native multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, an ECR person may assign “1/2” control over their AID to a mobile phone and another “1/2” to a laptop. In this example, the ECR must use both the mobile and the laptop to, e.g., sign a contract.</p><blockquote>Note: The multi-signature scheme may be used recursively. For example, an LE AID may be controlled by three individuals, each with control authority “1/3”. Each “1/3” could be further divided into two halves using two devices. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/602">Key Management for Organizational Identity</a> by Samuel M.&nbsp;Smith.</blockquote> AID Management by vLEI Stakeholders <p>The vLEI EGF requires that all vLEI issuing organizations — including GLEIF, QVIs, and LEs — hold collective AIDs using such multi-signature schemes. This enables the maker-checker process that requires the approval of at least two individuals for all workflows related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.</p><p>An example of the management of the AIDs and associated cryptographic keys for all vLEI stakeholders is shown&nbsp;below.</p>Management of AIDs and associated keys by representatives of vLEI stakeholders.  GLEIF Root AID: The GLEIF Root AID enables the root of reputational trust of the vLEI ecosystem. The role of the GLEIF Root AID is to delegate to GIDA and GEDA. Currently, the GLEIF Root AID is controlled by 7 Root GARs, each with control authority of&nbsp;“1/3”.  <blockquote>Note: Delegation in the vLEI ecosystem utilizes the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. It requires a cryptographic commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate to initialize or update the key states of&nbsp;AIDs.</blockquote>  GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA): The GIDA is used to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as the holder of the LE vLEI credential. Currently, the GIDA is controlled by the 5 Internal GARs, each with a controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”.  GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA): The GEDA is used to issue and revoke the QVI vLEI credentials. Currently, the GEDA is controlled by the 5 External GARs, each with controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”  <blockquote>Note: The key management for the GLEIF’s AIDs can be inspected from their KERI witnesses as follows: <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2?name=GLEIF%20RoOT">GLEIF Root AID</a>, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EFcrtYzHx11TElxDmEDx355zm7nJhbmdcIluw7UMbUIL?name=GLEIF%20Internal">GIDA</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EINmHd5g7iV-UldkkkKyBIH052bIyxZNBn9pq-zNrYoS?name=GLEIF%20External">GEDA</a>.</blockquote>  QVI AID: A QVI AID is delegated by the GEDA and must be controlled by at least 3 QARs where at least 2 QARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. For example, a QVI AID could be controlled by 4 QARs with control authority of [“2/3”, “2/3”, “1/3”, “1/3”] such that the QVI cannot authorize a transaction without either of the first two&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: All QVI AIDs are also delegated by the GEDA using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. As a result, key rotation of a QVI AID must be approved by the External GARs. For example, if a QVI wishes to change one of their QARs by rotating the key of the leaving QAR, the QVI must inform the External GARs to approve the key rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote>  LE AID: An LE AID must be controlled by at least 3 LARs where at least 2 LARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. There is an exception to this rule when an LE has fewer than 3 employees. In this case, the LE cannot directly issue a vLEI credential and must authorize a QVI to issue it on their&nbsp;behalf.  Role AID: There is no requirement for a multi-signature scheme for ECR and OOR persons. An organization representative may control their AID using a single signing key. They may also use a multi-signature scheme to divide the control authority of their AID to multiple&nbsp;devices.   Types of vLEI Credentials <p>The previous sections have outlined the stakeholders, their relationships, and the management of their identifiers, called AIDs, in the vLEI ecosystem. We are now well-positioned to explore what the vLEI credentials actually are. The vLEI credentials, in fact, consist of six types of verifiable credentials that are issued and received by different vLEI stakeholders. Their schemas can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/tree/dev/schema/acdc">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI credentials utilize<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html"> Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)</a>, which are considered a variant of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data&nbsp;Model</a>.</blockquote> (1) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) vLEI Credential <p>A QVI vLEI credential is issued by the External GARs (i.e., the GEDA) to a candidate QVI after they complete the formal qualification process. The issuance of the QVI vLEI credential serves as the formal qualification by GLEIF that the QVI is now eligible to participate in the vLEI ecosystem.</p><p>Before the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, the External GARs must perform identity verification on all of the QARs. After the issuance of the QVI vLEI credential, if the QVI wishes to add more QARs, the identity of the new QARs must also be verified by the External&nbsp;GARs.</p> (2) Legal Entity (LE) vLEI Credential <p>An LE vLEI credential is issued by a QVI to an LE. The issuance of the LE vLEI credential allows the LE to issue role and AUTH vLEI credentials.</p><p>Before the issuance of an LE vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on all of the LARs. After the issuance of the LE vLEI credential, if the LE wishes to add more LARs, the identity of the new LARs must also be verified by the&nbsp;QARs.</p><blockquote>Note: A QVI may issue an LE vLEI credential to the GIDA. The GIDA’s LE vLEI was initially issued by <a href="https://provenant.net/">Provenant Inc.</a>, the first&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote> (3) &amp; (4) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) Authorization (AUTH) vLEI Credentials <p>A QVI AUTH vLEI credential is issued by an LE to a QVI to authorize the QVI to issue a role vLEI credentials, including the LE ECR and LE OOR vLEI credentials. A LAR of the LE has to input the accurate data of their representative — including the legal name and role — in the QVI AUTH vLEI credential. There are two variants of the QVI AUTH vLEI credentials as&nbsp;follows:</p>  OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an OOR vLEI credential  ECR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an ECR vLEI credential  <p>Before the issuance of a QVI AUTH vLEI credential, the LARs must perform identity verification on the representative, who is either an OOR or ECR&nbsp;person.</p> (5) Official Organizational Role (OOR) vLEI Credential <p>An OOR vLEI credential is a role vLEI credential issued by a QVI to an OOR person. Before issuing an OOR vLEI credential, the QVI must be first authorized by the OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which has been issued by the LE that the OOR person represents.</p><p>Before the issuance of an OOR vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on the OOR person. The QVI must also verify that the OOR person genuinely holds the specified OOR using official public sources or documents of the&nbsp;LE.</p> (6) Engagement Context Role (ECR) vLEI Credential: <p>An ECR vLEI Credential is a role vLEI credential issued to an ECR person. Unlike other types of vLEI credentials, an ECR vLEI credential may be issued by two approaches as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Direct issuance by an LE: The LARs of the LE perform identity verification on the ECR person and directly issue the ECR vLEI credential.  Issuance by a QVI: The LARs perform identity verification on the ECR person and issue an ECR AUTH vLEI credential to a QVI. The QARs of the QVI then perform identity verification on the ECR person again before issuing the ECR vLEI credential.   Credential Chaining <p>One of the unique properties of vLEI credentials, which utilize authentic chained data containers (ACDCs), is credential chaining. vLEI credentials are chained using strong cryptographic digests, starting from QVI vLEI credentials issued by the External GARs. For example, an OOR vLEI credential of an OOR person is chained in the following manner:</p>  (5) the OOR vLEI credential, which is issued by a QVI, is cryptographically chained to (3) an OOR AUTH vLEI credential issued by an LE that the OOR person represents,  (3) the OOR AUTH vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (2) an LE vLEI credential that the same QVI issues to the&nbsp;LE,  (2) LE vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (1) a QVI vLEI credential that the External GARs (GEDA) issue to the&nbsp;QVI  The GEDA is cryptographically linked to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.  <p>Due to credential chaining, every vLEI credential can be cryptographically verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The cryptographic digests for ACDCs are generated using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)</a> protocol.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) has laid a foundation for a globally interoperable digital identity system for organizations. The vLEI EGF defines a hierarchical governance structure where GLEIF is the root of reputational trust. It employs a novel approach to key management using Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and autonomic identifiers (AIDs) that serve as the root of attributional trust. This approach enables multiple authorized representatives to collectively control their organizations’ decentralized identifiers. Most importantly, the vLEI EGF defines 6 types of vLEI credentials with rigorous cryptographic relationships that reflect the hierarchical structure of the vLEI ecosystem. Every vLEI credential is cryptographically chained and can be verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The vLEI EGF facilitates the issuance of vLEI credentials, providing the highest level of identity assurance. These credentials enable digital verification of organizations and their authorized representatives globally and across industries. The vLEIs stand as a cutting-edge, interoperable, and decentralized solution in the organizational digital identity ecosystem, positioning them as the utmost secure and trustworthy choice for global business transactions.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain started the year with the release of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/">Holochain Beta 0.1.0</a> and it’s been an avalanche of development and achievements since then. We can’t talk about everything here, but want to share some highlights with you. As we bundle up for winter in the northern hemisphere (and rejoice at summer in the southern hemisphere), let’s walk through the year together to remember where we have been.&nbsp;</p> Spring: Holochain Beta <p>The Holochain beta release continued through the spring with <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-tools-explainers/">dev tooling</a>, updates to the 0.1.x series, and even an early release of 0.2.x. Paul d’Aoust started work on our dev documentation and refreshed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dev Portal</a>, and the team could feel the excitement as we continued to improve on a stable codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking Holochain back out on the road, we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-at-ethdenver-2023/">attended EthDenver</a>, hosting a series of satellite events where we gave blockchain devs a hands-on opportunity to feel what Holochain can do, and collectively we imagined the future of the web.</p><p>In March, we had our first of two online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">Dev Trainings</a>. The course was taught by Marcus Phillips, co-founder of the immersive software engineering school <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a>, and community developer Guillem Cordoba (check out his work at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dark Soil</a>). The cohort of eighteen students learned how to work with Holochain’s backend code, preparing them to build custom distributed applications.</p><p>This spring we felt Holochain really <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">become viable</a>.</p> Summer: DWeb Camp <p>Summer took us to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-2023-holochain/">DWeb Camp</a>. For those that don’t know it, DWeb Camp is a sort of Mecca for the distributed web community. Getting to think, work, talk, and present alongside and with all of the other projects building the next web (from Filecoin and OpenAI to Secure Scuttlebutt and Spritely) was truly an honor. But we might have learned the most from the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/fellowships/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb fellows</a> who brought their openness, honesty, situated need, and greatly innovative ideas to the gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>As a co-sponsor of the event, Holochain showed up in force, with dozens of team and&nbsp; community members attending. In addition to presentations, workshops, and panels, we developed a custom app for the event. We decided to create an app for scheduling and managing emergent sessions across the event. But this app had to work in the woods, and on people’s phones. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">In the end, we stumbled and learned.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The need for mobile on Holochain has pushed us to develop a deep relationship with smartphone manufacturer <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> as a first test case for a mobile native Holochain. In May, community devs <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1663847940853571586?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo and Nick Stebbings showcased a small Holochain application at the Volla community event</a>. Since then we have been in a collaborative process of application design and testing to get Holochain apps running on their privacy-first OS.</p> Fall: Connecting to Web3 <p>Fall took the team from conference, to podcast, to conference, including a number of appearances as speakers and moderators. Check out a few of the opportunities we had to talk to the world about Holochain throughout the year.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1689684274390212622?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Diving into Crypto podcast</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1692092474506752391?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Web3 Disruptor podcast</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7puEjHI2J4&amp;list=PLOuXrtFJO6zXsTs56d0bpPmVpHjMO7m50&amp;index=1&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live 2023: How Verifiable Data Powers Up Web3</a>  <p>This fall also saw Holochain used in Web3 and blockchain contexts in new ways. <a href="https://welcometonor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nor</a>, is a Web3 gaming platform using Holo and Holochain for a variety of systems, such as identity and login. Nor is creating new models of skill based gaming and reward in Web3.</p><p>Similarly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a>, developed by Josh Hardy of the <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rain Protocol</a>, in partnership with our Executive Director Mary Camacho showed that it was possible to secure NFT assets on a Holochain app. The app is a live play, distributed art game, inspired by r/place, where players collaboratively make art which they can mint into NFTs. We showcased this game at events from <a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live</a> in London, to <a href="https://devconnect.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DevConnect</a> in Istanbul, and we even <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1721146092593586602?ref=blog.holochain.org">hosted our own event</a> spinning off from <a href="https://nftsanfrancisco.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">NFT SF</a> when the conference was sadly put on hold. Fractal Tribute acts as a proof of concept for new ways to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">augment NFTs using Holochain</a>.</p><p>In October we also held our second online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/joins-us-and-learn-holochain/">Dev Training</a>. Check out these clips from the demos:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Design Pattern for Private Data — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/KvkmfPaRqjs?si=6Ne0KSqb7N9FUb9x&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Deck Building Game — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>   Winter: Holo Feature Complete <p>The end of this year brings the next big leap for Holochain as we step into 2024. The Holo network is built on the Holochain framework to provide distributed hosting to hApps. With the release of the Holo Network-RC and the upcoming Holo Launch, we have a real case study showing a performant Holochain used for a commercial application. This will spur development of Holochain apps, and we expect an increase in both apps hosted on the Holo network and operating directly in peer networks as a result. Read <a href="https://press.holo.host/232769-holo-delivers-network-release-candidate-in-december?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo’s Lead/Org announcement</a> to learn more.</p><p>As we enter into 2024, we are excited for what is to come: New and developing collaborations like those with Nor and Volla; the growth of ecosystem projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/neighbourhoods-offers-support-to-the-green-climate-funds-sri-lankan-initiative-3532a70264b7?ref=blog.holochain.org">pilot program</a> with the Green Climate Fund in Sri Lanka; and continued application development as Holochain apps become more accessible through Holo’s hosting network.

 As we look back on the past year, we’re amazed by all our incredible accomplishments. <p>Read on to take a look at our journey through 2023, the exciting milestones we reached together, and what 2024 looks like for the Veramo community.</p> Increased community contributions and participation <p>Our community has witnessed an upsurge indicating a flourishing engagement ecosystem. This surge reflects the collective effort of our community, poured into building Veramo. Community contributions and discussion participation soared this year, creating an environment where diverse perspectives meet. We also received lots of positive feedback which has been particularly heartwarming.</p><p>2023 was the [first] year of the community for Veramo.<br>Since the first lines of code, Veramo was meant to be a public good project. It was developed in the open under the old <a href="https://github.com/uport-project">uport-project</a> org on GitHub with the intent that it would be the tool to use when getting started with SSI &amp; verifiable data.</p><p>This intent is manifested in 2 ways, the architecture and the basics.<br>The architecture we chose is open, modular, and extensible. The choice was obvious to us as we were looking for a way to work in a rapidly evolving space with new and growing standards and protocols. In such a space, it would have been hard for our team to do everything internally and reasonably keep up with everything. We opted to reuse existing tooling and libraries as much as possible instead of writing new implementations, and this option now manifests as a way for anyone to use their existing tools and libraries to create plugins for Veramo.<br>The basics are all the plugins developed alongside the core package to use as a starting point to build products and apps as well as new protocols. They cover most of what you would need to function in the issuer-holder-verifier triangle of Verifiable Credentials, like key and DID management, credential issuance, storage, messaging, presentation, and verification, with a diverse set of formats and algorithms built&nbsp;in.</p><p>The ease of adding new functionality and the ability to decide which plugins to use instead of hauling around a monolith has brought a lot of attention to the Veramo framework and has prompted many folks to not only adopt it for their projects but also to contribute back some of their additions. It’s worth highlighting some of the new features and the teams that were the most active developing them: new sub-protocols supported for did-comm: coordinate mediation, trust-ping, message-pickup, routing, as well as message attachments; support for Secp256r1 for signing credentials; a new storage plugin based on kv-store; native support for did:peer, did:jwk, did:pkh and meta-transaction support for did:ethr.</p><p><a href="https://masca.io/">Masca</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/">Sphereon</a>, <a href="https://www.tuum.tech/">Tuum tech</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, <a href="https://www.ltonetwork.com/">LTO network</a>, and <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> are some teams that contributed these features and deserve a shoutout.</p> Tech updates <p>Besides the contributions from the community, the recent releases of Veramo have focused on stability and interoperability improvements. Having a growing set of projects use Veramo means there is an increase in the number of corner cases encountered, new ways in which it is deployed, or plain interoperability friction. This is a great way to discover and fix bugs and make the platform as a whole much more robust. To that end, Veramo is now much more lenient with the encoding quirks of certain libraries, DIDs, or systems, and we upgraded the encryption capabilities for the did-comm package to adhere to the spec requirements and recommendations for key wrapping and content encryption.</p><p>Alongside the Veramo framework, we’ve had some interesting collaborations and projects this year. Our team was a launch partner for the Collab.land marketplace, creating <a href="https://dev.collab.land/help-docs/marketplace/apps/kudos">one of </a>its first mini-apps.</p><p>We significantly upgraded the architecture of <a href="https://explore.veramo.io">the agent-explore tool</a> and it now follows the same principles of modularity and extensibility as the Veramo framework. We hope this tool will foster the same kind of innovation in the user interface space as the Veramo framework already has done in the DID/Credential space. We used some of the learnings from that to build a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Veramo.veramo-vscode">VSCode extension</a> for improving the experience of working with raw Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>We also used this basis to participate in the <a href="https://jokerace.xyz/contest/polygon/0x7C8420e6237C9A592EFcAC7777d28FAe78C42394">Newforum identity hackathon</a> where our BrainShare plugin for agent-explore got us a spot among the winning projects.</p> Veramo donated to&nbsp;DIF <p>​​In October this year, <a href="https://mesh.xyz/insights/the-veramo-project-donated-to-the-decentralized-identity-foundation">Veramo was donated to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> to ensure continuous collaboration and support within the broader decentralized identity community.</p><p>As part of DIF, we’ll continue to build and develop the project, alongside our community with support from the foundation. A Veramo User Group will be created in 2024, and all the members of our community, code contributors, and partners are welcome to join. The user group will be open to all regardless of DIF membership. More details about this will be shared in January, stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> Outreach <p>Veramo had a strong presence at various events throughout the year, fostering connections and sharing insights with the wider community. From the Rebooting Web of Trust to Berlin Blockchain Week, IIW38, and Eth Denver. Alongside Ceramic, we co-hosted RepConnect at DevConnect Istanbul. Outreaches like this are great opportunities to learn, share, and connect with other people in the reputation space.</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVpCGfoSk1Q">Demo at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jvf5r33UtXk?feature=shared">Panel on Insights &amp; Action Items for Building Real Apps With Decentralized Reputation at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/veramo/veramo-didcomm-bringing-identity-to-ai-f7efd1fbdf5d">Veramo and DidComm: Bringing Identity to AI</a>&nbsp;[Blog]  <a href="https://youtu.be/LYcIjBppkGE?feature=shared">What medium is our message?</a> [EthDenver]   Conclusion <p>Community and open source will remain at the forefront of our efforts, as they have been integral to what we’ve built. In the coming months, some members of our community will be stepping up as maintainers to accelerate the work on the framework and ensure its future and sustainability.

<a href="https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/contract-upgrade-failed-because-variables-are-deleted-in-openzepplin-5-0/38341">unsafe upgradability note</a><p>OpenZeppelin is a well-known and trusted company in the blockchain world. It provides secure open-source smart contracts and libraries, which accelerate the blockchain development worldwide. For more than two years, developers from all over the world have been using OpenZeppelin’s v4 contracts to build applications. The v4 contracts were maintained, well-documented, and audited over a long period. However, On the 5th of October, a new journey began with the release the v5 of OpenZeppelin contracts. In this article, we will explain - with an example - why it is not safe to upgrade existing deployments from OpenZeppelin Contract v4 to&nbsp;v5.</p> TLDR <p>The v5 of the contracts includes significant changes and improvements. Some contracts and libraries have been restructured, while others have been removed. However, the most crucial reason for the incompatibility is that the v5 contracts of OpenZeppelin integrate a significant change to the storage layer. The contracts in v5 adopt the namespaced storage layout, which is defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a>. This change implies that the new logic of v5 contracts will query existing data and write new data in incorrect storage slots, making an upgrade from v4 to v5 not safe. Developers have several options to update an existing contract, such as reinitializing the contract, deploying it as a new proxy, or choosing to continue with updated v4 contracts. Each option has its own unique challenges and requirements.</p> Prerequisites <p>We consider the knowledge of upgradeable smart contracts and rudimentary knowledge of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) storage as a requirement for understanding this article. The following tutorials give a good overview about upgradability of smart contracts:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI</a>  <p>For the EVM storage layer we recommend the following articles:</p>  <a href="https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9">https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9</a>  <a href="https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/">https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373">https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373</a>   Comparing how state variables are stored in OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts in v4 versus&nbsp;v5 <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stores state variables in a key-value store with 256-bit keys and 256-bit values. These state variables are stored in a compact, continuous manner. Therefore, the order of the state variables in a smart contract determines their position in the&nbsp;storage.</p><p>OpenZeppelin v4 upgradeable contracts primarily use the default approach for storage management. The storage slots for state variables are determined by their sequential order in the contract. Therefore, base contracts often include a ‘storage buffer’ — defined as uint256[49] __gap; — to reserve storage slots. This will allow future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts. This approach of storage handling complicates contract management and upgradeability by increasing the risk of mistakes and storage conflicts, where new upgrades may unintentionally overwrite existing storage&nbsp;slots.</p><p>To simplify upgradability and minimize storage conflicts, OpenZeppelin v5 adopted the namespace storage layout, which has been proposed officially as ERC-7201 on June 20, 2023. The ERC-7201 recommends using pseudorandom locations derived from a namespace as the basis for new storage trees in base contracts. The root slot for storage is calculated using a <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201#formula">specific formula</a>. This approach does not require changes on the EVM level and can be implemented by grouping state variables within a struct and using assembly language to access specific storage slots directly, as shown in the&nbsp;example:</p>Example of namespace-based storage locations in a smart contract following <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a><p>In the example smart contract x and y are state variables. However, they are not stored on the first and second slots in the storage as default. They will be stored in the storage tree under the given root MAIN_STORAGE_LOCATION = 0x183a…b500, which is calculated using the suggested formula in ERC-7201.</p><p>When a v4 upgradeable contract is deployed on the network, the state variables of the contract are initialized, stored, and managed using the default storage pattern based on their order in the contracts. However, if the implementation contract is upgraded using v5 contracts, a critical issue occurs. The new v5 contracts are designed to interact with storage in a different way, using the namespaced storage layout introduced in ERC-7201. As a result, these updated contracts will not recognize or access the original storage slots used by the old contract. This mismatch in storage access will lead to dangerous and incorrect states where variables may not reflect the intended values, and functions may behave unpredictably, leading to loss of funds or compromised security.</p> Unsafe Upgradability Example <p>The following ExampleV4 contract uses OpenZeppelin v4 and imports the following contracts Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, and UUPSUpgradeable. It sets the value of exampleStateVariable, the address of the owner, the address of implementation contract, and the status of the contract to Initialized during the initialization process when it is deployed as&nbsp;proxy.</p>example upgradable contract using v4&nbsp;version<p>To check the storage keys of the state variables, we can deploy it as <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_proxy_contracts.html">proxy using Remix IDE</a> and then debug it using the <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugger.html">Debugger</a>.</p>the storage of the&nbsp;contract<p>As shown in the picture, slot 0x000…000 (slot 0) has the value 0x01 marking the contract as initialized. At Slot 0x000….033 (Slot 51) the, address of the owner of the contract is stored. At 0x000…0c9 (Slot 201) the value 7 of the exampleStateVariable is stored (Note: The variables are not sorted at slots 0, 1, 2 due to the buffer gaps between the contracts). At Slot 0x36089…82bbc the address of the implementation contract stored (Note: The slot of the implementation contract address was already hardcoded in v4 in a similar way to the namespaced storage layout to prevent conflicts).</p>map current slots to values in&nbsp;v4<p>For demonstration purposes, we will update the implementation contract to ExampleV5 using OpenZeppelin v5 contracts, without introducing new logic. To execute the upgrade, we must import the new v5 contracts, make minor modifications to the original contract to align with the new structure, and then deploy it. Then, we invoke the upgradeTo function on the proxy contract, providing the address of the new implementation contract as an argument.</p>Code of the upgradeable smart contract in OpenZeppelin version&nbsp;5<p>After upgrading the contract we can call the two state variables in the proxy contract to check their&nbsp;values.</p>the values of the state variables after the&nbsp;upgrade<p>The value of exampleStateVariable is now 1 and not 7 because the upgraded contract reads the value from the first storage slot, which was the same slot of the initialized status. Furthermore, the owner is the zero address 0x000…000 because the new implemented contract following v5 of OpenZeppelin looks for the address of the owner at another storage slot. Inspecting the v5 contract, we will find that the owner value is read from slot 0x9016…9300, which is&nbsp;empty.</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol">OwnableUpgradeable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>The same issue applies to the Initialization status of the contract. It is read from slot 0xf0c5…6a00 and not from 0x000…000 as it was in v4 contracts</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol">Initializable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>This means our very simple updated contract has incorrect values, is not initialized, and has the zero address as&nbsp;Owner.</p>compare current slots to values before and after upgrade shows the misplacing of state variables between old and new v5&nbsp;contract<p>At this point, anyone would be able to initialize it again giving the address of owner to control the contract. Even if the original owner still managed to initialize the contract before anyone else the contract will stay in an unsafe state. To explain this we will re-initialize and debug the storage of the upgraded contract using&nbsp;Remix.</p>The storage keys and values after the upgrade and re-initialization of the&nbsp;contract<p>As displayed on the above storage snapshot, the original (v4) storage slots at 0x000…0c9, 0x000…033 are not empty. Therefore, new state variables added to the contract could unintentionally use these slots, creating invalid&nbsp;values.</p> Going Forward with Existing Contracts <p>For developers, finding the best way to update existing contracts is crucial. There are several options for updating deployed v4 upgradable contracts, some of these options&nbsp;are:</p>  Reinitializing the Contract: This process involves clearing the storage and migrating the data within the contract. While this approach might be feasible for simple contracts, for complex contracts with dynamic data types such as arrays, strings, and mappings, the storage becomes overly complicated, making migration within the contract impractical, if not impossible.  Deploying as a Proxy: Similar to the <a href="https://sergiomartinrubio.com/articles/how-to-release-new-versions-of-smart-contracts/#social-migration">Social Migration</a> approach for non-upgradable contracts, this method involves deploying the new contract as a new proxy with a new address, followed by migrating the data and users to this new contract. Depending on the contract type and existing data, this process can become complicated. Additionally, it requires users’ involvement.  Updating using v4 Contracts: Likely the most advisable approach is to continue using v4 contracts. This method eliminates the need for data migration or storage restructuring. Developers need to maintain their existing OpenZeppelin v4 contracts, extending or updating only the necessary components for their specific needs when required.   Summary <p>In Ethereum, upgradeable contracts are complicated due to potential storage conflicts. The introduction of a new storage layout aims to make the upgrade process easier and cleaner. However, old upgradable v4 contracts will face issues with the new layout, as their state variables could be dislocated, leading to an invalid contract state. Therefore, a native upgrade from v4 contracts to v5 is considered as not safe and is not recommended, requiring careful selection of strategies for updating v4 Upgradeable Contracts.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/why-upgrading-openzeppelin-smart-contracts-from-version-4-to-version-5-is-unsafe-e08be30efd8a">Why Upgrading OpenZeppelin Smart Contracts from Version 4 to Version 5 is Unsafe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Should You Expect from a Tokenization Platform in 2024 
<p>Season’s Greetings from all of us at Tokeny!</p>
<p>As we approach the new year, it’s the perfect time to upgrade and take a look at your tokenization strategies. Let’s clear up a common misconception first: Far from being a straightforward task,&nbsp;building a robust tokenization stack demands more than just deploying smart contracts.</p>
<p>The platform should not only support advanced smart contracts such as ERC-3643 for on-chain compliance but also&nbsp;offer tools for transfer management, automation, data management, interoperability with existing financial systems, and a seamless investor experience. Let’s break these down below.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Tools for Automation and Token Lifecycle Management: 
<p>🎛️&nbsp;Onchain Compliance Rules: &nbsp;The platform must allow for setting up compliance rules via smart contracts (e.g., jurisdictions of investors, KYC checks, etc.) and utilizing a permission system to manage and appoint agents, for example, KYC agents for signing KYC credentials to investors’ digital identity.</p>
<p>🆔&nbsp;Digital Identities: &nbsp;Every stakeholder, and especially investors, must be properly identified on the blockchain to apply permissions and compliance rules. For this, an encrypted on-chain identity system is needed as wallets ownership cannot be used as proof of identity.</p>
<p>⛓️&nbsp;Blockchain Operations:&nbsp; As most operations result in blockchain transactions, the platform must prepare the needed parameters based on the issuers’ or their agents’ inputs, to facilitate the selection of concerned investors, gas fees, etc. Once ready, these transactions are sent for signature to the authorized agent. This should be made possible for all the functions provided by the token smart contracts (e.g., around 120 functions for the ERC3643 standard).</p>
<p>🔐&nbsp;Secure Wallet Solutions:&nbsp; Wallet solutions are needed for the issuer, its agents, and each investor. For issuers and their agents, they must support signature policies without impeding automation. For investors, they should offer non-custodial options to avoid regulatory constraints. Ideally, the wallet solution is integrated into the tokenization platform to automatically generate wallets, ensuring regulatory compliance and enabling seamless interchangeability through account abstraction.</p>
<p>🖥️&nbsp;User-friendly Interface:&nbsp; The platform must be user-friendly so that any stakeholder, regardless of coding or blockchain experience, can seamlessly navigate the platform. For investors, it should also offer an e-commerce-like experience akin to commonly used mainstream platforms with features like built-in self-custody wallets and gas tanks to eliminate friction points.</p>
 Data Management: 
<p>📊&nbsp;Real-time On-chain Data:&nbsp; The platform needs a performant indexer to sync blockchain data with the smart contracts orchestration platform. This is done by reading different nodes on the network. The platform has to provide an infrastructure management service to listen to the token and compliance smart contracts events, route to the most performing RPC, and provide a real-time data stream to the software and its users.</p>
<p>📑&nbsp;Investor Data Management: &nbsp;Managing investor data requires an automated cap table that aggregates off-chain data like personal identity data and on-chain data (i.e transaction records, digital identity credentials, etc.). In addition, issuers should be able to choose where they prefer the off-chain data to be stored.</p>
<p>📁&nbsp;Asset Data Management:&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate distribution, it is crucial to provide detailed documents and information about the tokenized assets to investors. The tokenization platform should enable the enrichment of the token with documents, third-party certifications (e.g., ESG), valuation, etc.</p>
 Interoperability with Financial Systems: 
<p>🔌&nbsp;Legacy Systems: &nbsp;Large institutions need API-ready solutions to plug and play in their legacy systems to ensure the adoption of new technologies is seamless. Synchronizing investors with their on-chain identities, or integrating token actions in existing investor portals are usually the most needed integrations.</p>
<p>🌐&nbsp;Trading Venues and DeFi Services:&nbsp; Broad distribution and diverse liquidity options are the most important reasons issuers tokenize assets on-chain. Therefore, the platform must enable issuers to connect natively to the best trading platforms (centralized exchanges, OTC, etc.), distributors, and DeFi applications (DEX, collateralization, etc.), to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>As we enter this new era of finance, asset managers, banks, and asset servicers must accelerate their tokenization market presence to stay ahead of the curve in 2024. It is crucial to collaborate with a seasoned tokenization platform provider, rather than starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Technology</a> and SpruceID hosted a webinar featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, CEO and Founder of SpruceID, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV, about their <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">recently launched mobile driver’s license</a> (mDL).</p><p>This conversation between Wayne and Ajay gave an inside look into the past couple of years working together to bring the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner-award-winning</a> mDL to the State of California residents — from addressing complexities with implementation, working to adhere to global standards, understanding the rapidly evolving market ecosystem, and more.</p><p>Read through the top 5 takeaways of this conversation, and listen to the full recording below to learn how the State of California DMV worked alongside SpruceID as their technology partner to bring this project to life.</p><p></p> 1 - People Expect a Digital Experience <p>At the start of this discussion, Ajay touched on how people expect a digital experience when interacting with any establishment in today's increasingly digital world. This expectation has been accelerated drastically by the pandemic when businesses were required to offer services online. With the shift to digital, people will inevitably be asked to verify their identity online in various situations.</p><p>Offering both a mobile driver’s license and an online self-serve onboarding experience provides increased efficiency and convenience for the user so they are not stuck in long lines waiting for a human to help them renew their driver’s license. It also greatly reduces the cost of operations within a DMV.</p><p></p> 2 - Implementing an mDL Comes with Complexities <p>Standing up a program that provisions mobile driver’s licenses has many advantages, such as reducing fraud (seen today in situations such as the billions of dollars lost by false claims to unemployment benefits online) or eliminating fake IDs. However, getting to this point isn’t without challenges and complexities.</p><p>Starting out, one question the California DMV had was how they would gain residents’ trust when they started using their digital ID. In the webinar, Wayne and Ajay touch on how SpruceID helped to introduce cryptography and other security elements, such as biometrics, to allow California to securely provision mobile driver’s licenses that could be trusted and help to eliminate issues such as fraudulent claims.</p><p>Another challenge was creating transparency with users regarding how their information is handled in the California DMV wallet app. The California DMV and SpruceID prioritized keeping users’ data private without there being any digital trail of how and where residents use their mDL. </p><p>In addition, they mention how important it was for selective disclosure to be built into the app so that residents provide only the minimum amount of information required when being asked to present their digital ID. It should be clear to users exactly what information they consent to share in each situation. For example:</p><p>Despite having to work through several complexities with the technology and ecosystem along the way, both the California DMV and SpruceID describe how they're confident this solution best serves California residents while preserving their privacy and keeping their data secure. In the full webinar recording, listen to both Wayne and Ajay dissect some of the complexities they encountered throughout this undertaking, and how they were addressed by technology.</p><p></p> 3 - Open-Source Has Its Advantages <p>One quality unique to SpruceID’s mobile driver’s license implementation is having built an open-source mobile wallet. The many benefits of using an open-source solution include things like customization, third-party audits, and increased trust and transparency. When discussing some of the open-source tools used, Ajay mentioned:</p><p>Allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software by checking the source code helps build accountability within a community of users.</p><p>In addition to the open-source approach, SpruceID also participates in a number of different working groups in order to contribute to some of the standards bodies on which our software is based. These standards bodies create technical frameworks to promote the safe and secure use of technology and define requirements for security, data elements, and more.</p><p>Wayne mentions how being an active participant and <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">helping lead events</a> for these standards groups has benefited SpruceID as an organization and has been a catalyst to drive the standards forward.</p><p></p> 4 - Market Ecosystem Opportunities are Endless <p>A high point of the webinar was hearing Wayne and Ajay talk through the multitude of market opportunities that will be brought about by the launch of California’s mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID and the California DMV talk through the market ecosystem that is being developed around digital credentials today, as well as their current efforts working with organizations that will begin accepting mobile driver’s licenses as part of their business model: </p><p>Facilitating market growth, including momentum from both users of mobile driver’s licenses and businesses accepting these digital credentials, will open many doors and opportunities for growth in the overall ecosystem.</p><p></p> 5 - The Future for California is Bright <p>As the webinar came to a close, Ajay talked through some of the exciting plans for the California DMV that lie ahead on their roadmap. To name a few, working with credit unions and banks to start accepting the mDL as an identity verification mechanism and creating digital registration cards, titles, and disabled placards. They are also collaborating with law enforcement on a way for police officers to safely and securely accept a mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID is looking forward to seeing what’s in store for the State of California DMV and working together as the current landscape evolves. We feel grateful and honored to have been able to partner with the California DMV team on this groundbreaking initiative.</p> Watch the Webinar <p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what was covered during this inspiring and educational fireside chat, so head over to our YouTube channel to listen to the whole conversation between Wayne and Ajay.</p><p>Interested in chatting with us more about your own digital credentials, whether it’s augmenting existing infrastructure or creating something new? <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact us today</a>.</p> <a href="https://youtu.be/oy7ycRoCiws?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch Webinar Recording</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Hong Kong is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000, above which detailed information, including the originator’s address or ID number, is required.  For transactions below this threshold, only the name and account number of the originator and beneficiary are&nbsp;needed.  This threshold approach aligns Hong Kong with countries like Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, differing from places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the EU, where no threshold applies.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in Hong Kong on June 1st, 2023. This was the final step of many regulatory actions that Hong Kong saw in the previous months, known as the enforcement of FATF Recommendation 16, or the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Before this, on December 7th, 2022, <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/bills.html?bill_key=10015&amp;session=2022">the Hong Kong Legislative Council approved</a> the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill 2022. This change aimed to include virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under rules for customer checks and record-keeping.</p><p>Then, on February 20th, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission put out a paper for discussion on proposed rules for VASPs. They received 152 pieces of feedback on&nbsp;it.</p><p>After looking at all the feedback, the commission made and shared detailed guidelines on <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML)</a> and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) for VASPs with SFC licenses. Finally, the Crypto Travel Rule began in Hong Kong on June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Hong Kong: Technological Solutions to Help Financial Institutions <p>To implement <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the Crypto Travel Rule</a>, Hong Kong adopted a risk-based strategy, focusing on both institutional and customer risk. This approach involved assessing technological solutions that financial institutions (FIs) could use to ensure their virtual asset (VA) transfers complied with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>According to the implementation guidelines, FIs in Hong Kong can choose any technological solution to collect and submit the necessary information for VA transfers. However, the chosen solution must enable the FI to adhere to the Travel Rule requirements. In this context, an FI could function as an ordering institution, an intermediary, or a beneficiary institution.</p><p>For compliance with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong, two primary conditions must be&nbsp;met:</p>  Effective and efficient identification of VA Transfer counterparties.  The technological solution employed must be able to submit the required information for a VA transfer in a timely and secure&nbsp;manner.  <p>Furthermore, when selecting a technological solution for VA Travel Rule compliance, FIs must consider several factors. These include the solution’s interoperability, its capacity to process information for a high volume of VA transfers, and its effectiveness in enabling FIs to implement controls for scrutinizing VA transfers.</p><p>Additionally, the solution should be capable of performing due diligence and securely retaining the required information. This comprehensive approach ensures both the safety and regulatory compliance of VA transfers under the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Shyft Veriscope stands out as an ideal Travel Rule solution</a> in line with Hong Kong’s Travel Rule compliance requirements. Built to perform thorough checks and ensure information safety, it addresses key aspects of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope simplifies identifying parties in VA transfers and facilitates the quick and secure sharing of necessary details. Its compatibility with various systems makes it suitable for all financial institutions. This efficiency and versatility make Shyft Veriscope a smart choice for complying with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Specifics of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel Rule Compliance <p>While Financial Institutions may adopt qualified technological solutions to help them, all the related stakeholders need to know the specifics that make a VA transfer Travel Rule compliant.</p>  The supervisory body for VASPs in Hong Kong is the Securities and Finance Commission.  Travel Rule implementation does not have a threshold. Irrespective of the transaction value, obtaining Travel Rule information is a must in any VA transfer. However, the volume of required information is less when it comes to transactions under HKD 8,000 or US$1,000.  The Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to all VASPs. For self-hosted wallets, Travel Rule data is to be collected as well, including account numbers associated with the&nbsp;FI.   Compliance Requirements <p>According to the provisions, the originator VASPs of a VA transfer would have to obtain, record, and transmit the required information to the beneficiary VASP in the following manner.</p>  If the transaction amount is less than 8,000 HKD, information required on the originator and beneficiary customer would only include the name and account&nbsp;number.  However, if the transaction amount goes above the threshold of 8,000 HKD or US$1,000, the required information categories would also include the originator customer’s address, customer identification number, identification document number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth.  <p>The SFC mandates that Travel Rule compliance be performed pre-transaction since, in virtual asset transactions, the settlement is immediate and irreversible.</p> Impact on Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Any sort of VASP, including exchanges and wallets, would have to make increased efforts to make their process Travel Rule compliant.</p><p>The VASPs must verify the customers’ wallet ownership when transacting with self-hosted wallets. This implies they need to establish a mechanism for confirming their customer’s ownership or control of the wallet address, which can be achieved, for instance, through a message signing&nbsp;test.</p><p>Additionally, the VASPs are required to conduct more intense monitoring of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets. They must impose transaction limits wherever necessary, possibly including setting appropriate limits on the amount of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets.</p> Global Landscape &amp; a Comparative Analysis <p>When it comes to Hong Kong’s implementation of the Travel Rule, it has many similarities and dissimilarities with its global counterparts.</p><p>For example, Hong Kong’s threshold model aligns with Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, where a broader scope of Travel Rule obligations is triggered when transactions exceed a certain limit. In contrast, countries like the US, Philippines, and Canada only enforce Travel Rule when a transaction surpasses a threshold. Yet, there are places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the European Union where no such threshold exists.</p><p>The approach to self-hosted wallets also varies significantly across jurisdictions. The United States and Canada, for instance, have not set specific guidelines. On the other hand, countries like Lichtenstein and Estonia have adopted enhanced due diligence measures. The UK and Gibraltar are moving towards gathering more information.</p><p>Hong Kong, which requires verification of information for self-hosted wallets, shares this standard with countries like Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, the European Union, and Hong Kong&nbsp;itself.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong aligns with global trends in the crypto space, marking a shift towards increased clarity and transparency. Mirroring this trend, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan also implemented the Travel Rule</a> on June 1st, 2023, followed by Portugal on July 15th, 2023, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">the United Kingdom</a> on September 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>As a result, VASPs will need to intensify their compliance efforts, and more solutions are expected to emerge within the country to assist financial institutions and VASPs in adhering to these regulations. With over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/over-80-crypto-firms-eyeing-presence-in-hong-kong-financial-secretary">80 crypto firms</a> from mainland China and other countries showing interest in setting up operations in Hong Kong, the effective implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule is poised to significantly bolster the country’s crypto&nbsp;economy.</p> Frequently Asked Questions Around Crypto Travel Rule Hong&nbsp;Kong  Q1: What is the threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>The threshold is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000. For transactions above this threshold, detailed information like the originator’s address or ID number is required.</p> Q2: What information is required for transactions below the threshold? <p>For transactions below HKD 8,000 or US$1,000, only the name and account number of the originator and beneficiary are&nbsp;needed.</p> Q3: When did the Crypto Travel Rule come into effect in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule was implemented in Hong Kong on June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Q4: What are the main obligations for VASPs under the Crypto Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>VASPs must ensure thorough customer checks and record-keeping, verify wallet ownership for self-hosted wallets, conduct intensified monitoring of VA transfers, and impose necessary transaction limits.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Despite recently introduced regulations, gambling on the black market in Germany is still alive and well. We gathered experts from the industry to discuss why that is and what can be done to curb the worrying trend of illegal gambling. 



 



<p>The drop in tax revenue from €55 million to €10 million per month is due to an inhospitable regulatory environment in Germany, according to Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, who was speaking at our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/germanys-problem-illegal-market-gambling/">webinar on black market gambling in Germany</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the introduction of the State Treaty on Gambling in 2021, German players have been flocking to either offshore operators, or unregulated black market operators. Why is this happening, and what can be done to stop it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent IDnow webinar, ‘Germany’s problem with the black market’, we gathered experts from the field, including Ted Menmuir, Content Director at the Sports Betting Community, Jochen Biewer, Managing Director at Chevron Consultants, Bernd Henning at IGamingConsult.com, Laszlo Pados, Brand Manager at Greentube GmbH, Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, and our own Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming to delve deeper into the subject and explore what operators across the board need to know.</p>



 
   
     
                     Germany’s problem with the black market. 
                     Watch a panel of experts debate why Germany has witnessed a sudden increase in black market gambling, upcoming regulatory challenges, and what the future of gambling in the German market may look like.

 The current state of gambling regulation in Germany. 



<p>Historically, Germany has had a rather complex and fragmented approach to gambling legislation, with individual states retaining considerable autonomy. Recognizing that an outright ban on online gambling was unsuccessful and had allowed offshore operators to flourish, a new State Treaty on Gambling was enacted in 2021 to regulate the market and offer licenses to German operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (GlüStV)</a> was first luanched, it introduced a centralized licensing system for online sports betting and casino games and aimed to unify and modernize the regulation of gambling across the country. A noble cause indeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while the requirement of operators to have a license opened the market and allowed private operators to break the state monopoly on certain forms of gambling, it also introduced several restrictions and player protection measures, that, some argue, have largely driven players to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



  Deposit and stake limits<br>  Identity verification<br>  Strict advertising guidelines<br>  Centralized database for monitoring activities  



<p>Read more in our blog post, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Online Gambling in Germany: regulations, restrictions and ramifications</a>‘.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos licensed by the national gambling authority (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/">Glücksspielbehörde der Länder, GGL</a>) must enforce a deposit limit of €1,000 per player per month across all operators. This is monitored through a centralized database to check player behavior. To prevent excessive gambling, players are subjected to a €1 stake limit on casino games and a 5-second delay on slot machines. Operators must also pay a 5.3% turnover tax on each bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sportsbook operators face similar restrictions regarding deposit limits. Taxes are even higher, with a whopping 8% tax levied on sports betting. Certain types of betting, such as live betting and fantasy sports, are prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As pointed out in our webinar, the DSWV report shows that between 2021 and 2022, total <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/compliance-updates/2023/03/13/131693/german-sports-betting-association-calls-for-rethinking-of-regulation-to-combat-the-black-market/">sports betting stakes fell from €9.4 billion to €8.2 billion</a>, and as a result, taxes collected fell from €470 million to €433 million, a drop of 13%.</p>



 What are the risks of black market gambling? 



<p>Perhaps because of the above, the German Betting Trade Association (DSWV) has reported a 65% increase in illicit gambling activities and sports betting activities and is calling for more action against black market activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling sites that operate without the necessary licenses from the GGL or use alternate licenses from international authorities such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority MGA</a> or Curaçao are operating in defiance of the legal frameworks established by the government, and are therefore considered black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers who use illegal or unregulated online platforms are doing so at their own risk, as consumer protection standards may not necessarily be enforced, which increases the risk of fraud, a lack of fair play, or responsible gambling mechanisms for players. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">Illegal gambling operations can also be used for money laundering</a> and other illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of accountability and transparency can also contribute to difficulties in tracking financial transactions and investigating illegal activities.</p>



 Betting bad: What factors contribute to the growth of illegal gambling? 



<p>A lively discussion point from the webinar was what forced law-abiding German citizens to the black market. Participants suggested several reasons.&nbsp;</p>



  Better entertainment: Players are attracted to offshore gambling sites because they offer more games, betting options and bonus offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  No limits: There is no pre-set deposit limit, but players are often encouraged to set a daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit as part of the operator’s responsible gambling strategy. Similarly, there is no €1 stake limit. Players can choose stake size according to preferences and financial capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  More features: Black market online casinos also offer features such as automatic betting, which spins the slot machine reels a pre-defined number of times without the need to manually click after each spin. There is also no 5-second delay on virtual slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Higher RTP: Due to the high tax rates for German operators, RTPs (return-to-player) on games are much lower, leading to smaller pay-outs on regulated platforms. As players often opt for games with the highest RTPs, they are invariably drawn to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Better experience: No deposit and stake limits, no predefined spin duration, more features, and more games can lead to an overall better user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>While there are a multitude of reasons for consumers to opt for black market gambling sites, a long and expensive licensing process also means many operators may find it more attractive to be licensed elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although being a licensed operator has its advantages, not least of which is being able to show you are compliant and adhere to fair play and responsible gaming measures, it does not necessarily make financial sense. Revenue is capped due to deposit limits, taxes are high, and the offering is limited as every game needs to be tested and approved by GGL (even if another operator already offers the exact same game).</p>



 The challenges, loopholes and regulatory hurdles of the German market. 



<p>Since coming into effect, the German State Treaty has proven to be largely ineffective in preventing access to the black market. Attempts at geo-blocking websites are often ineffective, as a recent example from Turkey showed, where one unregulated site was blocked but within minutes had sent a new URL to players via an SMS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main tool German authorities have in the fight against the black market is the ability to pressure payment providers to not process payments for illegal operators. However, when one payment method fails, players invariably just switch methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important factor driving players to the black market is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. As per KYC requirements, German operators are required to verify players at the registration stage or within 72 hours to weed out fraudsters and prevent underage users from accessing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the user experience, especially for privacy-conscious Germans can be seen as a hurdle many are simply unwilling to surmount. Few people want to hand over personal details to use a product or service they don’t know much about. Many offshore operators don’t require immediate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-verification/">identity verification</a>, and usually only do so when players withdraw (a lot of) money from the site. In the case of the Malta Gaming market, this is usually north of €2,000.</p>



 Challenges faced by regulators. 



<p>With a steady decline in tax revenues from legal gambling activities, regulators need to create a more supportive and inclusive environment for players and operators alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://www.dswv.de/">German Betting Association (DSWV)</a> has pledged to work closer with operators to crack down on illegal operators. Industry experts don’t necessarily see this as the right approach, as more bans won’t solve the problem of players being drawn to more attractive offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prohibition and restrictions can drive consumers directly to the black market. As covered in the webinar, high barriers to entry for operators, such as a lengthy licensing process and high taxes on stakes, can be a significant barrier to entry for many operators, while players are often deterred from regulated operators by the monthly deposit and wagering limits, as well as the need to verify their identity before placing a bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the webinar, Bernd Henning of <a href="https://www.igamingconsult.com/en/">IGamingConsult.com</a> agreed that while steps must be taken to prevent players from using the black market, the main conundrum facing operators is “How can we operate within the confines of the law and still make a profit?”</p>



 Does LUGAS help or hinder? 



<p>LUGAS, which is Germany’s Interstate Gambling Evaluation System, is used to evaluate the data submitted by operators and ensure deposit limits and other regulations are met. It is mandatory for all online gambling operators to connect to LUGAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a cross-operator database, it includes deposit limits and regulates access to the regulator’s platform. The system enforces a rule that restricts a player to accessing only one platform at a time, coupled with a specific deposit limit. However, the system is not without its detractors, with even the DSWV raising concerns about data protection. A common criticism is that operators themselves have no way of auditing LUGAS, which raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/aufsichtssysteme/technische-richtlinien-und-zugang-zum-testsystem-des-laenderuebergreifenden-gluecksspielaufsichtssystem-lugas">LUGAS</a> appears to be contributing to the growing trend of players turning to the black market. In Denmark, for example, the imposition of a deposit limit led to a significant shift of players to unregulated casinos. However, as soon as this restriction was lifted, players returned to the regulated market. This underlines the importance for regulators to monitor developments in other regulated markets and learn from their experiences with different regulations to effectively navigate the dynamic landscape of online gambling.</p>



 The way forward for regulators, operators, and players. 



<p>The current landscape of gambling regulation in Germany is a valiant, but perhaps misguided attempt to modernize the industry and strike a balance between consumer protection and market openness. However, ironically, it also appears to be driving users and operators to the black market, which suggests a misalignment with the original goal of player protection. A comprehensive re-evaluation of the entire regulatory process may be necessary to achieve the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep players within the regulated sphere, cooperation with established international regulators like the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">MGA</a> is essential. Working together to simplify processes and gain a deeper understanding of the market will benefit German regulators, operators, and players alike. For example, the removal of deposit and wagering limits could help to retain players, while the introduction of a game whitelist could streamline the licensing process for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ongoing discussions within the German regulatory landscape underline the importance of adapting strategies to adjust to shifting trends and market development. Whether this is done by launching a series of consultations with invested stakeholders like what is currently happening in the UK will ultimately be the decision of German regulators and policymakers. What is clear though is that a collaborative and adaptive approach will be key in creating a thriving, regulated gambling industry that addresses the challenges of an attractive black market.</p>

  A new look for Bluesky — the social butterfly — and a public web interface.

<p>Today, we announced a new logo for Bluesky:</p>

 Why did we choose a butterfly? 
<p>Well, of course, it flies. But more importantly, it is a symbol of change and transformation. Early on, we noticed that people were organically using the butterfly emoji 🦋 to indicate their Bluesky handles. We loved it, and adopted it as it spread. The butterfly speaks to our mission of transforming social media into something new.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, we are starting to open up. Posts on Bluesky have been public from the start through the open protocol, but today we’re making them publicly accessible through the app. We’re unfolding a little bit at a time, and are excited to bring you along on this journey of metamorphosis!</p>
 What’s in a name? 
<p>The name “Bluesky” was originally a placeholder for the project started by Twitter to build an open social protocol. I decided to keep the name when I was chosen as the lead of the project. It’s memorable and symbolizes the open space of possibilities: the Twitter bird freed from a closed platform to fly in Bluesky’s open ecosystem.</p>

The last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.
<p>As the project matured, we named the underlying standard the AT Protocol, or atproto. Bluesky, as the more colorful (and less technical) name everyone was familiar with, is also what we named the first app we built on atproto. But Bluesky is not the limit. Many more apps and experiences are already beginning to emerge — there are thousands of custom feeds, dozens of other clients, and atproto will eventually support other apps. We hope that Bluesky, as the first app, will be a catalyst for change and transform how social media works, like a butterfly flapping its wings.</p>
 What if I don’t like butterflies? 
<p>The great thing about an open network is that anyone can build on top of it and customize it further! Maybe you like birds more. Well, someone could build BirdSky, and you could switch to using that and still be in the same network, still have the same friends, and still see the same posts.</p>
<p>The protocol that makes Bluesky, BirdSky, and endless other options possible is also what makes Bluesky “billionaire-proof.” Just like you can change email providers or cell phone carriers and bring all your contacts, photos, or messages with you, in an open network, you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 Explore Bluesky 
<p>We built Bluesky to be a home for public conversation — breaking news, commentary and analysis, jokes and more. And we’re taking one step closer to this goal by releasing a public web view, which means that you don’t have to be logged in to view posts on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can easily view Bluesky posts without being logged in. Sharing will be more convenient — whether it's a joke you want to text a friend, or a post you want to embed in an article.</p>

 In November 2022, the European Banking Authority issued its guidelines for the use of remote entry solutions in the banking and financial sector. High-level or substantial identification schemes and qualified electronic signature solutions took the spotlight. So what’s the difference between these two solutions? How do you choose? PVID vs QES: Which solutions are best for banking and financial relationships? 



 A changing regulatory environment: an overview. 



 The six requirements of the Monetary and Financial Code. 



<p>Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) sets out six means of customer identification, to ensure that the customer enters into a remote relationship in complete confidence. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking establishment</a> must apply at least two of these measures (generally number 1 plus another complementary measure) in order to comply with local <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">anti-money laundering directives</a>.</p>



 







 European Banking Association recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Since October 2, 2023, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2022/EBA-GL-2022-15%20GL%20on%20remote%20customer%20onboarding/1043884/Guidelines%20on%20the%20use%20of%20Remote%20Customer%20Onboarding%20Solutions.pdf">European Banking Association (EBA) has been recommending the use of solutions</a> such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes, such as PVID, in order to strengthen the fight against fraud when entering into a relationship.</p>



 The position of the AMF and ACPR in France.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In line with the EBA’s recommendations, the authorities that regulate the French financial market, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de (ACPR), point out the vulnerabilities notably linked to the first installment in the fight against fraud. However, this third measure remains compliant, and is often perceived as less burdensome in terms of user experience, and simpler for regulated institutions to implement, than the measures outlined by the EBA.</p>



 Focus on complementary entry methods. 



<p>Following the EBA’s recommendations, solutions such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes like PVID are favored by regulators when it comes to guaranteeing a more secure entry into the relationship. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



 Qualified electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> offers the highest level of security and guarantee of all electronic signatures. It reliably identifies the signatory and protects it against falsification or alteration. It uses a qualified certificate issued by a certified supplier and it is a particularly robust solution from an anti-fraud point-of-view, and inclusive from a user experience point-of-view.</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a picture of his or her identity document&nbsp;  The user’s face is then captured on video&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, the user signs his or her contract electronically  



 







 PVID certified by ANSSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In March 2021, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI issued a set of requirements for Remote Identity Verification Service Providers (PVID)</a>. The aim of this certification is to create a uniform, trusted service offering for identity verification providers. This solution is built for security, and is designed to limit identity fraud and advanced forgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a video capture of his or her document and face.&nbsp;  These captures are then automatically and manually verified by an agent specialized in document and identity fraud.&nbsp;  A file of evidence is built up, and a verdict is reached on the authenticity of these captures and on the identity of the person concerned.  



 







<blockquote><p>Financial operators need to strike the right balance between having a system that filters out as many fraud attempts as possible, while letting legitimate customers through.</p>Baptiste Forestier – Head of Compliance &amp; DPO at Hero</blockquote>



 The choice of solution: PVID vs QES. 



<p>To strike the right balance, both PVID and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) offer substantial advantages, as mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-certification-interview/">IDnow is one of the few certified providers</a> of both electronic signature and identity verification solutions who can help you achieve compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our qualified e-signature solution boasts broad geographical coverage and an easy-to-use workflow, while meeting the main needs of today’s financial players: compliance, fraud prevention and an optimized customer experience.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>This 4-part blog series has been written to explore why money in its current form is a primary driver of the metacrisis¹ and what an alternative system could look like. We have divided our reflections into four sections to address the following questions:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic?  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios?  What could a desirable future scenario actually look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?   Part 1 (of 4): what are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? <p>The global monetary system sits at the centre of every crisis we face, yet it is often excluded from mainstream diagnostics and potential response strategies. In this blog we will trace a number of issues from the intrinsic qualities of money itself, through layers of the economy such as money issuance rights and the profit motive, to the brutal service level manifestations of monetary colonisation and transactional oppression.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mrthetrain?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joshua Hoehne</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><blockquote>1. Money as an intrinsically extractive technology</blockquote><p>In economic textbooks and in the general public discourse, money is often framed as a neutral tool that enables the real economy to function. Perceptions have shifted somewhat following David Graeber’s work highlighting that its origins were bound to social relationships rather than to barter². Despite this, there is still a persistent idea that whilst money might represent underlying social contracts, it is not a powerful force in its own right. In contrast to this benign conception of money, Daniel Schmachtenberger has recently described it as a “unit of game theoretic optimality”³. He argues that it is a uniquely destructive technology for the following reasons:</p>  Money as a highly liquid and abstract value layer: when we exchange goods or services for fiat money (i.e. currency that is not backed by a physical resource such as gold) we are taking complex, entangled values and ruthlessly converting them into a single, indiscriminate and highly liquid token of opportunity. In doing so we are incentivised to consume, exploit and pollute the base layer value of everything.  Singularly upside returns: in an exchange based situation there is a point after which having more of a tangible good or service leads to diminishing returns. In the case of money the opposite is true. Once a base resource is converted into money, it can then be leveraged to generate further monetary returns (e.g. interest, dividends, speculative trading). Thus the liquid token that was exchanged for an underlying resource can self-perpetuate, giving rise to greater claims on other resources and creating an ever increasing cycle of extraction.  <p>As an example, imagine somebody who runs a rose farm and agrees to exchange roses for another commodity such as oil. Having arranged the trade there would be a limit to how many roses would be deemed useful by the supplier of the oil. At this point the roses would have a low liquidity value and there would be a diminishing return on harvesting them. Contrast this scenario with the reality of being able to exchange the roses immediately for money. If the current demand for roses is high, there is a strong incentive to force grow them and sell as many as possible, irrespective of the impact on the intrinsic health of the plants and soil. The money received in exchange for the physical plants can then be used to gain access to more oil (or anything else, including converting the rose farm into a car park if it is more profitable to do&nbsp;so).</p><blockquote>2. Profit as an extractive force that harnesses the liquid optimality of&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Money can also be understood as the crystallised outcome of profitable activity. Whilst profit generation might be the surface level target, the fundamental goal is to secure the rights over future choices and resources. Profit is money and money is liquid optimality.</p><p>Profit itself is variously described as a distributed signal of value, an appropriate reward, a driver for innovation and the cause of the economic growth obligation. Under different circumstances each of these claims is both true and disputable. If we want to avoid unhelpful, binary reactions to the idea that in its current form profit (and indirectly money) is an extractive force, then these dual ‘truths’ are important to unpack. How would our behaviour change if we understood profit to be a shapeshifting force depending on the&nbsp;context?</p><p>As a signal of value, profit is an important way for people to indicate their preferences and thus collectively shape economic activity. Without such a mechanism we would be reliant on a type of authoritarian centralised planning. In terms of motivation and inspiring progress, it also provides a powerful incentive. However, if we consider how narrowly we define profit can we legitimately claim that it represents value creation? Can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or geographical context? In an interconnected world, externalities are a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The way that we define, measure and use profit determines its form. Thus, profit can continue to exist as an extractive claim over undefined future value flows, but it could also be reimagined as a generative tool for decentralised inclusion.</p><blockquote>3. Commercial bank money issuance as a multiplier of future extraction and repression</blockquote><p>The lion’s share of money issued in today’s economy is digitally created by commercial banks in the form of debt. The flexibility of this system has its benefits but its unregulated impact on living systems is profoundly destructive. When debt is issued in this way it creates a future claim on energy, materials and human labour. The right to use the credit (and its associated interest) in the present day creates a future obligation to convert biophysically linked reserves into decoupled monetary units of repayment.</p><p>A second observation is that entrusting the money supply to a niche group of profit incentivised bankers, skews the distribution of who receives funding and thus perpetuates structural inequalities.</p><blockquote>4. Transactional oppression</blockquote><p>In 2010 Wikileaks was permanently blocked from accessing its Paypal account. More recently, a number of journalists and activists have reported having their accounts blocked or removed. A less publicised but equally debilitating phenomenon is that millions of people worldwide are denied the right to a bank account at all. In the UK alone, 1.3 million adults are described as being ‘debanked’ with no access to an account⁴. For some people, this may be a personal choice, but for many others it results from failing to meet KYC (know your client) requirements.</p><p>It is hardly a coincidence that many of the countries with the highest cryptocurrency usage are also amongst the most financially exclusive. For example, Thailand, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa all have an uptake of between 19–20% on a per capita basis and an unbanked population higher than&nbsp;30%⁵⁶.</p><p>If money is a social contract, then the ability to transact could be embedded as a fundamental human right, yet our current system ensures that for many this is far from the case. Whilst existing cryptocurrencies offer some reprieve, the dominance of centrally issued and controlled money still forces many communities and even countries into the&nbsp;margins.</p><blockquote>5. Monetary colonisation as a brutal expression of capitalist self-preservation</blockquote><blockquote>Colonialism may be over, but the system that it created — a system designed to siphon wealth from South to North — remains very much in place — <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2018/10/13/the-case-for-reparations#:~:text=Colonialism%20may%20be%20over%2C%20but,problem%20is%20in%20the%20past.">Jason&nbsp;Hickel</a></blockquote><p>The statues of colonists, slave traders and racists are being torn down across the US and UK. These protests reject past actions and condemn the suffering, extraction and violence on which the wealth of such nations was built. What they perhaps fail to acknowledge is that the colonisation is not something that happened in the past. Instead, it is still actively being deployed as a tactic to ensure the comfort and stability of the countries who hold the greatest monetary&nbsp;power.</p><p>One shocking example of this can be seen in the Franc de la Communauté Financière Africaine (<a href="https://taxjustice.net/2021/03/22/the-cfa-franc-as-a-vivid-symbol-of-colonial-continuities-in-francophone-africa/">CFA Franc</a>) which was introduced to Western Africa by the French in 1945. The fourteen countries that use it today are still required to trade internationally in Euros via the French Treasury. They also continually rank amongst the poorest countries in the world. On a wider scale, the US dollar as the global reserve currency creates multiple advantages for its issuing country. With that privilege comes a responsibility that is rarely acknowledged. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) has a large following in the US, because for a country that mints the most prevalent global currency, the ability to print money is in fact a viable option to stimulate economic activity. Firstly, they can use it to buy goods and services from foreign countries who have a constant requirement for dollars. Secondly, their exchange rate is extremely resistant to devaluation. For the vast majority of countries that do not have a widely desired sovereign currency, this is simply not an option. On the flip side, when the US, UK or Eurozone raise their interest rates to maintain local financial stability, they are also outsourcing their inflation and often accompanying austerity to countries that hold debt in those currencies.</p><p>In our view, the five drivers outlined above are insidiously powerful forces. Left unaddressed they will render a just transition or even a survivable future impossible. This opens up some difficult questions. If we don’t make the self-sovereignty of money a priority, are inclusivity initiatives such as redistributing philanthropic funds futile? Whilst money exists as a singular, abstractive and indiscriminate medium of exchange, do we have any chance of first repairing and then regenerating our planetary home? As the spread of AI and web3 intensifies, how will this extraordinary technological power be&nbsp;wielded?</p><p>Whether such tools are deployed towards further speculation, extraction and exploitation or in service of our collective vitality is the fundamental question of our&nbsp;time.</p><p>As always, we are sharing these thoughts to provoke discussion and to invite feedback. Some initial ideas for alternative monetary futures are the subject of our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">next&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB. We aspire to start working on some tangible proofs of possibility for bioregional currencies in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>References:</p>  We are using the term metacrisis to describe the underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises.

<p>Have you been reading about digitally verifiable credentials and wanted to know more about them? Are you interested in digitally verifiable credentials but do not know how to get started? Well, then, you are at the right place – this blog post is all about getting started with verifiable credentials and seeing how they change how credentialing is done.</p>



<p>Credentialing is a simple enough workflow we all understand – an organisation issues the credentials to a recipient. In turn, the recipient can present, share or exchange the credentials to seek new opportunities, services and other things. Today, along with printed credentials, there are digital credentials as well – these are often in PDF and can be easily stored and exchanged. Verifiable credentials improve this workflow – they are secure, tamper-evident data representations that help anyone verify the credentials’ issuer and authenticity.</p>



<p>MARK Studio from Dhiway is a credential lifecycle management platform which empowers issuers to design, issue and manage verifiable documents as blockchain-anchored credentials. Including the blockchain as a system of record leads to immutable records, and thus these are tamper-evident. With MARK Studio, anyone can create certificates online and quickly issue them through well-thought-out steps. Transitioning from traditional print-ready credentialing flows to blockchain credentials could be daunting. So, MARK Studio has a Free plan to try out the workflows before committing to adoption. You can sign up to <a href="https://studio.dhiway.com/auth/register">FREE PLAN</a> and get started. The videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dhiwaynetworks">YouTube channel</a> can help you build and issue your first verifiable credential.</p>



<p>MARK Studio comes “batteries included” with over 60 templates and designs to choose from when creating Learning and Education Records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records and Workplace Experience Records. Starting the credentialing journey with MARK Studio ensures that while you get a feel for verifiable credentials, you look at all kinds of records and data that need provenance – and you are soon on your way to verifiable documents. The verifiable documents issued on MARK Studio help reduce the risk of data abuse and thus add value to your data governance strategies. With secure blockchain-anchored credentials now readily available, you can even look at needs such as temporary passes, event passes and IDs to be designed and issued on MARK Studio.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials on the CORD network blockchain enable recipients to request, receive, store and exchange a whole set of documents they collect as a learner and in their professional roles. The ease of machine verification, data security and integrity, and combining various sets of credentials into a need-based verifiable document (a “digital resume”) makes it a compelling proposition for all key stakeholders – the issuer, the verifier and the recipient. Today, many organisations are switching to blockchain-anchored verifiable credentials with MARK Studio – sign up and try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming consequences.</p>  
<p>A robust identity security strategy requires the consolidation of a broad set of identity assurance capabilities into a unified approach. A new position paper by industry analyst Simon Moffatt of the Cyber Hut explores the current state of IAM security and proposes guidelines for organizations to build a comprehensive Identity Assurance approach that can tackle these challenges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Enterprises Face Multiple Operational and Identity Security Challenges  
<p>The current technological landscape has become increasingly complex, characterized by hybrid deployments, fragmented technology silos, and inadequate visibility and metrics. Employee onboarding and credential management processes remain manual and disjointed, creating friction and security gaps. The rising volume and variety of remote work and people supply chains puts further strain on systems and business.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Outdated Authentication and Identity Verification Processes Prevalent  
<p>Authentication stands out as a critical pinch point in user interactions, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Many organizations employ multiple MFA solutions without a clear pathway to consolidation or adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless authentication.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the lack of coherence and continuity in identity verification and validation processes severely impacts business and security, leading to issues such as cumbersome employee verification, fraud, credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.</p> 
 The Need for Converged Identity Assurance  
<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> strategy involves viewing authentication in stages of maturity, moving from siloed and coarse-grained methods to relying on an assured identity that is continually verified. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and trust boundaries, and overlay existing authentication with verified identities on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>By embracing a converged Identity Assurance approach, organizations improve identity security, accelerate adoption of Zero Trust principles, improve IAM productivity, and reduce their compliance exposure.</p>

 What happened? 
<p>On December 16th Truffle Security disclosed a <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">Google OAuth vulnerability</a> that allows employees, even after leaving a company, to retain access to applications like Slack and Zoom. The vulnerability arises from the ability to create Google accounts where the email address has the domain of the corporate organization but does not actually belong to that organization. This poses a risk to organizations, service providers like Zoom and Slack, and Google itself.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>1. First, the user must have an account in your corporate Google workspace, such as <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></p>
<p>2. Then the user creates a new personal Google account, using their existing email, but they add “+something” to the user name part of the email, eg. <a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a>. Because Google will essentially ignore anything after the + in an email address, the user will be able to receive all the verification emails in their corporate inbox. (They need to do this in advance of leaving the organization.)</p>
<p>User must click “Use your existing email” and use the alias user+something@example.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Now the user can use this google account to sign into 3rd party apps under the corporate domain. This is possible because many of these 3rd party apps only verify that the domain part of the email used when logging into the account is a known corporate account. (<a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a> ⇒ domain = <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>)</p>
<p></p>
 Was YeshID Affected? 
<p>No, users attempting to use this technique to log into YeshID would not be successful.</p>
 Recommendations 
 Detection 
 
 If your organization has tools to perform an email search (such as the Security Center Investigation Tool in Google Workspace), look for emails sent to addresses containing your domain and a “+” symbol to detect these shadow account creations. 
 Review the user lists in the applications your organization uses to look for accounts with email addresses containing a “+” symbol to detect users who may have exploited this vulnerability. 
 
 Prevention 
 
 If your organization uses applications that allow any user to sign in as long as they are from your domain, consider disabling that feature. For example, in Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace">https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace</a> 
 Switch the application to use SAML for SSO if possible

<p>Businesses face an ever-expanding array of cyber threats. Phishing, the deceptive practice of tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, sits prominently at the top. It’s not just about lost data; it’s about lost trust, credibility, and in many cases, significant financial repercussions. Enter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an established tool in the cybersecurity arsenal. But as cybercriminals become savvier, the call for more advanced, phishing resistant MFA grows louder.</p>
 
Understanding Phishing Resistant MFA 
<p>Phishing resistant MFA takes the foundational principles of MFA and enhances them. While traditional MFA might rely on something you know (a password) and something you have (a mobile device for an SMS code), phishing-resistant variants add authentication request elements much harder to replicate or steal. This could be a physical device like a hardware token or something inherent to hardware security keys the user, like a biometric detail.<br>
The biometric authentication and login process, for instance, utilizes unique physical or behavioral attributes – from fingerprints to voice patterns. Its strength lies in its uniqueness; while a password can be stolen or guessed, replicating a retina pattern remains profoundly challenging.<br>
Today, cybercriminals employ various tactics to deceive individuals and organizations such as:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Unlike generic phishing attacks that target a broad audience, spear phishing is tailored to a specific individual or organization. Having done meticulous research, the attacker crafts a personalized message, making the deceit harder to spot. A typical scenario might involve mimicking communication from a senior executive or an HR representative requesting sensitive data or actions. 
 Whaling: This is a subset of spear phishing but targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs. Given the potential high return, attackers invest time in understanding the executive’s behavior, likes, dislikes, and even personal schedules, aiming to bypass traditional detection methods. 
 Smishing and Vishing: As mobile usage grows, attackers have begun to target users via SMS (Smishing) and voice calls (Vishing). For example, one might receive an SMS from a “bank” claiming unauthorized activity and requesting immediate action. Vishing attacks, meanwhile, involve human interaction, with attackers using social engineering techniques to extract information over a phone call.<br>
To fully grasp the gravity and evolution of these contemporary cyber threats, it’s crucial to delve into the historical backdrop from which they emerged. Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
 
 Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
<p>Over the past few decades, as the digital world has expanded, so too have cyber threats. Phishing began as simple email scams but rapidly evolved, targeting more prominent organizations and employing more sophisticated tactics. In response resist phishing, the cybersecurity industry introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure authentication and add an extra layer of protection.<br>
Early MFA systems were rudimentary, often relying solely on passwords and security questions. But with the increasing sophistication of modern phishing campaigns and techniques, MFA had to evolve, leading to the advanced phishing-resistant systems we see today.</p>
 
Why Phishing Resistant MFA is Essential 
<p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in phishing attempts targeting businesses, and online services regardless of size or domain. Beyond the immediate financial losses, which can be substantial, phishing attacks erode client trust and tarnish an organization’s image for years.<br>
Furthermore, the data they store grows as more businesses undergo digital transformations. This makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Incorporating phishing resistant technologies and security keys into MFA can act as a formidable barrier, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
 
ROI of Phishing-Resistant MFA 
<p>When considering any significant change in organizational processes, especially one that involves costs, it’s essential to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI). With phishing-resistant MFA, the ROI isn’t just measured in monetary terms. Yes, there can be direct cost savings from averting potential cyberattacks, but the intangible benefits are equally vital.<br>
Enhanced brand reputation, infrastructure security agency increased customer trust, and adherence to industry regulations can result in long-term business benefits, from customer retention to easier stakeholder negotiations. In essence, the investment in phishing-resistant MFA could yield returns far beyond the financial.</p>
 
Preliminary Steps Before Implementation 
<p>Rushing headfirst into implementing any security solution without a strategy is a recipe for potential failure. Start with a comprehensive security assessment. Engage experts to understand where your vulnerabilities lie and which assets are most at risk.<br>
An equally critical component is understanding your users. An overly complex system might have substantial resistance, leading to workarounds compromising security. It’s essential to strike a balance – a system robust in its security but user-friendly.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA 
 
User Education and Training 
<p>Technological measures are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. Your users – employees – are on the front lines. Regular training sessions help reinforce the importance of security. Beyond theoretical knowledge, interactive sessions, such as simulated phishing attacks, can provide practical experience, preparing them for real-life scenarios.</p>
 
Choosing the Right MFA Solution 
<p>The market is flooded with a range of phishing-resistant MFA products. Each boasts its set of features and benefits. While evaluating, look beyond just the security features. Consider the ease of integration into existing systems, how scalable the solution is, its user experience, and its cost-effectiveness. An ideal phishing resistance and solution would align with both your IT infrastructure and budgetary considerations.</p>
 
Phased Implementation 
<p>A phased approach is often more manageable and less disruptive. Begin with the most critical systems that, if compromised, could result in the most significant harm. Parallelly, prioritize high-risk user groups. As you iron out any teething issues and achieve success, expand the implementation to cover more systems and users.</p>
 
Regular Testing and Evaluation 
<p>Implementing a strong phishing resistant MFA isn’t the end. Cyber threats evolve, and your defenses should adapt accordingly. Regularly scheduled penetration tests can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities. Monitoring tools can offer real-time data on the MFA’s effectiveness, allowing for timely tweaks and refinements.</p>
 
Creating a Responsive Support System 
<p>Challenges and uncertainties often mark transition periods. A robust support system can ease these teething pains. Whether through helplines, chat support, or on-ground IT teams, ensure users can easily access assistance. A two-way communication channel can also provide valuable user feedback, refining the MFA system.</p>
 
Ensuring Backup and Recovery Options 
<p>Every system can face hiccups. From a user losing their hardware token to a biometric system failing to recognize a fingerprint, having backup systems in place is crucial. Clear protocols for such scenarios can prevent potential lockouts and ensure continuity of operations.<br>
In addition to these common concerns, addressing the need for offline access is essential, particularly when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable, such as during travel.<br>
Here are some strategies to manage these situations:</p>
 
 Offline Access Solutions: Implement offline access features in your phishing-resistant MFA system. This could involve using physical tokens or biometric methods that don’t rely on real-time verification from a central server. For instance, a hardware token generating one-time codes or a biometric system storing validation data locally can provide secure access even without an internet connection. 
 Travel-Friendly Authentication Methods: When users travel, especially across different time zones or areas with limited connectivity, they need reliable authentication methods. Consider providing additional travel-specific hardware tokens or setting up temporary access codes that remain valid for the travel period. 
 Backup Verification Methods: Establish backup verification methods when the primary MFA method fails. For instance, you could use a secondary mobile device as a fallback option or provide a limited number of use-once codes that can be securely stored and used only when necessary. 
 
 Types of Phishing Resistant MFA Tools 
<p>To truly understand the scope of phishing-resistant MFA, it’s crucial to explore the variety of tools available. Hardware tokens, for example, are physical devices that generate time-sensitive codes. While these tokens are secure, they can be lost or stolen.<br>
Biometric systems, on the other hand, offer authentication through facial recognition, fingerprint scans, or even voice patterns. There’s also behavioral-based authentication, which analyzes patterns in user behavior (like typing speed or mouse movements) to confirm identity and to secure their login credentials and credentials. Each tool has advantages and challenges, making it imperative for organizations to choose based on their specific needs.</p>
 
Integration with Other Security Measures 
<p>While formidable and phishing-resistant, MFA can be even more potent when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. For instance, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) adds a layer of encryption and security to data transmissions.<br>
Combining an authentication method MFA with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device is compromised, unauthorized users still need multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. A multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant authentication methods MFA can create a robust defense mechanism against cyber threats.</p>
 
Enhancing Phishing-Resistant MFA with BlockID 
<p>While phishing-resistant MFA stands strong, its potency is amplified when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. Our BlockID app, for instance, provides a seamless experience in secure digital identity verification, aligning perfectly with the principles of phishing-resistant MFA. When coupled with a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an added layer of encryption and security protects data transmissions.<br>
Further solidifying security, combining a tool like the BlockID app with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized users still require multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. This combination results in a multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant methods, positioning organizations at the forefront of defense against cyber threats.</p>
 
Addressing Common Challenges 
<p>Change is often met with resistance. Employees accustomed to older systems might view phishing-resistant MFA as an unnecessary complication. Addressing these concerns, clarifying the change’s rationale, and offering training can ease the transition.<br>
On the technical side, the implementation might face hitches like any IT project. It’s crucial to have an IT team well-prepared to address these. Lastly, while security is paramount, user convenience shouldn’t be wholly sidelined. An overly cumbersome system might lead to non-compliance, defeating its very purpose.</p>
 
Benefits Beyond Security 
<p>While the primary purpose of phishing-resistant MFA is to bolster security, its benefits extend beyond just protection. Implementing advanced MFA can signal to customers and stakeholders that an organization is committed to safeguarding its data—a crucial factor in building trust.<br>
Moreover, in some industries, regulatory compliance necessitates specific security measures to prevent phishing,, including advanced phishing resistant MFA methods. Thus, by adopting phishing-resistant MFA, organizations can avoid potential fines from federal agencies and position themselves favorably in the market as trustworthy entities.</p>
 
BlockID’s Role in Strengthening Phishing-Resistant Security 
<p>In the ongoing fight against phishing and cyber threats, robust security like BlockID is crucial. BlockID advances beyond traditional authentication methods of what you know or have, to a more secure paradigm of who you are, thereby enhancing an organization’s phishing-resistant security posture.</p>

				  Remove the need to set up and manage your own mediator so you can focus on helping your customers benefit from verifiable data and identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® provides customers with powerful, scalable communication features that allow them to cryptographically authenticate the parties in any interaction before data is shared.</p>
<p>This secure, bidirectional communication between people and organizations using mobile devices is made possible by a mediator. It’s like a post office for a decentralized ecosystem: every message goes to the mediator, which is then able to find individual end users to create a secure connection and deliver the message. Mediation drives decentralized communication — and in a privacy-preserving way too, as the “Post Office” can’t open the messages, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>With a hosted mediator in Indicio Proven®, customers can choose to let Indicio run the Post Office, which makes deploying a verifiable data solution faster, scaling it easier, and managing it simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that while we say “message,” we are not confined to simple texts or written messages. How you use this secure connection is largely limited by your imagination. Among the use cases Indicio has helped facilitate are offering proof of funds for financial transactions, sharing proof of membership for an organization or rewards program, and sharing proof of age for purchasing goods, without actually sharing birthdate or other personal information.</p>
<p>Historically, Indicio has helped customers set up their own mediator for management by their internal teams. Due to customer feedback, Indicio Proven® now provides this feature as a professionally-managed service. This makes Indicio Proven an even simpler and more powerful way to implement decentralized identity technology, enhancing scalability, ensuring uptime, and freeing users to focus on delivering transformative verifiable data solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Whether your mediator is hosted and managed by your team or Indicio, the messages it delivers are private by design. Each message is encrypted to the end recipient, and is not visible to the mediator.</p>
<p>Who its for</p>
<p>This mediator service is for customers that just want to “set and forget” their decentralized identity solution. Indicio will handle the day-to-day management of any mediation your solution requires and ensure the mediator has the latest updates.</p>
<p>Why use Indicio’s mediator services</p>
<p>Professionally managed: Indicio has years of experience in the decentralized identity field and boasts a 99.97% uptime on our network. You won’t need to worry about the day-to-day specifics of mediation, but should any problems come to your attention you will have a direct line to a team that leads the development of the technology.</p>
<p>Built for scale: The new mediator service has been tested with up to fifty thousand simultaneous connections per customer, and our team can easily scale it to as many connections as you need.</p>
<p>Live message delivery: Often mediators will only allow for a momentary connection to an end user to deliver a message and then sever that connection. Indicio’s mediator service allows for users to stay connected to your service for a set amount of time, resulting in receiving messages faster and a better customer experience.</p>
<p>How to get started</p>
<p>Our team prides itself on setting our customers up for success. We have found a <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">quick consultation with our team</a> to align on goals for your solution to be the most effective way to learn more about Indicio Proven® and how you can best use the Hosted Mediator Service.</p>

				  Rebuilding Trust in the Digital Age: The Emergence of a Trust Layer  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Picture a digital landscape where trust reigns supreme, where every online interaction is as secure as a handshake in the physical world. It’s not just a vision; it’s the focus of our latest report, created in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/">Canadian Internet Registration​ Authority</a> (CIRA). In this blog, we unveil the intriguing concept of the internet’s ’emerging trust layer’ and how it will revolutionize the internet, making it a haven of reliability and security.

				 <p>In today’s interconnected world, trust in the digital landscape is more crucial than ever. A secure and trustworthy online environment becomes paramount as we increasingly intertwine our lives with the internet, from personal interactions to complex financial transactions and healthcare decisions. Recognizing this critical need, Continuum Loop, in collaboration with CIRA, has authored a new report, “<a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/resources/documents/state-of-internet/a-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging-a-2023-report/">A Trust Layer for the Internet is Emerging.</a>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the result of the collaboration between <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/">Darrell O’Donnell</a> of Continuum Loop and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a> from CIRA, emerges as an essential resource for those innovators and early adopters leading the charge in digital innovation and strategy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and solutions in building trust online, tailored to meet the needs of technical and business professionals in internet-centric organizations.</p>
<p>This pioneering document addresses the growing trust crisis in the digital realm, where the proliferation of fakes, frauds, and forgeries has significantly eroded public confidence. Our report highlights the path forward to restore and enhance trust in the internet, ensuring its role as a reliable and safe platform for future generations.</p>
 The Decline of Trust: A Wake-Up Call 
<p>It’s a concerning reality: trust in the internet is at an all-time low. In recent years, Canadians’ trust in the internet has plummeted from 71% to 57%, mirroring a global trend. The increase of fakes, frauds, and forgeries fuels this erosion of trust. This isn’t just a statistic; it has become a call to action. Organizations suffer when trust wanes, with some experiencing dramatic decreases in market capitalization after trust-related incidents.</p>
 Unveiling the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The report introduces an innovative concept: developing a ‘trust layer’ for the internet. This layer is a harmonious blend of technical trust (like encryption and signing) and human trust (like governance). It’s about creating a digital environment where parties can mutually authenticate each other, knowing confidently who they’re dealing with.</p>
 Trust Registries: Anchoring Digital Trust 
<p>A pivotal aspect of this trust layer is the role of trust registries. Trust registries provide authoritative answers within digital ecosystems, bridging the gap between technology and human trust. Furthermore, the concept of Registry of Registries (RoR) is explored to create an interconnected web of trust across various ecosystems.</p>
 From Wallets to Trust: A Paradigm Shift 
<p>Originally intended as an update to the 2019 “The Wallet Report,” the focus of this study shifted to the more critical issue of building trustworthy systems on the internet. It’s a response to the growing awareness that while security is essential, more is needed for establishing trust.</p>
 Navigating the Path to an Enhanced Trust Layer 
<p>The journey to build a trust layer on the internet, as outlined in the report, is challenging but vital. It requires a delicate balance of technical trust and human trust. The report underscores the importance of governance in maintaining trust and the critical role of trust registries in anchoring trust within digital ecosystems.</p>
 A Call to Action 
<p>The report concludes with a powerful message: we can reverse the decline in internet trust. By developing a trust layer, we can once again rely on the internet as a secure and trustworthy platform. It’s a shared responsibility to build and maintain this trust layer, not just for the benefit of digital ecosystems but for society as a whole.</p>
 Rebuilding Trust in Our Digital World 
<p>While the path ahead is challenging, the blueprint for a trustworthy internet is becoming clearer. Through the collaborative efforts of Continuum Loop and CIRA, we have charted a course towards an internet that balances technical trust with human trust, underpinned by the essential role of trust registries. These components are not just parts of a system but the pillars upon which we can construct an inherently reliable and secure digital realm.</p>
 Technical and Human Synergy: The Heart of the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The success of the emerging trust layer will not be measured solely by its technical strength but by the trust it fosters in our digital relationships. Developing and nurturing this trust layer is a collective responsibility with significant promise for revolutionizing digital ecosystems and enriching our society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey to reforge trust in the digital landscape, we do so with a clear understanding of the transformative potential of the trust layer and trust registries. This report is more than an analysis; it is a call to action for creating a future where trust is the cornerstone of our digital interactions. The time to act is now – to shape a functional and fundamentally trustworthy internet.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 The Internet’s Trust Deficit Needs to Be Repaid: Key trust-related decisions in the internet’s evolution were delayed or ignored, leaving the digital realm needing more essential capabilities to establish trust. 
 The Necessity of Trust Registries: Trust registries, including the innovative concept of a Registry of Registries (RoR), are crucial in creating a web of trust across ecosystems and anchoring the trust layer. 
 Ecosystem Diversity: Each digital ecosystem operates uniquely, and trust registries help unify diverse players and governance structures. 
 Leveraging Existing Systems: Existing systems hold the answers needed to establish trust; the challenge lies in accessing and integrating this information. 
 The Value of Trusted Interactions: Trusted interactions are increasingly valuable, and trust registries are pivotal in driving value up and costs down in the digital landscape.

 BE REALISTIC — DEMAND THE INCORRUPTIBLE!  Make the blockchain safe or lose&nbsp;it Vinay Gupta as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raguel_(angel)#:~:text=XXIII%2C%20Raguel%20is%20one%20of,across%20Jewish%20and%20Christian%20traditions.">Raguel</a><p>I have recounted the history and prehistory of crypto <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-road-to-rwa-f99cac31361d">elsewhere</a> — the path from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) through e-gold to Bitcoin. Now I want to take a look at what happened next, what went wrong with the Ethereum vision of the future, and how we can turn things around to make the blockchain the powerhouse of the future that it was always meant to be. I need to talk about magic and rules. I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules.</p><blockquote>I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules</blockquote><p>Let’s start with a short recap; the first great crypto innovation was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"> PGP,</a> which tried to bring true privacy to online communications, then there was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0908/6005172a.html">https </a>that gave us the ecommerce revolution, Amazon and all that. Then, the third innovation came with the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper">Bitcoin white paper</a> that ushered in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was commonly believed to be a response to e-gold being shut down by the American government; if we want to ask “who is Satoshi?”, then the answer is that somewhere within two handshakes of the e-gold organisations is almost certainly where you find the origin of the Satoshi group — I have my theories, other people have theirs. Anyway, Bitcoin trundles along for a while as an interesting geek thing where a few Bitcoin can get you a pizza, if you know the right nerds, but it’s not much use for anything yet; until Wikileaks. When Wikileaks gets seriously effective at embarrassing governments, banks and various other payment routes shut them out so no one can donate funds to them. Suddenly, the only functional method that can get cash to Wikileaks and can’t be shut down is Bitcoin; people take notice, its value skyrockets to the level where one will buy you a very decent car instead of a fraction of a pizza, and people start to get politically interested in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Now though, we need to think about what was really going on with Bitcoin. What people wanted from the blockchain — and what a lot of them got — was magic, and new&nbsp;rules:</p><p>Magic: “internet money machine go brrrrrr” and folks that were futuristic and lucky got very rich. A real vanguard movement.</p><p>Rules: 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC. Uncensorable. Free.</p><p>This idea that new rules can make you rich and the money isn’t really coming from anywhere is, unfortunately, the devil’s bargain. Here’s why: printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less.</p><blockquote>Printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is converting fiat money into Bitcoin, and it’s just increasing the money supply. It’s exactly the same as a central bank printing money. It’s just that bitcoin is printed and handed out to the miners, instead of having a government write enormous bailout cheques to banks under a cover like “quantitative easing”. Bitcoin slowly makes the dollar worth less just as something like quantitative easing (QE) ultimately does. All that QE money invented and dumped onto the market in 2008 to stave off financial collapse eventually fed through to the increase in inflation and so on today — it made the dollar worth less because there was more money circulating. Same happens with Bitcoin. Bitcoin may not be the same as dollars, but it is doing the same thing; ultimately, it is used to buy things so it has the same effect — more money circulating. Now bitcoiners will tell you that’s fine. And, within the scope of human beings exercising their freedom to compute it certainly is. Bitcoin is arguably a free speech issue. I’m good with that, but the money is coming from the dollar getting slightly weaker every time BTC moons. I don’t like this way of making money. I don’t mind people doing it, but let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the internet. It’s crazy that it works, but it’s another central bank printing money at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>Let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the&nbsp;internet</blockquote><p>Something else was&nbsp;needed.</p><p>So, people start asking <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">“Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?</a>”, which would make it more than just crypto-fiat, and that question of “Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?” is, to me, the great religious issue of the day. Because if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts, then there would not be a need for a <a href="https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf">second system.</a> All of the energy behind Bitcoin, all of the energy behind Ethereum, all of the energy behind everything else…It would be the single point of an enormous driven spear. We did not get that, because Bitcoin said “no” to progress, they said “no” to transformation, they said “no” to change. Bitcoin decided that they had evolved as far as they needed to, and that they were going to stay right there. As a result, we have an avant-garde that comes along to do the smart contracts thing, which is Ethereum and all of the things that came after Ethereum, while the old-school Bitcoiners stay with Bitcoin. Whether they turn out to be smart people that stuck to fundamentals, or Neanderthals who evolution ploughed under, is too soon to tell — give it another 20 years, maybe even another&nbsp;50.</p><blockquote>if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts…it would be the single point of an enormous driven&nbsp;spear.</blockquote><p>The great hope from Ethereum is that Ethereum is more than a central bank. Ether is not money per se: Ether is a tokenized right to future transactions on the World Computer. Watch this 2015 video from the Ethereum Foundation to understand the&nbsp;story.</p><p>Does software create wealth? YES! What we do with spreadsheets can be done by accountants on paper but it takes weeks rather than seconds to run a new financial model. A payment instrument does not create wealth, it just moves wealth around. That’s why ETH &gt; BTC for sure. What we’ve seen for the last 8 years, since Ethereum was launched, is a mad scramble to figure out what to do with the World Computer.</p><p>Generation after generation of cultish new ideas have been pitched as revolutions: ICOs, DeFi, NFTs were the largest waves. All of them, failed experiments. Folks will argue that these things have not failed but here’s a way to think about it: was more money put into these things than taken out? The answer is YES in all cases. Every penny made in DeFi was lost by somebody else, minus some friction which pays for creation of the tech. This is not wealth generating, any more than Bitcoin is wealth generating. Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE wealth. The financial system does not create wealth other than by investing in the creation of goods and services that people actually need. And, right now, Ethereum is the financial system on bottom-up decentralised individually-superempowered turbo steroids. So, what happened?</p><blockquote>Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE&nbsp;wealth</blockquote><p>Inside of Ethereum there developed three generations of political vision: these are what I would call the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers. The Nouveau Bitcoiners are the people who think that Ether is going to be the global currency instead of Bitcoin, they think in terms of freedom to transact and are very much about the idea of a direct takeover from the nation state and a direct takeover from the dollar. It’s “Ethereum is just like Bitcoin, but with smart contracts”. Their vision is “The Ether price climbs and climbs and climbs, until every asset is denominated in Ether”. That is the generation-one political vision of Ethereum. Not many people think like that now, but there are a few of&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>Inside of Ethereum there developed… the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers</blockquote><p>The next generation are the Radicalised Canadians, and I would see Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as one of these. The vision here involves things like quadratic voting: you reduce the cost of building new social structures because you can use Ethereum smart contracts to do it. Those social structures control assets and the control of assets using these new social structures enables the transformation of the way society works. This means you can do much cheaper experiments in an evolving society because you use software to run the bureaucracy — you don’t need to build a new government department; you just need the right smart contract and you can do it now. This is expressed particularly well in a book called <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iRqutFx">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. This idea that we can incrementally improve the functioning of the world by putting more and more load on automated bureaucracy rather than attempting political transformation through the ballot box is the “build your way to your own utopia”&nbsp;model.</p><p>I would suggest that the apex of the “build your way to your own utopia” model is all the stuff on network states coming from <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/huUv3pN">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. I went to the network states conference in Amsterdam, and there’s a huge amount of enthusiasm about building what I would call weakly state-like entities (<a href="https://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/">WSLEs,</a> or “Weasels”) on the blockchain, You have a cryptocurrency, you have a community, you buy a bunch of land, and you put all of that stuff together into a bundle, and it creates a sort of miniature state-like thing. Of course, there are major potential pitfalls inherent in all this; e.g. depending on where you have your land, your network state DIY utopia can look a lot like reinventing colonialism for the digital age — a bunch of Americans setting up a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera#:~:text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20a%20private%20city,%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20legal%20architecture."> “utopia” in Honduras</a> raises a lot more questions than, say, a bunch of Hondurans setting one up in the US. But a network state doesn’t necessarily need the land, it can have a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">completely virtual existence</a>, there’s lots of enthusiasm about that, and I would say that is the final embodiment of the Radicalised Canadian vision: kind of libertarian, kind of utopian, but a lot more egalitarian than the hard line, currency-driven Bitcoin generation. The DAO people are a big part of that as well, lots of work on DAOs, lots of work on quadratic funding, Gitcoin… All of that is in this bucket that I would call the Radicalised Canadians.</p><p>Finally we have the third generation, the Scammers. A big problem in the space is that the Radicalised Canadians have been unable to fight off the Scammers. I remember when the Scammers arrived: our conferences went from being a bunch of nerds in various-kinds-of-band T-shirts, standing around in their big black boots and yapping to each other about consensus algorithms, to slick computer graphics and really impressive slide presentations fronted by people that had been trained to speak in the Tony Robbins school of sincerity. And when those folks arrived, what you wound up with was a problem; because when you had people coming to find out what Ethereum was, the slick, sincere-sounding guys were the ones they listened to because they knew how to capture attention. The people who understood what Ethereum was truly about, the Nouveau Bitcoiners and Radical Canaidans, were, generally speaking, poor presenters, and they were pushed aside by the people that understood how to sell scams. Those people didn’t really understand what it was they were selling, and they didn’t have to, they just needed to understand what people were buying. All they had to have was a plausible enough story to separate rubes from their money, and those people went through the space like dysentery through a refugee camp. I would suggest that they have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space over the last, say, 4–5&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Scammers went through Ethereum like dysentery through a refugee&nbsp;camp</blockquote><p>I want to repeat that: I would suggest that scammers have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space… You wonder why the coin is floating around $2,000 rather than $20,000? You wonder why there are only $120bn of stablecoins rather than half the global financial system being on chain? The answer is Ethereum has become synonymous with fraud. If you hear that your cousin has gotten super into crypto, do you think “My god, that’s going to be amazing!” or do you think they’re going to lose their house and their car and you’re going to have to bail them out pretty soon? The fear that we have, that being involved in the blockchain is now a bad thing, that is fear of the grifters. It’s fear that people who don’t really understand the technology are going to be sucked in by slick marketing for a deal that should be illegal, and probably is. That they’re going to get ripped off for everything they own if the Scammers can manage it, and we’ve become so tolerant of this that the culture has terms like “rug pull”. Rug pull means fraud and people should go to jail — rug pull! We have smart contracts that are perfectly capable of making it technically impossible for people to rug-pull, but the general Ethereum user population are so ignorant about what the technology is and how it can protect them that they don’t even insist that the contracts are structured in a way that means they cannot get rug-pulled.</p><blockquote>Ethereum has become synonymous with&nbsp;fraud</blockquote><p>It’s finance minus all RULES and deprived of all MORALITY. In Ethereum right now you are literally seeing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929#:~:text=On%20September%2020%2C%201929%2C%20top,on%20the%20London%20Stock%20Exchange">Wall Street was like in 1929</a>, rug pulls and all. Finance without RULES and MORALITY is net negative. It’s the fast being predatory and eating the life savings of the slow, over and over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>It’s violent.</p><p>“No Force, No Fraud” says the Libertarian Golden Rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Non-Aggression Principle (NAP</a>).</p><p>Does Ethereum live up to that&nbsp;today?</p><p>No. Remember I’m the former Release Coordinator for the 2015 launch. I also wrote the definitive blog post&nbsp;, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>, for the Ethereum launch. I’ve been around. I’ve done cryptographic applications development (against and then for multiple governments) since 1997.&nbsp;. I’m not pleased at how Ethereum is turning&nbsp;out.</p><p>We can do better. We can do a lot&nbsp;better.</p><p>So how did we wind up with epidemic fraud on Ethereum, a technology which was meant to produce an incorruptible global record of who owned what so that we could build a fairer, better global&nbsp;economy?</p><p>It’s your fault: you all got greedy and lazy and believed crappy NFTs had value. They are <a href="https://cheezburger.com/16719877/funny-memes-tweets-that-roast-nfts-crypto">literally laughing at&nbsp;us.</a></p><p>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around NFTs. If there had been a single decent intellectual property licence, commissioned by OpenSea and attached to everything by default then NFTs might not have hard crashed in value as they have. Proper use of law would have protected value which is, after all, the fundamental function of&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around&nbsp;NFTs</blockquote><p>Imagine how different it would have been if they could have said “here’s the OpenSea public licence and the Bored Ape licence, anything which is going to get done on the blockchain with images or art, you have that built in copyright licence by default. If you want a different licence, feel free to upload it, but you will have to have a licence…”</p><p>If they’d done that for intellectual property, then OpenSea would be the world hub for clearing intellectual property rights today, and it would probably still be doing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions a month, and it would have created enormously powerful global liquid markets for IP. You would be able to literally licence a Bored Ape to Disney to do a TV show, rather than the situation right now where nobody can really pin down <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/nfts-and-intellectual-property-what-do-you-actually-own/">what you buy when you buy an NFT</a>. That is the result of a lackadaisical attitude towards the deal; because if you don’t clearly define the terms, then what the hell is somebody&nbsp;buying?</p><p>We went out to build an incorruptible global economy, and what we got was overrun by scammers that subverted that vital global vision and delivered a wasteland of Ponzi schemes and delusional fake assets. The Eloi had a wonderful world full of sunlight and flowers, but the Morlocks still ate them. Ethereum needs a moral upgrade. Maybe instead of moral I should say political. “No force, no fraud” only works if we have a mechanism for punishing those who attempt or commit fraud. Financial products sold by Anonymous Aardvark twitter accounts do not have any meaningful ability to punish fraud. So we get fraud. A lot of really hardcore criminal shit is getting done in the financial markets running on Ethereum.</p><blockquote>Ethereum needs a moral&nbsp;upgrade</blockquote><p>It’s a massive market failure: in a Libertarian society in theory the “Free Market” is meant to self-regulate and create free market justice systems to make trade possible. What we have learned in this near-perfect experiment is that Libertarianism is bullshit.</p><p>Let me say that again: Libertarianism is bullshit, and we’ve proven&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we got on Ethereum was violent, destructive anarchy not a self-regulating borderless global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>It’s bad. To fix this we need to build governance structures on the blockchain which have the ability to impose rules and force good conduct on people. The violent anarchy we have created is so dangerous that ordinary people are getting mugged for everything they&nbsp;own</p><p>Is that acceptable?</p><p>Well, if it is acceptable, we wind up with Ethereum as a <a href="https://screenrant.com/eve-online-largest-pvp-battle-ever/">“Player-Versus-Player (PVP)</a> part of the Great Global Massive Multiplayer Online game (MMO) in which we all participate. All the serious players will only interact with Ethereum when they’re heavily armed, and it’ll be filled with predators feeding on each-other. This is a bad scene; “PVP Ethereum” — the violent, destructive anarchy that we have now — is not fit for running the global economy. It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Well, if you don’t believe me, look at what happened when someone did try to run the world on it. It is indicative of the age of most blockchain people — they are young — that Russia in the ’90s is ancient history to them, they don’t remember it; but we are old, and some of us used to be Russian; we remember. There, then, communism collapsed, and while the state struggled to catch up, a new kind of money, dollars, flooded in, and Russia became the poster boy for the kind of unfettered free market capitalism that gave Ayn Rand libertarians spontaneous orgasms. No state interference, just money and business. What happened? Oligarchs happened; without effective law to enforce contracts, you only paid the people who would kill you if you didn’t, and killed your creditors if the opportunity arose. As a result the most ruthless, the hardest, and those with access to serious muscle and hardware (basically ex-KGB) cleaned up while everyone else got thoroughly rinsed and ended up near destitute. This only ended basically when the biggest, most ruthless bastard of all, Putin, got the upper hand, ran the oligarchs out of town and co-opted their methods for himself, resulting in a gangster capitalist mafia dictatorship, which is not the outcome anyone else wanted. Libertarianism in practice turns out to be essentially property without rights, it boils down to “it’s mine because I’ve got the biggest gun”, and that’s it. For 90s Russia, read Ethereum; for the oligarchs read the Scammers. Fraud is a form of force, at the end of the day. When scammers deceive people they remove that person’s will and replace it with the scammer’s own&nbsp;will.</p><p>So we have a choice to make: does Ethereum have a productive real future, or does it end up as a nasty, destructive “PVP” wasteland in which predators feed on predators and scammers scam scammers driving out all the perfectly ordinary and legitimate users until there’s nobody but criminals left on the chain. This could become a cultural race to the bottom that transfers all of the public good value of the blockchain directly into the private good pockets of the&nbsp;thieves.</p><blockquote>This could become a cultural race to the&nbsp;bottom</blockquote><p>You think I’m joking. I’m not joking. The future of finance, and the future of the internet, cannot be to create a more dangerous, less fair, more predator-dominated version of the world and then tell people that it’s good for them. It’s not good for them. We’re creating a hell and calling it a&nbsp;heaven.</p><p>Now I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell realm and to super-empower predators and thieves. I came into this looking for an international aid transparency technology to help me build my <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world">climate refugee projects</a>.</p><blockquote>I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell&nbsp;realm</blockquote><p>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it now because this Bull Run (if it materialises) looks like it will be the <a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/defi/why-the-rwa-sector-accumulated-5-8-billion-in-3-months/">Real World Assets (RWA) bull run</a>. If people try the same games with RWA that they did with NFTs, if we get runaway fraud, people will start going to jail. The authorities will start prosecuting. If you sell somebody an NFT and tell them it’s “blue chip” and will hold its value you’re probably not committing fraud, it’s what the art world does all the time after all. But when it’s real estate? Cops understand it. If we get any significant amount of actual fraud in the RWA industry, people who have been sold bogus tokens will go and talk to the police. “I was sold this car online and they defrauded me” is a message a cop can understand. It’s not about magic internet $. And it’s not financial regulators looking at mis-sold financial instruments. It’s not the SEC pointing the finger and trying to grab turf from CFTC etc. No, it’s the fucking FBI investigating wire fraud. It’s local police forces dealing with straight up thefts. It’s simple criminal enforcement in many or most cases. Primitive, primal law. “You took my money. You sold me garbage.” We have examples of that dispute going back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir">4000 years</a>. Believe me, the police know how to act on it by&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it&nbsp;now</blockquote><p>Real World Asset scams are going to face criminal prosecution very&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Wow, that’s going to hurt the rest of us. Are we going to have Ethereum be a “PVP” corner of the internet in which scam artists con the general public, and the authorities keep throwing people in jail for blockchain scams? Is THAT the future that we’ve co-created together?</p><p>We have to get our shit together to avoid&nbsp;it</p><p>I want to propose an idea: I think we really screwed up horribly when we decided that decentralisation is what the blockchain was&nbsp;about.</p><p>I think that was a fundamental error of judgement, and I think it is not too late to fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we wanted was systems that were incorruptible, and we thought decentralised meant incorruptible.</p><p>We were wrong: incorruptible trade is the goal, and decentralisation is just one&nbsp;tool.</p><p>We believed and still believe that if you gave the power to the people, then the power would be used wisely. But in fact, what we have discovered is that if you give the power to the people, then the small number of people who are really good at being predators take advantage of the goodwill or ignorance of the rest to cut in and take the power: the scammers, the grifters, they take the power… We worked hard to give the power to the people, and then the scammers and the grifters took it right back off them&nbsp;again.</p><p>It all goes back to the idea of utopias — the internet has always been a utopian idea, a cool, free space, away from regulation and government where people can be excellent to each other and make a new world of equality and self-fulfilment for nerds. Every ten years, another generation tries to create the latest iteration of that, then get burned. Unfortunately something that works purely on mutual trust falls foul of (at least) two fundamental problems. Firstly, assumptions; if the two people in a deal come to it with different unspoken assumptions, grief results. Secondly, the Scammers, if one of the people in the deal isn’t playing fair, more grief results. There needs to be some basic capability that allows for formal agreements that makes the terms of a deal absolutely clear, and will punish scams. Smart contracts only provide one part of what is necessary to make this work in reality: FTX was not a technology problem. Failure to provide scam proofing is what has caused trust to collapse and allowed scams to proliferate, allowed the system to be corrupted. The lack of effective law is what screwed Russia in the 90s, and it will screw Ethereum now. Violent anarchy serves nobody. The locusts move on eventually.</p><blockquote>Every ten years, another generation tries to create utopia, then get&nbsp;burned</blockquote><p>I think that we need to start thinking in terms of the blockchain being about creating incorruptible systems: you get exactly what you pay for, nobody gets in the way, and if they do, the crypto economics or the legals squash them like bugs. That was the original vision of Ethereum, that was what we promised to ourselves that we were going to create back in 2015. If you look at the early Ethereum Foundation communications, incorruptibility is the core theme. That video I embedded earlier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXv">Ethereum: the World Computer</a>, really expresses this notion of an incorruptible system. An Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like bugs, that is the future, one where you know that if it happened on Ethereum it’s a square and you will get&nbsp;paid.</p><blockquote>We need an Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>That is what I’m working towards creating with my company <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>. We have spent years and a ton of money creating a way to build legals into smart contracts in a way that is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions. The Mattereum system makes it possible to buy something on the blockchain and prove you own it in a court of law almost anywhere in the world. It removes misunderstandings and, yes, squashes scammers like bugs. We are mainly using it to ensure someone buying a real world asset like gold or real estate on the blockchain has an enforceable claim to the physical asset in the real world, but it can be used for IP licences for NFTs, almost anything sold on the blockchain. It’s a way of baking incorruptibility into the system to ensure every transaction is&nbsp;safe.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum system removes misunderstandings and squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>So, Mattereum is doing magic with real estate, gold bars, and so on. The NFTs that people buy linked to their RWAs come with legal machinery that behaves properly, so they get what they paid for or get appropriate compensation. Magic. But that magic comes from rules. The Mattereum Asset Passport is a legally binding documentation stack which parcels out the risk associated with an RWA purchase and places the load on knowledgeable, solvent, deal-protecting underwriters. The magic is the rules. And we did not do this alone. The English judiciary (the judges) are very fond of the blockchain as a mechanism for storing legal evidence which can be used in court cases. They see the blockchain as an <a href="http://judiciary.uk/wp-content/upl%E2%80%A6">economic opportunity</a> for the British economy in&nbsp;fact.</p><blockquote>Many people do not realise that English law governs trading in €600 trillion of OTC derivatives annually, in €11.6 trillion in metals trading, in £250 billion in M&amp;A deals, and in £80 billion in insurance contracts every year — just to take a few examples. My hope is that English law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology as its take up grows exponentially in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><blockquote>– Sir Geoffry Vos, Master of the&nbsp;Rolls</blockquote><p>Now, you say, “but Vinay, centralisation is the devil”. Well, turns out decentralisation is the devil&nbsp;too.</p><p>If everybody is responsible, then nobody is. Value is bleeding through decentralised systems like coffee through a paper filter. It’s the <a href="https://w.wiki/LdS">Tragedy of the Commons</a> basically.</p><p>Think about that. We could have Ethereum be the world’s most trusted trade environment instead of the destructive shitshow that we have these days. I want this thing to work. The world needs this thing to&nbsp;work.</p><p>We have a limited number of chances to make this thing work because — eventually — the world will simply give up on Ethereum as a fraud-ridden wasteland. That perception is already becoming a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Every fraud on Ethereum profits the scammers and harms/damages the rest of the ecosystem. It’s the scammers or us: and that’s the real zero sum game&nbsp;here.</p><p>We have an absolute imperative to get the scammers out of the Ethereum ecosystem, we have to do this or the ecosystem is eventually going to&nbsp;die.</p><p>To do this the focus has to be on incorruptibility, not decentralisation because incorruptible systems can be used to identify the scammers and kick them off. “Is this thing that you’re doing incorruptible or not?” — “Well, no. It’s really decentralised, but…” — “We don’t care: bam, get off the blockchain, we’re not going to do this!”. It’s that simple — raise the bar. Demand incorruptibility.</p><p>If you’re going to put any money behind any project, then demand incorruptibility; if you’re working on a project, then demand incorruptibility. Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to rug, use smart contracts to lock up all of the value, nail them to the legals — there are excellent law firms that are fully functional now to actually get you what you need for that quickly and at a reasonable price. We can make the blockchain live up to its potential, but if we fail to do it, then it’s going to wind up as another dead&nbsp;end.</p><blockquote>Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to&nbsp;rug</blockquote><p>I’ve seen two waves of crypto innovation wind up in dead ends. The only thing that survived from crypto in the 1990s, even though we had fully functional digital currencies, was e-commerce, and e-commerce did not fundamentally make the world a better place — it made it more convenient, but it did not improve it. The first big wave of crypto innovation is all of the stuff that happened with secure communications — PGP and all that, secure email. Does anybody feel like their communications are genuinely secure? Nope. You don’t trust the software you’re using, you don’t trust the hardware. Most of that innovation was also lost. So if we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick, if we are going to make the blockchain work, if we’re going to get power of “These are my keys, nobody else can pretend to be me and nobody else can read my comms…” then we have to change our values. We have to go back to the original vision of Ethereum, we have to focus on the incorruptibility more than the decentralisation, and we have to absolutely stop tolerating the scams. If you see somebody on stage pitching something that you think is a scam, then you call it out, you do what you can to stop it. We need to be Judge Dredd bringing law to the Cursed&nbsp;Earth.</p><blockquote>If we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick… then we have to change our&nbsp;values</blockquote><p>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain because while scams are allowed to thrive unopposed they metastasise and consume all the available space. One reason people largely gave up on email is that for every email from family, there were 10 from Nigerian princes, alleged friends needing you to urgently send money (and possibly lawyers and guns) to get them out of a jam, cute strangers wanting to be your girlfriend, and so on. The same with “The Artist Formerly Known as Twitter”, people are leaving in droves because of Nazis, dropshippers and people shilling blockchain scams. No one is going to find it worthwhile to stay in a space where 90% of the activity is scammers eating people alive, even if it does have the potential to revolutionise the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain</blockquote><p>We should be revolutionising the world, we should be operating the world’s most honest trade environment — that’s the ETH brand promise. If we can deliver on the Brand Promise of Ethereum: “incorruptible transactions” we have friends all over the world. Everybody that wants to do honest business, to buy and sell in a transparent, honest and fair way, is our friend. You can’t get incorruptible trade with VISA cards and bank wires, so Mattereum is out here building the bridges necessary for incorruptible trade and our objectives are:</p><p>* Save&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>* Use Ethereum to save the&nbsp;world</p><p>An incorruptible system is a safe system, and the fundamental thing people need is to be safe, on the blockchain, just as much as anywhere&nbsp;else.</p><p>We’re going to need your support to make this happen. I’m hoping to rapidly scale our operations fast in 2024 and bring near-incorruptible systems for real world asset transactions to all of&nbsp;you.</p> Be realistic!

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, when the path forward may seem uncertain, well-structured legal frameworks provide a basic roadmap. These frameworks not only provide clarity on the permissible boundaries of AI development and application, but also serve as foresight tools that anticipate potential challenges and pitfalls. As I argued in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/balancing-innovation-and-regulation">blog</a>, law generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters human agency.</p>
<p>Consequently, nations around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to and capitalize on these evolving technologies. Unfortunately, while the impact of AI is global, many countries have yet to publish comprehensive AI regulations and policies. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, embracing standardized regulations could foster global collaboration, addressing ethical concerns and privacy issues. On the other hand, the absence of clear guidelines may hinder the progress of global AI initiatives, potentially leading to misuse, fragmented approaches, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Therefore, by exploring and comparing recently published AI regulations, individuals and organizations can proactively navigate the evolving landscape. This approach allows them to stay ahead of the curve, respond resiliently to change, and integrate practices and solutions that may not have been adopted in their home countries.</p>
 Implications of the EU’s AI Act 
<p>On December 8, 2023, after more than 36 hours of negotiations, a political agreement was reached on the EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. The AI Act adopts a "risk-based approach" that prioritizes the regulation of the use of AI over the technology itself, with the aim of protecting European values and the rule of law. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">legislation</a> sets clear obligations based on the potential risks and impact of AI systems.</p>
<p>Key provisions include:</p>
 
 Prohibition of biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (for example, political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race) 
 Restriction on untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases 
 Ban on emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions 
 Prohibition of social scoring based on personal characteristics 
 Prohibition of AI exploiting vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status 
 Use of biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes 
 Citizens' right to launch complaints and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems 
 Transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems, including technical documentation and compliance with EU copyright law 
 
<p>The AI Act focuses on risk assessments for AI systems, with obligations increasing based on the potential risk to individual rights or health. The agreement introduces transparency requirements for all general-purpose AI models and imposes tougher regulations on more powerful models. In essence, the EU AI Act strategically adapts its regulatory intensity based on the perceived risk levels associated with different AI systems.</p>
<p>By doing so, the legislation seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and mitigating potential harms arising from advanced AI technologies. This nuanced approach reflects the EU's commitment to responsible AI governance and aligns with its broader initiatives to establish a trustworthy and ethical AI landscape.</p>
<p>The AI Act won't take effect until two years after final approval by European lawmakers, expected sometime in early 2024. Moreover, the AI Act will apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</p>
<p>The law's global influence is expected to extend as a blueprint for other nations navigating AI regulations. However, by not fully banning live facial recognition, the EU's decision has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/eu-blocs-decision-to-not-ban-public-mass-surveillance-in-ai-act-sets-a-devastating-global-precedent/">criticism</a>, with Amnesty International deeming it a "hugely missed opportunity" and expressing concerns about potential global repercussions, particularly in the realm of human rights and civil liberties.</p>
 Decoding the American AI Regulatory Landscape 
<p>The U.S. AI regulatory landscape is characterized by a mix of existing federal and state laws, frameworks from various federal agencies, and a growing number of state-specific laws. It is also characterized by a decentralized approach, in contrast to the EU's top-down approach.</p>
<p>The legislative approach to AI is centered on an "incentive-based" strategy, with policymakers seeking to create conditions that will retain AI developers. The emphasis on incentives reflects a concerted effort to prevent the potential shift of AI development to competing nations, highlighting the delicate balance between promoting innovation and avoiding national security issues.</p>
<p>Despite the polarized and challenging political environment in the U.S. in recent years, both parties in Congress have consistently supported AI governance efforts. This bipartisan commitment reflects a shared recognition of the transformative potential and strategic importance of AI.</p>
<p>While the EU's AI law is in its final stages, the U.S. is unlikely to pass a comprehensive national AI law in the near future. Instead, a flurry of executive actions is expected. The outcome may not be a broad national AI law, but rather a nuanced, domain-specific regulatory landscape that navigates the complexities of AI governance.</p>
<p>For example, in October 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">order</a> on AI. The order mandates prominent AI developers to disclose safety test results and pertinent information to the government. Furthermore, government agencies will establish standards to guarantee the safety of AI tools before their public release, accompanied by guidelines for labeling AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Biden's directive extends the momentum generated by voluntary commitments from major tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which had pledged to ensure the safety of their products before launch. In addition, the U.S. government is expected to increase spending on AI and AI research, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we foresee that while private companies may implement their "responsible AI" initiatives, potential AI trade frictions with the EU may arise. Moreover, concerns linger about enforceability and binding measures, with critics highlighting potential disparities with the more stringent measures adopted by the EU in the recently adopted AI Act.</p>
 Balancing Acts: Concluding Thoughts 
<p>The dominance of major AI players in the US raises concerns about the delayed availability of powerful AI models in the EU, potentially impacting technological and economic development in the region. This dichotomy also underscores the global competition in AI, with China and Russia potentially adopting different, and less democratic-oriented, approaches. The question arises: can safety be adequately ensured through legal frameworks alone, especially when considering the divergent strategies employed by major players in the AI arena?</p>
<p>Exploring this critical angle prompts a deeper reflection on the effectiveness of legal frameworks in balancing safety concerns with the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI technologies, especially in the context of varying global approaches. The global AI debate involves geopolitical competition, national security, and economic competitiveness. Therefore, the answer to ensuring safety in AI may involve a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal regulations, incorporating international collaboration, ethical standards, and shared best practices</p>
<p>Despite differing approaches to AI regulation, both the US and EU share the common goal of ensuring safe and democratic AI, fostering the potential for aligned transatlantic regulatory approaches. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council demonstrates early success in collaborating on trustworthy AI metrics and methodologies, emphasizing the need for further alignment and knowledge sharing. It is therefore essential that the EU and the U.S. align their approaches in key areas, given their combined influence on global AI governance.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>On November 8th, the European Council and Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the new framework for a European digital identity (eID).</p>
<p>Over a decade in the making, we Europeans are now finally taking a fundamental step so that all EU citizens can have a unique and secure digital identity. This is a key advancement for the European Union to be a global leader in the digital identity field, enabling all 27 member states to reap the benefits of digitalisation.</p>
<p>The new European digital identity wallets will enable all Europeans to access online services throughout Europe with their own national digital ID, without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles help to assure that only information that needs to be shared will be shared. Security and privacy are paramount to any electronic identity ecosystem, and I have previously highlighted some of the concerns and trade-offs in the first of this EUDI blog series; <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity">Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity</a>.</p>
 Understanding the EUDI Wallet Pilots 
<p>Running in parallel with the legislative track are the actual pilots of the EUDI wallets and end-user services. This is a great advantage from many perspectives, not least striving to avoid the fate of eIDAS v1, which suffered from the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem from the start. It is surprising how the pilots have flown under the radar despite there being over 250 private corporations and public authorities participating in the four largest pilots alone, supported with €46 million investment from the EU Commission, as discussed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3556">Provisional Political Agreement EU Commission article</a>.</p>
 EUDI Pilot Categories 
<p>The pilots can be broadly divided into three categories: User Authentication, e-Signing, and Website Authentication or Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs). As the last category is outside European control and looking increasingly unimplementable, I will focus initially on the User Authentication and E-Signing.</p>
<p>Beside the QWACs, a wide range of use cases are part of the EUDI pilot projects. These include:</p>
 
 Using the wallets to host user credentials for accessing government services 
 Activating SIM cards for mobile network services – in those countries which forbid anonymous SIM cards 
 Signing B2C and G2C contracts 
 Facilitating travel via digital driving licences and identity documents 
 Presenting educational credentials previously standardised under the Bologna agreement 
 
<p>All together, these use cases highlight the broad applicability of the EUDI. Basic user authentication is but a small part of its capabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged that a digital identity can be used for much more than authentication to existing services. It frequently plays a part in the EUDI’s wide capabilities, as convenience features even at the highest level. For example, in the <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/state-union-2020_en">2020 State of the Union address</a>, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted how users will be able to use the EUDI wallets to file tax returns, check into hotels, rent cars, and securely open bank accounts across borders. Looking further, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/efip/Digital_identity_update.pdf">European Central Bank policy brief on the European Digital Identity Framework</a> suggests that the EUDI wallet will include support for the Digital Euro.</p>
 The Four Major EUDI Pilots 
<p>There are several multi-year pilot projects running, of which the four largest are introduced below. In the first phase, which is currently ongoing, the pilots are centred on individual identities and the most common B2C use cases. After the launch of the EUDI for private persons, it’s expected that it will (at last) be the turn of organisational identity.</p>
 <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC</a> – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The EWC pilot is coordinated by Sweden with the involvement of 18 Member States and Ukraine. It is a major undertaking that involves 15 public entities and 40 private organisations. The pilot is centred around travel and tests the storage and display of digital travel credentials and instant payments. First becoming an alternative to, and later replacing, European passports is not a realistic goal at present. But since a national identity card is a valid travel document within the EU, accepting EUDI as a travel document within the Schengen zone (the 27 European countries that have removed the need for passports and many other types of border control at their mutual borders) would be a much more realistic development.</p>
<p>The Digital Euro will be a central component of the EUDI instant payment system, scheduled to launch in 2027+. The Digital Euro seeks to bring instant electronic payments to the masses. However, it will not be as big of a change in the Nordics as in other countries, due to electronic payments already being the default. The Euro represents not value but debt; most of the European money supply exists purely in the digital domain already.</p>
 <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL</a> – Pilots for European Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The POTENTIAL Pilot is coordinated by Germany and France with the involvement of 17 Member States and Ukraine. It is the largest of the pilots and involves over 50 public entities and over 80 private organisations. The pilot will use the EUDI wallet for several use cases around user authentication including; accessing government services, opening a bank account, e-prescriptions and Digital Driving Licences.</p>
<p>The Digital Driving License is a good example of how having a widely available, strong digital identity opens up a whole range of possibilities for enriching the identity with additional attributes. In this case, using the Digital Driving License to operate motor vehicles within the EU. Every country already has a database of valid licenses granted by the national authorities, so enabling the end user to present this data alongside their digital identity replicates the function of a dedicated physical driver’s license card. This makes tasks like car rental a faster and less error-prone process. It also allows end users to prove both their identity and their vehicle operation licenses online, without the need to send photos of their documents alongside selfies holding those documents to the third party – a goldmine for any identity thief.</p>
 <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID</a> – Nordic-Baltic eID Wallet Consortium 
<p>Interestingly the NOBID Pilot is led by Norway, a non-EU country, with eight member states also involved. Overall, it involves 5 public entities and over 15 private organisations.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on a single use case: the use of the EUDI wallet for the authorisation of payments for products and services by the end user. Unlike the EWC, it will concentrate on addressing the issuance of wallets, the provision of payment means by financial institutions, and the secure and convenient acceptance of payment in a retail (B2C) context.</p>
 <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a> – Digital Credentials for Europe Consortium 
<p>The DC4EU Pilot is led by Spain and involves nearly all other member states, as the pilot trials the use of the EUDI wallet in the educational sector and the social security domain. The pilot project aligns with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/ESSPASS">European Social Security Pass</a> and <a href="https://europa.eu/europass/en/node/2128">the European Learning Model</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/consortium/">tens of universities</a> from around Europe together with government officials and research associations, the pilot is clearly focused on the higher education sector. Technically it is very different from the other pilots, as it trials the use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</a> (EBSI) in the context of the EUDI wallet. Educational records could be especially suitable for a distributed database model, because educational degrees are revoked only under extraordinary circumstances and the range of educational institutions is very broad – from small private institutions to massive state-run universities and polytechnics. The project is scheduled to run until April 2025, and they also maintain a handy list of <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/outputs/">related acronyms</a> on the project site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EUDI pilots are well underway and will continue to late 2024 with some even heading into 2025. It is clear then that the original 2024 launch date for the EUDI is not tenable, at least when talking about a mass launch. But I do hope that by this time next year, there will be a limited release available in order to truly start exploring the capabilities and practical features of the EUDI ecosystem. The potential scale of the EUDI is immense but is certainly doable – as the credit card industry has proven, for example.</p>
<p>In addition, I cannot wait to see <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/organisation-identity/" title="organisation identity">organisation identity</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="identity context ">identity context </a>and right to represent included in the EUDI Pilots as soon as possible, but perhaps this is one of the occasions where even in the modern world it’s worthwhile to measure twice and cut once.</p>

 We sit down with our Brazilian-born, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Francisco Martins to discuss what’s next for the Brazilian gambling market, and how gambling platforms can prepare for the new era of gambling regulation. 



 



 In December 2023, the Brazilian Senate finally passed its gambling regulations for sports betting and online casinos. What took so long?&nbsp; 



<p>Until this week, there had been no enforceable or documented Brazilian gambling regulations due to a blanket ban on gambling in the country since the 1940s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the ban, however, gambling was a prevalent pastime, and casinos were big businesses that pulled in celebrities worldwide. The ban, introduced in 1946, came from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra; a man heavily influenced by his wife, who was a devout Catholic, and thought poorly of games of chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continued pressure from the general populace saw some restrictions lifted in intervening years, such as:&nbsp;</p>



  Legalization of a non-commercial bingo in 1971.<br>  Legalization of horse racing and the betting associated with it in 1984.<br>  Creation of a state-owned lottery system in 1996.&nbsp;  



<p>Poker was exempt from the 1946 ban as it was deemed a game of skill. Alongside the above, social betting and fantasy betting are legal under Brazilian gambling laws; however, they are entirely unregulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ban was met with strong resistance, and underground gambling soon became a thing. The game of choice to this day is Jogo do Bicho, a simple lottery-style game that began in 1892. Jogo do Bicho began as a fun game played outside a zoo but is now an unofficial yet popular numbers game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Brazilian gambling restrictions only ever applied to gambling operators headquartered in Brazil, the domestic ban essentially provided a window of opportunity operators headquartered abroad to target Brazilian customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing this new regulatory framework has therefore been fraught with difficulties for new and existing operators across the globe. To help meet some of these challenges, a nonprofit organization called ABRADIE was created to ensure the Brazilian gambling and iGaming landscape remained safe and free from corruption.</p>



 What would you say was the main catalyst for change? 



<p>I think there were two main reasons for change: public opinion, and the realization that the Brazilian economy was missing out on major tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the first, as online gambling and iGaming grew in popularity, so too did public sentiment toward regulation revision. People began to regard the regulations as archaic, and openly challenged that online gambling should be exempt. In a way, it was, as online gambling and iGaming have been allowed in Brazil, provided the operators were headquartered outside the country. In 2018, the winds of change began to blow in Brazil’s way, and a plan was proposed to introduce new gaming legislation in Brazil. The proposed project allowed basic fixed odds sports betting, but with the caveat that actual legislation was a work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The income generated from online gambling in Brazil is predicted to be more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">$1.5 billion in 2023</a> – an increase of over 200% from 2022. Understandably, that’s a lot of tax revenue that the Brazilian authorities are missing out on. Predictions now point toward a sustained period of rapid growth. The Brazilian economy is struggling (having dropped from the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest to 13th in just over a decade</a>), and the revenue boost from opening the country up to the iGaming sector is too good to not take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that besides the economic boost, the regulation will also have a positive effect on:&nbsp;</p>



  Safer gambling: Invariably, when regulations are deemed necessary, it is an indication of inherent risk in the industry, for example fraud and other criminal activities. Enforcing strict and well-documented regulations will make the Brazilian gaming space safer and more secure.  



  Attract investors: Establishing online gambling and sports betting regulations opens the Brazil market to new and diverse investors. Setting a framework for gambling regulations ensures a competitive and fair landscape, for new and old entrants, while preventing companies from running unethical practices and promotions to build their iGaming brands.  



 What are your thoughts on the new regulations? Do you think they are clear enough? 



<p>The regulations for sports betting and online casinos are a significant step toward Brazil’s modern online gambling landscape. Casinos will also remain illegal for the time being, but further changes are expected in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the ban on bonus bets is an interesting decision. Sign-up bonuses are often used by operators to entice customers to register for their platform, however they are also exploited by criminals. [Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse in our blog here</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new rules also prohibit companies without a license from advertising. The content of advertisements must follow new guidelines, and any company found to be in breach of guidelines will have it removed from the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do think is smart are the new payment rules that have been designed to try and dismantle Brazil’s huge illegal gambling market. Only operators authorized by the Central Bank can offer payment services, and players are only able to send money to a bank account that is headquartered in Brazil.</p>



 So, what’s new? How can operators comply with the new Brazilian gambling regulations? 



<p>The first requirement is for an operator to be based in Brazil. Foreign operators will be barred from offering regulated gambling. This will ensure the Brazilian government is able to collect the taxable revenue (operators will be liable to pay 12% revenue tax.) Operators are also mandated to meet a range of integrity, responsibility and honesty requirements as proposed by the ABRADIE and IBJR and are therefore required to be a member of a sports integrity body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other requirements operators will be forced to comply with include having a minimum value of share capital and being able to pass several technical requirements.</p>



<p>Players will also be pleased to learn that there will be 15% tax on the amount that bettors win, which is a major reduction on the 30% tax that Brazilian Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad originally said he wanted.</p>



<p>Operators that wish to comply with the new sports betting regulations can do so by getting a Brazilian gambling license, which will set them back BR$30 million (US$6.1 million) for five years of validity. Learn more about the complexities of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/#:~:text=The%20only%20forms%20of%20permitted,to%20be%20active%20in%20Brazil.">Brazilian gambling license structure in our blog, here</a>.</p>



 What challenges do you foresee regarding the opening of the Brazilian market? 



<p>Introducing sports betting regulations in Brazil will not be without its challenges and risks. As the illegal and unregulated gambling industry is already thoroughly established, one of the primary issues that must be confronted is underground gambling and removing the risk of fraud or match-fixing. Brazilian sports have seen their share of scandals and controversies that would make anybody nervous about entering this newly opened market without a rigid and protective framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of iGaming is driven by the financial aspect. The challenge will be to balance the economic benefits of online betting legislation with the social responsibility to keep everybody safe. Safety relates to being safe from fraud and other financial crime, but also to ensure they engage in responsible gambling. </p>



 How does Brazil’s gambling regulations compare to other markets? 



<p>The best way to understand how to thrive in a new market is to study the landscape of existing markets. The<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/"> UK Gambling Commission</a> has created an established model that makes an excellent study for the Brazilian authorities. Malta is another location that has created a great regulatory model to tackle the challenges of being a smaller location with a heavy reliance on international business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country in LATAM is adopting and updating its regulations at a different place. Argentina, Bolivia, and Nicaragua are three countries with various existing regulations and are actively working to expand them. Mexico is another that has the framework in place for rapid iGaming growth and would present good case studies, offering realistic region-proof market entry strategies that can be easily customized for the Brazilian landscape.</p>



 What role will technology play in the&nbsp;new era of online gambling in Brazil? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology. This enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> and process international and local documents and data, such as the Cadastro de Pessoa Física (Brazilian tax number).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Brazil, gaming operators in Brazil must now adopt identification procedures&nbsp;that verify players’&nbsp;identity. As such, the use of facial recognition technology in identifying the identities of bettors and the amount of  taxation to be paid will become standard practice. Operators must also be able to verify and validate the authenticity of ID, by comparing with available data from public and private databases. </p>



<p>Navigating the online world and covering the range of potential issues is mission-critical for anybody looking to create a new set of iGaming regulations. An online business is present in many countries and, therefore, must be aware of and compliant with the relevant regulations and legislations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a solid system that can accommodate the different requirements of different regulatory bodies is essential. Anti-money-laundering compliant identity verification and fraud prevention are hot topics and even more prevalent when entering a new market that has been active but unregulated for several years.<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/)"> IDnow has the tools</a> that help make the transition into the Brazilian iGaming space as seamless as possible.</p>



 What’s next for Brazil’s gambling regime? 



<p>Revenue is already up by 200% from 2022 and is expected to double again by 2027. As the industry expands and technology advances, regulations must adapt to remain ahead of the curve, where possible, to maintain player and operator safety. As these laws change and people’s views toward online gambling evolve, so will the different definitions of what is covered. Many Brazilians would love to see casinos return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing a Brazilian gambling regulation process, the initial upturn for the economy will be immediate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road ahead of the iGaming culture in Brazil is not without its challenges. Initiating change takes time and knowledge.&nbsp;The online gaming sphere is fraught with complexities, such as ensuring that a solid multi-jurisdictional identity verification platform is in place to protect anything entering the space. Solid identity-proofing systems are imperative for anybody looking to enter the emerging LATAM market, as each new jurisdiction will bring its own requirements. Having a dependable system programmed to deal with a region’s requirements means setting a solid foundation for safe and stable growth in that market.</p>

 Owning Your Digital Identity in the Age of Self-Sovereignty 



<p>Imagine a world where your digital self isn’t imprisoned within the walled gardens of tech giants and government databases. No more surrendering your data for a flicker of online convenience. Instead, picture a universe where you hold the keys to your identity, selectively unlocking doors with verifiable credentials, navigating the digital landscape with unparalleled privacy and security. This isn’t a utopian dream; it’s the dawn of decentralized digital identity (DDID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI), revolutions quietly reshaping the digital landscape.</p>



<p>DDID and SSI stand in stark contrast to the traditional identity model controlled by centralized authorities. In this outdated paradigm, our digital footprints are scattered across the web, vulnerable to breaches and subject to the whims of corporations and governments. DDID and SSI empower individuals to reclaim ownership of their identity data, building a fortress of privacy brick by blockchain brick.</p>



 Breaking Free from the Siloed Self: 



<p>At the heart of this revolution lies the concept of verifiable credentials: tamper-proof digital badges issued by trusted entities (think universities, banks, or healthcare providers) and stored securely on your own device or decentralized networks. No more handing over your entire identity to access a service; with SSI, you simply present the relevant credential, demonstrating your eligibility without revealing anything else.</p>



<p>Imagine applying for a loan without your entire financial history laid bare, or renting an apartment without relinquishing your social media life. SSI grants you granular control, empowering you to choose what you share and with whom.</p>



 The Global Band of Identity Solutions: 



<p>The DDID (Decentralized Digital Identity) and SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) symphony is playing on a global stage, with diverse protocols harmonizing their efforts:</p>



 
 Canada:&nbsp;SecureKey Technologies leads the charge, forging an SSI network powered by blockchain, where governments, corporations, and individuals collaborate to build a privacy-centric future. 



 USA:&nbsp;The Sovrin Foundation champions SSI adoption, while NIST sets the beat of digital identity management through standardized guidelines. 



 Europe:&nbsp;The SSI eIDAS Bridge project acts as a conductor, bridging the gap between traditional eIDAS infrastructure and the dynamic world of decentralized identities. 



 Latin America:&nbsp;Extrimian, powered by the nimble notes of zkSync, partners with QuarkID, a versatile instrument enabling users to manage their credentials on a secure, multi-chain platform. 



 Asia:&nbsp;Japan takes center stage with the “My Number Card” project, showcasing the power of SSI at the national level. 



 Australia and New Zealand:&nbsp;The DTA pilots SSI for government services, testing the melody in real-world scenarios. 
 



 Challenges of the Decentralized Identity System: 



<p>While the tech behind DDID and SSI is captivating, challenges remain. Standardizing the language of identity across different protocols is crucial to ensure harmony. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful orchestration. And encouraging individuals to embrace this new paradigm demands education and trust-building.</p>



<p>Yet, the potential melody outweighs the dissonance. As awareness grows and technical advancements diminish the volume of challenges, DDID and SSI are poised to rewrite the identity score.</p>



 Extrimian and QuarkID: A Latin American Protocol 



<p>In Latin America, Extrimian and <a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>showcase the power of collaboration. <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian </a>leverages <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a>‘s zero-knowledge proofs, playing a quiet yet powerful note in privacy preservation. QuarkID, a dynamic multi-chain protocol, offers a versatile platform for managing credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their digital selves.</p>



<p>Their partnership, like a captivating duet, brings the promise of SSI closer to reality in Argentina, demonstrating the global reach and transformative potential of this identity revolution.</p>



 The future of Self-Sovereignty: 



<p>The future of identity is decentralized, with individuals conducting the symphony of their digital lives. DDID and SSI offer a transformative score, where privacy and security harmonize with control and convenience. As Extrimian and QuarkID exemplify, innovative collaborations are fueling this revolution, ensuring that every individual can claim their rightful place as the protagonist of their digital narrative.</p>



<p>So, put down the baton of centralized control and pick up the instrument of self-sovereignty. The future of identity is yours to compose, one verifiable credential at a time.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. signals the start of the holiday shopping season, stretching all the way to Christmas. During this time, businesses offer various deals and incentives, triggering a surge in orders, deliveries, and returns of goods. Unfortunately, this season is also a prime opportunity for attackers seeking to capitalize on unsuspecting individuals, employing identity-based cyberattacks such as phishing to compromise users’ credentials and take control of their accounts.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231115#:~:text=The%20FBI%20warns%20of%20criminals,in%20losses%20over%20%2473%20million.">FBI reported almost 12,000 victims reporting non-payment/non-delivery scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in losses over $73 million</a>. This number doesn’t account for organizations that have experienced breaches due to employees falling victim to phishing while using corporate devices for online shopping. Additionally, it doesn’t acknowledge the number of victims who never report these incidents. While education on phishing scams and how to stay safe is a necessary step in helping protect users against account takeover (ATO) and other identity-based attacks, it is not a foolproof way to secure your users and their data.</p>
<p>Most organizations have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is usually based on SMS/email one-time passcode (OTP) or mobile soft tokens to improve security for their users and customers. At the same time, attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using tools such as phishing-as-a-service and generative AI. These technologies enable the creation of phishing emails and campaigns that look alarmingly authentic, often evading the most well-trained and vigilant security-aware individuals. In addition, MFA bypass attacks like SIM swap and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing render traditional MFA options vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations need to implement phishing-resistant and MFA bypass-resistant multi-factor authentication to protect their users and customers.</p>
<p>Types of Holiday Scams</p>
<p>Most holiday phishing attacks exploit users’ distractions amid holiday festivities and shopping. This leads to financial losses and identity theft, causing long-term repercussions such as damage to credit scores, mortgages, and more.</p>
 
 Fake promotions – These are emails or advertisements that offer attractive discounts, leading victims to phishing sites that replicate genuine retail websites. Users unknowingly make purchases using their credit cards, only to never receive the items they paid for. 
 Delivery notifications – As online holiday shopping increases, cybercriminals exploit it by sending fake delivery notifications. These messages pressure victims to click on links to resolve supposed issues, such as delivery address or payment of additional fees, often leading to compromised credentials. 
 Fake charities – Preying on the goodwill of people during the holidays, attackers create deceptive websites impersonating charities to solicit donations. 
 Fake order receipts – Cybercriminals mimic well-known, reputable retailers by sending fake order receipts through email. These emails contain links supposedly allowing the recipient to cancel or modify their order, tricking them into visiting phishing sites where their credentials are compromised. 
 
<p>While most attacks are targeted toward consumers, organizations should also be alert. Employees often use corporate devices such as laptops and mobile phones for holiday shopping, potentially risking the compromise of business accounts and applications. In addition, many users reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, making them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) with Bluetooth proximity is the highest assurance phishing-resistant MFA option available in the market. It is the most recommended approach to securing access to organizational resources and data for users including employees, contractors, and B2B customers.</p>
<p>For most consumer use cases, passkeys are starting to gain adoption as the phishing-resistant MFA that utilizes a user’s smartphone to utilize cryptographic key pairs when authenticating users to applications or services. Passkeys are generally multi-device enabled with the private key stored across a user’s device ecosystem and in their platform’s cloud account (i.e. iCloud, etc.).</p>
<p>Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA)</p>
<p>While phishing-resistant passwordless MFA provides enhanced security and protection against ATO attacks, enforcing a risk-based approach can help add additional layers of security while balancing security with user experience, only introducing friction in the process when necessary. Risk inputs like travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, and other external risk feeds such as threat feeds, etc. can help evaluate the risk score of a user during an authentication event, allowing for access to be blocked or requiring the user to use a different 2FA based on risk score thresholds.</p>
<p>Identity Verification (IDV)</p>
<p>Another common entry point for attackers is during password/MFA reset, where they can gain access to a user’s account by triggering a reset and adding additional authenticators to the account. Using identity verification solutions can help combat these attacks. Requiring users to verify their identity with physical credentials such as a driver’s license, passport, etc. can add another layer of defense in securing users against ATO attacks. IDV as a step-up authentication can help protect high-value transactions or out-of-policy/out-of-compliance users.</p>
<p>Combining phishing-resistant MFA with RBA and IDV offers a layered approach with defense in depth against identity-based attacks.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>At the 2023 European Identity and Cloud Conference, KuppingerCole held a workshop entitled “Building the Roadmap for Your Future IAM”. In this workshop, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst and Co-Founder of KuppingerCole, together with Christopher Schuetze (CISO) and Phillip Messerschmidt (Lead Advisor) explained how to utilize the concept of the Identity Fabric and the IAM reference architecture to turn it into a workable roadmap for a corporate program in Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>If you have never heard of the Identity Fabric before, you clearly must have been living under a giant IAM rock in the past years. If you want some quick learnings, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/identity-fabrics-where-do-you-stand-where-should-you-go">read Martin’s blog about the identity fabric here</a>. If you have a little bit more time – three and a half hours to be exact – watch our workshop from EIC 2023 to learn about building the roadmap for your future IAM.</p>
<p>And, of course, don't forget to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/tickets">book your ticket to the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2024</a>, taking place in Berlin from June 4 to 7, 2024. EIC 2024 will sport a diverse range of sessions, panels, and workshops dealing with securing sensitive data in organizations with the help of modern identity management and access control. Attendees will get a well-balanced agenda, showcasing best practice presentations from end-user companies as well as industry standardization bodies, software manufacturers and independent analysts.</p>

 Making a Human Rights Based Approach to Personal Data&nbsp;Work <p>We (Mydex CIC) have just published a new Paper on how to practically implement <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">a human rights approach to personal data</a>. It’s important because implementing a human rights to personal data does two things: it involves implementing a human rights approach to the person that the data relates to and to the service that the data is being used to deliver. It’s key to actually making human rights happen on the ground, day-to-day rather than just talk about it (which tends to happen quite&nbsp;often).</p><p>You might think that peoples’ rights in relation to their data is already covered, dealt with by legislation such as GDPR. To be sure, GDPR lays important foundations creating a number of rights such as the right to access, to data portability, to transparency, to object to processing and to be forgotten.</p><p>But in many ways these are just formal rights which have very little impact on what happens day to day. We think a human rights approach to personal data goes much further than formal compliance to GDPR. It should extend into the nitty gritty of how themes such as Control, Agency and Guardianship work (hence the title of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Paper</a>). Here are some of its key&nbsp;points.</p> Is user-centricity a good&nbsp;thing? <p>First off, almost always, slogans like ‘user centric service design’ are a sure-fire sign that a human rights approach to personal data is not being implemented. This is because of the way ‘user centric’ logic works. By definition, a ‘user’ is a person using a particular service. In focusing solely on the interface between the organisation and the individual, ‘user-centricity’ actually ignores the context and circumstances of the individual’s life, quickly turning the organisation’s attention back to itself — its interface with the&nbsp;user.</p><p>‘User-centric’ thus becomes a way in which organisations keep examining themselves in their own mirrors: high-sounding rhetoric for their continued focus on their own needs in relation to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>Here is a simple example: a user-centric approach to designing forms will focus on one particular organisation’s attempts to make filling in its particular forms easier, clearer and simpler. This is fine as far as it goes. But it’s not very far, because most individuals need many different services and therefore need to fill in lots of different forms, many of them completely different in their design, presentation and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Time and time again we have seen projects where ‘user-centric’ service design loses sight of the people it is supposed to serve: the human beings whose lives are much richer, more complicated and difficult than just one single interface with one particular organisation and one particular service.</p><p>So, for example, a service that is person-centric rather than user-centric might ask ‘how to eliminate the need to fill in forms at all?’ (by, for example, enabling automated API-based processes of data sharing). Or, failing that, how to design forms so that they all look and feel the same no matter what organisation they come from, so that we as human beings don’t have to learn how to navigate our way through each different form, starting from scratch every&nbsp;time?</p> Is ‘control’ a good&nbsp;thing? <p>‘Control’ over data is another word to be suspicious about. That’s because service providers usually interpret ‘control’ in a very narrow, organisation-centric way. ‘Control’ is interpreted as an individual being able to exercise a little more control over the data that that particular organisation collects about them. This is very different to an individual having genuine, full control over the data by, for example, being able to aggregate data from all the different organisations they deal with in their own database (such as a personal data store), and to use and share this data as they wish, outside of the systems, restrictions and controls placed upon this data by the organisation concerned.</p><p>A truly human rights approach to data embraces the second, genuine, full interpretation of ‘control’; something that, after 16 years of development, we are now implementing in a number of projects, particularly in health and&nbsp;care.</p> Why agency is&nbsp;critical <p>‘Agency’ is another key concept when it comes to the practical implementation of a human rights approach to personal data. If you can’t actually access and use your data to actually get stuff done in your life then your ‘rights’ are just formal, not real; and ‘control’ is close to meaningless.</p><p>The locus of such agency isn’t within the systems of this or that organisation; it is within the individual’s life, when they are trying to access, use and share data to better manage the issues that matter to them. This, we believe, is creating a completely different agenda.</p><p>What’s really needed to enhance and enable citizen agency is a personalised experience layer that enables individuals to interoperate with many different schemes and ecosystems via a familiar, consistent interface that becomes second nature to them. Like driving a&nbsp;car.</p><p>Practically speaking, this means each individual should have their own personalised cockpits or dashboards that display the data about their life, their transactions, their accumulated proof points and so on, in the ways that they find intuitive and easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Within this, agency means being able to use your data where and when you want, and being able to share it easily with whomever you want, safely and securely. Seen from this perspective, our society has hardly even begun adopting or implementing a human rights approach to personal data: we have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p> Agency and guardianship: two sides of the same&nbsp;coin <p>Finally, ‘guardianship’ is crucial to both real life control and agency. There are millions of people in the UK today, such as the old, frail or ill, who are not able to act fully and completely on their own behalf: who need help; someone to act for them in ways big and&nbsp;small.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, it is precisely in such situations of real or threatened loss of control and agency that, very often, they become all the more important to the person concerned. They want, as it were, to exercise control over what others are doing for them, when and&nbsp;how.</p><p>This is complex to manage and current ways of handling this complexity struggle with a chasm between highly formal, legal and bureaucratic powers of attorney and the myriad of informal ways that powers are delegated in real life: “Oh love, when you go to the shops, could you buy these items for me? Here’s my&nbsp;card!”</p><p>People need systems and infrastructure that let them handle this formal/informal spectrum quickly, simply and safely. Our Paper explains some of the mechanisms, such as Circles of Support, that we have developed to deal with these issues in a practical way.</p><p>This underlines a key point about most current debates on human rights. What’s needed above all is infrastructure, tools and capabilities that make it possible to embed and crystallise a human rights approach to data in a way that works at the level of daily, practical details. The focus needs to be on practical implementation, not just rhetoric.</p><p>To conclude, change is in the air. Our (Mydex’s) day-to-day work is showing that it is possible to build a personal data ecosystem that is interoperable, flexible, certifiable, scalable and that is also safe, secure and consensual, taking a human rights based approach that results in genuine personal, social and economic benefits. The opportunity is to make a human rights approach to personal data — and therefore to all data-driven services — something that actually does happen, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>P.S.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>As we look towards 2024, the air travel industry is poised for a historic milestone. The latest forecasts suggest that 2024 is set to be the biggest year ever in terms of global passenger traffic volume. This is a remarkable turnaround from the significant downturn experienced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of us, including myself, this year has been marked by frequent flights. Whether for business or leisure, it seems like we’ve been in the air more often than not.</p>
<p>As air travel volumes continue to soar, the question arises: how can we further improve and streamline travel processes for travelers and various stakeholders? A key component in this evolution is the role of digital identity.</p>
<p>In this latest podcast episode, Dan and I engage in a conversation focusing on the concept of ‘travel credentials’. We delve into how digital identity can revolutionize the travel experience, making it more efficient and seamless for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Daniel and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Governance of International Air Travel: Inquiry about the organization responsible for developing international standards and specifications for smooth airport experiences across different countries. 
 ICAO’s Role and Dynamics: Exploration of ICAO’s governance and business interactions with countries like the United States and Canada. Discussion on the creation and alignment of passports through ICAO’s collaboration with various countries. 
 Machine Authentication and Passport Digitization: Examination of the trend towards machine authentication at airports and its impact on the digitization of physical passports. 
 Biometrics in International Travel: Inquiry about the alignment of biometric standards and technologies across countries for travel purposes. 
 Photo Accuracy in Travel Documents: Discussion on the accuracy of photos in travel documents and their comparison across different locations. 
 Integrity of Various Travel Documents: Comparison of the integrity and standards of images in passports, visas, and driver’s licenses for biometric assessments. 
 Digital Travel Credential (DTC): Introduction to the concept of the digital travel credential and its relation to current travel processes. Exploration of the benefits of moving towards a digital travel credential. Discussion on the standards and application integration of digital travel credentials. 
 Benefits of DTC for Travelers: Analysis of how DTCs could streamline travel processes and their comparison to existing programs like Clear and Nexus. 
 Future of DTC Adoption: Inquiry into the current state of DTC pilot projects and predictions for future adoption trends. 
 Integration of DTCs in Wallets and Applications: Consideration of the logical placement of DTCs in digital wallets and applications, and their potential impact on travel efficiency.

<p>The Verida Network is a self-sovereign database network for storing private data.

We believe private storage infrastructure is the next growth area for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Web2 offers abundant storage options, but web3’s unique needs demand specific solutions.</p><p>Existing decentralized storage models such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave are robust for public data, but fall short for private personal data. <a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a> fills this gap by addressing speed, authentication, encryption, and regulatory issues in private data&nbsp;storage.</p><p>This is a chance for node operators to gain exposure to emerging, high growth use cases such as compliant DeFi, RWAs, credentials, healthcare and enterprise data management.</p><p>We are working with a growing <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of partners such as Polygon ID, Redbelly Network, zkPass, cheqd and others to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The Verida Storage Node&nbsp;Network <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet </a>selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users, however, have the freedom to change these nodes or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>The technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented and vital for the widespread adoption of this technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p> The Storage Node Foundational Release <p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation. You can track node statistics on the <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">Network Explorer</a>.</p><p>This has allowed the Verida team to monitor performance, gather analytics and rapidly improve reliability on the <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Acacia Testnet</a>. We are now preparing to open up the network to third party node operators.</p><p>The foundational release will target a mixture of node operators across different data centres, different regions. We aim to accommodate and incorporate both small, medium and large operators to support the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>These foundational members will be rewarded for their participation and are expected to work closely with the Verida team to ensure our documentation, tooling and protocol are meeting our delivery objectives of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Storage nodes will be brought online in staged cohorts as the Verida team learns and receives feedback on deployment processes, availability, security, real world usage, payments and incentives.</p> Apply now to be a Storage Node&nbsp;Operator <p>You can <a href="https://www.verida.network/storage-node-providers">apply here</a> to become a foundational node operator.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback please chat with us in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/664594912460668960/1092274729328574464">#storage-nodes channel</a> in the Verida&nbsp;discord.</p> Learn more about&nbsp;Verida   Website: <a href="https://www.verida.io/">https://www.verida.io</a>  Subscribe: <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/97344/60309864285472178/share">Verida Newsletter</a>  LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/verida_io">https://twitter.com/verida_io</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">https://discord.verida.io</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/verida_community">https://t.me/verida_community</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/</a>  Medium: <a href="https://news.verida.io/">https://news.verida.io/</a>  YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io">https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/decentralizing-the-verida-network-become-a-node-operator-e31a6a31daf1">Decentralizing the Verida Network: Become a Node Operator</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a go 
<p>YeshID is in beta and looking for folks who sit in that sweet spot where you want to ditch The Spreadsheet but don’t want to go all in on Okta. If this is you, <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">learn more</a>! We’re already <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, we’re in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and you have a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. </p>

<p></p>



 What is QuarkID? 



<p><a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>is the Decentralized Digital Identity protocol anchored on <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync Era</a>, developed by <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, and driven by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and other companies with extensive experience in decentralized technologies and data security. This initiative seeks to put the power of data in the hands of citizens.</p>



 Latin America’s leading Decentralized Identity protocol partners with zkSync to transform Digital Identity in the region, starting with the City of Buenos Aires. 



<p>In the ever-changing blockchain technology landscape, the quest for a billion users remains a constant goal. So what technology or use cases should we push to achieve greater adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>And is that, considering the privacy and digital security needs due to the increase in cybercrime and identity theft that is occurring these days, an identity and private data verification system that puts the user at the center, is imperative.</p>



 What drives this development? 



<p>At the heart of the Web3 ethic is personal ownership and decentralization, principles that extend far beyond financial assets to encompass broader, more practical applications. Today, we are pleased to announce a groundbreaking initiative in this direction: citizen-owned digital identity. Buenos Aires, Argentina, is poised to lead the charge, gradually introducing Web3 identity solutions powered by zkSync Era’s privacy-centric properties.</p>



<p>In the effort to bring Web3 identity solutions to the global stage, it is imperative that privacy remains a paramount concern in technologies that enable personal data ownership. A decentralized world that neglects privacy considerations goes against the very essence of Web3.</p>



<p>We envision a future in which personal freedom and autonomous digital identity empower individuals to securely manage their data.</p>



 Empowering Buenos Aires Citizens with Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Digital Identity. 



<p>Under Argentina’s blockchain-based identification initiative, citizens will gain control over their personal documents, health data and, in the future, payment processing. To build the infrastructure for this transformative program, Buenos Aires has partnered with QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol developed by Extrimian, Latin America’s leading decentralized identity company. QuarkID uses zkSync Era as its anchor protocol, powering the wallets through which individuals will claim their documents.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This marks a monumental leap toward a more secure and efficient future for government services in Latin America,” ; “QuarkID fosters closer ties between governments and citizens while introducing digital identity practices and security standards in Latin America.”, expressed <a href="https://ar.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva">Guillermo Villanueva, CEO of Extrimian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data stored in QuarkID wallets is autonomous, allowing citizens to control the delivery of their credentials when interacting with administrative services. zkSync Era serves as a settlement layer for QuarkID, ensuring that each participating citizen maintains ownership of their legitimate credentials.</p>



<p>While QuarkID makes its debut in Buenos Aires, its architecture is designed to scale globally. Complying with international standards such as W3C, Trust Over IP and Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID is interoperable with networks around the world.</p>



 Leveraging ZK Technology to Empower 650 Million People in Latin America 



<p>While blockchain-based digital identity promises a revolutionary change in data ownership, it often generates controversy as to the true decentralization of these processes. Recent events, such as the Kenyan government’s concerns about data privacy in a biometric cryptocurrency project, highlight these issues.</p>



<p>However, the transparency and security inherent in the cutting edge of Zero Knowledge (ZK) technology, combined with Ethereum, have the potential to dispel such concerns. This partnership unlocks privacy-preserving digital identity enforcement for entire nations.</p>



zkSync Era partnership with QuarkID



<p>Source: <a href="https://zksync.mirror.xyz/w4_Dyhbx1X2BEGpYNCn8rEAS_2uC1hV0qPQl_m5AChk">ZkSync Blog</a></p>



<p>With zkSync and Ethereum as the backbone of this initiative, personal data stored on-chain mitigates identity theft and personal information attacks commonly associated with centralized data storage technologies. zkSync ensures that digital property is trusted, trustless and secure, while prioritizing privacy.</p>



<p>The Argentine government and the City of Buenos Aires aim to establish its digital identity framework as a public good, enabling individuals to seamlessly transact information between government, businesses and their peers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires</a>, emphasizes, “With this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology and set the standard for how other countries in the region should use blockchain technology for the benefit of their people.”</p>



<p>Read this <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Note to Diego Fernandez in Fortune Crypto</a> to learn more about this alliance and how it will be carried out.</p>



QuarkID decentralized digital trust protocol, and verification of private data



 QuarkID Roadmap 



<p>Beginning in October, residents of Buenos Aires will be able to download a QuarkID wallet to claim personal identification documents, including birth and marriage certificates. QuarkID will be available to all Argentine citizens and will eventually become mandatory nationwide. In November, documents such as proof of income and academic verifications will be available to obtain in QuarkID wallets. By the end of 2023, the government will establish QuarkID’s future roadmap and outline expansion milestones to initially provide its services to more than 3 million citizens.</p>



<p>Buenos Aires is leading this initiative, ushering in a new era of Internet through digital ownership. We hope that nations around the world will look to Argentina as an example of how Web3 identity can thrive at the government level.</p>

 What’s going on with Hollywood and AI or Artificial Intelligence? 



<p>Hollywood has a problem with artificial intelligence and the lack of humanity and individuality it breeds in the industry. The latest outcry from actors has underscored the importance of safeguarding authenticity in the film and television industry. In this context, the use of a decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system can be important. This system helps to verify data and identities and to avoid scams and impersonations.</p>



<p>It is time to protect authenticity and identity in Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age. identities and, in the case of Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age.</p>



<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity system ensures reliable verification of data and identities, making a difference in the control of personal data. With Self-Sovereign Identity, we could avoid impersonalization and negative uses of Artificial Intelligence, such as scams and identity theft.</p>



<p>At Extrimian, we are working to promote more sovereign, decentralized and cybercrime-preventing models. Find out what we are doing at Extrimian to promote these models at Extrimian.io Products.</p>



 The Present Conflict and the Relevance of Authenticity: Hollywood and Artificial Intelligence 



<p>In Hollywood, actors who are authentic and convey genuine emotions are key to the success of movies and TV shows. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has presented significant challenges in terms of impersonation and the generation of fraudulent content. The actor strike shows the concern about losing authenticity and being replaced by technology.</p>



 Data protection with SSI vs. AI 



 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the importance of authenticity. 



<p>How can this model solve the problems with breaching people’s identities?<br>SSI is a system that gives individuals full control over their digital identity and the data associated with it. Using SSI, actors and other individuals can create verifiable digital identities that support their authenticity in the entertainment industry. This system uses cryptography and blockchain to protect and validate information, preventing changes and forgeries.</p>



 Data security: Avoiding deception and forgery. 



<p>Using a decentralized, self-sovereign identity system in Hollywood could prevent scams and spoofing when validating identities. This system would enable the creation of verifiable digital certifications that would evidence the effective participation of participants in specific projects.</p>



<p>Such certifications could be employed by production studios and audiences to corroborate the veracity of content, fostering trust and preventing fraud.</p>



 Safeguarding authenticity in the Hollywood industry in the age of AI 



<p>In an age of technological advancements, it is important to address the entertainment industry’s challenges in terms of authenticity and truthfulness. What do you think is the effect of deepfakes and impersonations in the entertainment industry? In what ways do you think identity and data verification can help address these issues? What additional actions do you think should be put in place to safeguard the privacy and rights of actors?</p>



<p>What measures can we implement with respect to this? Self-Sovereign Identity as a tool for AI.<br>It is time to safeguard the authenticity of identities and, in the Hollywood context, maintain the essence of human performance in the digital age. The adoption of a Self-Sovereign Identity system can be crucial to ensure reliable verification of data and identities.</p>



<p>With SSI, we could prevent impersonation and harmful uses of AI, such as fraud and identity theft.</p>
