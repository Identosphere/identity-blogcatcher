<p><a href="https://www.vision-box.com/">Vision-Box</a> has received the go-ahead for a new contactless screening pilot at two land borders in Bulgaria. Both borders are part of the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-encourages-eu-countries-use-abc-kiosks-achieve-schengen-ees-compliance-020303/">European Union’s Entry/Exit System</a> (EES), which is set to go into effect in 2022 and will require member states to collect the biometric information of third party nationals.</p>



  



<p>The pilot concerns a new Self-Service Enrollment system that will allow travelers to pass through border checkpoints more quickly. The system will consist of touchless registration kiosks, a biometric corridor, and handheld tablets, all of which will run on Vision-Box’s flagship Orchestra identity management platform.</p>



<p>From the traveller’s perspective, the experience will begin with the kiosk, which is able to gather personal information from travel documents, in addition to biometric information through touchless fingerprint sensors and facial recognition cameras. The individual can also use the kiosk to answer entry questions, both for Bulgaria and for the European Union.</p>



<p>Once that process is complete, the passenger will be directed to the corridor, where their biometrics will be used to verify their identity as they pass through the border. Those who cannot be identified will be redirected to a border agent for a more traditional manual screening, which will be carried out with legacy Coppernic technology.</p>



<p>When running properly, the system will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aviation-industry-prioritizes-contactless-solutions-new-vision-box-survey-070304/">minimize the amount of contact</a> between travelers, border staff, and physical border infrastructure. The first phase of the pilot kicked off this month at the Kapitan Andreevo BCP crossing, where the self-service system is available for pedestrians and car travelers entering Bulgaria from Turkey. The second phase will make the technology available to those leaving Bulgaria for Serbia at the Kalotina BCP exit.</p>



<p>Vision-Box’s Orchestra technology has previously been deployed at airports all over the world. Emirates is using the platform to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vision-box-outfits-emirates-biometric-passenger-processing-technology-102803/">screen passengers in Dubai</a>, while AirAsia is integrating it with its own <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/airasia-looks-expand-biometric-faces-system-vision-box-partnership-102701/">face-based biometric check-in system</a>. The Bulgaria pilot has the backing of Frontex, which acts as the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-frontex-provide-border-security-research-european-commission-021101/">European Commission’s Border and Coast Guard Agency</a>.</p>

<p>The Liberal Party of Canada is facing criticism from privacy advocates for its use of facial recognition during its internal nominations process. The complaints are related to a biometric identity verification system that was used to enable online voting during the pandemic.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, the Liberal Party has historically selected candidates to run for office at in-person nomination meetings, where party members needed to be physically present to cast a vote for their preferred representative. However, those in-person meetings needed to be abandoned due to COVID-19 restrictions that limited the size of such public gatherings. Facial recognition allowed the party to complete that nominations process remotely, giving organizers a way to verify the identities of those eligible to vote.</p>



<p>The problem, according to the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), is that that facial recognition technology is unreliable, and that its use infringes on the privacy of the Canadian public. The organization has asked the Liberal Party to stop using the technology, and British Columbia Privacy Commissioner Michael McEvoy is now considering a separate privacy investigation based on that request. He noted that the Liberal Party’s actions could run afoul of a BC privacy law that gives the province oversight over the actions of political parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BC is the only province with such a law on the books. McEvoy has not yet opened a formal investigation, but indicated that he will be examining the materials in the CCLA’s complaint later in the week. He went on to argue that the issue is important because political parties often have access to large amounts of personal information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For its part, the Liberal Party insisted that its system was based on public guidelines published by the federal privacy commissioner. It also stressed that it is not storing biometric information, and that the data is deleted once a member’s identity has been verified.</p>



<p>“The Liberal nomination process is moving forward in a manner that ensures people can vote from their homes out of respect for public health precautions, while maintaining the integrity of our elections and protecting privacy,’” said Liberal Media Relations Manager Matteo Rossi.</p>



<p>The Canadian Privacy Commissioner has asked legislators to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-privacy-commissioner-calls-stronger-facial-recognition-regulations-051401/">pass stricter facial recognition regulations</a>, while the CCLA has called for a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-civil-rights-organization-calls-temporary-facial-recognition-ban-012903/">temporary ban on the technology</a>. The BC Privacy Commissioner, meanwhile, was previously part of the investigation that found that Clearview AI’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commissioners-rule-clearviews-data-collection-practices-violate-canadian-privacy-laws-020410/">facial recognition platform violated Canadian privacy law</a>.</p>

 FindBiometrics’ latest webinar is now available on-demand. 



  



<p>Entitled “Extending Trust With Reusable Identity Credentials”, the webinar featured Onfido’s Director of Alliances &amp; Partnerships, Ed Ackerman, and Microsoft Principal Program Manager Ankur Patel. In a discussion moderated by FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter, the two delved into one of the most exciting trends in digital security today – the use of selfie-based biometric identity verification, in which end users are authenticated by matching their selfie pictures to images of their official identity documents.</p>



<p>It’s a straightforward concept, but it involves highly sophisticated technologies – not only biometric facial recognition but also AI-drive document reading – as well as complex considerations with respect to liveness detection and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-azure-reaches-decentralized-id-milestone-in-collaboration-with-biometrics-leaders/">decentralized credentials</a>. Fortunately, the webinar’s experts had plenty of insight to share:</p>

 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/webinar-redefining-biometrics-next-decade-digital-work-life-704199/">ON-DEMAND: Redefining Biometrics for the Next Decade of Digital Work and Life</a> 



  



<p>The aim of this panel discussion was to demystify biometric technology, which has come under intense scrutiny due to concerns about privacy and surveillance, resulting in profound misunderstandings about much more benign applications such as authentication and identity verification. And some real experts were on hand to undertake this task, including FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy, CITeR Director Stephanie Schuckers, Better Identity Coalition Coordinator Jeremy Grant, and Frost &amp; Sullivan Security Analyst Danielle VanZandt.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> has secured another distribution partner for its biometric payment card technology, announcing that it has teamed up with Network International Services Limited Jordan PSC (“NI”).</p>



<p>The partnership is expected to enhance Zwipe’s reach across the Levant, a historical geographical area encompassing parts of Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Turkey. The announcement comes about a month after the news of Zwipe’s partnership with <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/middle-east-payment-services-is-zwipes-latest-card-partner-806031/">Middle East Payment Services</a>, an issuer and acquirer of payment cards.</p>



<p>NI, meanwhile, is described in a statement announcing the new partnership as a provider of “payment products and services that are on the cutting-edge of technology development.”</p>



<p>Commenting on the development, NI Regional President Amjad Al-Sadeq noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has “accelerated a mega-shift” in the Levant toward more hygienic payment solutions – an important selling point for biometric cards, which enable highly secure contactless transactions.</p>



<p>“We are confident that our issuer clients and consumers will embrace biometric payment cards as they provide an excellent check-out experience with much higher security,” he said. “Zwipe Pay ONE cards will enrich our payment portfolio and further reinforce our innovation leadership.”</p>



<p>For Zwipe, the partnership is an important strategic win as the company continues to position itself for the large-scale adoption of biometric cards. Ramzi Saboury, who was named Zwipe’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-targets-middle-eastern-market-with-new-partnership-regional-gm-041304/">General Manager for the Middle East and North Africa</a> in April, called the Levant “a key growth market for Zwipe in the Middle East and Africa”, adding that NI is “the largest player in this vast region,” and one that has “strong relations with many prominent banks across the Middle East and Africa”.</p>

<p>On June 29th, InfoCert will take part of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference, the leading independent European Think Tank focused on identity, privacy and trust. InfoCert will participate in a program of seven live and interactive webinars, focused on the theme of Securing Trust in the New Digital Reality. More than 40 countries will be represented during the free-to-attend conference, which takes place from 29th June – 1st July 2021.</p>



 <a href="https://annualconference.eema.org/#register">InfoCert Focuses on Self Sovereign Identity Paradigm Shift as a Platinum Sponsor of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference</a> 



<p>Chair of EEMA, Jon Shamah, states: “We are delighted that InfoCert has chosen to be a Platinum Sponsor for this year’s EEMA Annual Conference. InfoCert is a longstanding and active member of the EEMA community, and an organization at the forefront of innovation in Self Sovereign Identity, an area of specific interest for our members and partners.” One such innovation is Dizme, a Blockchain-based app developed by the DizmeID Foundation (of which InfoCert is a Premier Member), which incorporates the benefits of distributed identity, to provide individuals with direct control over the information they share with companies, with all of the legal value and trust of a Qualified Trust Service Provider.</p>

 FindBiometrics Multimedia Editor Eric Weiss moderated expert fireside chats and panels for our first ever virtual event. 



<p>The inaugural FindBiometrics Identity Summit is a wrap, and preparations are now underway for the <a href="https://events.channelpronetwork.com/enterprise-biometrics-online-summit-making-digital-transformation-work-you">Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit</a> in September. </p>



<p>A look back at last week’s virtual conference offers some idea of what to expect for the next one. The FindBiometrics Identity Summit was kicked off by <a href="https://www.acuitymi.com/">Acuity Market Intelligence</a> Principal Analyst Maxine Most, who delivered a rousing presentation – entitled “Harnessing the Tornado” – illustrating just how much excitement there is in the fast-rising financial services biometrics market.</p>



<p>The virtual conference that followed saw a number of fascinating conversations in the form of fireside chats and expert panels. High-level executives from IDmission and Jumio discussed the white-hot trend of selfie onboarding with Maxine Most, for example; and Frost &amp; Sullivan Security Industry Analyst Danielle VanZandt found herself in the middle of a debate between Nok Nok Chief Business Development Officer Walter Beisheim and FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy, over the best approach to authentication in the mobile channel.</p>



<p>The day also saw some one-on-one interviews with Aerendir CEO Dr. Martin Zizi, Nok Nok VP of Products Rolf Lindemann, and Jumio Chief Product Officer Bala Kumar; and it featured special presentations and panel sessions with experts from industry leaders Daon, Aware, Inc., Incode, and TypingDNA.</p>



<p>All of the above – along with a special session on smart Point-of-Sale technology and an interactive virtual Expo Hall – helped to prompt some very positive feedback from attendees and presenters alike, and the team at FindBiometrics is now looking to carry that momentum into our next big event, “<a href="https://events.channelpronetwork.com/enterprise-biometrics-online-summit-making-digital-transformation-work-you">Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit: Making Digital Transformation Work for You</a>“.</p>



<p>Slated for September 22, 2021, the event will feature numerous sessions focusing on different aspects of the digital transformation that is sweeping across the enterprise, with a focus on security, optimization, and regulatory compliance. The day’s discussions will touch on a range of exciting technologies, from facial recognition and machine learning to fever detection and wellness checks, and will deliver tangible insights for corporate decision-makers to take back to the office.</p>



<p>Registration for the event will open soon, so stay tuned to FindBiometrics for further updates over the coming weeks!</p>

 The Price of Gas: <br>Why KILT Chose Polkadot Over&nbsp;Ethereum <p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>There are many reasons why we chose to build the KILT blockchain on <a href="https://www.substrate.io/">Substrate</a> and plan to run as a parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem (i.e. the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> networks). One major reason is the fixed, low costs offered. For the first time, this will allow companies to incorporate permissionless blockchain into their business plans, knowing in advance what the costs of their transactions, and subsequently their product, will&nbsp;be.</p><p>To understand why this is a ground-breaking development for enterprise in general and us in particular, we first need to look at the history of blockchain.</p> Transaction costs on legacy blockchains <p>Blockchain first came to prominence after the Bitcoin white paper was released in October 2008. Bitcoin introduced two incentive models, providing a way for the developers running nodes (“miners”) to earn while maintaining the&nbsp;network:</p><p>1) By receiving newly minted Bitcoin tokens (BTC) for solving a cryptographic puzzle and winning a block (“mining”), adding it to the blockchain. This will occur until all the BTC tokens — a maximum of 21 million — are&nbsp;mined.</p><p>2) By receiving the “gas” (transaction fees) from any transaction within the&nbsp;block.</p><p>Ethereum, the next biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, also has a system with gas costs. The user can choose how much gas they want to pay when making a transaction. The miners look at the amount offered and choose which transaction they want to carry out. Naturally, the more gas you offer to pay, the more attractive your transaction is.</p><p>Permissioned blockchain alternatives with stable gas costs do exist, but since the attraction of blockchain is that it can be trustless, i.e. the user can trust the mathematical system rather than having to trust in people, that was not an option for&nbsp;us.</p> Supply and&nbsp;demand <p>What we see with permissionless systems is that gas costs follow supply and demand. As a consequence, when the networks are busy many transactions end up in a memory pool on the network (e.g.<a href="https://mempool.space/"> Mempool</a>) waiting to be processed, sometimes for up to a day. This is a critical problem with transaction fees on permissionless blockchains, as you never really know how much you have to put in to avoid being stuck in a Mempool, and subsequently how much the transaction is going to cost if you want it carried out within a specified timeframe. While this can be calculated using interfaces such as the<a href="https://ethgasstation.info/"> Eth gas station</a>, it means that the cost of the transaction isn’t known in advance, since it depends on the current market situation. This makes it nearly impossible for businesses to create a reliable financial plan for their&nbsp;costs.</p><p>At KILT, we use blockchain technology to record the hash (a number representing the information) of credentials issued. This forms a core part of our goal to create revocable, anonymous credentials. Using legacy blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, we could create a credential, but couldn’t quote a regular price — it could be inexpensive one day, and it could be €100 the next. Or it could take up to 24 hours to&nbsp;process.</p><p>That made building ID services on legacy permissionless blockchains impossible for industrial use, as a fixed production cost could not be determined in advance. Since a product price consists of the production cost and the profit, the price could not be set without risking winning or losing on each transaction, making it impractical to build a business model as an attestor. What we needed was a system with a more predictable cost structure.</p> Transaction costs on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot uses different incentive mechanisms. Like the first incentive mechanism in Bitcoin, Polkadot uses a system in which newly minted coins are earned by the people running the network — the validators — and the nominators backing them. Therefore, the gas price doesn’t need to be competitive, as the validators are already compensated for their work and not competing with each other on&nbsp;price.</p><p>The gas price in Polkadot, therefore, has a different purpose. It is mainly to disincentivise spammers from flooding the network or causing bottlenecks with useless or extraordinarily heavy transactions, as users have to pay a fee to write a transaction on the blockchain.</p><p>The funds raised by these gas fees go to the Treasury. Native token (KSM or DOT) holders can then propose referenda and vote on how the gas is spent — for keeping the system running smoothly, marketing, community events, etc. Gas not used is “burned” and taken out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>The actual gas costs vary depending on the computer power needed, and the amount of data to be saved. For example, a simple transfer of DOT from one account to another needs less gas than a smart contract, and saving 10 bytes of data forever uses less power than saving a gigabyte. Behind the scenes, the gas fee the user pays for a transaction in the Polkadot ecosystem is calculated by multiplying the base fee by the data amount needed by the computing power needed. So while Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the market, Polkadot is designed to be driven by computer algorithms, with a constant, fair fee depending on the size of the transaction.</p> Transaction fees on&nbsp;KILT <p>For KILT, writing the hash on the blockchain doesn’t use much more computing power than a simple token transfer, so the base fee for credentials can be kept low — as little as a few&nbsp;cents.</p><p>Another element of our system includes the possibility of delegation, for example allowing a large company to delegate attestation rights to several employees. Setting up delegation trees requires more power and energy because they need to go through the validator, and will therefore cost more than recording the hash. These costs can, however, be anticipated and written into a business’s cost structure.</p> Keeping transaction costs stable on&nbsp;KILT <p>As gas costs (known as the “angel’s share” on KILT) are paid in KILT tokens, volatility in the price of KILT would affect the corresponding price in fiat. We aim to address this in several&nbsp;ways.</p><p>The initial cost of a transaction will be set at network&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Later, on-chain oracles — which automatically link the base fee of KILT to the current price of the KILT coin in fiat — could be used to keep the cost stable. Until these oracles are available, in the event of the fee going too high before Sudo is removed, we could adjust the cost. After Sudo is removed and before oracles are introduced, changes to keep the cost stable could be made by the community of token holders using on-chain governance.</p> Bringing blockchain to&nbsp;business <p>The fixed, stable costs of using permissionless blockchains via the Polkadot ecosystem will finally make blockchain technology practical and accessible to a wide variety of use cases in business. We look forward to being among the first parachains in the ecosystem and having our credentials available not only to those already using blockchain, but for traditional businesses and users. Using our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">open-source SDK</a>, even small companies could build solutions to meet their digital ID needs cost-effectively and without blockchain expertise. Finally, the advantages of trustless blockchain technology can be brought to the mainstream, bridging the advantages of the fairer, decentralised Web 3.0 to our current experience of the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-price-of-gas-why-kilt-chose-polkadot-over-ethereum-6bef9006a305">The Price of Gas:&nbsp;

<p>The UEFA EURO was about to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2020 with 3 million tickets and 5 billion global live viewers anticipated. The event initially was supposed to take place in June 2020, but due to the global COVID19 pandemic, it was moved to 2021.</p>
<p>For gaming operators, big sports events traditionally mean large spikes in user activity and especially new user registrations. More than ever, during this year’s EURO 2020, gaming operators are facing a high number of surges in new signups on a matchday. Unfortunately, with rising demand, there is an increase in fraud attempts coming along.</p>
 A new wave of sophisticated fraud 
<p>IDnow is constantly monitoring the fraud attacks on its customers to detect trends early and ultimately stay ahead of fraudsters. Recently IDnow has detected an increasing wave of highly sophisticated fraud attacks. These advanced fraud attacks were bypassing standard identity verification processes, making them very difficult to detect.</p>
<p>After investigating and analysing the sophisticated fraud attacks, IDnow discovered that fraudsters were utilising very well forged ID cards. The visual security features, like holograms and watermarks, were forged to perfection. In consequence, both humans and artificial intelligence were not able to visually detect fake ID cards.</p>
 If the ID cards were forged to perfection, how did IDnow spot them? 
<p>IDnow is not only looking at individual identity verification cases but is monitoring across all verifications, over long periods and across multiple customers with different use cases. This results in extensive data sets, allowing IDnow to detect fraud patterns and trends at scale.</p>
<p>This data enabled IDnow to detect two ident cases with two different identities, however the same person on appeared the biometric images. In other words, at least one or more likely both ID cards were fraudulent. After investigating the cases further and performing a manual review, the two used ID cards were proven fake by verifying the built-in electronic chip using NFC.</p>
<p>Below I highlighted some of the things that come up for my clients. The main question is how we ensure with NFC technology we reduce the increasing rate of fraud cases?</p>
 Sophisticated fraud attacks require more sophisticated identity verification solutions 
<p>When an ID document is forged to perfection, it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features. Today modern ID documents contain an NFC chip that stores a copy of the identity details. The information on the chip is secured and can be authenticated through an electronic certificate from the issuing government. Consequently, the NFC chip is far more complex to forge than visual security features, like holograms and watermarks. Validating the presence of a chip and the stored information using NFC offers an additional and more sophisticated security feature.</p>
 What’s NFC? 
<p>NFC stands for Near Field Communication, wireless communication technology for short ranges of 4 cm or less. Today NFC is well known through contactless credit cards and mobile payment solutions such as Apple- and Google Pay. Nowadays, most smartphones can read NFC ID documents, including both leading operating systems, Android and Apple iOS. As a result, you can scan your passport or ID card and identify yourself on your smartphone, just like you use to do at ePassport gates at airports. When scanning an identity document with NFC, the information gets read out automatically from the chip. Like at the airport, automatically scanning your passport is faster and more convenient than somebody visually checking your documents.</p>
<p>Read our Quick Guide: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/nfc-technology-for-id-verification/">Do you want to how NFC offers security and convenience for your identity verification?</a></p>
 How is NFC going to help our operators make the EURO 2020 a success? 
 
 Additional security layer:&nbsp;Validating an NFC chip adds a new form of physical security feature that goes beyond visual security marks. Further, the chip is highly complex to forge. Therefore NFC chips offer a higher level of security against fraudsters. 
 Higher Automation: Scanning an NFC document is fast and easy and eliminates user error, such as blurry pictures or poor lighting conditions. Instead, the identity details and the biometric picture are read out automatically. In consequence, NFC authentication requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. 
 Regulatory Acceptance:&nbsp;More and more regulators have started evaluating and approving NFC-based ident methods. More recently, FINMA in Switzerland and ANSSI in France have approved NFC-based methods.&nbsp;Other regulators like in Portugal are considering it. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, NFC offers a win-win for both gaming operators and football fans alike. For gaming operators, NFC presents an additional and more sophisticated security feature. At the same time, their customers get a fast and convenient onboarding process. That’s why we at IDnow believe that IDnow AutoIdent plus the new NFC feature provide the right combination of convenience and sophisticated security for the UEFA EURO 2020.</p>

 How Access Control Works 

<p>OIDC claims are a piece of information inserted about an entity. Name and picture are claim examples for users.</p>

<p>OIDC scopes are a group of claims.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll define a new claim based on an Okta group. The claim will be included in all scopes defined. The OIDC plugin must check if the coming tokens have this specific claim to allow the Kong route consumption. Only users who are part of the Okta group will have the claim included in the token and will be able to consume the route.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Okta 

<p>In my example, I already created two users and a group. The group has only one member.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new claim will be based on this group, so only its members will have permission to go through the Kong route.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new Kong claim definition is based on the Kong group. It’ll be included in any scope for each access token issued.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s run a token preview to check the tokens and claim out. For the first request, we can try the user who’s not a Kong group member. As expected, the access token does not have a Kong claim inside of it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we try the other user that belongs to the Kong group, the access token will be different. Here’s the Kong claim inside our token.</p>

<p></p>

 Enable OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Let’s check our Kong route with the OIDC plugin enabled. According to the parameters in the screenshot below, the plugin should check if the token has the Kong claim defined by Okta. So in this sense, the route should be consumed only by users who are members of the Kong group.</p>

 
   Config.Scope Claim: <code>kong_claim</code> 
   Config.Scopes Required: <code>kong_group</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Consume the Kong Route 

<p>Let’s have both users consume the route. The process will be similar to what we already did in Okta’s token preview process. For the first request, let’s try the user who isn’t in the Kong group. As expected, we shouldn’t be able to consume the route.</p>

<p>We are trying to consume the route, but since we don’t have any token injected inside our request, the API gateway redirects us to Okta to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And after getting authenticated, Okta is redirecting us back to the API gateway. However, since the token doesn’t have the claim inside it, the gateway says “forbidden” and won’t allow us to consume the route.</p>

<p>Let’s try the other user who is a member of the Kong group. Again, we try to consume the route, getting redirected to Okta, but we’re going to use the second user this time.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After getting authenticated, Okta redirects us back to the API gateway. This time, our token has the Kong claim we defined in Okta previously.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, we will decode the JWT token and check the token and the claim inside it.</p>

Web-based threats are subtle and tend to go unnoticed. They happen when people visit affected sites that seem fine on the front-end but, in reality, automatically download malicious content onto devices.</p>  <p>Mobile Network Security Threats. Network-based threats are especially common and risky because cybercriminals can steal unencrypted data while people use public WiFi networks.</p>  <p>Mobile Device Security Threats.

 Welcome and Thanks to our Patrons!  <a href="https://patreon.com/identosphere">Support this publication at Patreon.com — Get Patron only content!!</a> <p>We’re still working on that mailing list digest, but that will be released to patrons in the next few days (hopefully).<br><br>In other news, since this newsletter is always overflowing, and this week it’s even fuller than ever, we’re splitting this weeks Identosphere into 2 parts.</p><p>The problem is that some e-mail clients \ providers will truncate messages beyond a certain length. We’re trying to figure out if we should just publish long newsletters and readers can visit the website for the rest, or if we should always keep the newsletter within those limits? For this week, you get two! Please let us know what you think in the comments.</p><p>Read previous issues and Subscribe @ <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net">https://newsletter.identosphere.net</a></p> Help Wanted <p>We’ve been considering the idea of seeking help for the creation of the Identosphere newsletter and related products. There are a lot of possibilities for the growth of this publication, but only so many hours in the day, and we each have our specialties.</p><p>Every week we spend an hour or two gathering news-items from various feeds, but processing those into this newsletter can be time-consuming.<br><br>For another thing, there’s so much more news and information than there is room in this e-mail. Perhaps, every week we ought to have a public newsletter and one that just goes out to patrons.  Or maybe there is another creative solution we’ve yet to consider.</p><p>At the moment, there isn’t a ton of <a href="https://patreon.com/identosphere">cash to go around</a>, but we’re happy to compensate and open to ideas. Maybe all we need is a little help to take it to the next level.

The Contested Horizons of Digital Identity</a> <blockquote><p>I identify a series of competing logics in the debates around SSI’s emancipatory potential, which relate to four issues: (i) the neutrality of the technology, (ii) the capacities of refugees, (iii) global governance and the nation state, and (iv) new economic models for digital identity. SSI is simultaneously the potential enabler of new modes of empowerment, autonomy and data security for refugees and a means of maintaining and extending bureaucratic and commercial power.

Christie’s earliest auction catalog is dated the same month and year. Founded by Scotsman James Christie, Christie’s is, by all accounts, a very reputable auction house.</p>

Meeco is looking for self-driven software engineers to contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform.  The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph. <br><br>We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 





 About the opportunities 





 




The product team currently consists of 15 people, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting secure decentralised and cloud solutions. Our products are modular and can be implemented as a single solution (decentralised wallet) or together with key backup and secure storage. These products enable developers to build a range of applications for users and organisations to access, control and exchange identity, personal data, credentials and tokens.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several&nbsp;Elixir and Node on the backend, and Angular, NgRx, Ionic, Capacitor and&nbsp;Flutter apps on the frontend”




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code, based on many decades of experience across the team. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics, we are pragmatic and want to see positive change in the data world now – not years away. For these reasons we seek to understand the job to be done, how to layer in privacy and security and then design a mutually beneficial solution.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We do test driven development.




 





 




The following can help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 




• Developing beautiful front-end code and implementing a new service with business logic that is called from our suite of APIs




 




• Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach a high-level requirement (tasks, estimations)




 




• Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur




 




• Implementing data integrations to help users access public, private and social data




 




• Working on latest Standards implementations for distributed ledger, verified claims and self-sovereign identity




 




• Review a PR of one of your colleagues




 





 About you 





 




We are looking for someone who loves and understands how to write cross-platform mobile applications in TypeScript.




 




You’ll receive detailed designs to implement and our design team loves nothing more than developers that understand how to implement it according to the specifications. The applications we create target an inclusive audience, including: citizens, customers, patients, students, employees and decentralised enthusiasts. <br><br>If you like to see an example of the latest set of apps we created for families and children, check out <a href="https://miks-it.com/">miks-it.com</a>. These applications are communicating with (several) RESTful APIs to access, control and exchange data from our users. Oh yes, before we forget, you have to care about clean code (a lot) and be ready to learn (a lot).




 




The following should not be considered as essential requirements but will increase your chances:




 




• Our current frameworks of choice for building mobile applications are




 




◦ Angular, NgRx, Ionic and Capacitor




 




◦ Flutter




 




• Your framework of choice to build mobile applications may have evolved over time, so did ours. Having multiple experiences allows us to make better choices in the future. Tell us about your journey.




 




• Experience in building dApps, building on top of distributed ledger technologies. If you are loving Hedera Hashgraph, we should definitely talk, because we do too!




 





 




• Besides building frontend applications, we are also building back end applications (e.g. vault, keystore). Relevant back end programming experience, having a good understanding of different patterns to communicate with these services is a plus.




 




• Have a practical understanding of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography">cryptography</a> and where to use it.




 




• redux skills would be highly valued, and if you are passionate about a technology, tell us about it!




 





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming fundamentals is the most important.




 




You might have a degree in CS, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we endorse remote work. A lot of the time, you are free to work where you work best, a combination of home office or co-working space. We have offices in Adelaide, Brussels, London, Melbourne and Sydney. For these roles we would prefer for you to be based in Adelaide, Melbourne or Brussels.




 




We value people who can work independently and manager your time, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. A lot of what we are working on has not been done before, so the ability to explore, test, iterate and learn is an essential part of our culture. So we would like to iterate that asking for help is highly regarded!




 





 What we have achieved 





 




We are early pioneers in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012




 




Funding; our founder and CEO bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have a strong runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. Check out Meeco on Twitter or LinkedIn and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won nine international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands, Germany, USA for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: During COVID we launched our developer portal so our partners could keep working with us remotely and we kicked off 2021 with some really interesting projects across a range of use-cases.




 




Partners: In early 2020 we started working in partnership with <a href="https://hedera.com">Hedera Hashgrap</a>h to develop our multi purpose wallet to support decentralised identity, verified credentials, micropayments and tokens.




 





 How to apply 





 




Unfortunately due to ongoing COVID restrictions we are not able to offer visa sponsorship at this time. Therefore,  Australian applicants must already be in Australia and have permanent residency. For Belgium, you must have the necessary rights to work in the EU. <br><br>By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you have to do is contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a>




 




Priority will be given to assessing your application if you include what you like about the role, why you may want to join, any questions along with your resume.<br><br>Depending on the response it might take us a few days to get back to you, the last time we advertised we where humbled by the amazing response. Shortlisted candidates will be asked to kick-off a process, which will help us assess next steps and get you into the selection process as quickly as possible.




 




We really hope to see you soon!

<p><a href="https://www.facephi.com/en/">FacePhi</a> is starting to make in-roads in the African market. The Spanish identity provider has agreed to provide onboarding services for the Nigerian Armed Forces, which will be using the technology to help distribute pension benefits to veterans.</p>



  



<p>Moving forward, retired military personnel will be able use their smartphones to register in the pension program remotely. FacePhi’s solution will first ask veterans to take a photo of an official ID card, analyzing the characters on the surface to make sure the card is authentic. After that, users will need to take a selfie, and FacePhi will match that picture to the image on the ID.</p>



<p>Afrilight Technologies will act as FacePhi’s local integration partner for the project. The arrangement with the Nigerian Armed Forces is FacePhi’s first with a public agency in Africa, and indicates that the company is hoping to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-aims-for-international-expansion-with-e33m-in-financing/">continue its international expansion</a> and build on its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-expands-vietnam-with-pinetree-securities-partnership-041905/">successes in Asia</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-provides-biometric-onboarding-mibanco-customers-latin-america-021703/">Latin America</a>.</p>



<p>The veterans themselves will be able to access their pension benefits through the new FacePhi system. The various partners are hoping that the program will help mitigate the threat of fraud, and boost internet adoption rates in Africa in the wake of COVID-19.</p>



<p>“The use of biometric systems to access banking and financial services is becoming more and more common among senior users, as this technology allows access to digital spaces in a comfortable and very intuitive way,” said FacePhi CEO Javier Mira. “Boosting digitalization processes through biometrics has a positive social impact, as it helps to ensure that the elderly are not left behind in the use of certain services, helping to close a digital divide that is especially pronounced on the African continent.”</p>



<p>FacePhi’s technology has previously been used to facilitate <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-biometrics-enable-remote-pension-payments-argentina-092803/">pension payments for senior citizens in Argentina</a>. The company recently partnered with Revelock to offer behavioral biometrics services to its customers in the financial sector.</p>

<p><a href="https://safr.com/">SAFR</a> will be bringing its wares to next month’s <a href="https://www.iscwest.com/">ISC West</a> event in Las Vegas. The RealNetworks subsidiary will set up shop at booth #11109, where it will be showcasing a range of computer vision offerings.</p>



  



<p>Featured products include SAFR for Surveillance, SAFR Inside, and SAFR for Access Control. The former is a Video Management offering that is compatible with Genetec, Milestone, Avigion, Digifort, Panasonic, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/geutebruck-integrates-safr-into-g-core-vms-041401/">Geutebrück systems</a>, while SAFR Inside is an edge product that allows customers to process video footage on the camera itself. The utility offers support for the NVIDIA and Android platforms, and it has also been fully integrated with Axis cameras. In that regard, Axis will be conducting its own SAFR Inside demos during ISC West at booth #14051.</p>



<p>The SAFR for Access Control solution, meanwhile, uses facial recognition to enable touchless access control. The company will be highlighting the platform’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/safr-improves-passive-liveness-capabilities-with-updated-facial-recognition-system-040805/">improved Passive Liveness detection feature</a> during ISC West.</p>



<p>“SAFR has the best combination of live video performance and low bias of any facial recognition system on the market,” said SAFR VP and Computer Vision GM Brad Donaldson.&nbsp;“We’re looking forward to connecting with everyone at ISC West again to show the continued evolution of this powerful platform.”</p>



<p>SAFR’s products are able to process footage from dedicated security cameras, and from other camera-equipped IoT devices. The technology can perform facial recognition in real time, and will notify administrators if it spots someone on a watchlist. It will also create a record of access events, and send an alert if an unregistered individual tries to enter to a secure area or system.</p>



<p>Convergint Technologies recently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/convergint-offers-safr-us-customers-052101/">agreed to offer SAFR’s products</a> to its own customers in the United States. ISC West is scheduled to run from July 19-21 at the Sands Convention Center, and marks a return to in-person programming after last year’s show <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/isc-west-2020-now-virtual-event-062606/">migrated to a virtual format</a> in response to COVID-19.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/home">Juniper Research</a> is forecasting major growth in the digital identity verification market. The firm has specifically predicted that the amount of money that businesses spend on digital identity solutions will climb from $9.4 billion in 2021 to $16.7 billion in 2026.</p>



  



<p>That spend will correspond to a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-sees-1000-increase-in-selfie-authentications-during-2020-906242/">dramatic increase in the total number of identity checks</a>. Global providers will be fielding 92 billion checks by the end of the forecast period, more than doubling the 45 million figure from 2021.</p>



<p>The actual money will come primarily from banks and other financial services organizations. The financial sector is expected to account for roughly 62 percent of that $16.7 billion, with Juniper noting that finance is more heavily regulated than other industries. As a result, financial institutions will embrace digital onboarding solutions as they search for ways to improve the customer experience while still providing a high level of security.</p>



<p>“Digital-only banks have shown that fully digital Know Your Customer can work and is very engaging for the user,” said Vladimir Surovkin, one of the co-authors of Juniper’s <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report">report on the digital identity verification market</a>. “The pressure is on for traditional banks to deploy new identity verification services. Managing this transition quickly, and getting the user convenience/security balance right will determine overall success.”</p>



<p><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-saw-strongest-sales-ever-in-q1-2021-705121/">Like many other organizations</a>, Juniper pointed out that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-declares-best-sales-quarter-in-company-history-910157/">digital transformation accelerated during COVID-19,</a> since lockdowns forced businesses to adapt to a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/mastercard-report-finds-online-spending-was-up-900-billion-2020-040702/">remote work and consumer landscape</a>. However, the firm also noted that that trend was already underway before the pandemic, and therefore cannot be entirely attributed to the coronavirus. Instead, Juniper argued that the growing interest in digital identity technology speaks to the demand for better user experiences, and that businesses will increasingly need to offer a low-friction digital services in order to retain their customers.</p>



<p>Juniper has previously predicted that biometrics will be used to authorize <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/juniper-biometrics-will-cover-3-trillion-payments-by-2025-020210/">$3 trillion in payments</a> by 2025. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/juniper-tracks-growing-popularity-facial-authentication-financial-industry-041307/">Facial recognition</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/juniper-research-behavioral-biometrics-fight-e-commerce-fraud-704261/">behavioral biometrics</a> are expected to be particularly popular with financial institutions. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> has added another language to its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innovatrics-announces-digital-onboarding-toolkit-905182/">Digital Onboarding Toolkit</a> (DOT). The DOT’s optical character recognition algorithm is now able to recognize traditional Chinese characters, and can <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-explains-how-digital-onboarding-toolkit-verifies-identity-documents-042606/">verify the authenticity of identity documents</a> printed with that character set.</p>



  



<p>The Hong Kong national ID card is the first document that can be verified with the new Chinese language utility. However, Innovatrics suggested that it will be relatively easy to train the platform to support additional documents now that it has overcome the initial logistical hurdle (traditional Chinese has more than 50,000 unique characters) and can handle Chinese text.</p>



<p>The company is hoping that the news will increase the appeal of its Digital Onboarding Toolkit in the Asian market. The platform already offers <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-arabic-support-biometric-digital-onboarding-toolkit-010601/">support for Arabic</a> and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innovatrics-teaches-onboarding-toolkit-recognize-bengali-script-031603/">Bengali script</a>, which were added to the platform in January and March, respectively. Innovatrics also supports the Latin and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-cyrillic-script-nfc-support-052606/">Cyrillic alphabets</a>.</p>



<p>The complete Toolkit supplements document recognition with facial recognition to allow organizations to onboard new users remotely. The solution first asks users to take a photo of an identity document, and checks to make sure that the document has not been tampered with. It then asks users to take a selfie, and matches it to the image on the original ID.</p>



<p>Innovatrics believes that DOT can help mitigate fraud in the financial industry. The company has previously provided onboarding services for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-makes-inroads-latin-american-market-031205/">financial institutions in Latin America</a>, and for <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/slovakias-partners-group-sk-turns-innovatrics-digital-onboarding-011906/">Partners Group SK in Slovakia</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a> has partnered with <a href="https://rapidsos.com/">RapidSOS</a> to provide first responders with more information about emergency incidents. RapidSOS is the developer of an emergency response data platform that gathers data from a massive network of more than 350 million connected devices. 911 dispatchers can view that data, and pass it on to first responders so they know what to expect (and can make better decisions) before they arrive on the scene.</p>



  



<p>The partnership with VSBLTY will increase the amount of information at dispatchers’ disposal. To that end, VSBLTY will integrate its Vector software with the RapidSOS platform. Vector offers computer vision and facial recognition capabilities, and will help dispatchers distinguish victims from bystanders, suspects, and law enforcement officers. It also offers weapons detection and watchlist screening so dispatchers have a chance to warn responders about potential threats.</p>



<p>That information will supplement the data already available through the RapidSOS platform. That includes alarm data from connected buildings, in addition to health and medical data associated with 911 callers. More than 4,800 Emergency Communication Centers are currently using the RapidSOS service to guide their response operations.</p>



<p>Vector is an edge solution, so it can process video footage on the camera itself, and even lock down a smart building if weapons are detected. The platform supports license plate recognition, which can help the police during follow-up investigations.</p>



<p>“Through this partnership, Emergency Communication Centers, local law enforcement, and on-site security will directly receive critical information to verify and act upon alerts,” said VSBLTY Co-founder and CEO Jay Hutton. “Together, we are making data more actionable, and helping to protect lives and empower safer, smarter communities.”</p>



<p>VSBLTY has previously <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-vsblty-energetika-celebrate-success-mexico-city-surveillance-program-020608/">provided computer vision tech</a> for a large-scale <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-radarapp-bring-smart-city-surveillance-benito-juarez-041507/">smart city surveillance project in Mexico City</a>. More recently, the company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-ability-sign-mou-market-smart-camera-products-internationally-050307/">signed a Memorandum of Understanding</a> with Ability Enterprise to market their <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-partners-ability-enterprise-smart-camera-solution-021107/">new smart camera solution</a> to customers internationally.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Almost all enterprises have many security tools in place already, some of which are still focused on perimeters/DMZs and on hosts, such as servers and endpoints. Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools are becoming more commonplace in enterprises and SMBs. EDR tools depend on agents installed on endpoints to collect and transmit telemetry to the EDR console. EDR agents can be instructed by administrators and programmatically to respond to suspicious and malicious events, taking actions like gathering forensic evidence, terminating processes, removing malware, etc. EDR tools emerged as a second line of defense on endpoints in situations where Endpoint Protection (EPP), formerly known as Next Generation Anti-Virus, may have missed detection and prevention of execution of malware. EPP and EDR vendors have been merging and acquiring one another over the last few years, so a large part of the endpoint security market has essentially become Endpoint Protection, Detection &amp; Response (EPDR).</p>
<p>Many organizations today are also looking for security tools such as Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) that provide additional visibility and controls at the network layer. NDR tools rely on sensors on the network for gathering data about traffic in a given environment. These sensors generally plug in to taps or SPAN ports on network switches and routers. Most modern enterprises have a mix of on-premises networks and cloud-based resources to cover with NDR solutions. NDR solutions mostly focus on analysis of traffic metadata, although some can do full packet capture and a few products even do packet decryption. Like EDR, the “D” and “R” in NDR emphasize the abilities to detect malicious behavior and respond to it. Examples of NDR actions are collect forensic evidence, terminate sessions, and block traffic by IP/host/domain.</p>
 Functional overlaps 
<p>Functional overlaps exist between EPDR, NDR, and Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs). CWPPs provide malware scanning, remediation, and configuration management for IaaS instances, containers, and serverless environments.</p>
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) systems are centralized repositories that collect security telemetry and log files from many sources around an enterprise. Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) tools facilitate analysis of information in SIEMs and help orchestrate analyst responses across disparate downstream security tools.</p>
<p>XDR (eXtended Detection &amp; Response) solutions are an emerging category of security tools that are designed to consolidate and replace multiple point solutions such as Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).</p>
<p></p>
 Our view of XDR 
<p>In our definition and view, XDR must encompass endpoint, network, and cloud aspects. This means that XDR solutions must have agents for endpoints, sensors for networks, and agents for cloud instances and containers. As opposed to SIEMs, telemetry is pushed into XDR systems in real-time, not pulled from logs, which allows for real-time correlation and analysis, and therefore a reduction in time-to-detect and time-to-respond metrics. Companies conducting RFPs for XDR expect implementations of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) detection models and functions to reduce the labor needed for analysis, time-wasting false positives, as well as add value by improving anomaly detection and categorization, leading to an improved overall security posture.</p>
<p>As with SOAR solutions, XDR systems are tools that enhance security operations, and as such have consoles that are designed for deployment within Security Operations Centers (SOCs) at customer sites or Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) sites. SOAR tools prominently feature “threat hunting” interfaces. With XDR, the emphasis is on automation and continuous threat hunting, making threat hunting less of a manual activity.</p>
 XDR and SOAR: evolution or competition? 
<p>XDR and SOAR solutions are on a path toward either convergent evolution or competition, depending on the vendor. However, SOARs depend on SIEMs, and XDR solutions should be able to function somewhat independently of SIEMs. XDR systems can export relevant event data to SIEMs.</p>
<p>Though real-time detection is advantageous, we emphasize the response capabilities, because such leading-edge technologies should expand on the automation of mitigation actions. Therefore, the types of response actions available in EPDR and NDR must also be present in XDR.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced XDR use cases and solution capabilities may include active defensive measures, such as the deployment and maintenance of Distributed Deception Platforms (DDPs). DDPs are systems that are designed to simulate a variety of computing assets and environments for the purposes of drawing in would-be attackers to clearly alert IT security teams to the presence of attackers, drawing attackers away from real assets, and allowing IT security teams to study the TTPs of attackers in order to better defend against current and future attacks. DDPs therefore aid IT security teams in discovering anomalous and malicious behavior at various layers across the infrastructure.</p>

			  Mario Cámara is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>I love solving challenging problems with the help of technology to keep learning smarter ways to solve the next one. Currently, I’m settled in Spain with my family. In the past, I had brief spells in Moscow, Zurich, Edinburgh and Paris. Actually, who knows if we will move to Seattle, Vancouver, London, Shenzhen or Seville at some point in the future?</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After doing diverse things in the past, like pursuing a PhD and an MBA, I created my own startup to help companies to tap into high skilled tech professionals that might not be actively looking for a new job.</p>
<p>Although this was a fruitful learning experience, I realized that I would be more useful in putting my expertise at the service of a growing startup. That’s when the opportunity to join Tokeny popped up,&nbsp;and I’m glad I made that choice to join and to be part of the team that’s making Tokeny flourish.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s very interesting and enriching. The staff comprises multiple nationalities and extensive backgrounds. Management is approachable and very active in moving the company forward to hit new targets. However, I work mostly with the people in the tech team. Although they’re spread in several countries, there’s almost no friction coming from this. Besides that, they have high expertise that shows daily, and you can always learn new things from them. Additionally, they tend to welcome feedback on their pull requests or the product features. Overall, it’s a team that makes it significantly easier to ship great software.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love delivering products that exceed customer expectations. And I want to believe that it’s not only a saying, but I do really make that difference. Put bluntly, and as a wise person taught me: “Under promise and over deliver.”. Moreover, I also love learning about new things.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p><br>
As a firm believer in science and innovation, I can’t settle on a single dream or even a handful of them. There are still many things that humankind will achieve in the coming decades. Just to name a few: fully autonomous self-driving vehicles, flying cars, neural implants, decentralized and accessible finance, safe and clean nuclear power, hypersonic commercial flights, etc. On a personal level, I still keep some faith that, eventually, I’ll learn to play the piano.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Again, there are many things to make the world a better place. But, if focusing at a local level and, provided that high-quality education is the base of modern and advanced societies, I’d love to see and help the Andalusian universities to reach the level of top-class European ones such as Oxford, Cambridge, the Imperial College, ETH Zurich, EPF Lausanne or MIPT.</p>

Full-stack model for next generation institutional capacities A sketch for the transformation of Italy’s&nbsp;cities <p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-lockie-b294696/?originalSubdomain=uk">Sean Lockie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelica-monaco-5b086722/?originalSubdomain=it">Angelica Monaco</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://twitter.com/indy_johar">Indy Johar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joostbeunderman?lang=en">Joost Beunderman</a> and Juhee Hahm. For Italian translation, see&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">here</a></p><p>Italy, like many nations, is facing a major strategic transition. Many Italian cities are seeing a cocktail of intensifying challenges and future risks, including the brain drain of young skilled people to bigger cities and other parts of Europe; economic stagnation and aging infrastructure; poor air quality, growing heat island impacts, and increasing incidence of flooding. All this has been exacerbated by COVID, which has deeply affected Italy’s communities and economy; it has both revealed and deepened inequalities. Already, we are seeing signs of a growth in exploitative labour patterns and the deprivation of minimum rights; in terms of social and psychological distress we are seeing growing incidences in violence both in the street and domestic sphere, and a worrying increase in self-harm. Italy’s society is hurting, and it needs a deeply strategic approach to investing in the infrastructures of tomorrow.</p><p>Beyond incrementalism</p><p>The transition required is systemic — this is not an incremental or additive transition, but a fundamental one. We know, for example, climate change not an isolated crisis: it is fundamentally a symptom of a structural problem in how we govern and how our relationships in the world are governed — in terms of our relationship with the future, our relationship with the natural and material world and our relationship with each other. As the evidence of growing social divisions and the perspective of <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ degrees Celsius climate change</a> becomes more and more unmissable, we must allow ourselves to re-think a series of fundamental social, economic, human and planetary relationships to forge a thriving future for Italian cities. And with a once-in-a-generation level of capital being made available through Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), this is perhaps the best opportunity we have — which implies a huge responsibility on all of us as professionals and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic has seen levels of fiscal and policy coordination within the EU not seen before. For example, the capital to be raised to finance the Covid-19 recovery fund for fiscal stimulus packages across the EU was a collective response. The fund will be distributed over the next five years, in a mixture of grants and loans to EU countries, and direct EU spending; approximately 1/3 (€250bn) is to be spent on funding the green economy. The Commission plans to start borrowing in the markets in June of this year, and this now creates a precedent for other fundraising activities in Europe. The plan requires agreement on a new tax on goods imported into the EU from countries adhering to less aggressive CO2 emissions goals, new levies or surcharges on emissions in the transport sector, and a digital tax. The €250bn to be allocated to the green economy should provide the basis for the fiscal innovation to occur in the climate change space, e.g. to look at the feasibility of a climate change impact bond that could enable Europe to lead the way and invest in a clean, healthy and just future. All this comes on top of a very ambitious Italy-wide energy efficiency major retrofit programme called the ‘Superbonus’ scheme addressing fabric, renewable and heat source upgrades. Administered through Italy’s Revenue Agency there will be a subsidy of 110% of the installation costs paid back over only five years through tax savings. An impressive amount of organisations have been executed around this scheme involving banks, the tax department, consultancies, technical supply chains (insulation, plumbing, architecture, engineering) municipalities and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic also showed that places have to be able to transform fast, and that we need to develop this sort of institutional resilience and agility to deal with unpredictable events — so that we are not just responding reactively to crisis, but ensure our recovery measures are transformative and reduce future vulnerabilities. Milan, for example, was of the first large cities in Europe to lock down, and the city has responded with a broad set of initiatives, which included fast-track active mobility strategies, use of the home as a means of production, and schools deploying online learning at scale to address a digital divide and create more opportunity for self learning.</p><p>A multi-dimensional recovery programme</p><p>As the transformation is multidimensional, it has become very clear now that the processes to make it happen are of utmost importance. All recovery measures to be deployed in the near future need to go beyond one-dimensional quick-fixes, and instead target multiple co-benefits and synergies. For example, this includes the opportunity to leverage further the ‘superbonus’ subsidies to create an inclusive retrofit programme that addresses sustainability at street by street level. Such a retrofit programme should tackle not just the energy performance of the housing stock but the potential for greater social cohesion and long term benefits through residents generating and distributing their own energy, the enhancement of the public realm that connects the buildings, and repurposing space dedicated to the car to urban parks that allow residents to enjoy to exercise, birdlife, urban meadows and eventually community gathering (farmers markets&nbsp;etc).</p><p>In setting out such a multi-dimensional recovery programme, a first challenge relates to how we understand the interconnected and cascading risks that we face (e.g., air pollution, fuel poverty, health impacts, job losses and precariousness, lack of appropriate education and community cohesion as well as climate change). Secondly, we need to re-think how we build portfolios of mutually reinforcing interventions against such future liabilities, enabling us to set a clear directionality of the transition but be open to uncertainty and emergence of new opportunities as well as possible new crises. This also means building distributed capacity to build, iterate and learn from early interventions, to create dynamic transition portfolios that have proximity and agility to evolve with ongoing new issues, opportunities and problems and insights as they emerge. After all, we live in an age of both chronic emergency and emergence — meaning centralised, slow moving institutions are by definition not up to the&nbsp;task.</p><p>Next gen institutional capacities</p><p>In practice this means building the institutional capacity in both the public sector (municipalities), private sector (developers, energy companies etc) and civic sector to understand and act on emergence in a collaborative way. This is about fundamental institutional properties: the distributed capacity to make sense of complex data and weak signals, distributed capacity to innovate, and distributed capacity to forge new coalitions. We aren’t able to 1:1 predict what the problems are, where our greatest liabilities lie, and what the solutions might&nbsp;be.</p><p>One dimension where such institutional capacity needs are particularly urgent is innovation in maintenance. We have to radically reduce the bureaucratic and the management costs of maintaining, adapting and upgrading our existing cities as a whole if we are going to unlock the current infrastructure upkeep backlogs and unlock new value in the existing built environment. This is particularly relevant in Italy where there are many layers or control and bureaucracy which hold cities back in the procurement and government of such works. A ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ in local empowerment, accountability and simplification of procedures is essential for the country to spread its wings and take flight to new levels. Italy needs to change its mindset from “we have always done it this way” to one of “these are extraordinary times, let’s give this a go and learn from&nbsp;it”.</p><p>To get there, we need to take a value chain approach to investing. This looks at investing across value chains, such as enabling the real estate development and construction sectors to move into bio based and circular materials. Critically, such value chain transitions and deep and structural shifts need to be approached from a ‘just transition’ perspective. If we limit ourselves to point based innovations, we are going to see the consolidation of capital and wealth in the hands of the few. So recognising the SME and family-based nature of the economy in Italy, how do we invest in an inclusive, economy-wide revolution of the whole value chain, driving digitised production and whole-life-cycle performance capacity, emphasising the new skills and ways of working essential to new machine-human automation capacities?</p><p>We know that in the 21st Century, if we are going to talk about prospecting for the future, we are fundamentally operating in the domain of new machine-human capabilities. This requires the setting up of new institutional and financial infrastructures, both to crystallise what our future risks are and to integrate a more sophisticated understanding of those liabilities into how we invest in a range of human, technological and physical transition infrastructures. Our infrastructure investments have to move well beyond the familiar ‘cranes on the horizon’ — financing also the long-term capacity for companies, whole sectors and communities to be part of imagining and innovating within the transition.</p><p>For example, cities are increasingly taking seriously the need for massive investment in green infrastructure, with Milan, Turin and Bologna being among many European cities with plans to plant millions of trees. But it is impossible to build truly integrated approaches unless we have integrated e.g. flooding, heat island, health and biodiversity liabilities into the models of the utility companies that own the flood risk and the energy companies that own the capex requirements for heat island effects - integrating them with the impacts on health, and involving insurance companies across these risks or rewards, and building a collective outcome buying capacity which integrates those risks and liabilities across the public and private sector. Multiple-benefit infrastructure solutions like (peri-) urban forests can manage these risks simultaneously and produce co-beneficiary results. So the pooling of those liabilities and being able to build frameworks for companies, communities and other long-term focussed organisations to set up <a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/november-2019/heres-a-way-for-governments-to-buy-positive-outcomes/">community driven outcome buying contracts</a> to allow the investing towards collaboratively defined priorities become fundamental tools. This sort of innovation in procurement lets the public sector and communities describe the outcome they want and then leave space for new innovation to occur. We are on the cusp of seeing this innovation in some places where health authorities for example are investing in changes to the built environment because they result in say less obesity or respiratory disease or a community with reduced mental health stresses. We are seeing cities like Vienna and London starting to grapple with these systemic challenges.</p><p>The social contract for transition</p><p>What becomes apparent in all this is that Italy must invest in the citizen-level capability for innovation. We have to build citizen understanding of the transition and appetite for innovation, almost at an everyday level — it is an essential part of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">the social contract required for a legitimate transition</a>. The street level capability, the mass democratic capability to innovate is a fundamental component in this thesis. Bologna is a great example where this already starting to happen, through the Fondazione Innovazione Urbana and its “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, patient and democratic spaces for discussion at neighbourhood level. The goal is to activate on-going processes of listening, dialogue and collaboration in each neighbourhood, to bring out priorities, needs, indications and proposals, imagining shared solutions on how to regenerate and enhance spaces in the various areas of the city through public assemblies in the neighborhoods, thematic sessions and physical or on-line meetings.</p><p>Or take Ferrara, where the Climb Project has boosted active and sustainable home-to-school mobility through a mix of behavioural change, internet of things and gamification; it aims to change the attitude of children, their families and their community to embrace environmentally sustainable travel solutions by creating eco-friendly mobility habits as a fun and social experience. Local communities can use the lessons learned from the project to create a civic movement with other co-benefits too. These projects all start at a grass roots level and are seeing important levels of citizen participation.</p><p>Or take the Silk Project in Rovereto aimed at creating a cultural and economic district of silk-based activities following an integrated development approach: regeneration and reclamation of the uncultivated land; promotion of a social and sustainable agriculture project for the production of mulberry trees and silkworms, with job placements for people in difficult situations. Finally, in the circularity space there are numerous examples of innovation that are at the point of scaling in Italy. Bioplastics from grape residue in the Valdobbiadene area for example, or the numerous examples of new business models we are seeing in places like Milan around circular housing concepts, where there are developer models being refined that bring residents together to not only manage their building but to help with child care, asset sharing (mobility) and food production. These are the projects we need to find and learn from, whether to grow in scope and / or replicate, or in order to enable lessons learnt to drive systemic impact, using the recovery funds to catalyse this change and bring these new climate resilient value chains and business models to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Building lead markets in Italian&nbsp;cities</p><p>Ultimately we need a culture change in how we view such transition initiatives. If for example we invest in digitally enabled street ‘de-pavings’ creating space for micro-meadows and urban trees all across a city, and if we create new models of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">Civic AI</a> to get communities to engage with their public assets like urban meadows, allotments and other Nature-based Solutions — then we are not just making cities better and communities more resilient. By making such machine learning models open source and looking at the social network capital that builds the capacity to then retrofit whole streets and districts in an integrated way, that allows you to generate demand for the value chain innovation and regulatory innovation which builds a high value economy for the 21st Century. So it’s not just de-paving: it’s an intentional pathway to inclusive transition and new ‘lead markets’ that create sustainable jobs, livelihoods and positive place identity.</p><p>Clearly, this type of fundamental transition demands a deep reflection on and investment in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">institutional capacity fit for the 21st Century</a>. We have discussed investing in value chains, civic collaboration capacity and financial instruments like outcome buying. Another dimension is the educational investment for human development in the machine age. What are the new 21st century schools and development agenda that Italy wants to prepare for? Do we need radical new schools or universities which are transformed? Do we need a whole new area of human development infrastructure? Currently there are still several areas of the country suffering the digital divide and this is having significant consequences on the ability to attend schooling online, affecting the level of competences of future generations. There are world leading examples of AI occurring in Italy in the regions in Piemonte in Turin, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia where research centres and companies are partnering. The challenge here is to learn from the insights created for system-wide benefit, so that such innovation is shared nationally in a more evenly distributed way.</p><p>The other aspect is government acting as a lead market. Government procurement should not just be focused on efficiency but actually on purposeful creation of new lead markets through investing in and ‘buying’ innovation in key sectors. How do governments actively support the emergence of new behaviours through what they procure? Governments and cities have great potential here but there are many obstacles in practice. Civil servants get worried about the risk of failure so go with the middle ground and we miss the chance for the big innovation to occur. Alongside regulatory innovation, acting strategically in this domain is going to be&nbsp;vital.</p><p>The final dimension is building the infrastructures for regulation to be less about control oriented to one of enabling. A control orientated governance and regulatory system works in a world of predictability. But that is not the world we live in — now less than ever. So if this is the case we need not just a series of immediate regulatory adjustments enabling a green recovery, but also to create agile new ways to evolve our regulatory frameworks on an on-going basis for a complex emergent world focused on innovation and transition. This is particularly true in Italy, where a deep change in public administration is needed whether in procurement, recruitment, authorization procedures and or know-how on public-private-civic collaboration.</p><p>The PNRR offers great opportunities. But it cannot be a sticking plaster. Driving an innovative, resilient, and thriving society in the 21st Century cannot be achieved with the tools and practices of the 20th century. We must create tangible pathways towards a next generation governance system at urban level and beyond — through collaboratively building portfolios of new instruments and tools right across the domains we mention in this piece: a ‘boring revolution’ of institutional infrastructures to enable the more visible aspects of recovery and resilience in our&nbsp;cities.</p><p>If you want to find out more about this initiative contact <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> or <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">The great 200 billion Euro Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Per la versione inglese vedi&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">qui</a>.</p><p>L’Italia, come molte nazioni, sta affrontando un’importante transizione strategica. Molte città italiane stanno assistendo ad un cocktail di sfide crescenti e rischi futuri, inclusi la fuga di cervelli di giovani qualificati verso città più grandi e altre parti d’Europa; la stagnazione economica e le infrastrutture che invecchiano; la scarsa qualità dell’aria, gli effetti negativi delle isole di calore e l’aumento dell’incidenza delle inondazioni. Tutto ciò è stato aggravato dal COVID, che ha profondamente colpito le comunità e l’economia italiana rivelandone e amplificandone le disuguaglianze. I modelli di sfruttamento del lavoro con privazione dei diritti minimi si stanno diffondendo; mentre in termini di disagio sociale e psicologico stiamo assistendo a sempre più episodi di violenza sia in ambito domestico che nelle strade e ad un preoccupante aumento dell’autolesionismo soprattutto tra i giovani. La società italiana sta soffrendo.</p><p>Oltre l’incrementalismo</p><p>La transizione richiesta è sistemica: non si tratta di una transizione incrementale o aggiuntiva, ma radicale. Sappiamo, ad esempio, che il cambiamento climatico non è una crisi isolata: è fondamentalmente un sintomo di un problema strutturale nel modo in cui governiamo e in cui sono governate le nostre relazioni nel mondo: il nostro rapporto con il futuro, il nostro rapporto con la natura e il mondo materiale, il rapporto tra di noi. Man mano che le divisioni sociali e la prospettiva di un riscaldamento globale di <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ ​​gradi Celsius</a> diventano sempre più probabili, dobbiamo metterci nelle condizioni di ripensare una serie di relazioni sociali, economiche, umane e planetarie per forgiare un futuro florido e sostenibile per le nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Il Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) con la sua irripetibile dotazione di capitale, rappresenta forse la migliore opportunità che abbiamo e comporta un’enorme responsabilità per tutti noi come professionisti e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha visto livelli di coordinamento finanziario e politico all’interno dell’UE senza precedenti. Ad esempio, la raccolta di capitale per il fondo di ripresa Covid-19 per i pacchetti di stimolo fiscale in tutta l’UE ha registrato una straordinaria risposta collettiva. Il fondo sarà distribuito nei prossimi cinque anni, con una combinazione di sovvenzioni e prestiti ai paesi dell’UE e spesa diretta dell’UE; circa 1/3 (250 miliardi di euro) andrà a finanziare l’economia verde. La Commissione prevede di iniziare ad emettere titoli nel giugno di quest’anno creando un precedente a livello europeo per altre attività di raccolta fondi sui&nbsp;mercati.</p><p>Il piano richiede l’accordo su una nuova tassa sui beni importati nell’UE da paesi che perseguono obiettivi di taglio delle emissioni di CO2 meno ambiziosi, nuovi prelievi o sovrattasse sulle emissioni nel settore dei trasporti e una tassa per il settore digitale.</p><p>I 250 miliardi di euro da stanziare per l’economia verde dovrebbero fornire la base per l’innovazione finanziaria nel settore del cambiamento climatico, ad es. esaminare la fattibilità di bond legati all’impatto del cambiamento climatico per consentire all’Europa di aprire la strada agli investimenti in un futuro pulito, sano e&nbsp;giusto.</p><p>Tutto questo si aggiunge a un programma di retrofit di efficienza energetica molto ambizioso a livello nazionale, “Superbonus”, che si occupa del miglioramento dei materiali, degli impianti energetici e dell’incremento di fonti rinnovabili. Amministrato attraverso l’Agenzia delle Entrate, prevede un sussidio del 110% dei costi di ristrutturazione e installazione, che verrano rimborsati attraverso un bonus fiscale nell’arco di pochi&nbsp;anni.</p><p>Attorno a questo schema si sta mobilitando una quantità impressionante di organizzazioni come le banche, l’agenzia delle entrate, le società di consulenza fiscale, un insieme di fornitori per la parte tecnica e di realizzazione (isolamento, impianti, architettura, ingegneria, imprese edili, etc.), comuni e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha anche dimostrato che i luoghi devono essere in grado di trasformarsi rapidamente e che dobbiamo sviluppare resilienza e agilità istituzionali per affrontare eventi imprevedibili, per rispondere alle crisi non solo in modo puramente reattivo, ma garantendo che le misure di ripresa siano veramente trasformative e capaci di ridurre le vulnerabilità future.</p><p>Milano, ad esempio, è stata una delle prime grandi città in Europa a dover attuare un lockdown. La città ha risposto con un’ampia serie di iniziative, che hanno incluso la realizzazione a tempo di record di strategie di mobilità attiva, la trasformazione dell’ambiente domestico in luogo di lavoro, l’attivazione su larga scala della didattica on line facendo fronte al divario digitale e creando maggiori opportunità di autoapprendimento.</p><p>Un programma di ripresa multidimensionale</p><p>Poiché la trasformazione è multidimensionale, è molto chiaro ora che i processi per realizzarla sono della massima importanza. Tutte le misure di ripresa da implementare nel prossimo futuro devono andare oltre le soluzioni temporanee unidimensionali e mirare invece a molteplici co-benefici e sinergie. Ad esempio si potrebbero sfruttare le agevolazioni “superbonus” per creare un programma di retrofit inclusivo che porti la sostenibilità a livello di quartiere. Un tale programma di riqualificazione dovrebbe affrontare non solo il rendimento energetico del patrimonio abitativo, ma anche realizzare una maggiore coesione sociale e benefici a lungo termine attraverso la generazione e la distribuzione della energia prodotta dagli stessi residenti, la valorizzazione delle aree pubbliche che collegano gli edifici e la conversione di spazi dedicati alle auto a parchi che consentono ai residenti di praticare attività fisica, godere della natura e organizzare mercati di prossimità (prodotti agricoli&nbsp;ecc.).</p><p>Nel definire un programma di recupero multidimensionale di questo tipo, una prima sfida riguarda il modo in cui comprendiamo i rischi interconnessi che dobbiamo affrontare (ad esempio, inquinamento atmosferico, povertà energetica, impatti sulla salute, perdita di posti di lavoro e precarietà, mancanza di istruzione adeguata e coesione della comunità, cambiamento climatico).</p><p>In secondo luogo, dobbiamo ripensare a come costruire portafogli di interventi che si rafforzino a vicenda contro tali passività future, permettendoci di stabilire una chiara direzionalità della transizione ed essere aperti all’incertezza e all’emergere di nuove opportunità, nonché a possibili nuove&nbsp;crisi.</p><p>Ciò significa anche sviluppare una capacità distribuita di costruire, iterare e imparare dai primi interventi, creare portafogli di transizione dinamici, agili e capillari capaci di evolversi man mano che emergono nuove problematiche, opportunità, problemi e intuizioni&nbsp;. Viviamo infatti in un’epoca di continua comparsa di difficoltà/opportunità e crisi emergenziali e le istituzioni centralizzate si muovono lentamente e non sono, per definizione, all’altezza del&nbsp;compito.</p><p>Le capacità istituzionali di prossima generazione</p><p>In pratica questo significa costruire la capacità istituzionale di comprendere e agire sull’emergenza in modo collaborativo sia nel settore pubblico (comuni), nel settore privato (costruttori, società energetiche, ecc.) che nella società civile. Si tratta di proprietà istituzionali fondamentali: la capacità distribuita di dare un senso a dati complessi e segnali deboli, capacità distribuita di innovare e la capacità distribuita di creare nuove coalizioni. Non siamo in grado di prevedere 1:1 quali sono i problemi, quali sono le nostre maggiori responsabilità e quali potrebbero essere le soluzioni.</p><p>Una dimensione in cui tali esigenze di capacità istituzionale sono particolarmente urgenti è l’innovazione nella manutenzione. Dobbiamo ridurre radicalmente i costi burocratici e di gestione della manutenzione, dell’adattamento e del miglioramento delle nostre città nel loro complesso se vogliamo recuperare l’arretratezza nella manutenzione delle infrastrutture e liberare nuovo valore dell’ambiente costruito esistente. Ciò è particolarmente rilevante in Italia, dove ci sono molti livelli di controllo e di burocrazia che frenano le città nell’approvvigionamento e nella gestione di tali lavori. Una ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ (una ‘rivoluzione noiosa’) nell’empowerment locale, nella responsabilità e nella semplificazione delle procedure è essenziale affinché il paese dispieghi le ali e prenda il volo. L’Italia ha bisogno di cambiare mentalità da “abbiamo sempre fatto così” a “questi sono tempi straordinari, proviamo e impariamo ”.</p><p>Per arrivarci dobbiamo adottare un approccio all’investimento a livello di filiere / catene di valore, che presuppone investimenti su varie filiere produttive, come ad esempio quelli necessari per supportare il passaggio a bio materiali e circolarità nei settori dello sviluppo immobiliare e dell’edilizia&nbsp;. È cruciale che cambiamenti profondi e strutturali siano affrontati assicurando una “transizione giusta”. Se ci limitiamo a innovazioni puntuali, vedremo il consolidamento del capitale e della ricchezza nelle mani di pochi. Quindi, riconoscendo il ruolo delle PMI e della natura familistica dell’economia italiana, come possiamo investire in una rivoluzione inclusiva dell’intera catena del valore, spingendo la produzione digitalizzata e la capacità di rendimento dell’intero ciclo di vita, enfatizzando le nuove competenze e modi di lavorare essenziali per la moderna automazione uomo-macchina?</p><p>Sappiamo che nel 21° secolo, se vogliamo parlare di prospettive per il futuro, operiamo fondamentalmente nel dominio delle nuove capacità uomo-macchina. Ciò richiede la creazione di nuove infrastrutture istituzionali e finanziarie, sia per cristallizzare i rischi futuri sia per integrare una comprensione più sofisticata di tali responsabilità con il modo in cui investiamo in infrastrutture umane, tecnologiche e fisiche per la transizione. I nostri investimenti in infrastrutture devono andare ben oltre le familiari “gru all’orizzonte”, finanziando anche la capacità a lungo termine di aziende, di interi settori e della comunità di essere soggetti attivi della transizione, portando ciascuno immaginazione e innovazione.</p><p>Ad esempio, le città stanno prendendo sempre più in considerazione la necessità di massicci investimenti in infrastrutture verdi come Milano, Torino o Bologna, tra le tante città europee che si sono dotate di piani di forestazione urbana da milioni di alberi. Ma è impossibile costruire approcci veramente integrati senza considerare le inondazioni, le isole di calore e la biodiversità, come fattori essenziali nei modelli delle società di servizi e multiutilities che gestiscono i rischi e gli investimenti per farvi fronte. Questi a loro volta devono andare di pari passo con la valutazione dei rischi sulla salute, il coinvolgimento del mondo assicurativo e la costruzione di una capacità collettiva di acquisto basata sui risultati (outcomes based contracts) che integra tali rischi e responsabilità nel settore pubblico e&nbsp;privato.</p><p>Le soluzioni infrastrutturali multi-benefici come le foreste (peri-) urbane possono gestire questi rischi simultaneamente e produrre risultati per più beneficiari. Quindi la condivisione di tali responsabilità e la creazione di un quadro di riferimento per aziende, comunità e altre organizzazioni per i contratti di acquisto basati sui risultati (Outcomes Based Contracts),diventano strumenti fondamentali per dare agli investimenti priorità definite in modo collaborativo.</p><p>Questo tipo di innovazione negli appalti consente al settore pubblico e alle comunità di descrivere il risultato che desiderano e quindi di lasciare spazio a nuove innovazioni. Stiamo iniziando a vedere sperimentazioni di questi tipo in alcuni luoghi in cui le autorità sanitarie, ad esempio, stanno investendo in cambiamenti all’ambiente costruito perché si traducono in meno obesità, meno malattie respiratorie o meno stress per la salute mentale. Città come Vienna e Londra stanno iniziando ad affrontare queste sfide sistemiche.</p><p>Il contratto sociale per la transizione</p><p>Ciò che diventa evidente in tutto questo è che l’Italia deve investire nella capacità di innovazione a livello di singolo cittadino. Dobbiamo costruire nei cittadini la comprensione della transizione e la voglia di innovazione, quasi a livello quotidiano: è una parte essenziale del <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">contratto sociale necessario per una transizione legittima</a>. La capacità a livello di strada o quartiere, la capacità democratica di massa di innovare è una componente fondamentale di questa tesi. Bologna è un ottimo esempio in cui questo sta già iniziando a succedere, attraverso la Fondazione Innovazione Urbana e i suoi “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, spazi pazienti e democratici di confronto a livello di quartiere. L’obiettivo è attivare processi continui di ascolto, dialogo e collaborazione in ogni quartiere, per far emergere priorità, bisogni, indicazioni e proposte, immaginando soluzioni condivise su come rigenerare e valorizzare gli spazi nei vari ambiti della città attraverso assemblee pubbliche nei quartieri, sessioni tematiche e incontri fisici o&nbsp;on-line.</p><p>Oppure Ferrara, dove il progetto Climb ha promosso la mobilità casa-scuola attiva e sostenibile attraverso un mix di cambiamento comportamentale, internet delle cose e gamification; il progetto mira a cambiare l’atteggiamento dei bambini, delle loro famiglie e della loro comunità ed abbracciare soluzioni di viaggio eco-sostenibili creando abitudini di mobilità eco-compatibili come un’esperienza divertente e sociale. Le comunità locali possono utilizzare le lezioni apprese dal progetto per creare un movimento civico che porta anche ad altri benefici collaterali. Tutti questi progetti iniziano dal basso e hanno portato a importanti livelli di partecipazione dei cittadini.</p><p>Oppure si pensi al Progetto Seta di Rovereto volto a creare un distretto culturale ed economico delle attività seriche secondo un approccio di sviluppo integrato: rigenerazione e bonifica dei terreni incolti; promozione di un progetto di agricoltura sociale e sostenibile per la produzione di gelsi e bachi da seta, con inserimento lavorativo di persone in situazioni difficili.</p><p>Infine, sul tema della circolarità ci sono numerosi casi di innovazione che si stanno sempre più diffondendo in Italia. Bioplastiche da residui d’uva nella Valdobbiadene, i numerosi esempi di nuovi modelli di business che stiamo vedendo in luoghi come Milano attorno a concetti abitativi circolari, dove si stanno affinando modelli di sviluppo che riuniscono i residenti per aiutare con la cura dei bambini, la condivisione delle risorse (mobilità) e la produzione alimentare. Questi sono i progetti da cui imparare, sia per ampliarne la portata e / o replicarli, sia per consentire alle lezioni apprese di guidare l’impatto sistemico, utilizzando i fondi per la ripresa per catalizzare questo cambiamento e portare queste nuove filiere e modelli di business climaticamente resilienti a&nbsp;mercato.</p><p>Costruire mercati guida nelle città&nbsp;Italiane</p><p>Infine, abbiamo bisogno di un cambiamento culturale nel modo in cui consideriamo tali iniziative di transizione. Se, ad esempio, investiamo nella de-pavimentazione stradale supportata dall’uso di strumenti digitali creando spazio per microprati urbani e alberi in tutta la città, e se creiamo nuovi modelli di <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">intelligenza artificiale civica</a> per convincere le comunità a impegnarsi su beni pubblici come i prati urbani, terreni ad uso pubblico e altri interventi naturali, stiamo facendo di più che migliorare le città e territori più resilienti.</p><p>Rendere open source tali modelli di machine learning e tenere in conto il valore dei social network che creano la capacità di riqualificare intere strade e quartieri in modo integrato, consente di generare domanda di innovazione di filiera e normativa e costruire un’ecoonomia ad alto valore aggiunto nel 21° secolo. Quindi non si tratta solo di de-pavimentazione: è un percorso intenzionale verso una transizione inclusiva e nuovi “mercati guida” che creano posti di lavoro sostenibili, mezzi di sussistenza e identità positiva del&nbsp;luogo.</p><p>Chiaramente, questo tipo di transizione radicale richiede una profonda riflessione e un investimento in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">capacità istituzionali adatte al 21° secolo</a>. Abbiamo parlato degli investimenti in catene del valore, di capacità di collaborazione civica e di strumenti finanziari come gli Outcomes Based Contracts. Un’altra dimensione è l’investimento educativo per lo sviluppo umano nell’era dell’automazione.</p><p>Quali sono le nuove scuole del 21° secolo e il programma di sviluppo a cui l’Italia vuole prepararsi? Abbiamo bisogno di nuove scuole o università? Abbiamo bisogno di infrastrutture completamente nuove per lo sviluppo&nbsp;umano?</p><p>Attualmente sono ancora diverse le aree del Paese che soffrono il digital divide e questo ha avuto conseguenze significative sulla capacità di frequentare la scuola online, incidendo sul livello di competenze delle generazioni future.</p><p>Ci sono esempi di leader mondiali di AI in Italia, a Torino, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia, dove i centri di ricerca e le aziende stanno collaborando. La sfida qui è imparare dalle conoscenze generate estendendone i benefici a livello di sistema, condividere l’innovazione a livello nazionale e distribuirla più uniformemente.</p><p>Un altro aspetto importante è relativo al ruolo che hanno i governi nel guidare il mercato. Gli appalti pubblici non dovrebbero concentrarsi solo sull’efficienza, ma anche sulla creazione mirata di nuovi mercati guida attraverso l’investimento e l’”acquisto” di innovazione in settori chiave. In che modo i governi sostengono attivamente l’emergere di nuovi comportamenti attraverso ciò che acquistano? I governi e le città hanno un grande potenziale, ma nella pratica ci sono molti ostacoli. I dipendenti pubblici si preoccupano del rischio di errore, si adotta una via di mezzo e si perde l’occasione che si realizzino grandi innovazioni. L’’innovazione normativa è uno degli strumenti per attuare una strategia sistemica e trasformativa.</p><p>La dimensione finale è relativa alla costruzione di infrastrutture affinché la regolamentazione sia meno orientata al controllo e più orientata all’abilitazione. Un sistema di governance e regolamentazione orientato al controllo funziona in un mondo di prevedibilità. Ma questo non è il mondo in cui viviamo, ora meno che mai. Quindi, se questo è il caso, non abbiamo bisogno solo di una serie di aggiustamenti normativi immediati che consentano una ripresa verde, ma anche di creare nuovi modi agili per far evolvere i nostri quadri normativi su base permanente per un mondo complesso incentrato sull’innovazione e la transizione. Ciò è particolarmente vero in Italia, dove è necessario un profondo cambiamento nella pubblica amministrazione negli appalti, nelle assunzioni, nelle procedure di autorizzazione e / o nel know-how sulla collaborazione pubblico-privato-cittadino.</p><p>Il PNRR offre grandi opportunità. Ma non può essere un cerotto. Non si può guidare una società innovativa, resiliente e florida nel 21° secolo con gli strumenti e le pratiche del 20° secolo. Dobbiamo creare percorsi tangibili verso un sistema di governance di prossima generazione a livello urbano e oltre, attraverso la costruzione collaborativa di portafogli di nuovi strumenti e di souluzioni come quelle menzionate in questo articolo: una ‘boring revolution’ delle infrastrutture istituzionali per abilitare e valorizzare le componenti di resilienza e ripresa nelle nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Se sei interessato a continuare la conversazione, contattaci <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> o <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">Un piano da oltre 200 miliardi</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A case study of using Fission's UCAN to power lightweight, verifiable credentials for discounts, offers, and other deals between businesses on the web.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>How do you coordinate among many business units in one company, or with many independent businesses across the web? Fission's UCAN approach makes for lightweight, verifiable credentials that can help businesses coordinate without tight integration or coordination ahead of time. </p> "At a Doughnut Shop Near You!" <p>Let's say that you've recently realized your lifelong dream to open an independent doughnut shop. To welcome you to the neighbourhood, the coffee shop next door wants to run a promotion to drive awareness of both businesses (what's better than coffee and a doughnut, right?) If someone buys a cruller from you, the coffee shop will give the them a brew coffee at half price.</p><p>To keep things simple, customers only need to show a receipt from your shop issued in the last 24 hours at the coffee shop. To prevent them from being claimed multiple times, the cafe will track the receipt ID in their system. Non-coffee drinking customers can hand off their doughnut receipts to their friends, who gratefully take the 50% off, and drives even more business to the area. Foot traffic is up, and profits soar.</p><p>Time goes on, and this arrangement is working so well that the other shops in the area want to also offer collaborative deals. They want to do all kinds of things: some keep the single-use deal offer, but others want to offer permanent discounts to members of their co-op, over different time periods, or recurring offers (e.g. "every Friday").</p><p>You could absolutely create a coordinated system with a central database for the entire neighbourhood, but that shows everyone how many sales are being done at the other stores, and requires ongoing maintenance. You want to offer specials and deals without coordinating with the entire business association! You keep the system that's been working: record the receipt IDs, and leave it up to each retailer how they want to run their offers.</p> The Online Equivalent <p>The above story not only sounds reasonable, but is done in real life with physical receipts. It's ground-up, requires little coordination, has no service outages, and anyone can participate. No one has to ask the doughnut shop if they are allowed to use their receipts, and no one is maintaining a complex system of rules for these offers.</p><p>Historically, doing this online has been less straightforward. Because permissions are done per company, offering a discount code requires coordination between at least two teams: the doughnut shop in the above story suddenly needs to either:</p>  Know all of the discount codes for all of the participating shops, or  Register the user ID as being eligible for deals, and wire up the two company's back-ends  <p>These both work, but they depend on a high level of coordination, and rules to be maintained across systems. They're permissioned, and top-down. There must be a simpler way, closer to the bottom-up version from our doughnut shop story, right?</p> Enter the UCAN <p>At Fission, we've developed a version of distributed auth called UCAN:</p><blockquote>User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are a way of doing authorization where users are fully in control. OAuth is designed for a centralized world, UCAN is the distributed user controlled version.<br><br>– <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/auth-without-backend/">Fission blog: UCAN: Authorizing Users without a Backend</a></blockquote><p>As well as being like a distributed variant of OAuth, UCANs are also stateless by default ("REST for auth"), so it continues to work client-side, P2P, and even offline.</p><p>UCANs are used anywhere that we need to authorize a user to perform side-effects: time-based expiry, rights delegation, authorized access, writing to a database, and so on. Fission is a platform that helps people create apps, so we made it extensible: it can support arbitrary use cases as long as they're well understood by the issuer and verifier.</p><p>It turns out that UCANs are able to fully support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credential</a> use cases, in a different format, with the added flexibility of delegation. This makes them work much like the receipts in the doughnut shop story, thanks to the following properties:</p>  Permissionless —&nbsp;anyone can accept UCANs issued without bothering you  Bearer Credential —&nbsp;you only need the UCAN itself (like a receipt)  Delegable — can be passed around to friends, and prove that they're allowed  Non-fungible — uniquely identifiable, even when delegated   Use Case: Decentralized Coordination <p>We have been exploring use cases with a few teams, including a Fortune 500 publishing company. They have many properties under their umbrella, and collaborate with many third parties to offer perks to their subscribers. Like many companies offering running at scale today, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">solved for team agility with microservices</a> — each team can move their publications forward independently. Users have a single account across publications, and so all logins and billing get funnelled through the auth service.</p> Internal Decentralized Coordination <p>If you have ever read a physical magazine, you'll be familiar with their leaflets enticing you to sign up for their other publications and partners. You typically mail the leaflet that's already prefilled with your account number back to the publisher. How would we replicate these offers digitally?</p><p>The centralized auth server works well, but that auth server is a both a technical and team bottleneck: if Publication A wants to give a trial offer for Publication B, they need to encode this logic directly in the auth server. The auth and billing teams are suddenly responsible for maintaining the complex rules across all teams' marketing deals. Teams A and B now have a hard dependency on the roadmap of the auth team, which is also responsible for servicing all of the other teams.</p><p>By placing all the information needed to describe and validate an offer right in the token, teams can ship independently.</p> Easy Third-Party Integration <p>The same applies to teams outside the company: anyone with a valid credential can be used as authorized proof that you have an account, despite having totally separate auth systems. It can be as simple as signing up with the same email that's in the credential, or having a challenge code signed into the UCAN chain.</p><p>What this can't tell you statelessly is that the holder is currently a subscriber, only that they were when the credential was made. For this reason, these credentials generally have an expiration date. They can absolutely be made stateful by requiring a lookup — it's always easier to go that direction than from stateful to stateless —&nbsp;but in our experience it's not required for the 95% use case.</p><p>What this enables is that business and marketing teams can make discounts, offers, and other specialized deals anywhere, with any company, with low effort and without developer coordination overhead, while still having verifiable credentials, and without sharing more than a single fact about users.</p> Contemporaries <p>It turns out that it's not just us! This pattern is being picked up elsewhere, too.</p> Google Macaroons <p>Until fairly recently, Google had a similar centralized auth setup as the publishing company. Being at Google scale means that their auth servers were dealing with an enormous volume for logins and auth across Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, Google Docs, Stadia, and so on. To make this scale better, they developed the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/macaroons-resources/527">Macaroons</a> system to delegate auth responsibilities to the individual services, which still remaining interoperable with a single account.</p><p>In many ways, UCANs are like Macaroons taken to their logical conclusion: they fully decentralize auth, are stateless by default, and work well permissionlessly across teams.</p> Passport <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenThompson">Ben Thompson</a> of the excellent <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> has recently released <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/passport/">Passport</a>, which is also aimed at a subset of the problem space. From the linked article:</p><blockquote>The second reason to build Passport is to provide a better experience &nbsp;for my subscribers. One of the downsides of relying on a menagerie of &nbsp;different services is that there were both more rough edges exposed to &nbsp;users, and also an inability to provide more personalized offerings. &nbsp;Passport is an improvement on both fronts.</blockquote><p>We had a number of people send us this article, saying that it reminded them of how Fission worked. Definitely, these are the types of use cases that we think can be created and enabled across the web as an open, interoperable standard. And some of it crosses into the work we're doing as <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/fission-demo-day-may-2021/">part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, too.</p><p>It feels like this idea's time has come!</p> Your Turn <p>Interested in implementing UCANs to coordinate offers? Have a use case we haven't thought of? Want to poke holes in the whole concept? We'd love to hear from you!</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/borismann">Book a time in our calendar</a>, or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by our Discord chat</a> with any further questions.</p><p>You can find all the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/user-controlled-authorization-networks-ucan-resources/1122">collected UCAN resources in our developer forum »</a></p>

<p>We’re excited to announce that Dock’s mainnet will transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT.</p><p>As discussed in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-testnet-is-now-live/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=docks_proof_of_stake_mainnet_will_launch_on_july_7th">earlier blog post</a>, this transition will further decentralize the Dock blockchain by basing validator selection on the amount of tokens staked by validators and token holders, and introducing a new governance structure that allows anyone with Dock tokens to vote on proposed changes to the network.</p><p>This transition also comes with a change in the network’s consensus algorithm, from Aura to BABE (you can read more about these algorithms <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/consensus">here</a>), and this will require starting a new chain that runs the BABE algorithm. However, we’re taking the following steps to minimize the impact of creating a new chain on our network users:</p>  The new chain’s genesis block will preserve the state (accounts with balances, DIDs, schemas, etc.) of the existing Proof of Authority (PoA) mainnet.  We will retain the history of the PoA mainnet blocks and have it publicly available on a separate explorer, whose link will be shared soon after the new chain is launched.  <p>The upgrade to PoS will involve stopping the block production on the existing PoA mainnet, exporting the state of the PoA network, and starting the new PoS chain that preserves the PoA network’s state. This process will begin at 10am GMT on July 7th, and will take around 3 hours, during which transactions will not be possible. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused by this, but we're sure you’ll agree that the benefits outweigh the disruption.</p><p>In the coming days we’ll publish more detailed information on how token holders can participate in the new network, and keep the community updated on our progress in taking this important step!</p>

Natasha, a woman driver receiving a client request on her phone in Nairobi, Kenya. Photo credit: Natasha (driver).<blockquote>“Digital channels are actually the lifesaver when it comes to these challenges females&nbsp;face.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Lizzie, 24, freelancer and research participant</blockquote><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Qhala and Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will work to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young women’s experiences working or selling through online platforms in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> Why this research&nbsp;now? <p>There is growing conversation on how platformization (broadly, the use of digital technologies to get work or sell) has increased access to work and markets for young women. Despite consistent calls for gender equity and <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2016/leaving-no-one-behind">narrowing</a> the gender gap worldwide, in many emerging markets, such as Kenya, there is much more to learn about how platforms impact women’s lives, especially during and after COVID-19.</p><p>COVID-19 deprived people of sources of income and led to the closure of businesses, vending sites, and marketplaces, and women were among the <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_women_9_apr_2020_updated.pdf">worst</a> affected. The pandemic and its effects on livelihoods emerge in the context of global <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_771749.pdf">findings</a> by ILO that a majority of workers on digital labor platforms are highly educated and male. How can women compete in this economic sphere dominated and enabled by men? Understanding the experience of platform livelihoods from women’s perspective is key to identifying the enablers, barriers, opportunities, and challenges for women as they strive to get platform work during and after the pandemic.</p><p>This research builds on Qhala and Caribou Digital’s previous work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a>, which explores the effect of “platformatization” on different livelihoods for Kenyan youth. Through an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">extensive literature review</a>, Platform Livelihoods describes in detail the experiences of youth workers in farming, creative sectors, logistics (motorcycle drivers), and small businesses. (The full report is in publication; frameworks and the gender-specific literature review can be found <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender">here</a>). Through interviews with workers, the differences between male and female youth economic opportunities and participation became clear. This includes <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/access-to-work-is-there-work-for-those-who-want-it/">access</a> (access to capital, freedom of movement, devices, and safety), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/flexibility/">flexibility</a> (juggling productive and reproductive roles and responsibilities for women), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/earnings/">earnings</a> (reflecting a difference in how skills are valued their skill is based on gender) and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/objectivity-professionalism/">professionalism</a> (societal perception about what kinds of jobs or roles women and men are best suited for). Milly is an onion farmer in Kajiado County. Her quote below illustrates the complexity of female Kenyan gig worker experiences:</p><blockquote>“Yes of course there is always that — a little bit of male chauvinism around. I won’t lie. There is a lot of sexism that is around. But there is also the advantage of the fact that you are a woman that people will easily believe you or trust in you. You know? So you look at it in both ways. It’s an advantage sometimes and sometimes a disadvantage. Yeah. But I think it has worked for me rather than it has worked against me.” — Milly, 26, Farmer, (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>Women participants (especially in the creative sectors) mentioned that there is sexism. For example, in the music and artistic industries, women face the expectation to sell their products cheaper than men or face harassment:</p><blockquote>“There are people who are going to take advantage of you. They come to you with other intentions, not businesswise.” — Lynn, 25, Visual Artist (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>The gig sector is known for its flexibility and earning potential. However, with stiff competition emerging in the platform economy, will women be able to thrive and succeed in this sector, in terms of earnings and finding opportunities? Further, women were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Some were out of work. Others considered a career change and ventured into the platform economy. Understanding women’s economic participation experiences in the gig economy is thus necessary to generate evidence to describe the enablers and barriers including coping mechanisms, and then inform gender policy and program considerations to improve livelihoods through platformatization.</p> About the&nbsp;research <p>The questions we will ask in our gender-focused Kenya research will be informed by our initial global findings and gender, work, and platformatization. From the Platform Livelihoods literature review, sectoral reports on <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24732/w24732.pdf">ride-hailing</a> platforms outline notable differences in wages, attributed to experience on the platform, driving experience, choice of where to work and live, as well as safety issues as they carry out the work. There are also notable differences for women freelancers when bidding for work. Foong et al. (2018) found that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274322">women bid less</a> than men and as a result have to bid for more work to <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=527000067124025066094116074070107108039003024042071075093072121088117122097095002067114102007027106035006118100121071013027083005082039040022084028076126102024076010057077009093030069067114126083085115085011092008094101027115097072008067001006102100001&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">compensate</a> for this disparity in earnings.</p><p>Although women dominate the trade and services sectors, female gig workers allude to the skewed power dynamics that privilege clients over workers. (It is worth noting that men may also experience the same, and some platform economy critics point out that we talk more about women and platforms than men and platforms). These sectors are also heavily <a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">dependent</a> on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64697-4_7">ratings</a>; many young women report wanting more bargaining power in terms of the jobs they bid for, time put in the work, and the quality of&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“Let’s say I have been booked for five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. It will be a big house that does not even tally with those five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] but the client expects me to finish that job, so I am forced to add hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. The client will be putting pressure on me to work fast, but if I work fast, I will get a bad rating attributed to not cleaning properly as the job was rushed. There is a serious problem there.” — Faheema, FGD participant, Cape Town (<a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">Hunt et al</a>.,&nbsp;2019)</blockquote><p>A gender analysis of the platform economy is therefore timely to assess the enabling factors of and barriers to economic participation by young women in Kenya, especially in the informal sector. Notably, women’s involvement in the informal sector has been increasing, particularly in the platform economy, given its potential for women’s economic opportunities and participation for empowerment. By articulating the supports, barriers, and risks associated with the platform economy, this study will provide key learnings and understanding to address inequalities that may challenge young women’s economic participation. This study will begin in Kenya, followed by complementary research in Ghana (with the <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a>) and Nigeria (with <a href="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/">Lagos Business School</a> and <a href="https://v4w.org/">Value for Women</a>). The sample population is young women aged 18–35 years from rural and urban Kenya working on the gig/ platform economy (with parallel populations in Ghana and Nigeria).</p> Young women turn to digital platforms in&nbsp;Kenya A visual artist posting her art work on Instagram. Photo courtesy of Wanja (Visual&nbsp;Artist).<p>Digital platforms encompass social media too. With a <a href="https://kenyanwallstreet.com/digital-gig-economys-potential-to-solve-youth-unemployment.">rapidly expanding</a> youth population and limited opportunities for formal employment, Kenya’s workforce is shifting towards the informal sector which offers endless economic opportunities. The informal sector in Kenya has grown exponentially in the last two decades and presents innumerable opportunities for youth and women. For example, in several <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/98644.html">African countries</a> the employment contribution of the informal sector is estimated at approximately 80% for non-agricultural jobs.</p><p>Within the informal sector, women account for a disproportionate percentage of workers from street vendors, to domestic workers, subsistence farmers, and seasonal agricultural workers. These economic opportunities are often labor intensive, low-income, short-term unsecured work characterized by informality without proper structures and guidelines for operations. However, what we have seen in Kenya is that while digital companies have tried their hand in these sectors due to the abundance of workers, many initiatives for “platformatizing” informal work have not taken off due to the reliance of a trust based system, where clients prefer referrals from their closed networks/circles. For example, domestic help is more likely to be sought through a friend in a one-on-one message or closed WhatsApp group than contracted through a platform.</p><p>Beyond this, however, other types of work are thriving online. Platforms are capitalizing on the economic potential of the informal sector to create marketplaces for buyers and sellers, or clients and independent contractors. As we begin interviews, three primary topics are of interest: COVID-19 and its effects, the influence of offline gender norms, and policy regulations in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> The effect of&nbsp;COVID-19 <blockquote>“It affected us because most of our clients were employed through some offices so the offices when they closed, we lost some clients, we had some losses.” — Pauline, 21, MSE (Food&nbsp;Vendor)</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the <a href="https://rstmh.org/news-blog/news/the-evolution-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-kenya">onset of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> informal sector economic opportunities easily available for youth and women in Kenya were the worst hit as containment measures and health directives such as social distancing, <a href="https://techweez.com/2020/03/27/uber-kenya-suspends-night-pickups-due-to-curfew/">restricted movement</a>, and lockdown brought businesses to an impromptu standstill, with some eventually <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/11/ride-hailing-startup-safeboda-quits-kenya-citing-impact-of-covid-19/">shutting</a>&nbsp;down.</p><p>COVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing problems, especially for women, <a href="https://data.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/COVID-19%20Gender%20Assessment%20-PopularVersion.pdf">most of whom</a> lost jobs or business and could no longer work for pay after COVID-19. There was also an increased burden of work, including unpaid care and domestic&nbsp;work.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/blog/covid-19-gig-workers-social-protection">left workers</a> on their own. Some report <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/covid-19-exposes-risks-and-opportunities-kenyas-gig-economy">cutting back</a> on non-food items and reducing their number of meals to cope with decreased income. The number of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/08/tackling-kenyas-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-crisis">domestic violence</a> cases attributed to COVID-19 increased. Some sectors, on the other hand, found <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">new success</a> with an upsurge of <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001365681/boon-for-delivery-apps-as-city-eateries-shut-on-virus-fears">demand</a>, for instance, <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2020/05/sendy-launches-a-home-delivery-solution-to-help-flatten-the-curve/">deliveries</a>, food industry, pharmaceutical corporations, cleaning companies, and online&nbsp;work.</p> Offline gender&nbsp;patterns <p>Social norms and perceived women’s roles still limit women’s engagement in the platform economy. In the previous Platform Livelihoods study (study to be published), each of the four sectors displayed long-standing dynamics. For instance, in logistics, female drivers are scarce and are seen as courageous for taking up the&nbsp;job.</p><blockquote>“[People tell me] Madam, congrats. You are doing work that even most men can’t do.” — Brenda, 29, Motorcycle Rider</blockquote><p>However, it does seem to be the case that young Kenyan women are successfully navigating social commerce and even social agriculture (using social media platforms to buy and sell produce). This demonstrates that there may be new barriers to be confronted, challenged, or changed. Women are faced with formal and informal structural barriers manifested in the perceptions of the work they do. For instance, societal bias to what work is decent: if educated e.g with certain academic qualifications, family may not understand why a worker is doing that work as opposed to looking for more formal employment or working during late hours for married women may be shunned. It is key to understand the role of actors who may enable or hinder women’s growth and development. These could be peers, spouses, and sometimes family members like parents or siblings.</p><p>While women engage in the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/why-women-hold-the-keys-to-africas-future/">informal sector</a> that is labor intensive and time-consuming, women still have to fulfill their traditional roles which then means they have a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24738395/Gender_planning_in_the_third_world_Meeting_practical_and_strategic_gender_needs">triple burden of work</a>. Women’s workload often includes the unmeasured, unpaid domestic work demanded by their reproductive and productive roles. Further, the informal arrangements in informal sector operations subsequently limit women from fully accessing benefits and entitlements of labor engagement. For instance, working without clear human resource laws that govern the workers time, level of engagement, working conditions and negotiated pay.</p><p>According to Kenya’s gender mobile access <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSMA-Connected-Women-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2019.pdf">outlook</a>, over 82% of women own a mobile phone, but only 28% of these have access to mobile internet. Furthermore, women are significantly disadvantaged in accessing credit, land, or financial products, which prevents opportunities for them to start a company or make a living by managing&nbsp;assets.</p> Taxation, women, and platform work in&nbsp;Kenya <p>In 2020, the Kenyan government launched COVID-focused fiscal, monetary, and social insurance policies to <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/kenya-tax-developments-in-response-to-covid-19.html">moderate the impact of COVID-19, such as tax exemptions</a>. However, these policies <a href="https://www.fes.de/referat-afrika/neuigkeiten/how-the-pandemic-is-affecting-the-informal-sector-in-kenya">hardly benefit those in the informal sector</a>, where a large percentage of young women work. Additionally, for increased revenue collection, the government is now targeting <a href="https://www.bmmusau.com/electronic-commerce-law-with-a-special-emphasis-on-the-kenya-legal-tax-and-regulatory-challenges/">emerging e-commerce, which includes online business for tax returns</a>, yet more young Kenyan women are increasingly turning to this sector for work. <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/income-tax-gender-discrimination">Empirically</a>, when taxation is linked to labor supply, women’s labor supply compared to that of men is more responsive to their after-tax wage. With a reduction of taxes, the participation of women increases. The government tax on e-commerce coupled with the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic effects portend serious economic, social, and security consequences for young&nbsp;women.</p><p>These barriers in the informal sector notwithstanding, <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-are-kenyas-youth-experiencing-gig-economy">young women</a> continue to strive to source incomes from available opportunities. For those who can access and navigate digital technologies, online platforms present new<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/"> business lines and shifts in livelihoods</a>, especially in the gig economy, namely: platform work, small and medium enterprise, logistics, farming, and creatives.</p><p>There could be a reprieve for Kenyans on the digital tax with a <a href="https://citizentv.co.ke/business/relief-for-kenyans-in-digital-service-tax-waiver-11466752/">proposed</a> 2021 finance bill that will instead tax only non-residents or foreigners as opposed to local businesses. However, in foreign platforms this cost is passed down to users, and will impact overall earnings of anyone working online. For instance, UpWork will add the Digital Service Tax on services provided through their platform, and AWS (Amazon Web Services) will pass those extra costs to platform providers.</p>Caption: Information on the Digital Service Tax. Courtesy of Kenya Revenue Authority <a href="https://www.kra.go.ke/images/publications/Brochure--Digital-Service-Tax--final.pdf">KRA</a> The upcoming research&nbsp;process <p>As more women join the platform economy, they will have to overcome pre-existing barriers to participation, including offline gender patterns, new policies that make it harder to do business, and the effects of the pandemic on earnings and employment. From this study, then, there is a need to further explore and detail the gender dynamics in the platform economy. Qhala is thus setting out to upscale from the initial 2020 study and conduct in-depth research to provide detailed insights into gender and platform work in Kenya. The study is anchored in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">Cornwall’s women’s empowerment framework</a>, which calls for cutting away the tangle of assumptions and stereotypes that fill the field of gender and development.</p><p>The study will project the voices and unique perspectives of young women as actors in the platform economy to articulate the nuanced barriers and enablers including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will also facilitate mapping of the context and provide gender perspectives in the gig economy when regarded as a sector that has potential for increasing young women’s economic opportunities and participation to contribute to the realization of empowerment and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>The study will adopt a mixed method research design including:</p>  Flash conversations via closed social media groups where women work in the platform economy. Women discuss issues they face getting work or selling on online platforms. This is a key methodology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where women are turning to online groups for&nbsp;support.  In-depth interviews and focus group discussions with female gig workers with select male partners to understand the experiences of women workers and actors responsible in shaping their work experience.  Participatory video storytelling to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">See our previous participatory video storytelling work&nbsp;here</a>.  <p>We would welcome any feedback, from useful literature you think we should consult to methods we might have missed.

<p>Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/468663/uk-internet-penetration/">internet penetration rate in the United Kingdom is at an all-time high</a>. 46% of people in the UK attributed increased mobile device usage to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Britons now spend an average of 3.5 hours every day on the Internet — the statistic is much higher for Britons who work and live through e-commerce establishments.</p>
<p>The unstoppable rise of the internet opens up a plethora of questions that technology providers need to answer. The most important questions revolve around building security and trust especially in a way that does not frustrate end users.</p>
<p>How do we keep every Briton safe and secure when they access the Internet — without hampering user experience?</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK and the Digital ID Surge 
<p>The proliferation of digital products and services for the everyday consumer today has many effects — some intended, others unforeseen.</p>
<p>As is customary when people have multiple choices, an unpleasant one-time experience is enough to negatively affect customer experience, leading them to switch between brands that provide more pleasurable experiences. This is the most important rule guiding a frequently increasing on-demand culture in the UK.</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK 
<p>The term “on-demand culture” pays homage to a 21st-century consumer trend of heightened consumer convenience.</p>
<p>A major example of the on-demand culture in action is the expectations of mobile phone users.&nbsp; For mobile devices, users want digital service providers to deliver top-notch services and software solutions — search engines, financial apps, instant messaging —&nbsp; that can work securely and efficiently anywhere in record time.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the United Kingdom, end-users require the most of Digital ID verification systems. Consumers want an identity verification system that is fast, reliable, and accessible on cue.</p>
 How to be ‘on-demand’ compliant? 
<p>Given that<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf"> 85% of internet users</a> in the United Kingdom would rather access the internet via a smartphone, digital ID systems that are accessible on both web and mobile platforms will be considered on-demand compliant.</p>
<p>Consumers will waste no time switching brands whose ID systems they consider to be unavailable or often inaccessible. Tech service providers need to always prioritise solutions that fit the on-demand culture. Digital identification solutions, no matter how complex the backend operations, are no exception.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Digital ID solutions that fall short of the on-demand culture expectations risk losing consumers, who will undoubtedly lay claim to poor customer experience.</p>
 Security and Trust: The Digital ID Surge 
<p>As of the turn of 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/748192/number-of-contactless-transactions-in-the-uk/">an aggregate of 939 million contactless transactions</a> have been made in the United Kingdom. As more people decide to function digitally, there’s a corresponding increased responsibility on the part of public and private stakeholders to ensure that the internet is safe, secure and trustworthy.</p>
 What are digital identity and Digital ID (identification)? 
<p>Digital identity and Digital ID verification present the way out of the digital world’s security maze. These concepts are fast becoming an all-important requisite for smooth operations in the on-demand digital economy — and the digital world.</p>
<p>Digital ID verification systems provide processes to digitally authenticate a person’s identity whenever the need arises. For Digital ID verification systems to work, people need to have individual digital identities.</p>
 The Digital ID Surge 
<p>The United Nations (which the UK is a member of) recognises the need to bring trust back to digital operations. Together with the World Bank’s ID4D initiative, the plan is to provide every person on earth with a legal identity by 2030.</p>
<p>Providing security for consumers through digital ID verification is crucial for all digital service providers who want to stay ahead of the curve. As part of the on-demand culture amongst Britons, businesses that do not provide a robust digital ID framework for their customers are very likely to lose out.</p>
 Nipping the “fraud” bud 
<p>Fraud, money laundering and a swathe of financial crimes are what you get in a world where Digital ID is not taken seriously by both private and public stakeholders.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, according to <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/online-fraud-report/">research findings by Uswitch</a>, was the highest-ranked nation in Europe for money lost by online fraud in 2020. A mind-boggling amount of 376.5 million pounds was lost to e-commerce fraud.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot more to lose to fraud because the threat still exists. For the end-users, especially on digital payment service platforms, the threat of fraud is a big-enough incentive to switch to more reliable and secure solutions.</p>
<p>Digital ID solutions that are accessible, operable and usable by Britons anywhere will surely change the racecourse, favourably.&nbsp; A workable digital ID process should combine national identity documents with company-specific consumer data (biometrics, to facilitate on-demand electronic identification) for every financial transaction.</p>
<p>This effectively prevents fraud and other financial crime cases to create the kind of secure environment that ultimately ensures Britons trust in the digital economy.</p>
 The Government’s place in Digital ID 
<p>The United Kingdom government has not had the best of times where implementing a national digital identity project is concerned. The cost-intensive “Verify” digital identity project has fallen short of its goals — meaning that the UK does not yet have a national standard identity verification system.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the British government is still keenly aware that digital ID systems are the key to a future of financial inclusion and security in the United Kingdom. It is precisely why the Government Digital Service is working on another digital identity project.</p>
<p>Following further amendments to financial regulations, the government’s position — under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">the trust framework</a> — is to make it mandatory for service providers to have effective, robust, flexible and scale identification verification systems. For service providers, nothing should be more important than picking the right identification verification service to work with.</p>
 A user-centric Digital ID system 
<p>Building a hugely secure Digital ID system is important. That said, building one that is not just simple but also requires minimal effort to operate is far more important — because it really is all about the end-user.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the UK, companies need identity verification solutions that excel in: security, compliance and versatility.</p>
 Get in touch with IDnow 
<p>Simple and effective digital identity verification systems are not as straightforward as they sound. These systems require massive data input, immense technological capabilities and strict compliance with the government’s identity regulations.</p>
<p>Even for the most qualified tech service providers, forging a consumer-centric digital ID verification solution that complies with the on-demand culture can be a tough ask.</p>
<p>. . . And that’s where IDnow comes in.</p>
<p>IDnow is proudly in control of one of Europe’s leading identity verification platforms with trusted expertise in regulation markets, financial institutions and a host of other businesses and industries.</p>

<p>Given the many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">hacking and identity theft</a> incidents that have happened in the last few years, all of us are concerned about our online privacy and the safety of our Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is emerging as a solution for these apprehensions as it gives complete control and ownership of data to the individual entities as they can decide what data to share and with&nbsp;whom.</p><p>Beyond this encompassing vision, let’s drill down into the specifics to understand what you can and can’t do with&nbsp;SSI.</p> What You Can Do With&nbsp;SSI? <p>What are the things you can do and the benefits you derive from using SSI? Let’s&nbsp;explore.</p> Protect your Data from Centralized Storage&nbsp;Systems <p>With SSI, you have control over where your information is stored and shared. This means you can choose to move your information from centralized storage owned by companies to an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallet</a> that only you can&nbsp;access.</p> Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>In the currently popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> system, companies like Google and Facebook monetize your data through ads. With SSI, you can monetize your data and even choose which companies you want to share it with for&nbsp;money.</p><p>A possible way for data monetization is through a VC marketplace that is akin to an online eCommerce platform like eBay or Airbnb where buyers and sellers come together to buy/sell&nbsp;data.</p> Safeguard your&nbsp;PII <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">Security</a> is probably the most important benefit you get as you know who has your data and what it is being used for. Unauthorized users can’t access your data and use it for the wrong purposes.</p><p>Also, since your data doesn’t sit in a centralized database, there’s little incentive for a hacker to spend time and resources to steal a single person’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>All these are sure to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.</p> More ROI for Businesses <p>If you’re a small business owner, you can earn more returns from your business because you no longer have to spend resources on protecting customer data and complying with data regulations.</p> What You Can’t Do with&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary technologies that can change the way you think about your data and handle it. But it is not without pitfalls either. Instead of turning a blind eye to these pitfalls, understanding and navigating through them will help you to better leverage the SSI benefits.</p><p>So, what are some of the things you can’t do with&nbsp;SSI?</p> Pass on the Responsibility <p>With SSI, you can no longer pass on the responsibility of protecting your data to large companies. Remember, companies invest millions of dollars each year to protect the data stored in their systems and still get hacked. So, it can be a huge responsibility for&nbsp;you!</p><p>While the architecture of SSI makes it difficult to hack your data, still the responsibility to safeguard it is all yours. This means you will have to know the security policies of the entity using your data and the onus of picking a secure vendor lies completely on your shoulders.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’ve stored your identity details in a digital wallet that’s protected by a public-private key pair. Here, it’s your responsibility to remember the private keys, as no one can recover it for&nbsp;you.</p><p>A possible workaround can be to use a custodial wallet like the one offered by <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/GetCredentials">Affinidi</a>, but then you lose some level of decentralization.</p> Seamless Transfer <p>The SSI space is highly fragmented now with each company developing its applications and possibly even ecosystems. As a user, this translates to a lack of interoperability between different applications or ecosystems. You may have to change the format of data each time you send it to a different user.</p><p>This is undoubtedly inconvenient now, but it could change as the technology matures and eventually leads to the creation of a marketplace where companies can offer their services and you can pick a service provider and send your data for validation and for using the services&nbsp;offered.</p><p>Since the marketplace can have a common format, your data can be interoperable across the applications of companies who participate in this marketplace. Until then, you’ll have to make changes to your data’s&nbsp;format.</p> Cannot Avoid Middlemen <p>The heading can sound counterintuitive. After all, SSI and decentralized identity are all about removing companies, centralized storage, and middlemen, right?</p><p>Well, yes, but you can’t avoid middlemen in all situations. The idea of a marketplace we talked about earlier is a middleman of some&nbsp;sort.</p><p>Likewise, we saw that you can monetize your data if you chose to. Most likely, you’ll need a common marketplace or some other way through which you can inform companies about your willingness to sell your data. This entails a middleman as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So, you can’t avoid middlemen altogether, though their roles can&nbsp;change.</p> Verdict: Should You Go with&nbsp;SSI? <p>Absolutely YES, because the benefits far outweigh the downsides. Also, remember SSI is a relatively new technology and it could take some time for people to jump on its bandwagon.</p><p>Nevertheless, SSI is likely to stay, as is evident from the many proactive steps that the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU</a> and other countries are taking in this direction. It may not be long before other governments follow suit, so SSI is undoubtedly a part of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

 The Coming Storm 
 
<p>On April 28th, 2021 the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en" title="European Data Protection Board announced">European Data Protection Board announced</a> that The Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD) ordered INE (National Institute for Statistics) to suspend the sending of personal data from the Census 2021 to the United States. CNPD has issued a <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/decisoes/deliberacoes/" title="decision">decision</a> addressed to INE for the suspension within 12 hours of any international transfer of personal data to the United States or other third countries without an adequate level of protection in the context of Census 2021 questionnaire.</p>
<p>If this were your organization, would it be able to weather this storm?</p>
 
 The Fair Weather Cloud 
 
<p>Most organizations have been using cloud services for some time. This has been what could be called “fair weather” use. Where the impact of service failures has been limited. This is revealed by various studies that show only a small proportion of business-critical workloads have been moved to cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the COVID pandemic has accelerated Digital Transformation and cloud usage. This is making organizations much more dependent upon their IT services and the impact of failure has become much higher.</p>
<p>What is needed is a “Cloud for all Seasons” which organizations can exploit today’s complex IT environment to obtain the benefits that cloud services can bring in a secure and compliant manner.</p>
<p>The common business risks from the use of cloud services can be summarized as:</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – from individual element failures as well as cyber-attacks such as ransomware and denial of service. 
 Data breaches – loss, leakage, or unauthorized access to the applications or data stored or processed within the cloud service. 
 Compliance- results in failure to comply with obligation imposed by laws or regulations. 
 
<p>These arise because the existing internal security and compliance controls do not take account of cloud use. Furthermore, there is often confusion resulting from the way responsibility is shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Provider) and the cloud tenant.</p>
<p></p>
 Inconsistent Governance 
<p>Many business-critical applications now depend upon multiple services from multiple providers. The service levels must be set by business needs - but mapping multiple SLAs is difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, each cloud service provides their own disparate management capabilities and tools. This imposes an extra management burden for each cloud service.</p>
<p>When IT services are delivered on premises the security and management capabilities are chosen by the organization. For cloud services most of the tools and capabilities are specific to the service.</p>
<p>You may also need additional tools such as SASE (Secure Access Service Edge), CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers) and CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management).</p>
<p>This all leads to a costly and inefficient ad hoc approach to security and management.</p>
<p>Organizations need consistent approach to governance across the delivery models.</p>
 
 Zero Trust Cloud 
 
<p>Can you trust your cloud to protect your data? The Schrems II judgment in July 2020 found that there is a risk because governments are able to override contracts to seize data held in outsourced IT services.</p>
<p>Contracts, Supplementary Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules are not sufficient protection. <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="According to the EDPB">According to the EDPB</a> organizations need to take supplementary technical measures to protect their where it is transferred to a Third Country.</p>
<p>While this judgment applied to personal data – is your <a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5122014519132358461949.pdf" title="business-critical data safe">business-critical data safe</a>?</p>
<p>Organizations need to take a Zero Trust approach to cloud services – never trust always protect your data. Confidential computing provides the technology to help with this.</p>
 
 Cloud for All Seasons 
 
<p>Organizations need their cloud usage to be storm proof. This involves not only how you choose the cloud service but also how you govern all of your IT services – however they are delivered.

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

 Read More 



<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

					 Decentralized Identity opens the doors for safe travel and tourism 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Learn how Indicio and SITA worked together using privacy-preserving technology to reshape contactless health information sharing.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Proof of testing or vaccination has become central to how we reopen travel to countries, admit visitors, and bring tourism economies back to life. Providing privacy and control for people is the key to establishing public confidence in a system for proving one’s health status.</p>
<p>A digital proof of a Covid negative test or vaccination must be designed to protect individual privacy. It should enable a medical or test center to directly provide that information to an individual—and involve no one else storing or managing their data. It should be tamper proof and incapable of being faked. And it should be easy to download and quick to use.</p>
<p>This is why Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation that provides decentralized identity software solutions, and SITA, the leading global technology provider for the air transport industry, have used open source, privacy-by-design technology to build a solution that allows airports, airlines, and all elements of the tourist economy to use verifiable digital credentials to safely and securely return to life.</p>
<p>How to reopen travel and tourism and preserve privacy<br>Decentralized identity uses distributed ledger technology, cryptography, and a new way to provide an individual with control of their digital information. This means identity credentials that contain health information are issued directly to that person’s digital wallet, without any handoff to or management by third-parties. Trusted organizations can quickly issue millions of credentials without any of the information they contain being collected and stored in a third-party database.</p>
<p>Then, when the person decides they want&nbsp; to share all or just part of the information, such as the specific details of their test status, the authenticity and original source of that information can be definitively proven. This makes the digital credential compliant with health and data privacy law (HIPAA, GDPR).</p>
<p>The advantages of this decentralized identity ecosystem are that it can:</p>
 
 Replace paper cards with fully digitized identity information 
 Increase efficiency by automating many tasks involved in presenting personal&nbsp; health status 
 Ensure consent and control when sharing personal data 
 Allow a user to select which information they want to disclose while obscuring the rest 
 Enhance security through privacy-by-design, user-friendly digital records, and tamper-evident distributed ledger technology 
 Avoid the problem of fraudulent health cards or paper forms from being presented 
 Scale to include millions of participants, including employees, travelers, and residents, with just a few writes to a public ledger and an inexpensive mobile application 
 Speed recovery of reopening venues and countries 
 
<p>Open and manage public spaces<br>Indicio’s identity ecosystem is built using Cardea, a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Based onHyperledger Indy and Aries open source technology, its flexible design means it can be easily adapted and deployed by any company, government, or organization that needs a privacy preserving digital credential for managing access.</p>
<p>Indicio’s implementation of Cardea for SITA and the Government of Aruba features a mobile interface in the form of a mobile app for users and a second mobile app for use by venues to receive and verify credentials from users. Software called mediator agents and enterprise agents allow for scaling and automation of the credential issuing and verification processes. Distributed ledger technology provides cryptographic assurance that the data within any given credential has not been tampered with or altered.</p>
<p>Cardea’s architecture protects privacy and aids compliance by separating issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. Issuers cannot know where credentials were used by those holding them, and verifiers (receivers) of credentials are able to limit the amount of data they receive and retain.</p>
<p>Successful test deployment in Aruba<br>The island of Aruba and global air transport technology provider SITA came to Indicio to create a trusted traveler system that makes it easy for visitors to share their health status privately and securely using their mobile device.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on finding innovative ways to strengthen its tourism industry while minimizing the risk of Covid-19 infection from visitors. Unlike immunity passports, the verifiable digital credential system from Indicio allows visitors to share a trusted proof of their health status. This trust is possible because the traveler has shared their health status and had it verified by a public health agency.</p>
<p>Once a test result is approved, the traveler is issued a second credential by the public health agency to confirm that they have tested negative. This credential contains no medical data whatsoever and is used only to prove the person’s test status. The Happy Traveler Card, as this credential is called in Aruba, is verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that the traveler visits. It is an easy way for even their smallest businesses to ensure the safety and health of their guests.<br></p>
 The Happy Traveler Card in action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine readable governance enabled businesses and venues to trust that tourists had been tested on arrival by Aruba’s health department. Visitors using the digital Aruba Happy Traveler Card could be swiftly and reliably verified with a phone app. This freed both businesses and the government from the burden of mechanically collecting data with the attendant risk of error or fraud.</p>
<p>The Cardea ecosystem enables Aruba to move toward a privacy-first approach to supporting their tourism industry, which in 2019 accounted for 98.3% of Aruba’s GDP and supported 47,000 jobs—99% of all employment on the island.</p>
<p>Build on our experience for your solution<br>The tourism and hospitality identity solution for SITA is highly replicable for use cases in any industry and easy to integrate with existing systems. With a professionally staffed global network for verifiable digital credentials supported by many of the leading companies in this space, Indicio is building the future of identity. Open source and interoperable software means your solution is scalable and&nbsp; sustainable. Our expert team of architects and engineers can create and customize a solution quickly for business, governments, and organizations who need a privacy-first identity solution and they can deploy it in weeks.</p>

The Support Centre for Data Sharing (SCDS) initiative focuses on researching, documenting, and reporting about the data sharing practices, EU legal frameworks, access and distribution technology that are relevant to organisations, and that imply novel models, and legal or technological challenges.




 





<blockquote>“Whilst privacy is paramount, you can’t have a digital economy if everyone is locking&nbsp;their entire digital footprint away”<p></p>Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder Meeco</blockquote>





 




This is one of the many topics touched on the latest Support Centre for Data Sharing interview. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayweyzen/?originalSubdomain=nl">Raymonde Weyzen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estherhuyer/?locale=en_US">Esther Huyer </a>interview Meecos’ CEO &amp; Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> and Chief Commercial Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Jason </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Smith</a>.




 




Some of the challenges that come with data sharing are data privacy and data control. However the paradox of data sharing is that it generally means the recipient needs the data in order to fulfil an obligation, such as deliver a service, validate identity, deliver a package or customise an experience. <br><br>So the issues are often not about sharing, but about trust and transparency. Helping customers understand why the data is required and providing evidence that it is being used as intended is a great way to establish trust. Another way to boost trust is to focus on designing services that minimise the amount of data collected whilst maximising the value created.





When designing data sharing services, consider how to minimise collection whilst delivering maximum value. It might be as simple as only holding the data for the maximum time needed to complete the service and then sharing evidence that it has been deleted.






 




In this thought provoking interview Raymonde asks about Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth. Some of the the exciting projects discussed include <a href="https://miks-it.com/">mIKs-it, the safe multimedia app for children</a>, developing a decentralised identity and verifiable credentials wallet and how innovators like <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> are transforming workforce management and <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com/">My Life Capsule</a> are helping their customers be prepared for a family emergency.



Other questions and topics covered include:




 




+ How the idea of Meeco was conceived




 




+ Why is there a need for data sharing?




 




+ What is the data sharing lifecycle at Meeco?




 




+ Examples of use cases at Meeco




 




+ What specific licensing or standards to share data are used at Meeco?




 




+ In order to share data proper;y going forward, do we need more or less regulation?




 




+ Where would you see Meeco and ultimately the digital world in 10 years from now?




 




And finally, the most difficult question we weren’t prepared for “What would be the working title of a movie starring Meeco?” to find the answer to this and more click below to listen or watch the interview.

   Google has&nbsp;pre-announced&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp; If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;Apple’s privacy labels, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;Critics&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a

<p>Google has&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced</a>&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">Critics</a>&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a privacy move so much as a justification for why a user can trust an app with their data. As Google puts it, the new section “will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s not really saying apps shouldn’t collect the data in the first place — which is increasingly Apple’s position, particularly with its new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature.</p>



<p>So what can we expect from the Google Play store safety section?&nbsp;At a glance, app developers will be asked to declare:</p>



  What personal data they collect, including users’ names and email addresses, and any information from the device, such as location data, contacts and photos and videos&nbsp;  What they’re using that personal data for — is it for a better user experience or personalized ads, for example?&nbsp;  Any good security and privacy practices they already have in place, such as data encryption or protecting children under Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families">Families policy</a>  Whether the app needs the data it collects to function or whether users have a choice about their data being shared (as they do on iOS apps through Apple’s new ATT)&nbsp;  Whether the app’s safety section is verified by an independent third&nbsp;party  Whether they will service the user’s right to data deletion requests if the user chooses to uninstall the app.&nbsp;  



<p>As we said, Google’s safety section and Apple’s privacy labels are not really a case of comparing apples with apples (pardon the pun). Critics are&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">saying</a>&nbsp;Apple privacy labels focus on the data apps are collecting for tracking purposes and what’s linked to the end user, whereas Google’s safety section is more about an app’s best practices and trustworthiness in collecting and handling a user’s personal data. While the independent verification on the Google labelling doesn’t happen on Apple’s privacy labelling, it is optional, and it also remains to be seen how rigorous it will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, this is all part of Google’s predictable misunderstanding of what safety means to many people. Yes, it’s about security of data, but Google’s repeated ploy to bait-and-switch a privacy concern into a security solution is missing a big aspect – what companies do themselves and how they share our personal data with other parties. No amount of security-only thinking results in a privacy solution in this case. What’s more, Google going on about the evils of data sharing are moot since they are the biggest data hoarder there is.</p>



<p>Like Apple did when it announced the ATT feature, Google is giving developers plenty of time to get used to the idea. The safety section in Google Play store won’t become mandatory for all apps until Q2 of 2022. In fact,&nbsp;this feels like Google is giving its app developer community longer than Apple did from announcement to required implementation. Perhaps that’s an indirect acknowledgement by Google that the data handling practices of its huge app dev community needs more time?</p>



<p>Once the requirements are mandatory, app developers who don’t comply will face sanctions.</p>



<p>Like all the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-will-adtech-face-google-apple-privacy-changes/">privacy changes we’re seeing in the ad tech space</a>&nbsp;lately, consumers will ultimately determine whether this new move from Google goes far enough in protecting their personal data. As iOS apps have seen with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">low opt-in rates for cross-app tracking</a>&nbsp;from Apple’s new ATT, Android apps might be in for a rude shock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, June 23rd 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, announces the launch of AML-compliant video identifications around the clock. Users can now perform non-automated identity verification procedures at any time thanks to the overnight operation.</p>
<p>“With the extended service hours with 24-hour availability, we give our users even more freedom and enable our business customers with tailored support even better accessibility, higher customer satisfaction and of course the possibility to identify more customers per day” says Bettina Pauck, COO of IDnow. “No matter what industry you are in or what your use case is – opening a bank account, foreign exchange trading or player verification, we are here for you.”</p>
<p>The new service offering, which is available in English and German, completes IDnow’s strategy of focusing on the user needs and providing an easy and quick identification – whenever and wherever a customer wants. “For a convenient process that fits into the fast-paced, digital-centric everyday life of users, such a factor is essential,” adds Bettina Pauck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IDnow offers a highly secure and reliable structure – with a diversification to a total of 20 geographically distributed ident center locations. The sites are located in various cities across Germany and Europe and also guarantee a high level of data protection. The highly qualified and multilingual fraud and identification specialists, who can also offer the service in French, Italian and Spanish, are trained on the comprehensive BaFin process, know the data protection regulations as well as the common forgery and fraud possibilities.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

   FastAPI is really fast and SQLAlchemy is really…SQL-y. But what good is a fast and SQL-y application if it isn’t secure? 

 In this post, we’re going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app! 

 First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify
who the user is. We’ll use Okta for this. 

 Next, we’ll want to perform authorization, which controls what the user can do in our app

 Bear Management Service Architecture 

<p>What, you expected TodoMVC?</p>

<p>Our app allows authenticated users to register their own bears and view the bear population at large. It consists of two separate services: (1) a front end through which users authenticate with Okta, and (2) a back end that exposes an extensive API for creating and retrieving bears.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once your new Okta application is created, the Okta CLI will print out its <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> properties:</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create

...

Okta application configuration:
Client Id:     &lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
Issuer:        https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the project’s root directory with the following contents:</p>

   <code>CLIENT_ID=&lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
ISSUER=https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>After creating the <code>.env</code> file in the project root, symlink it into the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> subdirectory so that both the front end and back end projects have access to the same configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>$ ln -s ../.env okta-hosted-login/.env
</code>   

 Start the React Front End 

<p>In the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies and then <code>npm start</code> to fire up the React front end.</p>

<p>Once the app is up and running, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your browser. Click the <code>Login</code> button and enter your Okta credentials when prompted. Successfully signing in should redirect you back to your front end, where you’ll be greeted with your name (courtesy of Okta), a ‘Create a new bear’ form, and a list of bears:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The list will be empty because our back end service isn’t running. Let’s change that now.</p>

 Start the FastAPI Back End 

<p>While the React app runs happily in the background, open a new terminal and <code>cd</code> to the project’s root directory. In the root, create and activate a new virtual environment, and then install dependencies:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Finally, start the FastAPI server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload --reload-dir=app
</code>   

<p>If you reload <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, you should see the list of bears populated with a number of very good bears owned by various members of Example.com, Inc:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and create a few new bears of your own.</p>

<p>Our app is now open for business. In fact, it’s  too open. Every authenticated user can see everyone’s bears — even users who have been banned for trying to create koalas. It’s time to put a stop to this madness.</p>

 ABAC, As Easy as 1-2-3 🕺 

<p>Oso is an <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso">open source</a>
authorization system that we’ll use to secure our app. Oso is flexible enough to support <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/examples.html">any access control pattern your heart desires</a>, but for this example we’ll focus on <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>

<p>ABAC is all about representing fine-grained or dynamic permissions based on who the user is and their relation to the resource they want to access.</p>

 The Bear Necessities 

<p>First, after pressing Ctrl+C to exit FastAPI, we’re going to install the <code>oso</code> and <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> packages:</p>

   <code>pip3 install oso sqlalchemy-oso
</code>   

<p>Once pip finishes pipping, open up <code>app/main.py</code> using your favorite text editor and make the changes that you see below. The following is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">Git diff</a> of the change — if you’re following along, add the lines that start with a single <code>+</code> symbol to your local copy of <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Next, create an empty Oso policy file in the <code>app</code> directory:</p>

   <code>touch app/policy.polar
</code>   

<p>This is where we are going to write all of our authorization logic
using Oso’s declarative policy language called Polar.</p>

<p>Load the new policy file into our Oso instance in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Before we start filling that policy file with authorization rules, we first need to register the application data types that we’re going to use in our authorization policy with Oso. Registering the application types allows us to reference them in our Polar policy as <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/polar/polar-syntax.html#specialization">specializers</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to use the <code>register_models()</code> helper from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library to register our SQLAlchemy models with Oso in bulk. <code>register_models()</code>
registers all descendants of a SQLAlchemy base class with Oso; otherwise, we would have to call <code>oso.register_class()</code> for each individual class that we wanted to register:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Oso is deny-by-default, and we currently have an empty policy file. In the next section, we’ll write our first authorization rule to allow real bear lovers to create real bears.</p>

 Add Your First <code>allow()</code> Rule 

<p>For our first foray into writing a policy, we’re going to use Polar to add a rule that prevents banned users from creating new bears.</p>

<p>Open up <code>app/policy.polar</code> and add the following rule:</p>

 <code>allow(user: User, "create", _bear: BearBase) if
    not user.is_banned;
</code> 

<p>The rule works by matching the inputs provided by the application:</p>

 
   <code>user</code> - an instance of the <code>User</code> class. 
   The action is the string literal <code>"create"</code>. 
   <code>_bear</code> - an instance of the <code>BearBase</code> class. 
 

<p>And then checking that the provided user’s <code>is_banned</code> field is false.
We don’t yet need to check anything further about the <code>bear</code> resource,
so we prefix it with an underscore to indicate that it won’t be referenced in the body of the rule.</p>

<p>NOTE: To learn more about Polar syntax, head on over to <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/learn/policies.html">the Writing Policies guide</a> in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Save the file, flip back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should once again be able to create new bears (assuming you haven’t set your own user’s <code>is_banned</code> property to <code>True</code>). All law-abiding bear enthusiasts have had their access restored, and the koala lovers are left out in the cold. (Does it get cold in Australia? We’ll investigate in a future blog.)</p>

 Deal with List Endpoints 

<p><code>oso.is_allowed()</code> worked perfectly for securing the <code>create()</code> endpoint, but it’s not the best tool for the job when it comes to securing <code>index()</code>. The difference is that <code>create()</code> operates over a single record, while <code>index()</code> operates over a potentially very large collection. If performance weren’t an issue, we could load the collection from the database and iterate over it,
calling <code>oso.is_allowed()</code> on every record to filter out unauthorized entries. However, we all know that Zoomers lose interest and click away from your website if it takes longer than a few Planck time units to load, so we need a better solution.</p>

<p>And now, presenting… a better solution. Data filtering! The cure to all of life’s performance issues.</p>

<p>The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library is built on top of Oso’s data filtering feature. In a nutshell, the logic engine at the core of the Oso library can turn your authorization policy into a set of constraints similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clauses used to filter records when querying a relational database. The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library then applies those constraints directly to your app’s SQLAlchemy queries. In this way, only authorized records are loaded from the database in an efficient operation instead of loading all records and then iterating over the collection to determine the authorized subset.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s wire up our app so that we can efficiently filter some bears.</p>

<p>First, we need to modify <code>app/main.py</code> to import <code>authorized_sessionmaker()</code> from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>
library:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644
--- a/app/main.py
+++ b/app/main.py
@@ -9 +9 @@ from oso import Oso
-from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
+from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, authorized_sessionmaker
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll create a new <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/">FastAPI dependable</a> that mirrors our existing <code>get_db()</code> function but yields an Oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/api/sqlalchemy.html#sqlalchemy_oso.session.AuthorizedSession">AuthorizedSession</a> instead of a regular SQLAlchemy <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session">Session</a>. To do this, add the following code below the <code>get_db()</code> function in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and… no bears. They’re still happily growling away in the database, but we haven’t added any Oso rules permitting access. Let’s change that.</p>

 Flesh Out Your Authorization Policy 

<p>To start off, let’s add a rule to <code>app/policy.polar</code> that permits all users to list all bears:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
</code> 

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should see every bear again. But something else is missing. The <code>Owner</code> column is empty! When we serialize bear records in the back end, we include the email address for each bear’s owner — a piece of data that comes from our SQLAlchemy-backed <code>User</code> model. Access to <code>User</code> data is now protected by Oso because <code>User</code> is a subclass of the <code>Base</code> SQLAlchemy class we registered via <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <code>register_models()</code> method. Let’s add one more blanket <code>allow()</code> rule, this time permitting users to view user data at the <code>index()</code> endpoint:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: User);
</code> 

<p>Do the save-and-reload dance, and the <code>Owner</code> column should once again be populated.</p>

<p>Next, let’s add some constraints to our <code>"index"</code> rule for bears so we can see Data Filtering in Action (coming soon from Manning, probably).</p>

<p>Perhaps users should only be allowed to see their own bears:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar

</code>   

<p>Save, reload, and confirm you can no longer see anyone else’s bears. If you want to see some bears, you’ll need to create them for yourself.</p>

<p>The index view is now private, but it feels wrong to prevent our fellow bear enthusiasts from viewing polar bears, the sweetest and most mild-mannered of all bears. To right that wrong, we can register the <code>Species</code> enum as a constant so that we can reference it in our policy:</p>

 Learn More About Oso, FastAPI, and Python 

<p>In this post, we started out with a very fast and SQL-y application built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. We created and configured a new Okta application to handle identity management and authentication for our app. Then we used Oso to add efficient, fine-grained authorization to our back end API.</p>

<p>The full example is available on <a href="https://github.com/osohq/fastapi-sqlalchemy-okta-oso-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

   Add roles to the app using <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/getting-started/roles/builtin_roles.html">built-in roles</a> feature.
Perhaps every bear lives in a sanctuary, and a user can have a particular
role in each sanctuary, e.g., “Visitor”, “Friend”, or “Shepherd”. 
   Add a “Delete” button next to every bear in the list, and wire up each button to send
a DELETE request to the back end. Secure your new <code>delete()</code> handler with
Oso, and add a rule to the policy that only allows users to delete their own
bears. 
   Join <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com">our slack</a> and let us know what your favorite bear is and why
it’s the polar bear. 
   Learn more about other use cases of Oso, other languages it supports,
and more in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.

Immutable, Trustless And Immune To Fraud: The Blockchain Expansion Of Democratic Republicanism<p>Introduction: The Great Fraud: Blockchain’s Rectification</p>Can We Trust Traditional Paradigms Of Ballot Counting For Fair And Equitable Elections Without Blockchain?<p>It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry; ballots don’t make results, the counters do. The last three elections within the United States have succumbed to political parties accusing one another of voter fraud, through substantiated and unsubstantiated claims; how can we rectify such a broken paradigm that threatens republicanism, blockchain is the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Blockchain technology is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries which include supply-chains, escrow, invoices, healthcare, crowdfunding and cloud storages etc. and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the demise of voter fraud. Blockchain in its purest of forms and most simplistic of terms is a digital ledger that is peer-to-peer that mitigates the avaristic intent of centralized entities. Encryption makes these records incorruptible and easy to verify. Voters can utilize blockchain and can be assured that their vote will not be tampered with and simultaneously, their vote stays anonymous; this is the true ethos and incorruptible paradigm of voting that should become the foundational bedrock of republicanism. This dynamic change in transparency surrounding voting is incumbent for democracy to expand and flourish into the 21st century, especially with ongoing investigations surrounding voter-fraud, not just in the United States, but throughout the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Aergo’s Understanding And Desire To Decimate Voter Fraud: The Pikkle Construction</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Voting Mechanism On The Aergo Platform: Enhancing Global Participation Of Transparent Blockchain Voting<p>Pikkle is the first of its kind; built on the Aergo platform by Blocko, Aergo’s technology partner and utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, Pikkle aims to resolve a variety of dilemma’s that plague traditional voting paradigms and mechanisms. Pikkle resolves issues such as cost inefficiencies, resolving voter processes that creates substantial costs that coincide with targeting voters, identity verification, ballot counts and check lists. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which, throughout the world, many voters have lost confidence in voting mechanisms because of the continuous onslaught and investigations of voter fraud. Pikkle ensures that trust is consolidated back into the consciousness of the populace; unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest. We saw this occur consistently among some of the most prominent social media platforms during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections within the United States. With voter fraud corrupting democracy, one must ask, are we in a democracy, or a democracy masked by corruptible despotism; it is not power that corrupts, but it is magnetic to the corruptible and Pikkle aims to change this&nbsp;notion.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. Centralized entities have attempted to garner similar approaches, but since the public trust in these entities has waned over the last fifteen years, it is evident that an app like Pikkle can replace traditional voting mechanisms. Through the utilization of blockchain technology, stake-holders, companies, governmental organizations, criminal enterprises and political parties can no-longer shake the foundational bedrock of pure democracy, and Pikkle emphasizes and embodies such a notion. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association: Blocko And Aergo: Unified Under The Consciousness Of Mending Public Voter&nbsp;Trust</p>Mending Public Trust Through Blockchain Voting Platforms: The Pikkle&nbsp;Paradigm<p>On April 23rd, The Korean Broadcasters Association, Blocko and Aergo signed an MOU to ensure the practical application and construction of a blockchain based audience participation application and voting system. The Korean Broadcasters Association is an organization that is almost half a century old with an aim to unify South Korea through domestic terrestrial broadcasts. The Korean Broadcasters Association has worked with the largest broadcasting stations in all of South Korea which include joint ventures when counting exit polls alongside the KBS, MBC and SBS. Through offering various cooperation to provide the 40 members with high quality and diverse broadcasting services, the KBA is continuously trying its best. The KBA intends on utilizing Pikkle for a variety of services which include, but are not limited to, media content and voting systems to select winners for Korea Broadcasting Prizes and the Seoul International Drama Awards on the Aergo platform. Blocko also plays a crucial role in the development and expansion of Pikkle as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Blocko is Aergo’s main technology partner that was established in 2014 and has worked with some of the largest institutions in all of South Korea which include the Bank of Korea, Financial Security Agency, Shinhan Financial Group, Hyundai Motor Group and many more. It is incumbent to reference that Blocko is South Korea’s largest blockchain infrastructure provider that has built blockchain based services for financial, political and public institutions throughout the nation. Blocko has commercialized enterprise blockchain platforms based off of Aergo, an open-sourced hybrid blockchain protocol powered by the native cryptocurrency AERGO optimized for hybrid deployments for public and private institutions.</p><p>Conclusion: Mending Democracy: The Pikkle Mission Confirmed</p>Pikkle Aims To Integrate With Broadcasting Systems And Festivals By Q3 Of This Year And Intends To Launch NFT’s Next&nbsp;Year<p>It is evident that the public trust of traditional voting mechanisms has all but collapsed over the last decade. Aergo comprehended this notion and seeks to rectify public trust themselves through the utilization of Pikkle on a consolidated frontier between Aergo, Blocko and the Korean Broadcasters Association. Pikkle is the first of its kind surrounding blockchain voting, enabling immutable and incorruptible data to be stored on the blockchain which has the ability to rectify our globally broken electoral system. Blockchain technology can transform democracy, and Pikkle can perpetuate its transcendence.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digitized-voting-democratized-the-aergo-blockchain-voting-paradigm-df70da14e2d">Digitized Voting Democratized: The Aergo Blockchain Voting Paradigm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#165 — Everything you need to know about new FTC chief Lina&nbsp;Khan <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-164-what-apples-missing-about-digital-identity-1d587693e285">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool  What people are&nbsp;saying  What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech  Everything Lina Khan + Big&nbsp;Tech  What people think about Big Tech platforms  Chart of the&nbsp;week  BONUS: Every platform is Clubhouse now  Stuff happens   1. The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool Photo: Lexey Swall / linamkhan.com<p>Lina Khan shot to unlikely national recognition after the publication of her seminal work while still at Yale, <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>. An overnight sensation, the paper helped reframe decades of consensus around antitrust frameworks — which at the time were formulated around pricing. Instead, we should focus on structural power, Lina&nbsp;argued.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">the NYTimes</a> back in&nbsp;2018:</p><blockquote>Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, [Lina Khan] presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: “The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon’s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.”</blockquote><p>Lina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">at the&nbsp;time</a>:</p><blockquote>“As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,” she said. “But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.”</blockquote><p>Thanks to Lina’s paper and her ability to bring newfound attention to an old challenge, new frameworks and vocabularies have been bubbling below the surface over the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>In that time, our stance on Big Tech has rapidly shifted. From being darlings of capitalism and innovation, we now view the corporate titans that control our digital world with a heightened sense of skepticism.</p><p>Our political leaders have taken the hint. The issue of monopoly power is, today, a bipartisan issue — though sometimes for different reasons.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Now, 32, Lina Khan is the new chair of the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-will-chair-federal-trade-commission-c7ea8e06-25de-4d8d-b188-2297169cd3fa.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Khan, an antitrust expert well-known for her ideas for applying competition law to the tech industry, is sure to spook tech platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>Khan, 32 years old, is a hero to critics of tech who want to see the government act more aggressively against what they see as anti-competitive behavior from companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57501579">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Worryingly for Big Tech too, a number of bipartisan bills have also been put forward in Congress to rein in the power of Big Tech. That there are Democrats and Republicans who support antitrust action makes her position even more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>Ms Khan’s appointment is the clearest sign yet that President Biden means business when it comes to clipping the wings of companies like Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><p>Wired in a piece titled, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-finally-moving-at-speed-of-tech/">The US Government Is Finally Moving at the Speed of&nbsp;Tech</a>:</p><blockquote>The result is that we find ourselves living in a world that looks very different from the one we were living in just a few years ago. New antitrust cases against tech giants are popping up left and right, keeping the issue firmly in the public consciousness. The companies are devoting unprecedented sums toward lobbying, advocacy, and advertising to try to avert a crackdown. And in the sharpest break with the past, Congress and the White House are taking concrete steps to restructure markets that have been left to their own devices for two and a half&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s all so much, so fast, that it’s hard to keep track of the various subplots. The introduction of the five House antitrust bills and the elevation of Khan to FTC chair, for example, look like two separate stories. But they’re really two parts of the same story: Khan was herself the key investigator behind the House antitrust subcommittee’s investigation of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, begun in 2019. The bills introduced last week are the fruits of that investigation. (While the time between the start of the investigation and the release of legislative proposals has felt like an eternity to those of us who follow this closely, it wouldn’t be bad for a Silicon Valley product launch. It took Amazon three years to bring the Kindle to&nbsp;market.)</blockquote><p>Matt Stoller, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-antitrust-revolution-has-found">The Antitrust Revolution Has Found Its&nbsp;Leader</a>:</p><blockquote>Khan is something rare in progressive politics, someone with academic credentials and mastery over a dense technical subject, but also connected with a broad-based populist social movement that crosses partisan lines. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken to in business, Republicans as well as Democrats, who talk in reverential tones about Khan. It’s not just that she is an important thinker, it’s that she *understands* what they are going through, the coercive power they are up against. And that’s because she got her start understanding the economy not in a classroom or at a law firm, but as a business journalist, listening to business people and workers facing monopolists.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>To call this appointment remarkable understates the point. That Khan is on the commission, with Republican votes, is surprising enough, but for her to be Chair is downright shocking. It’s too soon to know what Khan is going to do in her new role, but her appointment is already sending shock waves in the enforcement community globally. Antitrust policy is run by a small yet international community of lawyers and economists who know each other. In every country, some of them are cheering this move, while others are horrified. But they all know it matters, because as goes the U.S. on antitrust, so goes&nbsp;Europe.</blockquote> 3. What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech <p>For one, they’re on high alert. Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/big-tech-s-uneasy-future">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>And on Tuesday, tech stocks barely flinched at the news. But Khan’s arrival is likely to put Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft on the defensive in a way the past few years of heated anti-tech rhetoric have&nbsp;not.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s because Khan’s appointment to lead the agency, one of two antitrust enforcers in the U.S. along with the Justice Department, poses perhaps the most serious threat yet. Although she is just one person on a five-member commission, as chair she will set the enforcement and policy priorities for the agency. That could very well mean an antitrust case against Amazon, given her law school paper outlining the antitrust problems with the online retailer. A Khan-led FTC also is likely to bring enforcement actions to rein in not just the technology sector, but corporate America writ&nbsp;large.</blockquote><p>We’ll be watching to see how Lina Khan intends to leverage her new position of power. But it’s worth noting that antitrust is about a lot more than just trust busting — say, forcing Facebook to break up Instagram and WhatsApp. As Greg has mentioned in the past, the cat’s out of the&nbsp;bag.</p><p>Instead, we could see new rules around key issues such as interoperability and portability — <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/privacy/061721-tech-regulatory-overhaul-series-the-excess-of-access/">including this recently introduced bill</a> (via&nbsp;/m):</p><blockquote>This post assesses H.R. 3849, the “Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act of 2021” introduced by Representatives Scanlon (D-PA) and Owens (R-UT). The bill would impose sweeping requirements on specific covered platforms to build new technical interfaces to transfer data to competitors and potential competitors and to enable interoperability between their services.</blockquote><p>Here’s Mitja on the subject, comparing it to when telco companies finally allowed phone number portability:</p><blockquote>This bill might end Facebook’s monopoly, but one of the interesting and important things to note is interoperability which enables users to switch from one social network to&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In this case, “switch” could be defined similarly to when the UsSs government forced wireless companies to let you take your phone number with you when you switch carriers — a similar move may be called on social networks to let you take your identity and social content and transfer it elsewhere.</blockquote><p>With Lina, anything’s on the table. But these are early days and she still has her work cut out for her, as WIRED reminds&nbsp;us:</p><blockquote>None of this is to say that the movement to break up Big Tech, or rein it in, or whichever bumper sticker you prefer, has achieved victory. The legislative agenda in particular remains a long shot until proven otherwise. While it’s noteworthy that the bills have bipartisan support within the House antitrust subcommittee, they might not have enough to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, even in altered form. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has already come out in opposition, and even those Senate Republicans who might be sympathetic have yet to publicly support the agenda. (Even if the bills become law, there’s no guarantee they will achieve the desired results.) Ted Cruz, who appears to revel in browbeating social media executives as much as anyone, voted against Khan’s confirmation. So did Mike Lee, the ranking Republican member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee.</blockquote><blockquote>But even if legislation stalls, Khan’s overwhelming confirmation — she received support from 21 Republican senators — means change is coming to the FTC. Several experts have argued that the agency has enormous, mostly untapped power to structure markets. Two of those experts now make up two-thirds of the commission’s Democratic majority: Khan and her former boss, Rohit Chopra, who last year published an article arguing for the agency to use its authority to issue rules about unfair competition, rather than relying exclusively on litigation. They now have an opportunity to put that theory into practice.</blockquote> 4.

Chart of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-industrys-glory-days-in-washington-are-over-11623936187?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>“In the last four or five years, the pendulum has swung in an overly dramatic fashion from ‘tech can do no wrong’ to ‘tech can do no right,’ ” said Adam Kovacevich, who spent 12 years as one of Google’s top lobbyists. He now leads a new tech group called Chamber of Progress aimed at wooing back Democrats.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>As five House tech bills came together this month, lobbyists for the companies that would be most affected said they were frozen out of the process and that the lawmakers did everything they could to keep drafts of the proposals out of their&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>“The industry was very much treated as the enemy, and one to be isolated,” one lobbyist said. As a result, the bills are tougher on the industry than if lawmakers had sought their input to craft something that they could&nbsp;support.</blockquote> 7.

GS1 standards improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains across physical and digital channels in 25 sectors. GS1’s scale and reach — local Member Organisations in 115 countries, 2 million user companies and 6 billion transactions every day — help ensure that GS1 standards create a common language that supports systems and processes across the globe. Find out more at <a href="http://www.gs1.org">www.gs1.org</a></p><p>About <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>: Transmute is a US-based technology company that uses next generation identity and credentialing technologies to provide comprehensive solution design and software to define, digitize, and share verifiable data at scale. Transmute partners with innovative enterprises and governments to build digital trust ecosystems where this data can be securely exchanged across diverse stakeholders and technology vendors. Transmute specializes in trusted information about global supply chain products, actors, and transactions.</p> Project Overview <p>In 2021, GS1 and Transmute worked together to test the business and technical feasibility of combining <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 standards</a> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> for product-related claims.There was mutual interest in moving from theory to practice to illustrate the tangible value of leveraging Verifiable Credentials for creating trust that travels with&nbsp;data.</p><p>This project was guided by these key questions:</p>  How can GS1 create trust that travels with data by issuing authoritative information about companies and products?  How might <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a>, Verifiable Credential, and Decentralized Identifier standards be leveraged together to create business value related to product&nbsp;claims?  <p>Through our collaboration we discovered particular value in the area of new product introduction — or the process of procuring new products as a retailer. As consumers we rarely think about how the things we buy arrived on the physical (or virtual) shelf. Behind the scenes it can take months for retailers and brands to establish relationships, validate products, complete distribution, and ensure quality before making those goods available to consumers. We found multiple opportunities to improve the speed and security of these processes by leveraging Verifiable Credentials in conjunction with GS1 standards and identifiers.</p> Solutions Design Process: GS1 + Transmute Collaboration <p>Our companies worked through a step-wise approach to move from broad theory to a targeted application of our combined technologies for new product introduction.</p><p>Collaborative working sessions including GS1 experts and the Transmute team were conducted over several months to identify the most feasible and impactful possibilities. We drew from the international standards, supply chain, and technical expertise of GS1 team members. Transmute combined this information with our decentralized technologies expertise to propose specific credentials, workflows, and businesses narratives to address the product claims focus. These solutions are technically supported by the Transmute platform and open source libraries.</p><p>Our group went through multiple iterations as a part of early solution design work. This stage includes detailed business narratives for a variety of supply chain use cases, workflow mapping, brand interviews, sample credentials, and early prototypes, culminating in a Solution Design Report. This phase of work ultimately drove the narrowed focus to the new product introduction use case as the highest value opportunity for illustration of immediate industry&nbsp;value.</p><p>Next we built a Proof-of-Concept demonstration — including an interactive prototype and technical libraries — to show how these credentials can be issued, exchanged and verified seamlessly across brands. You can see the prototype in action&nbsp;here:</p> New Product Introduction Description <p>The following written description provides further detail about the business story portrayed in the video above. If you already watched the video you can also jump to the subsequent section.</p><p>Brand Healthy Tots wants to sell its natural baby food products for the first time with retailer Sell Anything &amp; Everything (SA&amp;E). SA&amp;E will start by selling the Healthy Tots product in its online store, with the future possibility of also selling it in brick and mortar locations.</p><p>Typically new product onboarding is a lengthy process, requiring submission of PDF documentation and requesting data from a variety of parties, often leading to duplicated costs and effort. These documents and sites are also very easy to fake, giving false confidence in product&nbsp;claims.</p><p>Healthy Tots provides SA&amp;E with verifiable evidence of its GLN and the product GTINs, and the process kicks off instantly. SA&amp;E uses the <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> resolver to immediately discover locations of all related product information. SA&amp;E’s system can then request relevant information from the associated locations, providing evidence where needed that it is authorized to do so. For example, it is able to request third party issued organic certification, allergen information, and product&nbsp;images.</p><p>SA&amp;E receives this information in the form of Verifiable Credentials signed by the original issuing parties, and is able to confidently populate the new product listing. SA&amp;E can do so automatically because the issuer of the information can be identified and confirmed, allowing data they issue to be passed through relatively unknown or untrusted parties like Healthy Tots systems. The SA&amp;E system can even automatically check that the issuing parties possess appropriate accreditations and/or GLNs to make sure such statements about the product are authoritative. This includes going all the way back to GS1 Global as a root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Healthy Tots can fill in any additional product details that SA&amp;E needs, and the product can be listed for sale within minutes. Relevant pieces of verifiable information such as certified organic and allergen information can also be passed through to the consumer’s view, providing deeper confidence in the legitimacy of the product and associated accreditations.</p> Testing Business&nbsp;Benefits <p>This novel approach to sharing product data can lead to the following benefits:</p>  Reduced administrative burden and faster timeline from engagement to product on&nbsp;shelves.  Automation for the retailer, working with hundreds or even thousands of vendors and tens of thousands of products. This protects brand reputation and allows elevation to human review when risk is detected.  Unambiguous documentation requirements that meet regulatory needs and further speed up processes.  More broadly, an encoded process for establishing trust in data that persists across systems, data pools, and unknown intermediaries.  <p>One of the next steps for this work is deeper testing of these benefits to measure cost savings, efficiency gains and strategic insight.</p> Building Trusted Ecosystems with&nbsp;GS1 <p>The demo scenario is underpinned by GS1 as a root of trust in the network — continuing a rich history for GS1 in this role. GS1 licenses and identifiers are and will continue to be at the foundation of trusting products and companies. Combining current practices with verifiable credential, decentralized identifier, and <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> standards disambiguating products builds business reputation for just-in-time engagement while keeping information up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>We believe that institutions like GS1 are critical in paving the foundations for trusted data to move across ecosystems in the future. Ultimately, trust has to flow from one or more sources whose reputation allows businesses to act with confidence. The advantage of the approach taken in this POC is that the distance between verifiers and root-of-trust organizations can be much greater without losing confidence in the information being presented. As long as the chain of trust retains integrity, the possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p> Next Steps <p>This new product introduction demonstration is now being used to test, validate, break, and refine assumptions about how the involved standards and technologies can best be leveraged to generate value for individual businesses and the broader ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“GS1 is moving forward with work to extend existing standards in order to better support the evolving needs of our member companies and create a consistent, common path forward for the scale of digital credentials.” — Melanie Nuce, Senior Vice President, Innovation and Partnerships, GS1&nbsp;US</blockquote><blockquote>“Verifiable Credentials are an exciting opportunity for GS1 to extend its identification system, improve data quality, and secure the supply chain in ways never before possible.” — Kevin Dean, Special Projects Consultant, GS1&nbsp;Canada</blockquote><p>Transmute is working with customers to continue designing, building, and growing digital trust ecosystems — from Solution Design work to bringing businesses onto the Transmute Platform to experience issuance, exchange, and verification of Verifiable Credentials integrated with existing business infrastructure.

 The once fictional concept of a “Metaverse” is fast becoming a reality — and Ontology is set to be an integral part of this evolving ecosystem. <p>The term metaverse combines the prefix “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">meta</a>” (meaning “beyond”) with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a>”. The Metaverse refers to a collective, virtual space, encompassing the totality of virtual worlds, augmented realities, and the internet. The concept originates in Snow Crash, a science-fiction novel by Neil Stephenson depicting a futuristic world in which people operate virtual avatars in an online world known as the Metaverse.</p><p>The kind of metaverse imagined by Stephenson is yet to be realized in the real world. However, the building blocks of a potential future Metaverse are already beginning to appear. Considering recent developments in science and technology, we can roughly define the Metaverse as: the next generation internet based on XR (including VR, AR, and MR), computer technology, internet communication technology, and social networks. More broadly, the Metaverse is a virtual reality world representing ‘real’ world experiences, such as working, studying, and investing. Users can transition freely between the offline and online&nbsp;realm.</p><p>A widely accepted definition of the Metaverse comes from Dave Baszucki, CEO of Roblox. He outlines eight characteristics of the Metaverse, which include: identity, friends, immersion, low latency, diversity, anytime and anywhere, economy and civilization. Based on this outline, we explore the contributions Ontology expects to make to the Metaverse of the&nbsp;future.</p> Identity <p>In the era of Big Data, unprecedented amounts of information can be stored and shared. This has enabled the growth of online encyclopedias, video streaming services, and social networks. Such technologies allow information to be accessed globally. But due to their scale, they are vulnerable to attack from bad actors aiming to obtain private information, a commodity that has become increasingly valuable in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Centralized organizations such as Facebook and Google control the identities, data and assets, of their users. The accumulated data are used to create targeted advertising campaigns. Platforms owned by the likes of Facebook are ostensibly free to use, with users sacrificing their privacy for the convenience that comes with using them. Most platforms require users to register a separate account for each platform, meaning each user may operate many accounts simultaneously.</p><p>To return to the concept of a Metaverse, how can we develop a system allowing users to migrate between parts of the Metaverse with a consistent identity, whilst ensuring their data and privacy are respected? Ontology’s “ONT ID”, a decentralized identity (DID) framework, and “OScore”, a self-management scoring system, aim to do just&nbsp;that.</p><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C decentralized identifier specification, blockchain and cryptography. It can quickly identify and connect people, assets, objects, and events, with the characteristics of decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, security, and usability. In short, ONT ID is not governed by any centralized authority, and allows users to securely manage their identities and data, independently.</p><p>At the same time, Ontology’s DDXF (Distributed Data Exchange Framework), provides a decentralized way to exchange data, which collaborates with ONT ID to improve users’ privacy protection. In addition, OScore generates scores for users based on their on-chain data, which they can authorize third parties to access. Users can also bind their OScore data and off-chain data using ONT ID, in order to seamlessly transition between the on-chain world and the off-chain world.</p><p>ONT ID, DDXF and OScore, are all central features of Ontology’s decentralized solutions, designed to allow users to manage their identity, data and assets, independently, in a decentralized way. Based on the interoperability and verifiability of decentralized identity, our solutions not only solve the pain points of social trust, but also enrich the whole trust ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology’s ONT ID is equipped for the Metaverse of the future, allowing users to easily traverse different environments within the Metaverse, in addition to enabling migration in and out of the virtual world. Whether online or offline, trust is an integral feature of a functioning society. OScore, the credit review system, bolsters trust and reliability when transacting, benefitting both individuals and organizations alike.</p> Economy <p>In the Metaverse economy, users can earn wealth through work, education, investment, and trade. By doing so, the whole ecosystem expands. However, it’s worth noting that this kind of ecosystem is not closed-loop. The Metaverse is not a purely virtual world. It must be closely connected with the real world, in order to realize its potential. Users can earn money not only by working in the real world, but also by playing games in the virtual world. These two kinds of assets are highly liquid and contribute to the overarching ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology is not only engaged in research and technological development. It is also dedicated to launching blockchain-based products that build connections between online and offline ecosystems. In the service sector, Ontology has partnered with<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/on-the-move-new-adoption-of-ontology-in-the-new-energy-logistics-vehicle-industry-9f46c1da0c4"> Kai Yun Delivery</a>, a comprehensive logistics service provider focusing on urban transportation and terminal-end deliveries. Kai Yun provides data attestation solutions, implementing the business scenario of “online consumption + instant delivery”, and empowers the new energy vehicle industry by solving the problem of low efficiency and high cost. In the field of digital assets, Ontology provides technology support for <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/250-million-pieces-of-ogq-digital-asset-content-to-be-housed-on-the-ontology-blockchain-428d385092ba">OGQ</a>, a leading digital assets and content platform in South Korea, helping content creators protect their copyrighted material. In the mobile and travel industry, Ontology and Daimler Mobility AG Blockchain Factory, which was established to bring the benefits of blockchain innovation and application to the automotive finance and mobility industry, jointly developed the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Welcome Home</a>” application. The app integrates cutting-edge technologies such as digital identity to bring a new driving experience to car&nbsp;drivers.</p><p>Finally, in the field of job recruitment, Ontology has successfully integrated its cross-chain wallet, <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, into global freelancing marketplace leader, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-microworkers-partner-to-enhance-global-freelancing-marketplaces-adef34dbe2f9">Microworkers</a>, providing more economic opportunities to freelancers. Based on information such as resume matching and job intention, freelancers establish labor relations with recruiting companies. After they complete the work, companies can compensate freelancers with ONT or other tokens, according to the contract. Candidates can use ONTO to transfer the received digital assets to their wallet address or personal assets terminals. During this process, ONG serves as the gas fee. This is Ontology’s dual token model. Such a model can be applied online and offline, acting as a circular token in the economic system of Metaverse, helping to enrich the ecosystem.</p><p>In addition to the economic and ID-based solutions, mentioned above, the Metaverse can also benefit from blockchain technology on other&nbsp;levels.</p>  Low latency: Relative to the high fees and congestion that has become the norm on Ethereum, the transaction confirmation rate on Ontology is very fast. On Ethereum, the average transaction cost is tens of US dollars, with some transactions costing over $100. However, on the Ontology chain, each transaction only consumes 0.05 ONG (equivalent to $0.05). At the same time, Ontology has been continuously researching the latest Layer 2 technology. Ontology is exploring the possibility of integrating with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and is committed to overcoming the technical barriers between Ontology and Ethereum. Ontology hopes Ethereum users can enjoy the same high-efficiency and low-fees as Ontology users. This coincides with the low latency attribute of the Metaverse. Whether in the real world or the virtual world, transaction speed greatly affects the user experience.  Diversity: On the Ontology chain, users can create multiple ONT IDs to log in on different terminals, based on their specific needs. For example, you can use different ONT IDs to independently manage ONTO and Wing or, if you prefer, you can use the same ONT ID for both. Whether in real life or in the Metaverse, you can generate multiple identities based on your own needs. The diversity of ONT ID is consistent with the diverse nature of the Metaverse. A variety of identities enrich the virtual world’s ecosystem and greatly enhance the sense of immersion.  Anytime and Anywhere: ONTO is a decentralized identity mobile terminal. It provides an all-in-one service for management of decentralized identities and data. Wherever you are, you can manage your assets, data and identities, in the palm of your hand. This kind of portability is indispensable in the Metaverse.  Civilization: The Metaverse originates in the human imagination. Blockchain is the underlying technology that will enable the Metaverse to become reality. Since its inception, Ontology has been developing blockchain technologies such as DID and data management tools, aiming to contribute to the global advancement of science and technology. At the same time, Ontology also hopes to inspire more people to participate in the blockchain revolution by developing new technologies and fostering a global community.  <p>Ontology is committed to accelerating the arrival of the coming Metaverse via the research and development of blockchain and further upgrades to its decentralized identity and data solutions.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>Organizations around the world have been rapidly modernizing their access management infrastructures in response to increased cyber-attacks and data breaches, enactment of security and privacy regulations, and a shift to remote working.</p>
<p>Access management modernization is quick shift away from insecure passwords, which time and again facilitate criminals to gain access to corporate networks and data. A recent survey on the <a href="https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/it/security/the-psychology-of-passwords-neglect-is-helping-hac/download" title="Psychology of Passwords">Psychology of Passwords</a> found that 59% of the respondents use the same password repeatedly, at home and in the office. The main reason behind this dangerous trend is the fear of forgetting the login information.</p>
<p>It is therefore time for businesses to evolve their approach to identity proofing to mitigate the risks of an increasingly remote workforce. As the corporate boundaries disintegrate, organizations require a new defensive playbook to address emerging business risk and remain secure.</p>
 A Zero-Trust approach to risk mitigation 
<p>When the concept of Zero-Trust was first conceived, it was about zero trust networks. However, today and in the future, corporate users and partners are accessing data through a plethora of networks – corporate, private, mobile. Hence, it is not efficient to discuss about securing access networks – it is almost impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The security perimeter of corporate assets had to shift to another frontline. The evolution of Zero-Trust is about securing the access points to apps and data. Since everyone is literally an outsider in cloud environments, there is a need to “never trust, always verify” the identity of the individual or the device requesting access to data and apps.</p>
<p>While Zero-Trust is not a single technology solution, it is the paradigm that can assist businesses support securely requirements for accessing a “constellation” of apps and data from everywhere. By validating the identity of the individual or device at every access point, organizations can mitigate the threats introduced by the proliferation of multi-cloud and hybrid computing environments and secure their digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
 Access management trends towards a Zero-Trust future 
<p>As technology evolves, organizations can evolve their access security to meet the increasing demands of cloud computing and pave their path towards a Zero-Trust culture. Businesses need to be aware of the various emerging trends on access management, evaluate them and tailor them to their business needs.</p>
<p>According to many security experts, the following trends will shape the access management and security ecosystem:</p>
 
 Identity-first security - Now that organizations operate fully (or mostly) remote, this trend has become vital to address. The result of these technical and culture shifts is that “identity first security” now represents the way all information workers will function, regardless of whether they are remote or at their office. 
 Managing machine identities as a critical security capability - As digital transformation progresses, organizations are experiencing increased numbers of non-human entities – containers, apps, services, mobile devices – IoT devices. Managing machine identities has become a vital part of the security strategy. As the number of devices increases, establishing an enterprise-wide strategy for managing machine identities, certificates and secrets will enable the organization to better secure digital transformation. 
 
<p>Shared security model in the cloud will be the defining factor for managing access requests. The old security model of “inside means trusted” and “outside means untrusted” has been broken since most digital assets and devices are outside the enterprise, as are most identities. The shared security model provides a more integrated, scalable, flexible and reliable approach to digital asset access control than traditional security perimeter controls.</p>
<p>Organizations are already opting for these integrated, cloud agnostic access security platforms which embed strong access management controls, such as verification and authentication of users for privileged account access via single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). These features add a multitude of risk mitigation benefits and create sources for contextual adaptive access controls.</p>
<p>Thales SafeNet Trusted Access platform can help business today reach a Zero-Trust access management future. SafeNet Trusted Access has been recognized by <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80547/thales-safenet-trusted-access-platform/">KuppingerCole</a> as “a market leading Enterprise Authentication and access management solution. It offers a variety of hard and soft token solutions as well as FIDO compliant authenticators. It is highly scalable and built for environments that require the highest security levels.”</p>
<p>The report highlights, as strong points and benefits of SafeNet Trusted Access, the compatibility with FIDO 2.0 protocol, a good out-of-the-box selection of connectors for a variety of apps, integrations with most IAM and IDaaS products, strong anti-tampering mechanisms, and machine learning risk detection models.</p>

<p>Bloom makes its first donation to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Claims and Credentials Working Group</p> The DIF and Working Groups <p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> is a Joint Development Foundation project that facilitates IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players in the decentralized identity space. It produces open-source code, pre-standard specifications, market collaboration, and non-technical documentation.</p><p>Working Groups (WG) are at the core of DIF. These groups are scoped by functional areas and are designed to drive emerging standard specifications backed up by open-source code. </p><p>Bloom is a member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims and Credentials WG</a>, which focuses on standards and technology that create, exchange, and verify claims and credentials in a decentralized identity ecosystem. The Claims and Credentials WG &nbsp;hosts specifications for projects like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> and Credential Manifest. Although these specifications outline the data models for requesting and issuing Claims, they don't specify how the data is sent between the holder and issuer/verifier. Enter WACI! </p> Wallet And Credential Interactions (WACI) <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/waci-presentation-exchange/">WACI</a> was introduced at the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_32_Book_of_Proceedings_Final%20A%201.pdf">annual IIW32 Workshop</a> &nbsp;with a very warm response. Its goal is to specify how interactions between a wallet and Relying Party (RP) such as an issuer or a verifier happen. At its core, WACI is a handshake of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>s, where the RP signs a JWT that is given to the wallet, and the wallet signs another JWT containing the initial token as a "challenge" claim. This allows the wallet to prove ownership of its DID. <br><br>The easiest way to see the benefit of WACI is to offer a way to log into an application without a password with Verified Credential (VC) based authentication that cannot be faked. </p><p>A picture (demo video in our case) is worth a thousand words:<br></p> Next Steps for Bloom and C&amp;C WG   Achieve v1 release of WACI-Presentation-Exchange <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-and-credential-interactions">specification</a>  Fold back in lessons and extensions from #1 and then flush out remaining sections to achieve v1 feature-completeness for v1 of the WACI specification and sample implementation  Register a custom URI schema (<code>waci:</code>//)

 Lessons from place-based strategic innovation in Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa <blockquote>This is the third in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #3 is a preview of our international portfolio around place-based strategic innovation, from the city to country levels, across Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa.</blockquote> In theory — What do we mean by place-based strategic innovation? <p>Innovation involves something new coming into existence. Whereas we see place-based strategic innovation to be something new coming into existence with the purpose of interacting with, and actively changing, the systems that shape a&nbsp;place.</p><p>In theory, we understand place-based strategic innovation to manifest with a focus&nbsp;on:</p>  Learning / Capability &amp; Capacity Building / Potential for Systems&nbsp;Change  Grand Challenge / Complex&nbsp;Problem  Traction / Tangibility / Visibility  Connectivity / Cross-cutting  Systemic Nature / Transformational  Catalytic / Multiple Horizons / Multiple&nbsp;Impacts  Stakeholder Diversity / Deep Engagement / Movement Building.  <p>What does it look like at the city&nbsp;level?</p><p>To pursue transitions on the scale and depth required to address deep-rooted challenges faced by cities, we must recognise that urban environments are made up of a complex web of dynamic and adaptive systems and act upon them accordingly.</p><blockquote>From single-point solutions &gt; to systems innovation and transformation</blockquote><blockquote>From portfolio of projects &gt; to portfolios of strategic experiments</blockquote><blockquote>From single-lever experimentation &gt; to multi-lever ‘full-stack’ experimentation</blockquote><p>An urban transition portfolio works to accelerate and deepen change in a city by marking out new pathways at the forefront of action. The insights and actionable intelligence that emerge, help inform the strategic decision making and investment required.</p><p>Strategic innovation in&nbsp;cities</p><p>There is no single, unifying theory of change that guides us. It combines at least the following:</p>  Product innovation — identifying discrete problems and developing products as solutions to test&nbsp;out.  Capability building — identifying outdated approaches / ways of working that aren’t conducive to strategic innovation and seeding alternative habits, rituals &amp; norms in strategically significant people and organisations.  Movement-building — developing new narratives that galvanise ‘coalitions of the willing’ and form the bedrock of legitimacy for&nbsp;change.   Overview of a few initiatives in that&nbsp;domain  Healthy, Clean Cities — Deep Demonstration across&nbsp;Europe <p>While political leaders across the continent are setting ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions, how to deliver on this at a pace and scale necessary remains&nbsp;unknown.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has been supporting <a href="http://climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> to work with the most ambitious mayors and municipalities in Europe to co-create a portfolio of joined-up strategic experiments that provide them with new knowledge, innovations and capabilities that can aid them in their Climate Action Plans — from mobility to waste to energy to health to the built environment — and help other cities to navigate the great transitions required for ‘Transformation in Time’. For more information on this initiative, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/accelerating-city-transitions-3baadbfdcd68?source=collection_home---2------4-----------------------">click&nbsp;here.</a></p> NextGenCities Program: Zimbabwe +&nbsp;Angola <p>As part of the <a href="https://undpinnovationdays.com/Harare">2019 Harare Innovation Days</a> (HID), Dark Matter Labs worked with UNDP country office staff, ‘strategic urban risk holders’ and edge experimenters from 23 countries across Africa under the banner of #NextGenCities to build shared understanding of the interdependencies and complexities facing Africa’s diverse urban realities, with clear clusters of common challenges — such as urban economies and informality, water management, the jobs deficit and waste services — you can read more about the context of HID in a <a href="https://medium.com/@undp.innovation/african-cities-disrupting-the-urban-future-5a774b101e58">blog</a> published before the&nbsp;event.</p><p>We then developed a #NextGenCities pilot program that sought to build capabilities for designing mission-based strategic portfolios of interventions to tackle wicked issues and dynamics that COVID merely surfaced and accelerated. As<a href="https://www.africancentreforcities.net/people/edgar-pieterse/"> Edgar Pieterse</a> of the African Center for Cities in Cape Town, African cities desperately need <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/poldev/2626">“a more coordinated, sequenced and integrated approach to infrastructure planning, investment, delivery, maintenance and repair.”</a> Two countries qualified for the program, Zimbabwe and Angola and we spent four months with teams from UNDP’s Accelerator Labs working on food security and urban markets for Zimbabwe and Angola respectivelys.

The NDS is also being prepared against a backdrop where European countries are dealing with the health, economic and social crisis presented by the Covid-19 pandemic to lay the foundations to “build back better”, in a way that delivers a healthy future for everyone.</p><p>Building System Intelligence in Bhutan, Philippines and&nbsp;India</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has worked with UNDP Asian Pacific Regional Innovation Centre, UNDP Bhutan, Philippines and India, which look at youth unemployment and food security issues. These two systematic challenges have a clear intention of building system intelligence: sense-making capacity and transitional capacity to understand the interdependent nature of local/national/global problems and create governance opportunities for shared learning beyond the boundaries of ‘nation’. The project aims to create a shared, cross-cutting portfolio of interventions and transnational governance innovation for both India &amp; the Philippines rather than making comparisons as the food systems/crisis cannot be solved by one nation in isolation. You can read more about one of these initiatives in the following blog: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/breaking-the-silos-through-participatory-systems-mapping-fccf9c2d01ab">Breaking the Silos Through Participatory Systems&nbsp;Mapping</a>.</p> In practice — Key&nbsp;lessons <p>Strategic innovation cannot be the starting point, it needs to sit within a context. People and organisations are more willing to ‘lean into’ strategic innovation if it builds upon local identities, pre-existing strategies, strength and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Strategic innovation cannot be held by only one stakeholder. Designing and deploying strategic innovation in a meaningful way requires deliberate ecosystems of technical expertise and local partners / brokers. This entails working with a consortium of partners, which presents its own challenges.The sheer amount of coordination and management of politics and personalities cannot be under-estimated.</p><p>Strategic innovation is political. Political realities dictate the permission for strategic innovation, the power dynamics that shape strategic innovation and the pace by which strategic innovation can be pursued in a place. It dictates the pace and orientation of&nbsp;change.</p><p>For innovation to be strategic, we need to understand the broader picture. Reframing the problem / opportunity space can help unleash strategic innovation — sowing the seeds of new mental modes that flourish further down the line. It is no longer about this single problem or solution.</p><p>For problem owners, strategic innovation is as much about organisation &amp; culture change as it is about problems and solutions. Understanding how each organisation needs to change in order to be more systemic &amp; strategic in the way they approach innovation is a real journey that takes&nbsp;time.</p><p>Strategic innovation at a national level can help test many approaches against machineries of policy making and programme delivery across the whole spectrum of national priorities, cascaded down across regions to municipalities. It helps create various adaptations of the same idea at different levels.</p><p>Strategic innovation at the national scale means we need to be much more strategic, political and adaptable in our own language. We will need to also be more practical and proactive on strategies. For instance, we had to create a glossary on what our terms meant so that when these new concepts were translated into local languages to make sure the value of the innovation would not be&nbsp;lost.</p><p>In strategic innovation, there is a delicate balance between the watering down of the purity of ideas VS greater societal and political acceptance that brings a framework for implementation (and often funding to do the work). On the one hand, we want to be precise and creative the language to open up new ways of seeing, and at the same time we want to ensure that the words we use don’t alienate the people we work with, as well as the people they&nbsp;serve.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-2-f5f270d13428">#2</a> here, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

<p>UTU’s AI-driven trust infrastructure to build comprehensive profiles on data providers, data consumers and data sets in Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://utu.io/">UTU</a> to launch their Web3 trust infrastructure for a safer internet on <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> and to build mechanisms to share data between the two platforms.</p><p>UTU’s vision is to make the internet a safer, more trusted place to gather, share, work, and trade. Its AI-driven trust infrastructure can ingest the activity of Ocean Market data providers, data consumers, datasets, and other entities to build comprehensive profiles. Additionally, Ocean Market users will be able to rate and review each of these entities. All of this data will be dynamically analyzed to create a trust score for each entity. It uses blockchain to reward trustworthy actors and to ensure reviews and ratings cannot be manipulated.</p><p>There are four components that UTU will build with Ocean, on both Ethereum Mainnet and&nbsp;Polygon:</p>  A standalone web app that rates Ocean data assets and accounts;  A widget that incorporates ratings directly into the Ocean&nbsp;Market;  A curation engine that recommends the most relevant data assets and accounts to Ocean Market&nbsp;users;  Updates to all of the above once Ocean v4 is released.  <p>This partnership will lead to increased platform trust and transparency, which will reduce friction in transactions, help users more easily discover quality datasets from trusted data providers to either use for data analysis or stake, avoid pool rug pulls and other malicious activity, and more. Fees for software development and UTU API usage will be funded by the Ocean Protocol Foundation, and the bulk of the work will be completed by Q4 2021. We will also explore ways to share data between our platforms in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol’s mission is all about creating a trustless system for sharing data, so we’re very excited about our joint venture with UTU. It’ll allow good actors on Ocean Market to display the trust they’ve earnt in the marketplace, which in turn will incentivize others to trust those actors again and again — a virtuous cycle of transparency and trust without centralized intermediaries.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>The UTU protocol compensates users for providing accurate ratings and reviews, and for sharing their data with the UTU platform. The collaboration will make it easier for UTU users to further monetize their data on Ocean Market by becoming a data provider; users will retain full control over what data to share with either platform, what data they would like to monetize, and how it should be&nbsp;used.</p><blockquote>UTU and Ocean Protocol share the beliefs that 1) data is a new asset class and 2) data privacy is of utmost importance. We’ve studied their data models in the past and are impressed by the ecosystem that they’ve built. This is why we’re so excited to partner with them to increase trust in their data marketplace and to facilitate data sharing between our platforms in a privacy-preserving way. This partnership is particularly exciting for us as I remember Trent giving a small talk to our incubator cohort at Zeroth AI back in 2018 and thinking that an UTU-Ocean collaboration would be a massive validation and use case for our model — 3 years to come full circle on&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>– Jason Eisen, Co-Founder and CEO of&nbsp;UTU</blockquote><p>We will explore additional ways to share data between our protocols:</p>  Putting publicly-available, on-chain UTU data (such as endorsements, transactions, and more) on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Purchasing datasets on Ocean Market that may be helpful to the UTU protocol.  Analysing who provided and consumed which datasets, and who provided liquidity on which datasets on Ocean (using the staking/curation mechanism) to derive UTU recommendations and feedback.   About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a new Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the new Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

I love this time of year; the progression of flowers bursting like a well-funded fireworks show, the lettuce unfolding and gracing the dinner table every evening, the strawberries that are not quite ripe enough but you stuff your face with them anyway.</p><p>I see the Holochain developer ecosystem going through a similar flush of growth. I’ll be honest: we’re still young and small, but that means the developers generally know each other and support each other well, and we’re able to support them well too. This seems to be creating a lot of vitality, sort of like those two small garden boxes in your backyard that thrive because they’re just enough for you to take care of.</p><p>Here are a few things that have caught my eye lately.

I especially love the one that shows how Holochain handles the <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/concepts/validation-rules/#but-what-happens-with-51-of-malicious-nodes">dreaded 51% attack</a> (or worse) without <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/">miners or consensus</a>.  <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/">Developers</a> introduces you to the building blocks of hApp development — data structures, host API calls, built-in patterns. There are code-along exercises that give you experience writing DNA code.  Holochain Playground simulator showing six bad actors who try to stage a 60% attack. Through a few rounds of validation and ‘warranting’ (publishing evidence of malicious activity), the four good actors isolate themselves from the bad actors.<p>This project is a collaboration between a few active community members, and it’s still in its early stages. If you’re already familiar with hApp development and would <a href="https://github.com/holochain-gym/">like to contribute</a>, I’m sure they’d be super grateful.</p> Holochain Open Dev: libraries for use in your own hApps <p>I’ve reported on the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev GitHub org</a> since the Holochain Redux days. Now with a rapidly maturing Holochain RSM and a bunch of hApps being built, it’s gaining new modules while the existing ones are getting refactored. Here are a few ones that looked interesting:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles</a> lets users choose a nickname (AKA screen name, username, or handle) and save profile information as key/value pairs. It also comes with a sample UI to show you how to use it on the front end. The interesting thing about this module is that nicknames are not exclusive — just like in real life, it’s perfectly okay for two people to have the nickname <code>stina_nilsson</code> if that’s what their name actually is. This demonstrates the beauty and weirdness of an agent-centric, consensus-free system.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts</a>, from the Kizuna team, lets users store lists of friends (contact list) and enemies (block list), as in a social media or communication app. I didn’t see any documentation, but the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts/blob/main/zome/zomes/contacts/src/lib.rs#L26-L64">module’s API</a> looks pretty self-documenting.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index</a>, from the Perspect3vism and Junto teams (more on them below), is one solution for retrieving data by time range. This is good for social media, blogs, financial records, and other time-based data. It also eliminates DHT hotspots that would normally come from putting a zillion links on one anchor. This repo is exquisitely documented and gives rationales for the design.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events</a> implements a basic calendar. This looks like it would be great for shared personal calendars, events, or resource booking. As with <code>profiles</code>, it includes a sample UI.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage</a> is a generic blob-storage module. It ‘chunks’ files behind the scenes — this prevents DHT hot spots (imagine some poor peer with a 32GB smartphone having to store your hour-long holiday video in their DHT shard) but also may make it possible to implement streaming videos. (And besides, there’s a 16MB limit on DHT entries anyway.)  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template</a> is just what it sounds like — a template that lets you scaffold modules that you want other developers to use.   Holochain In Action: a community of co-learning <p>I’ve been following the work of the Holochain in Action group for a little while, and I’m excited about what they’re doing. This group meets every Tuesday to learn, teach, share, and develop together. There’s a big focus on exploring and implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> that are appropriate for Holochain, which I think is important work.</p><p>If you’re a developer and want to get involved, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">jump to the forum</a> and fill out the application form. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">watch their past videos on YouTube</a> — looks like there are a lot of good presentations.</p><p>Finally, you can check out the app they’re working on, called <a href="https://github.com/holochain-in-action/peer-share">Peer Share</a>, which lets people share content of all sorts with each other. They’re using it to explore various patterns, including an interesting one called the JSON-Schema pattern. Instead of having to define entry types at compile time, DHT administrators can create new types on the fly using the <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> vocabulary to validate content that’s supposed to conform to those types.</p> Ad4m and Perspect3vism: a unique take on application development <p>I find this a very intriguing project. I’m still wrapping my head around it; it feels like it could have profound implications for the way we construct our online experiences. And when I say that, I mean users, not developers. It appears to be <a href="https://ad4m.dev/">an agent-centric approach</a> to building an online life, consisting of ‘languages’ (ways of expressing oneself, such as a tweet, a to-do list, or a chess move) and ‘perspectives’ (spaces in which one wants to participate) that a person can combine in ways that suit them best.</p><p>The architectural approach reminds me of Holoscape, and the vocabulary reminds me of the Junto social app, which shouldn’t be surprising: it’s a collaboration between Holo team member <a href="https://github.com/lucksus/">Nicolas Luck</a> and <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto</a> lead developer <a href="https://github.com/jdeepee">Josh Parkin</a>.</p> Holo-REA: a toolkit for cooperative economics <p>I get pretty passionate about non-coercive, appropriately sized, regenerative economies. It’s possibly the biggest reason I got involved with Holochain — because I saw that it had the potential to be a platform for these sorts of initiatives.</p><p>So I’m thrilled that Holo-REA is nearing maturity. Holo-REA is a toolkit for economic applications, particularly ones in which the players do their accounting out in the open (though it doesn’t exclude a bit of privacy either). The folks behind Holo-REA are building it to support a <a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/value-flows-model-lynn-foster-mikorizal-part-1/">big vision</a> of true-cost accounting, or considering all the costs of producing a good or delivering a service. This is something the current economic system <a href="https://youtu.be/KVTLLrP9uOg">isn’t great at</a>.</p><p>Holo-REA implements a business ontology called <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a>. It looks complicated, but it’s really just a formalisation of things that <a href="http://mikorizal.org/ValueFlows-Story.pdf">people do all the time</a>. This gives me hope that Holo-REA, and the applications that’ll be built on it,</p><p>You can find the source code for Holo-REA, along with lots of good literature on the why and how of the project, at <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea</a> . Lots of people who are building on Holochain are already getting excited about it and <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/digital-environment-for-material-commons-based-peer-production-with-sensorica/5659">planning to use it</a> in their own projects.</p> Dev Camp postponed until September; lots of opportunities before then <p>The response to the next community-run dev camp has been overwhelmingly positive — and overwhelming!</p><blockquote>More than 700 people have registered, which has resulted in the organisers changing their plans.</blockquote><p>It’s moving from June to September, and they’ll be working with us at Holo to provide more learning opportunities — both during and before.</p><p>You can still register, and the organisers will send you updates by email so you know what’s going on.</p><p>The theme of the Dev Camp sounds really cool:</p><blockquote>During DevCamp 8 we’re going to be building a multiplayer game: “Tragedy of the Holocommons”<br><br>We will bring every economist’s favorite game to life as a Holochain app! The heart of this game is a demonstration of consensus-seeking in an eventually consistent environment - a crucial part of building any decentralized application!<br><br>Of course, we’ll also cover all the other essential building blocks of a Holochain application, with little adjustments to make it more fun and cool!</blockquote><p>Reaching agreement without relying on global consensus is a challenging thing to understand, but it’s at the core of what makes Holochain Holochain. This will be a great opportunity to understand more about that in a hands-on way.</p><p><a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Register for the Dev Camp today!</a> And if you have any programmer friends who are disenchanted with blockchain, share it with them too. Maybe they’re ready for something fresh and new.</p> Can we have some updates on Holochain and Holo too? <p>Of course! Here are some of the most recent updates:</p>  Holochain has been having some serious performance issues in stress-testing, and it looks like it’s caused by a memory leak in Wasmer, the virtual machine that runs hApp DNAs. The Wasmer team have been great at tracking down the bug and sharing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/64">workarounds</a>, and we expect that they’ll fix the bug soon as well.  DHT sharding is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/833">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/799">active</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834">development</a>. There’s been a lot of work to make gossip efficient in a DHT that includes lots of multi-user machines, as well as the previous work of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">moving the storage backend from LMDB to SQLite</a> which made performant gossip possible in the first place.  Both dev teams are focusing on improving performance everywhere. Some of these improvements (like batching database writes) will stick around, while others will become obsolete once DHTs can be sharded.  There’s a new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/830">standalone bootstrap server</a> that doesn’t require you to use Holo’s or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/bootstrap/">deploy</a> your own on CloudFlare. This was created for testing, but it could be useful for applications that want to run their own infrastructure. Note that it doesn’t persist any peer information on restart; it’s all in-memory. (If you’re not familiar with the bootstrap server, it makes introductions between peers so they can start communicating with each other.)  The Holochain dev team is getting ready for the second public release of Holochain RSM, which will include all the changes since the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">first release in February</a>. Many developers have been tracking the changes in the <code>develop</code> branch; this will support developers who prefer something a bit more stable, as well as ones who prefer not to work in Holonix.  BREAKING CHANGE: all the DHT retrieval functions are disabled in validation callbacks except <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/812">three new ones</a>: <code>must_get_entry</code>, <code>must_get_header</code>, and <code>must_get_valid_element</code>. This serves two purposes: first, validation functions should <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/#guidelines-for-writing-validation-rules">always be deterministic</a>, and this removes the DHT as a source of non-determinism; and second, it removes a lot of boilerplate because you don’t have to manually handle all the different error types when a piece of DHT data can’t be retrieved. All you need to do is use <code>?</code> at the end of your DHT retrieval function, and the validation will automatically return the right sort of error to the host. Note: this change is not in <code>develop</code> and won’t be until after the next version of Holochain is released.  The Holo team has been working on dev-ops infrastructure that makes it easy for them to switch their HoloPorts to testing channels and back. This is because Holochain development is progressing rapidly and they need to be able to reliably reproduce environments to test apps against different commits. This won’t matter much to you, dear reader, except that it’ll speed up testing and get us to the next alpha milestone a bit sooner!  <p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@seffen99?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Sven Brandsma</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/planting-garden?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>InfoCert sarà fra i protagonisti del talk “Il Domicilio digitale e i trusted services”, discussione che ha come obiettivo quello di fornire un quadro di riferimento e le fasi di attuazione del domicilio digitale dei cittadini e dei soggetti non obbligati. Al tempo stesso intende fare un bilancio e alcune riflessioni per il futuro in merito all’adozione in Italia dei servizi fiduciari come previsti dal regolamento eIDAS, con alcuni dei principali protagonisti sullo scenario europeo e nazionale, anche alla luce dell’evoluzione dello scenario europeo di riferimento.</p>



<p>Introdurrà il talk Massimiliano Roma – Responsabile Comunicazione e Relazioni Istituzionali con gli Enti pubblici di FPA, moderatore della sessione Francesco Tortorelli – Direttore Responsabile Direzione Pubblica Amministrazione e Vigilanza di AgID; intervengono Claudio Petrucci – Responsabile Gestione servizi infrastrutturali di AgID, Riccardo Genghini di Studio Genghini &amp; Associati, Andrea Sassetti – AD Aruba PEC, Trust Services Governance and General Affairs Director di Aruba Enterprise.</p>



<p>In particolare, Danilo Cattaneo interverrà per fornire la visione strategica di InfoCert quale importante QTSP a livello europeo, analizzando lo scenario internazionale che si sta delineando a seguito delle ultime evoluzioni del regolamento eIDAS, e su quello nazionale in vista delle opportunità che si prospettano con l’approvazione del PNRR.</p>



<p>La manifestazione si conferma punto di incontro e confronto tra pubblica amministrazione, imprese, mondo della ricerca e cittadini nonché occasione di approfondimento delle più importanti tematiche inerenti l’innovazione e l’introduzione delle nuove tecnologie nella PA. AgID sarà presente con due appuntamenti mirati ad approfondire importanti progetti di digitalizzazione, di grande interesse per amministrazioni e cittadini.</p>

<p>In our last post we briefly presented <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> and how it evolved from the challenges faced with uPort’s libraries. In this next series of articles we will give <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> a proper introduction and answer some of the basics: why it exists and what it does, followed by articles describing the architecture in more detail, and how to build applications using <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>. While our name may have changed, the original vision of allowing individuals and organizations to own their own data and maintain privacy, has&nbsp;not.</p><p>The Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) space has been moving fast by establishing standards for decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) which simply did not exist when uPort set out five years ago. What began as a niche has caught wider attention. In Apple’s WWDC last week their Verifiable Health records appear to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples/accessing_data_from_a_smart_health_card">using W3C VCs</a> under the hood. The European Commission recently proposed a new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2664">electronic identity regulation</a> that aims to make identity wallets mandatory for various public and private sector service providers. This progress validates our theory that the task of managing DIDs and VCs is important work.</p><p>Enter Veramo</p><p><a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> is built with several goals in mind. First, we aim to simplify creating and managing identifiers and issuing and receiving credentials through straightforward APIs which run across backend, frontend, and mobile. We aim to provide the ability to do this in a spec compliant way with interoperability in mind. The framework should also be flexible enough to allow for many configuration options (multiple environments, hybrid deployment models, data storage, key management, etc.) and also to accommodate future advances in the space. With <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>, we took feedback to heart and combined these features into a single framework over the outwardly confusing set of uPort libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-transports, and uport-mobile.</p><p>The Veramo&nbsp;Agent</p><p>The entry point to managing identifiers, credentials, messages, keys and more is the <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent. The Agent provides a common interface for core and custom plugins to operate and orchestrates them through an event system. An Agent can be run as a CLI, backend service, within a mobile app, or in the browser and we have tutorials for each on <a href="https://veramo.io/docs">veramo.io/docs</a>. Agents can also work remotely, so you can have multiple agents with specific capabilities that work together to provide tailored functionality as&nbsp;one.</p><p>The <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent takes care of low-level details so you can focus on building your app. Once instantiated, it exposes methods for creating and managing identifiers through the did-manager plugin. Out-of-the-box support is available for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">ethr-did</a> (Ethereum address), <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">web-did</a> (DNS domain), and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did-key</a> (simple public/private key&nbsp;pair).</p><p>For credentials, the credentials-w3c plugin combined with the messaging plugin handle issuing, receiving, signing, and sending W3C VCs from one DID to another. The data-storage and key-manager plugins handle storing the identifiers, credentials, messages and the keys for signing and encryption.</p><p>Running an agent will depend on your use-case and environment. To get started, take a look at our documentation and tutorials on <a href="https://veramo.io">veramo.io</a>. The CLI tool is the quickest way to see how it works, and we also have tutorials for Node, React, and React-Native. Hit us up at hello@veramo.io or <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> with feedback or questions.</p><p>Coming soon: Part 2 will go deeper on architecture details and Part 3 will show how to build applications using&nbsp;Veramo.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/introducing-veramo-5a960bf2a5fe">Introducing Veramo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Jeff Zirlin, Head of Growth at Sky Mavis, on democratizing play-to-earn in the Gaming&nbsp;industry</p><p>We’ve kicked off season two of Voices of the Data Economy with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie">Jeff Zirlin</a>, Head of Growth at Sky Mavis, the creator of <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, a game that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players financially the more they play. During our conversation, Jeff describes the disruptive business model behind Axie Infinity, democratizing Gaming rights through NFTs, and how developing nations are getting involved in play-to-earn. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> The Business Model of Axie&nbsp;Infinity <p>The business model of Axie Infinity is different from a traditional game studio or Gaming company. Rather than relying on selling copies of a game or in-game resources, they have created an in-game economy, where players can sell their NFTs and in-game resources to anyone, anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We just take 4.25% of all marketplace activity as a fee. For example, if today, there was around $3 million of NFT volume on our marketplace; 4.25% of that gets taken as a fee for running the game. Right now, that payment goes to Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity. In the future, we’ll even be sharing that fee with all the owners of our governance token,” says&nbsp;Jeff.</p> How are NFTs changing the Gaming industry? <p>“I think the fundamental innovation that NFTs bring to the Gaming market is allowing for user-owned, user-operated games and economies. It creates much more interesting aligned incentives where the players and the developers are both incentivized to grow the ecosystem around the&nbsp;game.”</p><p>Players who are new to Axie Infinity need 3 Axies to get started, costing approximately $150. The majority of players are from developing nations and developing economies where they cannot afford to get started playing on their own. That’s where organizations like <a href="https://twitter.com/YieldGuild?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Yield Guild</a> come in, who own massive amounts of Axies, the game’s native NFTs. Yield guilds offer scholarships to cover these costs; new players participating in the scheme are aptly called scholars.</p><p>But why is play-to-earn NFT Gaming interesting for developing nations? A large percentage of Axie Infinity’s player base has been coming from the developing world — Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, and Venezuela.</p><p>“Around 80% of our player base are from developing nations. That’s important because these are the types of people that need to be using blockchain. It can’t just be for people in Silicon Valley or Berlin. We need people who are coming for the benefits. One of the problems that the industry has is that people think about how we can make it easier to use the technology, but they don’t think enough about why people would use the technology in the first&nbsp;place.”</p> Scaling NFT Gaming by reducing barriers to&nbsp;entry <p>Recently, <a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/seriesa">Sky Mavis raised $7.5M to scale Axie Infinity</a>. Jeff mentions that a part of it will go into reducing barriers to entry for playing. People will be able to play for free to get started; they’ll be getting three starter Axies that are not blockchain assets. But they’ll learn how to play the game; they may get a taste for earning. They might be able to make 5% of the in-game resources that a blockchain user could&nbsp;use.</p><p>“I think that the market for NFTs will be a trillion-dollar industry in 10 years. At present, the in-game market is only $50 billion which is a small size. Why? Because people don’t want to spend money on stuff that they don’t earn, or that they don’t own. It can be quickly banned or confiscated by the game developers. Once they own their game assets, they are going to be spending trillions of dollars,” he&nbsp;says.</p><p>Jeff concludes that Gamers deserve to own their game assets, their game profile, their game identity — this is all property and information they should own. We just have never even thought that people should own this stuff. “At a mass scale, as a society, we are still grasping why people would want to own their data online but more people are starting to demand these types of rights. It’s only going to increase over&nbsp;time.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:   01:46–04:00: Business Model of Axie&nbsp;Infinity  04:00–05:20: How NFTs are changing the Gaming&nbsp;industry  05:20–06:25: Jeff’s relationship with&nbsp;Gaming  06:25–11:42: How to get started with play-to-earn in a developing nation  11:42–15:00: Managing a global community of&nbsp;gamers  15:00–18:20: The growth projections for NFT&nbsp;Gaming  18:20–23:18: Deploying $7.5 million to scale Axie&nbsp;Infinity  23:18–25:35: The EU and US vs developing nations as a user base for NFT&nbsp;Gaming  25:35–27:45: How to choose a credible NFT&nbsp;project  27:45–End: The Future of NFT&nbsp;Gaming  <p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>When uPort began at ConsenSys in 2015, the self-sovereign identity space was also in its infancy. Early concepts existed as little more than academic theories with few attempts at implementation. Despite the lack of standards or the guidance of a marketplace, uPort began experimenting with our first architecture using smart-contract based identities.</p><p>Over time the technical limitations with on-chain identities began to pile up, which led to <a href="https://medium.com/uport/next-generation-uport-identity-app-released-59bbc32a83a0">uPort’s 1.0 architecture</a> and pioneering the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with our open-source libraries. At the time DIDs, together with verifiable credentials (VCs) were proposed W3C standards and are now nearing official status. Dozens of projects are still using several of our popular libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-mobile, did-jwt, and did-resolver, to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>While successful, some of these libraries also presented challenges of their own. Maintaining libraries across different tech stacks (web, mobile, backend) became an impediment to the rapid iteration so critical in a space where standards evolve quickly. Around 18 months ago, we began work on the next iteration of our architecture, a project internally known as DAF (DID Agent Framework).</p><p>The primary goal of DAF was to create a flexible, modular architecture based around a library of core functionality that would run on each primary stack (web, mobile and backend), and could be easily extended through add-on packages. This approach allows us and the developer community to easily add the application specific functionality they need, whether it be additional DID methods, key management functions, new protocols, and many more possibilities without needing to modify the core&nbsp;library.</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the culmination of these efforts, informed by years of open-source work, learning, and iteration, as&nbsp;<a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>.</p><p>This next major iteration also makes it necessary to begin deprecating the previous uPort mobile app, libraries, and services. The following is an outline of the schedule and what will be affected. If you currently depend on any of these, or simply have a question or two please send us an email at hello@veramo.io.</p><p>uPort Mobile</p><p>uPort Mobile will be removed from the Apple AppStore and Google PlayStore as of June 1st, 2021. The code is already open-source and will remain available in an archived github&nbsp;repo.</p><p>Libraries and&nbsp;Services</p><p>First, we will be archiving the deprecated github repos. Open-source code will still be available for reference, but no further changes/updates will be made. In addition, we will be shutting down hosted services, some of which will cause issues in libraries and/or the mobile&nbsp;app.</p><p>Chasqui: a server that allows communication between dApps, mobile apps (like uPort Mobile) and servers. Shutting down Chasqui will cause breaking changes in uPort Mobile and uport-transports. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Caleuche: an event hub service which allows the backup and sync of uPort mobile app events. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Pututu: a server that allows dApps and servers to send push notification messages to any uPort Mobile App. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The services below are related to proxy-contract identities and will be shutdown a couple weeks&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Sensui: uPort Transaction Funding Service. Shutdown date: May 15th,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Nisaba: provides user verification for the uPort ecosystem. Shutdown date: May 15th,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Unnu: phone verifier and creator of identities.

<p>Are digitally encrypted certificates the way forward?</p>



<p>COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented shift in our ability to meet, socialize and interact throughout the world. Almost overnight, we became subject to contact tracing and the need to keep social distance from everyone including family and friends. Since contact of any kind carried the risk of COVID-19 transmission, especially as variants multiplied, there seemed little hope of communities, countries and the world being able to reopen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we take the first steps towards the safe opening of different regions, an increasing number of governments are requiring people to provide validated proof of COVID-19 vaccinations or test results. These certifications must be verifiable and linked to official identity documents to travel, gain access to local venues or anything involving social gatherings.</p>



<p>The good news is there’s been significant advances in the ability to digitally link verified vaccination certificates and COVID-19 test results to an individual’s identity. Many organizations and governments are now looking to create a contactless verification process as part of this digital transformation. Additionally, they need something that will prioritize data privacy. As these solutions are developed and rolled out, several important issues have hit the headlines such as:</p>



  Being able to trust how the data will be used and stored&nbsp;&nbsp;  How to protect against fraud when certificates are often hard copies only and partly handwritten&nbsp;  How to prove the certificate is tied to a specific individual&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>In this series, we’ll look at the real-world benefits of digitally verifying credentials. We’ll discuss problems surrounding proof of identity and keeping data safe. We’ll highlight how your customers can have peace of mind knowing their data is encrypted, never stored anywhere other than their own personal device and can only ever be shared with their explicit instructions and consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using an elegant, safe and user focused smart application that people can use to confidently gain access to venues and travel is the answer.&nbsp; People need security knowing that despite any requirements to provide proof of vaccination or test results they remain in complete control of their own data and are able to start enjoying life and allowing businesses to thrive again.</p>



<p>After months of lockdowns and restrictions governments are looking for safe ways to gradually open the doors and encourage people to come out of their homes and be social again.&nbsp;However, allowing people to travel and attend events still carries big risks, particularly as new variants spread rapidly. Governments are looking to be able to provide documentary evidence ensuring all travelers and visitors are fully vaccinated or have recent negative test results as a requirement of entry. This in itself brings new challenges. If verification remains a manual process, the individual will need to carry and produce several documents that authorities will then need to scrutinize for authenticity and manually check against the individual’s official identity documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to minimize physical contact, including the handling of passports and vaccination cards, is a critical element in containing a pandemic. If the existing verification processes also include fingerprint scanning and the need to type in a secure PIN on a publicly used device, then this further increases the risks of virus transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contactless technology is the key to creating an effective solution. Companies are starting to recognize the need to evolve and offer streamlined processes that embrace digital verification. Digital verification is actually not a new concept; the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> back in 2019 which references digital certification and best practices. The need for safe and secure digital verification of personal identity and certification documents becomes even more critical if we are to address and contain the pandemic.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s solution to the current challenges is both innovative and simplistic. It leverages the immutability of blockchain technology to build the highest levels of security, privacy and consumer trust into a flexible digital verification system.</p>



<p>ShareRing has created a complete ecosystem for the issuance, ownership, and consumption of documents. For both the issuer and the consumer of the document/data, the ShareRing system provides fundamentally greater levels of confidence in the validity of the document. It eliminates the opportunity for fraudulent manipulation of data that’s been uploaded onto the ShareRing blockchain platform. For the user, our independent custom-built&nbsp;blockchain platform is available&nbsp;to anyone with a mobile device. And its no-nonsense interface makes it easy for anyone to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ShareRing app includes many unique features providing users with a Personal Identification Vault and Health document access. This allows users to safely store and easily share multiple documents, including their COVID-19 vaccination, passport, national ID card and more, in an encrypted format. None of these documents are held centrally and remain only on the individual’s personal device. Our transformative products offer the highest level of security providing reassurance that documents can’t be accessed by anyone without the owner’s expressed consent.&nbsp;Once the documents are uploaded to their personal device a digital “fingerprint” of those documents are stored on the ShareRing blockchain. This means they are not open to hacking and/or personal data theft, as has been the case with many database-dependent systems in the past.</p>



<p>For businesses and operators who wish to consume the data, we have developed an easy contactless digital journey which allows them to use QR Codes scans to request and check the information they require from the individual. This not only streamlines and speeds up the journey, but it also significantly increases the reliability of their checks since the documents will have been uploaded at source and/or verified using face matching and OCR checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issuer of a document or certificate can be confident that the certificates they are issuing to an individual will not be tampered with or misused by a third party.</p>



<p>Using COVID-19 vaccinations certificates is one example of how our ecosystem works. It also includes actions by:&nbsp;</p>



  A vaccination center that will issue the COVID-19 certificate at the point of vaccination. They then send an encrypted digital copy to the user, which only the user can access using a private key. At the same time a digital “fingerprint” or hash of that document will be uploaded to the blockchain.  The user who receives the digital copy of the vaccination certificate from the issuer and uploads it to their Personal Information Vault on their mobile device, alongside their OCR and face matched identity document which they uploaded when they created their ShareRing account.  A consumer of the data, for example a customs official at an airport or a ticket attendant at a venue, who scans a QR code from the user’s mobile phone which will, with the user’s explicit real-time consent, allow them to see the verified COVID-19 vaccination certificate alongside the user’s ID. The process automatically checks the digital fingerprint on the blockchain. Even if a single pixel of the image has been altered or the document on the user’s device has been tampered with in any way it will be rejected by the system.  



<p>Additional, optional features include the ability for an issuer to allow a user to find their nearest COVID-19 testing or vaccination center, book an appointment and prove health status in a private and trusted way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the ShareRing app, you can have confidence that your customer:&nbsp;</p>



  ID and accompanying information are valid&nbsp;  Will have the security to travel and access venues and events&nbsp;  Will feel safe knowing their information is always secure&nbsp;  



<p>ShareRing is their contactless and digital way to freedom allowing them to unlock the world.

<p>The Inception Of NFT’s Has Created A Craze: Will It Last And Have NFT’s Progressed Beyond Just&nbsp;Hype?</p>NFT’s Have Sold For Millions: So Did ICO’s In 2017: Can We Draw A Fair Comparison?<p>Introduction: Hype vs. Utility: Which Foundational Ethos Causes The Transcendence of Blockchain Ecosystems?</p><p>Throughout the history of blockchain, it has become more and more evident and obvious that hype is a cornerstone of a blockchain ecosystems success, specifically surrounding token price and awareness of the project. Ethereum’s infrastructure smart contract code capabilities transformed the zeitgeist of blockchain, enabling different projects to be built on Ethereum. This notion conceived of the “Great ICO Bubble Of 2017” which led to new projects skyrocketing in valuation without real-world utility. When “The Great Bear Market of 2018” commenced, investors succumbed to digital shell-shock, coming to the clear realization that many of these projects were extremely hyped but lacked utility. Fast forward to 2021, although hype is still a fundamental zeitgeist of the blockchain sphere, utility is becoming the superior and aggrandizing force. Will NFT’s meet the same fate as the ICO Bubble of 2017, or is there something deeper that is incumbent to analyze surrounding real-world utility? Lets delve deep into the intricacies of NFT’s and how projects like AERGO have created revolutionary innovations surrounding NFT expansionism.</p><p>What Are Non Fungible Tokens? The Modern Day Tulip Craze, Or Real World&nbsp;Value?</p>NFT’s, Amalgamated With DeFi, Have Been The Cornerstone Of The 2021 Bull Run, But Why&nbsp;NFT’s?<p>NFT’s have exploded during The Great Bull Run Of 2021, and it is important to recognize the intricacies of what NFT’s are. Non Fungible Tokens is a digital asset(s) that represents real-world objects such as art, music, in-game items, videos, collectible cards, an essay, a unique-sneakers and clothes etc. NFT’s are similar to cryptocurrencies in a variety of different ways, specifically highlighted by their similarities in cryptographic coding. The inception of NFT’s began in 2014, but their popularity has soared over the last two years, and since 2017, over 174 million dollars has been spent on NFT’s. But where do NFT’s garner their value, and&nbsp;why?</p><p>NFT’s main valuation proposition is the inception of digital scarcity. In the traditional exterior world, rarity breeds value, surplus leads to hollowness in many circumstances (see every single monetary currency that has succumbed to runaway inflation since the dawn of humanity). Within the digital world, rarity also breeds value, specifically in an entire consolidated web of an infinite supply of the majority of creations. It is evident that NFT’s hold a value proposition, but how far has NFT’s evolved since the Great NFT Craze of 2020&nbsp;began?</p><p>Value In Non-Fungibility: The NFT Paradigm Of Evolution</p>Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days” Sold At Auction For 69.3 Million&nbsp;Dollars<p>Since the inception of NFT’s, many artistic renderings have been anything but unique. Many NFT’s began as a digital copy of a creation that was already in existence somewhere else. Clips from iconic sporting events to securitized versions of artistic expression that already existed on social media outlets such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter all became amalgamated under the umbrella term known as an NFT. So if NFT’s can be basically seen, screenshotted, downloaded and/or printed, how does this create an exterior value proposition; the answer is ownership. NFT’s allow the buyer to own the digital item; NFT’s enable such a digital feat through digitized authentication which can lead to owners garnering a sense of uniqueness surrounding their ownership of such a unique piece of data. Since the creation of NFT’s in 2014, the function and maxim’s of owning these pieces of data have evolved substantially, and we’re going to find out why and&nbsp;how.</p>Digitized Authentication=Legitimate Unique Ownership<p>NFT’s have created numerous different opportunities for celebrities, musicians, and artists to expand their business models in a variety of different ways. Artists, to begin, can utilize and add stipulations to an NFT to ensure that they receive a portion of proceeds every-time that specific NFT is sold. NFT’s, because they provide digital ownership rights through a unique paradigm, eliminate the need to track an asset’s progress and the need to enforce entitlements associated with any sale of that property. NFT’s can also benefit musicians who can utilize them to provide special perks to fans. It is also evident, to any collector, that it can be extremely difficult to point out what is a genuine collectors item or a reproduction; NFT’s end that dilemma. NFT’s with clear transaction histories back to the original creator would eliminate such an issue that has plagued collectors for far too long. NFT’s have the potential to transform the paradigm of digital ownership, and I believe NFT’s have evolved into the “Vision and Real World Application” stage, rather than blatant hype without a valid sense of&nbsp;utility.</p><p>The Dilemma Of NFT’s: The Great Expense: Different Blockchains Look To Solve The&nbsp;Issue</p>NFT’s Provide Real World Value And Utility: But Their Biggest Dilemma Are Minting&nbsp;Fees<p>The largest breeding ground for minting NFT’s, as of 2021, is Ethereum. Unfortunately, just like expensive transaction fees that plague the Ethereum Blockchain, minting an NFT has unfortunately met the same fate. Although there is a complete guarantee of decentralized digital ownership when an NFT is issued on Ethereum, scalability and high costs plague the network. Many blockchains have attempted to rectify the high cost dilemma of minting NFT’s, blockchains such as Tezos have created scalable solutions that allows for NFT’s to be mint in as little as two minutes and cost approximately&nbsp;.50 cents per&nbsp;mint.</p><p>Blockchains such as Aergo and ICON have also created their own NFT platforms where individuals can ensure the movement and minting of their NFT’s for a fraction of what it would cost on Ethereum. Scalability and high transaction costs have plagued blockchain networks since the inception of Bitcoin and different blockchain projects have been working tirelessly to create a seamless, affordable and efficient digital paradigm for NFT’s to be minted and sold&nbsp;on.</p><p>Future Use Cases Envisioned: The Practicality of&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Changing The Dynamics Of Ownership<p>Ownership has unfortunately been in the hands of middlemen before the birth of NFT’s, but future potential can rectify this paranoia of changing hands of ownership. Similarly to smart contracts, NFT’s enable a reliable transfer of information between two or more parties. NFT’s enable assets to reliably move around within a blockchain system, and blockchain systems such as Aergo are creating bridges where NFT’s can be transferred from a side-chain of the network to a main network. NFT’s can resolve a variety of issues that coincide with land and vehicle ownership. Did you know that less than 40% of the global population has their land registered to the rightful property owner? NFT’s can fix this! Individuals who lack verifiable defined rights find it much more difficult to access financial services and credit. With NFT’s, individuals can verify their rights through original ownership attached to their property through digitized verifiable authentication.</p><p>Aergo’s Merkle Bridge: Bridging The Gap: Rectifying Dilemmas</p>NFT’s Merkle Bridge Provides An Interoperable And Cost Effective Approach To Data Transfer And&nbsp;NFT’s<p>Ask yourself a focal and important question about interoperability from a humanistic and primal standpoint; if tribes can’t communicate through a similar language, how can civilization evolve as a whole? Its a simple answer, we couldn’t of. In the 21st century, one of the main dilemmas blockchains face (as digital tribes) is the inability to communicate with one another. Interoperability is blockchains next step, its destiny as a digital innovation.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge is designed to become a bridge between different blockchains and side-chains, enabling blockchains to talk with one another and exchange value in a cost effective manner. Multi-sig operators are the main and predominant form of data transfers in blockchain systems, unfortunately, a lack of security and increased costs plague this type of transference paradigm. Small transfers cannot exist with this type of paradigm because costs are incredibly high. Aergo fixes such a notion through the utilization of the Merkle Proof Tree, which is less costly and more efficient than the Ethereum Patricia Tree; however, Aergo intends on developing bridges between Aergo and Ethereum. Now how can this benefit NFT’s when utilizing the Merkle&nbsp;Bridge?</p><p>Merkle Bridge’s technology can benefit not only individuals attempting to transfer tokens, but data and information as well such as NFT’s. Merkle’s Bridge can be seen as a type or oracle-feed between different networks that are interconnected through the Merkle Bridge. Many centralized institutions and blockchain projects have issued their own NFT’s without the ability of cross-chain functionality and transference. With Merkle Bridge, NFT’s can be transferred to “wallets” that connect to Aergo and Ethereum and in the future, other blockchain projects connected to Merkle Bridge. Interoperable NFT transfers, as interoperable protocols are inevitable, the future of NFT’s are fated to be consolidated with the interoperable paradigm.</p><p>AERGO Incubated: An NFT Use Case Utilizing CCCV</p>Aergo Has Incubated A Project That Creates Member Vaccine Verifications<p>Since February 2020, it is evident that COVID-19 has conceived of an onslaught against our modern civilization that hasn’t been seen for at least 100 years. Nations closed and economic regimes were brought to their knees against an ancient paradigm that humanity has never truly conquered and risen victorious: The Great Biological War. Blockchain enterprises realized that immutability and transparency thereof could assist in the inception of tracking the virus through vaccine verifications; Aergo understood this notion to the fullest extent. Aergo and Blocko XYZ conceived of an incubated project known as CCCV which enables individuals who have their COVID vaccination to identify themselves as vaccinated by adding a real-time badge and sticker that can be shown to others who utilize the platform. In South Korea, an apparent dilemma is that COVID badges are only given to individuals over the age of 65, that leaves a massive age demographic where identifying who is vaccinated and who isn’t is incredibly difficult to track. CCCV solves this dilemma. Although companies have created COVID vaccination tracking apps, security and standardization have been a focal issue; with CCCV, users can request a badge and a sticker and when the document of their verification is authenticated, it is uploaded to their account. Now how does this tie into NFT’s, Ill tell&nbsp;you.</p><p>CCCV has garnered over 2 million subscribers (roughly 1.3 times the population of the island of Manhattan) and offers numerous different services which include NFT services. CCCV is a social networking platform and professional person validator, simultaneously, NFT’s can be implemented into this platform and its 2 million plus subscribers! Fake online impersonations, false influencer credentials and fraud are unfortunate but occur incredibly often in cyberspace and NFT’s can solve such an issue through unique-original-digital-ownership through the utilization of CCCV. NFT’s service as an authenticity technology that prevents users from succumbing to SNS linkage and enables individuals to create unique personalized design badges that emphasizes personal ownership and authenticity of ones profile. The platform is blockchain based: immutable, trustless and reliable. NFT’s also enable individuals to control the ownership of their own credentials and CCCV provides such a service utilizing this technology. CCCV has a multitude of use-cases which amalgamate digital identity verification, COVID-19 vaccination status and authenticating digital ownership through&nbsp;NFT’s.</p><p>Conclusion: Envisioning An Evolved NFT&nbsp;Paradigm</p>NFT’s Have Come So Far, Yet We Have A Far Way To&nbsp;Go<p>It is evident that since the inception of NFT’s in 2014, the concept and expansion of non-fungible tokens has occurred exponentially over the last seven years. We have seen over 170 million dollars spent on NFT’s since 2017, different blockchain projects creating their own NFT marketplaces, effectively competing with Ethereum by creating low-cost and scalable alternatives, and we’re beginning to see the availability of cross-chain NFT technology. The overall future prospect of NFT’s is yet to be seen, but for what we can empirically observe now, we can presume that NFT’s have a bright&nbsp;future.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency and NFT investing requires substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose! I am not a financial adviser and I am not responsible for any of your trades.

<p>Java has been able to invoke native programs on an operating system for decades. Invoking native programs is often done using JNI (Java Native Interface) and JNA (Java Native Access). In the last few years, Java has also gained the ability to run JVM apps as native apps. That is, they’re binary executables that have no dependency on the Java runtime.</p>
 
 
<p>This is huge! Mostly because it gives Java apps the ability to start up in milliseconds (as opposed to seconds). If you’re scaling up to handle millions of requests and using a serverless environment to save costs, this is a game-changer. Developers have enjoyed using Node.js, Python, and Go on serverless environments for years. The ability to use Java (or Kotlin) opens this world up to a massive swath of the developer community.</p>
 
 
<p>This post will show you how to run a secure, OAuth 2.0-protected, Java REST API that allows JWT authentication.

 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.1.0.r11-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Launch a Micronaut Java API 
 
 
<p>In a terminal window, cd into the <code>micronaut</code> directory and run <code>mn:run</code> to start it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd micronaut
./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open another terminal window and try to access it with HTTPie, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ http :8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
connection: keep-alive
transfer-encoding: chunked</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make it so you can access this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token and update the JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) URL to yours (in this project’s <code>application.yml</code>).</p>
 
 






If you’re unsure what OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are, see our <a>Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.



 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Take note of the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> values. You’ll need those to get an access token and to configure each framework for JWT authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>micronaut/src/main/resources/application.yml</code> and change the Okta URL to match yours.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  application:
    name: app
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Stop your Micronaut app with Ctrl+C and restart it with ⬆️+Return.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 Access Token 
 
<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click Send Request to continue.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have an access token, set it as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM...</code> 
 
 
 






You might want to keep OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; open to copy your access tokens. It allows you to quickly start over and regenerate a new access token if it expires.



 
 
 
 Test Your Micronaut API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email in it.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Micronaut App 
 
<p>To compile this Micronaut app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will take a few minutes to complete. My 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM took 1 min. 28 s. to finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/app</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/app
 __  __ _                                  _

  Micronaut (v2.5.6)

17:20:23.980 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 25ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080 
 
 
 
<p>You can see it starts pretty darn quick (25ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token. You may have to generate a new JWT with <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com">oidcdebugger.com</a> if yours has expired.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Make a Micronaut App from Scratch 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "how did you build a secure Micronaut app"? Did I just hide the complexity? No, it only takes five steps to create the same app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use <a href="https://sdkman.io">SDKMAN!</a> to install Micronaut’s CLI:</p>
 
 
 sdk install micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create an app using the <code>mn create-app</code> command and rename the project’s directory:</p>
 
 
 mn create-app com.okta.rest.app --build maven
mv app micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add Micronaut’s libraries for JWT security:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security-jwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest/controller</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.micronaut.http.MediaType;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Produces;
import io.micronaut.security.annotation.Secured;
import io.micronaut.security.rules.SecurityRule;

import java.security.Principal;

@Controller("/hello")
public class HelloController {

    @Get
    @Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  ...
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now you can start the app or build the native image as shown above.</p>
 
 
<p>Now let’s take a look at Quarkus.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Run a Quarkus Java API 
 
 
<p>Open a terminal, cd into the <code>quarkus</code> directory, and run <code>quarkus:dev</code> to start the app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd quarkus
./mvnw quarkus:dev</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Update the URLs in <code>quarkus/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Quarkus API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate or copy an access token from OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; and use it to test your Quarkus API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see your email in the response.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Did you notice that Quarkus hot-reloaded your <code>application.properties</code> file updates? Pretty slick, eh?!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Quarkus App 
 
<p>To compile this Quarkus app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 1 min. 9 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner

<p>Supersonic Subatomic Java (in 14ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Quarkus App from Scratch 
 
<p>You can create the same Quarkus app used in this example in five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use Maven to generate a new Quarkus app with JWT support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.13.7.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.rest \
    -DprojectArtifactId=quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.okta.rest.quarkus.HelloResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Edit <code>src/java/com/okta/rest/quarkus/HelloResource.java</code> and add user information to the <code>hello()</code> method:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;
import java.security.Principal;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Authenticated
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Principal userPrincipal = context.getUserPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HelloResourceTest</code> to expect a 401 instead of a 200:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
public class HelloResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
            .when().get("/hello")
            .then()
            .statusCode(401);
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add HTTPS support to the native profile at the bottom of <code>pom.xml</code> with the <code>quarkus.native.additional-build-args</code> property:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.package.type&gt;native&lt;/quarkus.package.type&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
    --enable-url-protocols=https
  &lt;/quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The last step is not necessary if you’re running with Maven, but it is for the native image. Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl">includes SSL for many extensions</a>, but not for SmallRye JWT. The good news is <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/17929">Quarkus will enable SSL by default for SmallRye JWT in Quarkus 2.0.0.Final</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Last but certainly not least, let’s look at Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot Java API 
 
 
<p>In your IDE, update the issuer in <code>spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Spring Boot API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate an access token using ttps://oidcdebugger.com[oidcdebugger.com] and use it to test your Spring Boot API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a response like the following.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>But wait, doesn’t Okta <a>have a Spring Boot starter</a>? Yes, we do—however, it <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">doesn’t work with GraalVM yet</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>However, we’re calling in an expert to help us fix it! Join us next Tuesday, June 22, 2021, on <a href="https://twitch.tv/oktadev">twitch.tv/oktadev</a> for a session with <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We’ll attempt to fix things live!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Spring Boot App 
 
<p>To compile this Spring Boot app into a native executable, you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 2 min. 56 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it using Docker:</p>
 
 
 
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

<p>Bootiful! Test your API with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot App from Scratch 
 
<p>To create the Spring Boot app used in this example, it’s just five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to generate a new Spring Boot app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
     bootVersion==2.5.1 \
     dependencies==web,oauth2-resource-server,native \
     packageName==com.okta.rest \
     name==spring-boot \
     type==maven-project \
     baseDir==spring-boot | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> class that returns the user’s information:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.security.Principal;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Configure the app to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server by adding an issuer to <code>application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure JWT authentication:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(request -&gt; request.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable HTTPS for native builds by adding a <code>@NativeHint</code> annotation to the <code>DemoApplication</code> class.</p>
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@SpringBootApplication
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-url-protocols=https")</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>You can build and test a Spring Boot native image using the steps I outlined above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Build Native Images for Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>To recap, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot all support building native executables with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. Yes, there are other frameworks, but these three <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=micronaut,quarkus,spring%20boot">seem to be the most popular</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The commands to build each app are similar but not quite the same.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Micronaut: <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code></p>
 
 
<p>Quarkus: <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code></p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Of course, they all support Gradle too.</p>
 
 
 Startup Time Comparison 
 
<p>Performance comparisons are complex, but I’m going to do one anyway. Since this post is all about native Java, below is the data I gathered that shows the average milliseconds to start each native executable. I ran each image three times before I started recording the numbers. I then ran each command five times.</p>
 
 
<p>These numbers are from a 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. I think it’s important to note that my WiFi connection was 340 Mbps down and 246 Mbps up (according to the Speedtest app).</p>
 

Table 1. Native Java Startup times in milliseconds







Framework
Command executed
Milliseconds to start




<p>Micronaut</p>
<p><code>./target/app</code></p>
<p>20.4</p>


<p>Quarkus</p>
<p><code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code></p>
<p>13.4</p>


<p>Spring Boot</p>
<p><code>docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</code></p>
<p>60.6</p>



 
<p>The chart below should help you visualize this comparison.</p>
 

 

 
<p>The Spring Boot startup times looked a little long, so I contacted my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We did a debugging session over Zoom and discovered the longer startup times are because Spring Security is doing OIDC discovery with the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot’s "initialization completed" time seemed to be right around 30ms. The duration between that and the "Started in …​" time is the time it takes to make the call to Okta. We tried optimizing it by just using the JWKS URI. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This only improved the startup time by 1.6ms (59ms on average).</p>
 
 
<p>We also experimented with using <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> for Spring Boot. This allows you to create a native binary and run it with <code>./target/demo</code>. There’s no need for Docker with this command. Startup times are relatively the same in my and Josh’s experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Our hypothesis is Micronaut and Quarkus do the JWKS lookup on the first request rather than at startup. That’s how they achieve faster startup times.</p>
 
 






We later confirmed this hypothesis with <a href="https://github.com/JasonTypesCodes">Jason Schindler</a> (from Micronaut) and <a href="https://github.com/sberyozkin">Sergey Beryozkin</a> (from Quarkus).



 
 
<p>If I just take the value of the "initialization completed" time from Spring Boot, the numbers look a little more even.</p>
 
 

 
<p>I also tested the startup times on a Linux laptop with 64 GB of RAM. I used the value the framework displays for startup time and did not make the "initialization complete" adjustment for Spring Boot.</p>
 
 

 






If you disagree with these numbers and think X framework should be faster, I encourage you to clone <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">the repo</a> and run these tests yourself. If you get faster startup times for Spring Boot, do you get faster startup times for Micronaut and Quarkus too?



 
 
 
 
 
 Testing Native Images 
 
 
<p>When building native images, it’s essential to test them as part of an integration testing process. This post is already long enough, so I won’t explain how to test native images in this post. We’ll publish a post in the future that covers this topic.</p>
 
 
<p>I do like how Quarkus generates a <code>NativeHelloResourceIT</code> that’s designed specifically for this, though.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.NativeImageTest;

@NativeImageTest
public class NativeHelloResourceIT extends HelloResourceTest {

<p>However, this test did not help me <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67977862/quarkus-jwt-authentication-doesnt-work-as-a-native-app">detect an issue with my Quarkus native image</a> when writing this post. That’s because I was lazy in writing my test and changed it to confirm a 401 instead of <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect#integration-testing">testing it with Quarkus' OIDC testing support</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, you learned how to develop, build, and run native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot. You learned how to secure them with OpenID Connect and access them with a JWT access token.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re a Spring Boot aficionado, I recommend you watch Josh Long’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsUAGJqdvaA">Spring Tips: Spring Native 0.10.0</a> video.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for all the examples used in this post on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">native-java-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Server-side apps that serve up REST APIs aren’t the only thing that’s gone native in Java. <a href="https://twitter.com/gluonhq">Gluon</a> has done a lot of work in recent years to make JavaFX apps work on iOS and Android using GraalVM. See <a href="https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach">Gail Anderson</a>'s <a href="https://foojay.io/today/creating-mobile-apps-with-javafx-part-1/">Creating Mobile Apps with JavaFX – Part 1</a> to learn more about this emerging technology.</p>
 
 
<p>In the beginning, I mentioned JNI and JNA. Baeldung has some tutorials about both:</p>

<p>The regulators are coming. The regulators are coming.</p>



<p>Whether it’s FATF, FinCEN, CFTC, or one of many other governing bodies, lawmakers have been incrementally shaping new legislation aimed at further regulating centralized finance and DeFi. Most recently, the World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wef-defi-white-paper">published a white paper</a> to help policy makers understand DeFi, so that better guardrails may be designed for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>A confusing regulatory landscape</p>



<p>Companies in this new ecosystem, though, remain unclear on how to lawfully proceed. As we talk to companies about Civic age verification, log-in and KYC, we continue to hear a similar message from them: what should we do about compliance?</p>



<p>As an advisor offering identity services, it’s become clear to us that Civic can bring greater value to our existing and potential customers by offering more of what we do well.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to share a window into the future of digital identity’s role in the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic Compliance is coming soon</p>



<p>The new DeFi ecosystem makes it possible for anyone to trade using simply an internet connection and open-source code. The fact that these new marketplaces have proliferated illustrates the need for next generation financial services, but these solutions must begin to operate within the context of necessary compliance guardrails. Fortunately, digital identity with built-in compliance will help blockchain protocols, liquidity providers, and individuals create trust and comply with evolving regulations all at the same time.</p>



<p>More specifically, our newest offering, <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/compliance/">Civic Compliance</a>, will help DeFi companies and individuals know their counterparties, so that all parties can ensure KYC, AML requirements are met.</p>



<p>Civic is uniquely positioned to create decentralized identities, putting users in control of their own personally identifiable information (PII) so they can access compliant DeFi services. Users of Civic Compliance may sign up once and then re-use their “attestation” again and again. This gives protocols and liquidity providers visibility into each and every user transaction. And, it gives users more control over their PII.</p>



<p>Partners in compliance</p>



<p>Whether it’s KYC, AML or regulations not yet in place, Civic is a partner in meeting DeFi regulatory requirements, all while putting users back in control over their unique digital identities. We’re looking forward to sharing more about Civic Compliance.</p>

 If you’re new to Ontology, or confused by terms like DID, ONT ID, and OScore, this brief introduction is for&nbsp;you. <p>DID, ONT ID, OScore…you might have heard us use these words,&nbsp;before.</p><p>Yet, you’re still unsure what they all&nbsp;mean.</p><p>Here’s an overview of the key features that make Ontology&nbsp;special.</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; ONT&nbsp;ID <p>With traditional ID systems, a central authority or tech platform controls the data (e.g. phone numbers, email addresses) provided to it by&nbsp;users.</p><p>The users (i.e. the data providers), therefore, have very little control over how their personal data is stored and who has access to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework, <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, is different. By providing a self-sovereign system of data authorization and ownership confirmation, ONT ID puts the power in the hands of&nbsp;users.</p><p>With ONT ID, ID generation, storage, and other critical operations, are fully automated and decentralized, allowing users operating within the ecosystem full control and ownership over any data associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Discrete IDs linked across various ecosystems can have multiple delegates and attributes. With verifiable credentials, entities (i.e. individuals, enterprises, institutions, devices) can make and verify claims related to data ownership, access rights, and validation.</p> Verifying Credentials with ONT&nbsp;ID <p>ONT ID allows you to verify credentials, whilst protecting your data and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>You can verify many different kinds of credentials such as passports, national IDs, and social media accounts. Verifying credentials is one way to boost your OScore (more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>The beauty of ONT ID is that you, the user, decide who has access to your verified&nbsp;data.</p><p>For example, imagine a third party required you to verify an aspect of your identity, such as your nationality. With ONT ID, you could share this single data point whilst keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other sensitive information, completely private.</p><p>You can <a href="https://medium.com/onto/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet-96943997df2b">create an ONT ID</a> now by downloading <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, Ontology’s decentralized cross-chain wallet.</p> OScore <p><a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a> is an independent on-chain reputation system, generated using on-chain data including your ONT ID, engagements, assets, and credentials.</p><p>Your <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore</a> is based on data authorized by you and is updated to reflect changes in behavior and lending practices.</p><p>OScore is not associated with your off-chain identities. In other words, it respects user privacy and supports full anonymity.</p><p>Your OScore increases as you add more decentralized data to your ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>A higher OScore brings with it certain benefits such as better lending rates on platforms like <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing Finance</a>, Ontology’s credit-based DeFi platform.</p><p>OScore also benefits credit grantors, helping them decide whether to open a credit line and how much credit to extend to a particular borrower.</p> Summary <p>Let’s put together everything we’ve learned so&nbsp;far.</p>  Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework is called ONT&nbsp;ID.  Create an ONT ID with <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> to start verifying credentials.  Verifying credentials using your ONT ID helps boost your decentralized credit rating, aka&nbsp;OScore.  Having a higher OScore entitles you to certain benefits.

<p>ServiceNow, over the past few years, has emerged as one of the leaders in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger" title="ITSM">ITSM</a> (IT Service Management) market and beyond to what today is named ESM (Enterprise Service Management). In fact, the evolution of that market has helped ITSM leave the bunker of IT, and become a strategic element for businesses.</p>
 ESM today is much bigger and more important than ITSM ever was 
<p>The reason is that ESM supports organizations in business process optimization, based on central platforms with centralized data management and workflow capabilities. ESM is way bigger and more essential than ITSM has ever been, because it is business-centric and user-centric, instead of the technical, IT-centric approach exemplified by ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), one of the foundational principles of traditional ITSM. Yes, ITIL still plays a vital role for the IT core of ITSM and thus ESM, but it is just a small piece of the puzzle today.</p>
<p></p>
 For a seamless experience, Identity and Access Management must be integrated with ESM 
<p>Essentially, ESM combines the ability to automate and improve processes with the workflow capabilities on common platforms that allow customers as well as partners to extend the reach. While there is the potential risk of lock-in to such a platform, the advantages outweigh this risk for many buyers (or are buyers just ignoring the lock-in risk, e.g. to ServiceNow?). ESM provides (relatively) user-friendly access to IT services. This is of ever-increasing importance, driven by trends such as Cloud Computing and Cloud first, Work from Home, and Citizen Development.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing: With more and more services procured from the cloud, and a higher rate of change in the use of services, managing these services and making them accessible to the users becomes of ever-increasing importance. Managing access and the identities of users, must integrate with the ESM platforms for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Work from Home: We’ve all learned over the past 15 months that the delivery of new services must become seamless. Walking to the desk of the user and administering the local machine does not work anymore in the age of WfH. Seamless procurement of services is essential in today’s dispersed work environments.</p>
 Usability is not only a matter User Interfaces but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking 
<p>Citizen Development: Low-code and no-code platforms are changing the way of developing solutions. Many solutions are built by the business. They still need management. Platforms that unify initiatives and that help in getting a grip on all services, become essential.</p>
<p>ESM is an approach that helps address many of the emerging needs of businesses in delivering their services, where IT is not IT anymore, but ubiquitous across all parts of the business. Strategic platforms can help here, despite the lock-in risk. But they will only work with the context of the user: Who can do what, who is allowed to access which service, etc. Usability is not only a matter of UI, but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking across these platforms – and the platforms might also serve as an element or even the foundation of the IAM infrastructure.</p>

Tim (~timluc-miptev) will impart the implicit knowledge he gained working with Bitcoin in the course of his projects, and give an open workshop on what you need to know, either to satisfy your curiosity or to jump in and help. Tim will give a structured presentation on low-level Bitcoin fundamentals, intended to make it easy to use Bitcoin resources for further study.</p>
<p>Tim is the technical director at the Urbit Foundation, and wrote the backend for the Urbit Bitcoin wallet. He is currently managing <code>volt</code>, a project to integrate a Lightning client into Urbit.  This workshop will be interactive — Tim will take questions throughout, and will conduct another session later if material remains.</p>
<p>As always, there will be an informal call afterwards to hang out. We will also open a Bitcoin development channel on Urbit specifically to handle follow-ups from this and for those who can't make it live.</p>

 Urbit currently has ship metadata, but there is room for alternate products here. It would be useful to be able to attach arbitrary metadata to a user, both in textual format to describe them, graph-store links to materials they've written, automated lists of groups they're in, and programmatically-accessible metadata that can be used for filtering and permissioning.

It would be useful to be able to attach arbitrary metadata to a user, both in textual format to describe them, graph-store links to materials they've written, automated lists of groups they're in, and programmatically-accessible metadata that can be used for filtering and permissioning.</p>
<p>These contact lists could then be shared between ships as a way to jumpstart people into your social network. Alternate interfaces to chats could give read/write access to them.  While it's unlikely that this exact product would be what people finally use, it would go a long way towards feeling out the user-metadata design space.</p>
<p>This project would be great for someone who wanted to learn more about how Urbit data storage and sharing between apps works, as well as understanding how to interact with <code>graph-store</code>.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a user I can:</p>
 
 add text data to another user 
 add permissions/markers to another user 
 create a collection of <code>graph-store</code> links with data about the user 
 automatically collect known groups the user is in 
 search the user's written materials in <code>graph-store</code> (using <code>graph-query</code> or similar). 
 share metadata about users with other ships, along with ways of merging it.

<p>It’s the business challenge of this&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>: how to engage and convert customers&nbsp;in a&nbsp;fast-paced digital&nbsp;market&nbsp;while being&nbsp;good&nbsp;and&nbsp;compliant&nbsp;stewards&nbsp;of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>?&nbsp;There are two sides to this coin: personalization is improving the user experience, but&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data abuse is growing</a>—and consumers are noticing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those of us in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">privacy space</a>&nbsp;completely understand the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">problem</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;fix&nbsp;and are&nbsp;helping brands rapidly&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">bring it to market</a>:&nbsp;building privacy-first products and services that&nbsp;give&nbsp;consumers power over their privacy,&nbsp;and&nbsp;companies an easy way to engage without collecting, managing and risking personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a&nbsp;‘middle ground’&nbsp;solution that brands must rapidly engage or risk alienating their customers.&nbsp;The stats tell the story:&nbsp;</p>



  As far back as 2012, Pew Research found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2012/03/13/internet-users-dont-like-targeted-ads/">68 percent</a>&nbsp;of US consumers&nbsp;don’t like targeted ads and disapprove of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">invasive data surveillance</a>&nbsp;that drives them.&nbsp;  Seven years later&nbsp;in 2019 Pew Research found&nbsp;an even higher number of US consumers, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81 percent</a>,believes&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential risks&nbsp;from data-driven products and services&nbsp;outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;  This past February in Europe,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;polled 2,000 consumers&nbsp;in France and Germany&nbsp;and found 57 percent don’t want personalized ads on their devices and feel&nbsp;“deeply uncomfortable” about the granular categorization&nbsp;based on highly personal&nbsp;information,&nbsp;such as illness, pregnancy and religion,&nbsp;that drives it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Media and ad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">experts</a>&nbsp;get the point:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yashina&nbsp;Burns, Director, Data Privacy and Legal Affairs at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deepintent.com/">Deep&nbsp;Intent</a>, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">Forbes</a>: “While CPRA won’t become law until 2023, other states will likely create similar regulations in the interim and further push the ad industry to adopt targeting technologies that are more conscious of consumer privacy. Marketing leaders need to get ready now by focusing on privacy-friendly solutions that limit the use of sensitive personal information. Publishers and platforms that offer compliant data collection across platforms – especially in the healthcare space where privacy is of the utmost importance – will be well-positioned to continue the services they offer to marketers amid the coming regulatory change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Edmonds,&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of global digital&nbsp;services giant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pacteraedge.com/">Pactera EDGE</a>&nbsp;says similar:&nbsp;“The challenge moving forward into 2021 will be the continued delivery of personalized experiences while maintaining compliance with existing privacy laws and those regulations appearing on the horizon.&nbsp;It’s a delicate balancing act marketers will have to pull off as consumers&nbsp;increasingly embrace the hyper-personalization experience, but also demand transparency when it comes to how their information is being used.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;poll of consumers in France and Germany we mentioned earlier says it’s the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">behind the scenes</a>&nbsp;or back door nature of personalization that gives people the creeps.&nbsp;This perception isn’t helped&nbsp;by the fact consent to&nbsp;datapractices&nbsp;is&nbsp;often so&nbsp;convoluted and tied&nbsp;to&nbsp;long-winded&nbsp;terms and conditions&nbsp;and privacy policies&nbsp;that&nbsp;consumersdon’t know exactly what&nbsp;it is&nbsp;they’re agreeing to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The YouGov research&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">commissioning agency</a>&nbsp;says,&nbsp;“The EU has a unique opportunity to tackle these issues by making sure existing privacy rules are enforced and by bringing in new rules via the Digital Services Act (DSA). We’re calling on Members of the European Parliament to amend the DSA to ensure users can see all the ways they’ve been targeted and prevent surveillance overreach.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re still&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">waiting to see</a>&nbsp;how US consumers&nbsp;might&nbsp;get similar,&nbsp;national data and privacy protections.&nbsp;In the meantime, we suggest brands recognize&nbsp;both the&nbsp;opportunity to deliver consumer applications with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy at their core</a>, and the&nbsp;responsibility to comply with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">tightening regulations</a>.&nbsp;Discover how&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, our complete business toolkit for rapidly developing branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions,&nbsp;can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engagement with asset allocators, quantitative-focused hedge funds and academia to learn more about Ocean’s core technologies</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is collaborating with Battle of the Quants to drive growth within the quantitative hedge fund space and bring more data providers and buyers into the Ocean ecosystem. <a href="https://battleofthequants.com/">Battle of the Quants</a> connects academia, asset allocators, and quantitative-focused hedge funds to explore and discuss the critical issues confronting the quantitative approach to&nbsp;finance.</p><p>In 2021, we will collaborate for a series of events targeting the quant hedge fund world to increase awareness of Ocean Protocol within the industry. The online and offline events, in conjunction with background business development activities, aim&nbsp;to:</p>  Enroll new data providers to Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Increase data buyer usage on the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Increase group usage of the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  <p>Ocean Protocol Founder Bruce Pon said, “<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/quantitative-finance/#:~:text=Quantitative%20finance%20is%20the%20use,relates%20to%20portfolio%20management%20applications.">Quantitative finance</a> uses extensive datasets and mathematical models to analyze financial markets and securities, helping investors evaluate investment opportunities and develop informed and profitable trading strategies.

 Plug-and-play Passwordless Authentication with Magic and Gatsby.js <p>If there’s one thing web developers know better than anyone else, it’s this: authentication sucks. Authentication is one of those things that seems simple yet oftentimes ends up being a frustrating, overly-complicated process. Even worse, your production app might be completely dependent on your auth server — if it goes down, you’re in&nbsp;trouble.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> comes in. With only a few lines of code, you can integrate Magic into your application to enable passwordless authentication using magic links (similar to Slack and&nbsp;Medium).</p> ✨ Why Magic&nbsp;Links? <p>In my opinion, passwordless is simply better than the typical username/password authentication. It provides developers with a seamless development experience, users love the idea of not having to keep track of a password, and best of all: it works like magic; passwords disappear and everyone’s lives are just made&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is secure. Over 59% of people reuse their passwords everywhere, leading to poor passwords accounting for 81% of all security breaches [<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2017_dbir.pdf">source</a>]. (Gentle reminder to update your passwords! I recommend rotating them every few&nbsp;months.)</p><p>Magic leverages blockchain-based, standardized pubic-key cryptography to achieve identity management. When a new user signs up via your Magic integration, a public-private key pair is automatically generated for&nbsp;them.</p><p>In order to authenticate requests, a user’s private keys are used to sign cryptographic proofs to verify their identity. Thus, your resource server will no longer need to store and manage (1) hashed + salted passwords or (2) user sessions in its database&nbsp;table.</p><p>To learn more about Magic’s enterprise-grade security thanks to the cutting-edge identity tech they use involving zero-knowledge proofs, delegated key management and decentralized ID tokens, visit their <a href="https://docs.magic.link/security">security page</a> or read <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">Magic’s Whitepaper</a>.</p> 💻 An Enhanced Developer Experience <p><a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> is a developer SDK that you can integrate into any application to enable blazing-fast, hardware-secured passwordless authentication with just a few lines of code (even if you already have an existing auth solution). The Magic SDK currently offers support for <a href="https://docs.magic.link/#start-building">32+ ecosystems</a> — from Social Logins like Google, Facebook, and Github to Blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up or log in to your application:</p>  User requests a magic link sent to their email&nbsp;address  User clicks on that magic&nbsp;link  User is securely logged into the application  <p>In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate just how easy it is to get started integrating with Magic in just a few lines of&nbsp;code.</p> 👩🏻‍💻 Integrating Magic with Gatsby.js <p><a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby.js</a> is a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>-based static site generator powered by <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">GraphQL</a>. Gatsby essentially takes the best parts of React, Webpack, GraphQL, and various front-end tools to provide a seamless developer experience. If you’re new to Gatsby, you can learn more from their documentation <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs">here</a>.</p><p>I’m personally a huge fan of Gatsby and have built dozens websites with it. It’s great for building portfolio sites or blogs, both of which you can easily integrate with Magic — which I’ll demonstrate below.</p> 🛠 What We’ll&nbsp;Build <p>In this tutorial we’ll be integrating Magic to a static Gatsby.js site and deploying it to Netlify. Feel free to view and try out the production application live on Netlify&nbsp;<a href="https://magic-gatsby.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> Step 1: Clone the Starter Template &amp; Install Dependencies <p>To get started, clone the starter template from Github <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial">here</a>. We’ll be working out of the dev/ directory, but feel free to play around with the final code in the prod/ directory. I recommend following along with the tutorial before jumping into the production code.</p><p>To clone the starter template, run the following command from your terminal:<br>git clone <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git">https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git</a></p><p>Change to the tutorial’s directory:<br>cd passwordless-authentication-tutorial</p><p>And install the project’s dependencies from the root directory:<br>cd dev &amp;&amp; npm install<br>cd prod &amp;&amp; npm&nbsp;install</p><p>If you’d like to try the final application, you can run the production application locally from the root folder:<br>npm run start:prod</p><p>Otherwise, to follow along with the tutorial, spin up the development server (also from the root folder):<br>npm run start:dev</p> Step 2: Initialize Magic <p>Before we get started integrating Magic into our application, I recommend you take a look at <a href="https://docs.magic.link/">Magic’s documentation</a>. They’ve got easy-to-follow documentation and helpful <a href="https://magic.link/guides">guides</a> on other most commonly used developer tools.</p><p>The starter template for this tutorial lies in the dev/ directory of this tutorial's codebase. To begin integrating Magic, we'll need to install the Magic Client SDK in the dev/ directory:<br>npm install --save magic-sdk</p><p>By default Gatsby supports two environments: development and production. To support both environments, we’ll create two files in the root of the dev/ and prod/ directories:&nbsp;.env.development and&nbsp;.env.production. Copy the contents (it's only one variable) of&nbsp;.env.example to both&nbsp;files.</p><p>Before we initialize Magic, you’ll need to sign up to the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a> to get your own API keys. Replace GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY in&nbsp;.env.development and&nbsp;.env.production (in both directories) with your "Publishable API Key" from the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a>:</p><p>Now that we’ve set our environment variable, we can create an SDK instance to initialize Magic.</p><p>Because Gatsby generates static HTML at build time when you run gatsby build, we need to ensure the global window object is defined before importing Magic.</p><p>We’ll initialize Magic in the src/lib/magic.js file like&nbsp;so:</p> import { Magic } from "magic-sdk"  let magic  if (typeof window !== `undefined`) {   <br>   magic = new Magic(process.env.GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY)<br>}    export { magic }  Step 3: Handle Authentication <p>Navigate to the index.js file in src/pages and import your newly-created Magic instance.</p> import { magic } from "../lib/magic" <p>Next, we’ll implement our login &amp; logout methods. Handling user sessions is made incredibly easy with Magic. Add these two methods to the same index.js&nbsp;file.</p> // Handle login with email<br>const handleEmailLogin = async (e) =&gt; {<br>    // Get the current value from the input field<br>    const email = userEmail.current.value<br>    if (!email) return<br><br>    try {<br>      // Login with Magic ✨<br>      await magic.auth.loginWithMagicLink({<br>        email<br>      })<br><br>      // Set user metadata<br>      let userMetadata = await magic.user.getMetadata()<br>      setUser(userMetadata)<br>    } catch (error) {<br>      console.error(error)<br>    }<br>  }<br><br>  // Handle logout<br>  const handleLogout = async () =&gt; {<br>    // Logout with Magic<br>    await magic.user.logout()<br>    setUser(null)<br>  } <p>In our useEffect hook, we'll check if the user is logged in and set their metadata if they are. If not, we'll set the user to&nbsp;null.</p> useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>    // Check if user is logged in<br>    magic.user.isLoggedIn().then((isLoggedIn) =&gt; {<br>      return isLoggedIn<br>	// If user is logged in, set metadata<br>        ? magic.user.getMetadata().then((userData) =&gt;       setUser(userData))<br>        : setUser(null)<br>    })<br>  }, [])  Step 4:&nbsp;Deploy <p>Deploying the application is completely optional, but I’m personally a big fan of <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and once you register and connect your Netlify account to your Github, you can configure auto-deployments from the branch of your choice. If you choose to do this, set your build command as gatsby build and the public directory to&nbsp;public.</p><p>Don’t forget to set the GATSBY_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY environment variable in Netlify with your publishable API key from the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a>.</p> 🚀 Wrapping&nbsp;Up <p>So… ready to integrate with Magic? Magic is currently offering users the ability to earn free logins by referring friends. For every friend that <a href="https://magic.link/invite/r/ob3yKxvFyjvrexam">signs up for Magic</a>, you’ll both get 3,000 bonus logins — up to 90,000&nbsp;total.</p><p>You saw how easy it was to plug passwordless auth to our Gatsby app with Magic and start playing with the rest of our app’s business logic, so grab your referral link and start&nbsp;sharing!</p><p>Follow Magic on <a href="https://twitter.com/magic_labs">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/magic.labs/">Instagram</a> to stay up-to-date. Try Magic for free <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">here</a>.&nbsp;✨</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/plug-and-play-passwordless-authentication-with-magic-and-gatsby-js-c7d3ee7d2132">Plug and Play Passwordless Authentication with Magic and Gatsby.js</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Consortium Partners, Jungheinrich AG and Evan Developing a Blockchain-based IoT Infrastructure Utilizing Self-sovereign Identities for Sharing Machines 
<p>Dresden, Germany,&nbsp; June 16, 2021&nbsp; – Evan GmbH, a subsidiary of Blockchains, Inc., announced that it has begun the implementation phase of its ID-Ideal Consortium project in the&nbsp; <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">Secure Digital Identities Innovation Competition</a> . Implementation is the second part of the multi-month, two-phase competition sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). After being named a winner during the first phase of the competition in November 2020, the ID-Ideal Consortium project was awarded approximately 15 million euros in funding, to be paid out over the next three years.</p>
<p>The mission of the ID-Ideal Consortium is to create a blockchain-based trust network where digital data can be securely exchanged between companies, citizens, and administration. The consortium currently consists of 40 partners including evan, which also provides <a href="https://evan.network/">evan.network</a> , the infrastructure where consortium partners can engage securely.</p>
<p>“We are honored to have been chosen and to be awarded this funding from the BMWi. It will enable us to drive innovation on secure digital identities together with the partners of the ID-Ideal Consortium and to illustrate the importance and value of these on real use cases, ”says Thomas Müller, CEO of evan GmbH. “Within the consortium, we focus on building a digital infrastructure with which companies can securely and autonomously make physical resources digitally available and integrate them into multi-party processes. We believe that the true success of Industry 4.0 will be measured by how we can more easily and securely share resources and exchange data: human-to-human, machine-to-human, and machine-to-machine. “</p>
<p>One example of an ID-Ideal Consortium innovation that partners Jungheinrich AG and evan are working on is the digitalization of the rental process for industry trucks and forklifts using blockchain-based digital identities. With a digital identity, the prospective renter can be attested and verified by the rental company that they have a valid driver’s license to rent and operate the machine. The prospective renter can also view important data about the rental machine in advance, such as operating hours or the last maintenance date. All of this can be done in a blockchain-based digital world, including processing the payment – further minimizing administrative work and eliminating the need for physical paper documents.</p>
<p>Evan is also helping the ID-Ideal Consortium to enable companies to prove compliance with regulatory requirements in multi-stage supply chains. Digital identities built on blockchain technology can be used to trace product lifecycles from manufacturing to usage to recycling. In addition to optimizing processes, this data can also be used to reduce carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ID-Ideal Consortium has a broad and diverse membership to better understand and be able to meet the variety of requirements of today’s businesses that want to enable digital identity-based exchanges. The consortium is led by the University of Applied Sciences Dresden. In addition to evan GmbH and Jungheinrich AG, members of the project team include HTW Dresden, the state capital of Dresden, the Leipzig city administration or Fraunhofer FIT.</p>

  <p>Sessions can be a challenging topic for developers of all skill levels.  Many React developers never consider the internals of session management because so much of the work is abstracted away.  But, it is important to understand  what sessions are, how they work, and how best to manage and manipulate them.</p>

<p>There are several different strategies for session management in React.  In this article, you will learn the basics about sessions, how to manage them in React, and see some examples using common packages.</p>

 Session Management Overview 

<p>The first thing you should know is what exactly a “session” is.  In its simplest terms, a session is some data that is stored on the server.  The server then provides an ID to the client, which the client can use to make requests back to the server.  For example, if you needed access to a user’s email address, you could store it against the session, then return an <code>ID</code> to the client.  The client could then request an email be sent using the <code>ID</code>, rather than passing his/her  email back to the server.  The  <code>ID</code> field is opaque, meaning that the client knows nothing about what is saved against the ‘ID’ field.  The <code>ID</code> can also contain validation and encryption.  And, the server can return client data, which would typically be encrypted, to the client that  he/she would frequently need.</p>

<p>In this article, I consider a range of server scenarios, as many times when working in React, developers don’t have control over what the server does.  For example, when passing session data, the server will include the data in a cookie.  The server may also expect a cookie to be present when making a request.  Therefore, as a react developer, you will be required to include this cookie in your requests.  You may also choose to store the data in <code>localStorage</code>, however  then the server doesn’t have access to it.  Local storage allows for more storage and can persist over browsing sessions, making it ideal for situations where you want to remember user actions across multiple browsing sessions.</p>

<p>Another situation where you may receive a cookie from the server,  is when it is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>.  When a cookie is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>, it cannot be read by the client in javascript.  This helps minimize the risk of attack against the cookie.  For example, if your site has a cross-site scripting vulnerability, marking the cookie <code>HttpOnly</code> will protect the cookie’s contents.  Of course, you still need the data that the cookie represents, so you should make a request to the server for the resource you need and present the cookie to the server.</p>

<p>Along these same lines, you should also understand cookie validation.  The server you are attempting to access should validate the cookie before processing any request on it.  There are many validation tools to help server-side developers, such as signing and expiring cookies.  Many times, the server will provide a way for you to check the state of a cookie without requesting a resource.</p>

 Manage Sessions in React 

<p>There are many packages for helping manage sessions in React.  If you are using Redux, <code>redux-react-session</code> is a popular choice.  If you are not, <code>react-session-api</code> is another helpful package found on npm.</p>

<p>Focusing on <code>redux-react-session</code>, the first thing you need to do is add your session reducer.</p>

   <code>import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { sessionReducer } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const reducers = {
  // ... your other reducers here ...
  session: sessionReducer
};

const reducer = combineReducers(reducers);
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to initialize your session service.</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
const store = createStore(reducer)

sessionService.initSessionService(store);
</code>   

<p>Once you are set up, you have access to the full API by the session service. There are several key benefits to this.</p>

<p>First, you have <code>initSessionService</code>.  As the name implies, this call will initiate  the session service. Below you can see an example of a call:</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const store = createStore(reducer)

const validateSession = (session) =&gt; {
  // check if your session is still valid
  return true;
}

const options = { refreshOnCheckAuth: true, redirectPath: '/home', driver: 'COOKIES', validateSession };
 
sessionService.initSessionService(store, options)
  .then(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and a session was refreshed from your storage'))
  .catch(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and there is no session in your storage'));
</code>   

<p>To understand this call, you should understand the options that are passed in.  First is <code>refreshOnCheckAuth</code>.  This option defaults to <code>false</code>, but if set to <code>true</code>, will refresh the Redux store in the <code>checkAuth()</code> function.  The <code>checkAuth()</code> function is provided by the <code>sessionService</code> object from the <code>redux-react-session</code>.</p>

<p><code>redirectPath</code> defaults to <code>/login</code>.  This is the path used when the session is rejected or doesn’t exist.  Suppose a new user attempts to access a secured page by browsing to the URL directly.  Because there is no session, the user will be re-routed to <code>/login</code> by default, or <code>/home</code> in the example above.</p>

<p>Next is the <code>driver</code> option.  The two you have already learned about are <code>COOKIES</code> and <code>LOCALSTORAGE</code>, however <code>redux-react-session</code> also accepts <code>INDEXEDDB</code> or <code>WEBSQL</code>.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is a database that is built into the browser.  Applications that require a lot of client-side data storage should consider this option.  <code>Web SQL</code> is also a browser based database, however it is not supported in HTML5 and is deprecated.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is considered the default alternative to <code>Web SQL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the <code>validateSession()</code> function.  This will pass the logic for session validation to the <code>sessionService</code>.  As discussed before, this is largely dependent on your server functionality.  If you can validate the session from the client-side, you can implement the logic here.  Otherwise, you can use <code>axios</code> or <code>fetch</code> to make a call to the server to request session validation.</p>

<p>Two other useful functions are <code>saveSession()</code> and <code>deleteSession()</code>.  It is a best practice to enforce some rules for deleting the session, though these rules will vary based on your use cases.  These functions return promises, as does the entire API.  To save the session, you need to pass your custom session object.  Setting the session also changes the <code>authenticated</code> flag to <code>true</code> in the Redux store.</p>

 Learn More About Sessions and React 

<p>Managing sessions in React is an immense topic. In this article, you learned the basics of session management and how to apply them to React.  You also learned how to use one of the most common react session management packages available.  But this is just a start.  I encourage you to look into more react session packages and continue to learn and understand how to properly manage the session.  Doing so will make your applications more secure and performant.</p>

<p>Apple’s WWDC 21 had a great set of new announcements around security. The most exciting one for us Identity and Access Management (IAM) geeks is the update on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/">Apple’s commitment towards moving beyond passwords</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>In this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on this great announcement and what it means for enterprise identity and authentication.</p>
      
<p>The updates presented by Garrett Davidson from Apple build on Apple’s previous support for FIDO2 and WebAuthn open standards in the Safari browser on both iOS and OS X (now MacOS). Previously, Apple provided support for passwordless authentication in the Safari browser by adding a FIDO2 authenticator to the underlying operating system. This was a step in the right direction and followed Google’s Android passwordless implementation, which has been available for nearly three years.<br><br><br>Screenshot: Apple</p>
      
<p>Apple’s approach to passwordless is not particularly unique since it adheres to the FIDO standard, however their implementation and approach to the credential recovery problem is unique and relevant to enterprises. One refreshing aspect of their messaging and stance on authentication is their dedication to eliminating shared secrets.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Statements such as “Each time that a secret is shared, there is risk,” and “Servers are less valuable targets for hackers because there are no shared secrets to steal” are encouraging to hear and reflect what we’ve been saying at HYPR for years. We put it this way: moving away from shared secrets takes an enterprise from an infrastructure that’s expensive to defend and easy to attack to one that’s expensive to attack and easy to defend.</p>
      

      
 Here’s what’s new in this announcement:&nbsp; 
      
  Apple now has WebAuthn and FIDO2 support for native mobile apps. This means that users can enroll for passwordless authentication in a mobile app as well as browsers. These credentials, enrolled using the native app APIs, can then be used on mobile browsers as well without having to re-enroll.<br>  Synchronization via Keychain. Apple’s new feature “Passkeys in iCloud Keychain” —&nbsp;which are what they call the FIDO2 private key credentials —&nbsp; are now synchronized across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;  
      
 Thoughts on These Updates 
      
  Unsurprisingly, Apple’s keychain synchronization is more focused on consumer authentication than the enterprise.<br><br>Apple’s Passkeys approach is concerning. A Passkey is a private key, make no mistake about it. The best practice in security and cryptography is to not transfer or duplicate key material. I do believe that Apple’s approach to this is going to be world class, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a bad practice that adversaries will likely exploit.<br><br>  Enterprises will not want to synchronize their users’ Passkeys in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios.<br><br>Many enterprises allow BYOD. However, the Passkeys are synchronized across a user’s Apple account and devices. That means that if I’m using my personal phone to authenticate to my corporate resources, the credential used to access those resources could be copied over to my iPad that is shared with my entire household. This could hold a significant liability risk because it would be difficult to track user attribution tied to accessing corporate accounts.<br><br>I predict enterprises that want to leverage the Passkeys method of authentication will opt out of the synchronization offering from Apple and require more enterprise-friendly methods for credential recovery.<br><br>  Developers and IAM vendors will need to leverage the strong association between a native app and website in order to leverage this functionality.<br><br>This functionality is seldom used in apps today. It will need to be provided as an out-of-the-box capability since oftentimes mobile app teams and web teams manage projects in silos.  
      
 Conclusion 
      
<p>Overall the developments from Apple are highly encouraging and have an eye on the future of a passwordless world. Many of their approaches are consumer-centric which is understandable, but for those of us who want to leverage these powerful tools on the enterprise side, there are major security aspects to consider. It will be interesting to see how the MDM technologies in the market address and enforce the Passkeys replication capabilities within Apple’s products. It’s exciting to see future developments from Apple on this topic and we look forward to providing these additional capabilities to HYPR customers soon!</p>

<p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-163-eus-portable-identity-supreme-court-on-data-access-rights-d163bcb022f6">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea&nbsp;Project</a></p><p>This week:</p>  When Apple owns your digital&nbsp;identity  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. When Apple owns your digital&nbsp;identity <p>First the good. Apple is taking digital identity seriously — announcing last week that its latest mobile operating system will allow users to store digital copies of their driver’s license in their&nbsp;wallet.</p>Photo: YouTube<p>With a U.S. base of more than 43 million users on Apple Pay in 2021 — according to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-will-store-digital-us-state-ids-in-apple-wallet-2021-6"> eMarketer for Business Insider</a> — that’s a big deal. And with Apple’s brand and platform cachet, they’re able to drive adoption on both sides of the equation by working closely with local governments. According to CNET’s<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-us-states-will-support-apple-wallet-digital-identity-cards/"> Russell Holly’s napkin math</a>, there could be at least 12 states live at launch, ready to accept Apple&nbsp;ID.</p><p>As GlobaliD’s head of verifications /vs noted, “the digital government ID transformation is further along than you&nbsp;think.”</p><p>So in a lot of ways, Apple just made digital ID relevant — by helping to build the dream where we can finally ditch our chunky physical wallets with a much more robust and convenient digital offering. And because Apple’s business model isn’t based on farming data per se, their commitment to privacy should be commended.</p><p>Now for the not so good. The story of identity should be about individual empowerment. Apple’s story is more about individual convenience in service of Apple. When it comes to the Big in Big Tech, Apple’s as Big as they come — all while being renowned control freaks. Their top-down approach to digital identity isn’t about portability or interoperability, it’s about strengthening their platform moat, where Apple takes a 30 percent cut on all&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Which ultimately serves as a huge tax on creators and developers. Here’s The Information:</p><blockquote>Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said more than 80% of the celebrity shoutout platform’s revenue comes from web vs. its&nbsp;app.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s notable because Galanis is joining a chorus of large and small app developers complaining that the 30% commissions Apple and Google app stores charge customers for digital purchases are holding back smaller businesses, including creators. As we reported last week, some sites that act as platforms for creators, such as Patreon and Medium, side-step those commissions by focusing primarily on purchases over web browsers. Count Cameo in that&nbsp;camp.</blockquote><blockquote>The app takes 25% of a customer’s purchase; the celebrity takes home the other 75%. But if the sale happens on Apple’s iOS, after paying the fees, “the creator is getting 52.5%,” Galanis said. “The big issue here is that if Apple continues these policies, it’s really putting a tax on creators.”</blockquote><p>As we all know, Epic Games has taken Apple to court over that very issue. But that’s basically the point — why do we want a digital identity that doesn’t allow us to choose how we want to pay for things? That’s the end result when your digital identity is still controlled by one of the largest corporations on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Naturally, there’s rumblings as well about privacy concerns when it comes to storing digital copies of your stuff — as<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wallet-digital-ids-privacy-wwdc-2021/"> Mashable’s Jack Morse highlighted</a>. Those concerns are valid — but it’s the type of problem with plenty of potential solutions, whether it be encryption, user education, or UX failsafes. The world is getting more digital — and as more and more companies evolve toward that inevitability, those solutions will only get more refined and secure over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The big takeaway. That Apple is venturing deeper into the digital identity and wallet space can only be a net good as well as being awesome validation for where things are going. The big challenge for smarter approaches to identity will always be around infrastructure and ecosystem development around those new identity tools, and Apple’s entrance in this space will serve as a super catalyst for getting a lot of key puzzle pieces in place such as local government support for digital offerings.</p><p>Moreover, the more people learn about their digital identity, the more they’ll also realize what they really need or what they’re missing when it comes to individual control and ownership. Having a credential is nice — in this case, your state ID in your digital wallet. But it’s really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a portable and interoperable identity’s true potential.</p><p>So we’re already seeing that with the various fights Apple is facing on the Apple Pay side of things. We’re also seeing a lot of initiatives such as the EU digital wallet that will compete head to head with Apple’s new offering, which, as GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd noted last week, was another step in the right direction for a truly portable identity.</p><p>Apple — whether they intend to or not — is getting us all closer to that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/vs">/vs</a>—<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-us-states-will-support-apple-wallet-digital-identity-cards/">What US states will support Apple Wallet digital identity&nbsp;cards?</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>—<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wallet-digital-ids-privacy-wwdc-2021/">Now Apple wants to store your driver’s license on Apple&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/privacy-tech-industry-explodes-52f490ae-e96b-4f1f-abea-13634f5cddef.html">Privacy tech industry&nbsp;explodes</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zuckerberg-jabs-apple-over-creator-fees-floyd-mayweather-joins-onlyfans">Zuckerberg Jabs Apple Over Creator Fees; Floyd Mayweather Joins&nbsp;OnlyFans</a>  Plus, a couple of tweet reactions highlighted by GlobaliD product guru&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>:  <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/malonehedges/status/1401991977768341504?s=21">https://twitter.com/malonehedges/status/1401991977768341504?s=21</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/psb_dc/status/1401954735020810242?s=21">https://twitter.com/psb_dc/status/1401954735020810242?s=21</a></blockquote>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d573aea0-1c37-429e-812b-5a430f23bb2b.html">Great overview on the state of privacy regulations from&nbsp;Axios</a>   2.

   The biggest obstacle to blockchain-based improvements in the global supply chain isn’t technology, it’s getting companies to trust one another.

        <p>Nilsson observes of supply chain actors, “even if they’re working together they’re also competitors.” But, he says, a public ledger is able to allow for the smallest actors in a supply chain to get involved in the sending and receiving of data. This is in part because microtransactions and small fees reduce economic barriers to entry. As blockchain technology continues to be misunderstood, those stewarding supply chain companies into the future of data must devote their attention primarily to education in the coming years. When reshaping the foundations of global distribution networks, slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists no such thing as a Permissioned/Private Blockchain. A Blockchain is per definition a public timestamped record. If it is not public, it simply is a Private Database with a fancy replication mechanism.</p>

<p>Humpty Calderon <br>Está bien ya estamos en vivo, así que bienvenidos a todos. ¡Quién se une a nosotros aquí hoy! Uh, mi nombre es Humpty Calderon, jefe de Comunidad Ontology, tenemos a Raindy, ¿Te gustaría presentarte?</p><p>Raindy<br>Hola a todos, soy Raindy Lou, jefe de marketing y comunicación de Ontology, me alegro de estar&nbsp;aquí.</p><p>Humpty Calderon <br>Excelente y para que lo sepan aquellos de ustedes que no están familiarizados con Ontology, Ontology es una cadena de bloques para identidad y datos soberanos que saben que hay una gran cantidad de tecnología que se ha creado para facilitar la identidad soberana, datos crediticios, marketplaces, DeFi, sabe que si está interesado en obtener una instantánea de lo que es, puede ir a ont.io y puede ver algunos de los diferentes productos y protocolos que se han desarrollado como ont-id, score, Wing piscinas inclusivas dentro de Wing, que es la prueba del concepto de crédito descentralizado y DeFi, hay una billetera ONTO, por supuesto, que no es ningún secreto, mi billetera favorita de activos digitales de múltiples cadenas, la forma más fácil de crear su identidad digital.</p><p>Una vez que haya creado, puede ver lo fácil que es para usted hacer una verificación suave, una verificación dura lo que necesite y luego, por supuesto, saga, algunos de los cuales vamos a hablar hoy sobre cualquier cosa que quisiera agregar a Raindy antes de comenzar, la presentación.</p><p>Raindy <br>Eso ya, está bien, sigue por&nbsp;favor.</p><p>Humpty <br>Está bien, así que hemos compartido una presentación aquí como una plataforma de diapositivas que sabes si alguien está interesado después de esta llamada para tener acceso a esto, solo háganos saber si en los mensajes aquí o a través de las redes sociales de Ontology o en Telegram, diga “Yo vi esta plataforma de lanzamiento realmente genial”. Realmente quiero conseguir uno de esos para mí porque quiero aprender más, quiero sumergirme en cualquiera de estos temas realmente complejos para aprender más sobre cada uno de&nbsp;ellos.</p><p>Así que, como dije, Ontology es una cadena de bloques para auto soberanos, identidad y datos, usted sabe en tres pasos que puede ver qué es Ontology lo que ofrece y su ecosistema, probablemente los exploraremos paso a paso a lo largo de la presentación, plataforma de colaboración distribuida blockchain pública de alto rendimiento de Ontology, básicamente significa blockchain realmente rápido el consenso ha alcanzado, creo que la finalidad es de menos de un segundo, así que definitivamente una de las cadenas de bloques más rápidas que existe, es eficiente en términos de consumo de gas y es capaz de construir sobre ella. Es compatible con Python, Java, Golang, C ++, así que definitivamente es una vía de acceso para los desarrolladores para que puedan comenzar a trabajar en desarrollo de blockchain sin necesariamente tener que aprender un lenguaje de programación diferente.</p> Ontology que proporciona soluciones DID para plataformas de transmisión de música,&nbsp;ROCKI <p>Entonces, si avanzamos por aquí, podemos ver algunos de los diferentes socios que Ontology ha recientemente incorporó a la cadena de bloques para su identidad, debería decir solución y eso es rocki, si no está familiarizado con quiénes son, son una plataforma de música que está construida para que músicos, artistas, creadores, compartan su música de manera descentralizada y, como se dice aquí, Ontology y rocki han desarrollado una asociación estratégica para integrar las soluciones de identidad descentralizadas desarrolladas por Ontology para verificar a sus artistas.</p><p>Ciertamente, profundicé en eso, de hecho, lo hice anteriormente en la llamada de hoy y en otras conversaciones que publiqué en Twitter y Clubhouse, donde analizamos por qué eso es importante, por qué la identidad es importante cuando se trata de verificar al creador y verificar los activos digitales, por supuesto, la autenticidad es clave, especialmente porque la razón por la que recopila algo es porque desea apoyar a un creador en particular. Raindy, ¿Quieres agregar algo sobre rocki y en términos de saber por qué Ontology ve que el proyecto es importante y valioso para expandir la identidad descentralizada?</p><p>Raindy <br>Genial, así que hablamos con rocki durante mucho tiempo que, dado que el mercado NFT está aumentando ahora y tienen los requisitos sobre el sistema de registro KYC y AML, están encontrando socios que prueben especialmente soluciones en esta área y compararon diferentes proyectos entre todos los que están haciendo, lo mismo que la cienciología y luego de continuar los esfuerzos de nuestro equipo técnico y de negocios, finalmente eligieron Ontology porque piensan que Ontology es el principal experto en esta área, por lo que el objetivo tanto de rocki como de Ontology es que queremos transformar el sistema de inicio de sesión tradicional para cada creador en la plataforma rocki de una forma centralizada a una forma descentralizada para que de esa manera y todos los usuarios puedan tener el poder de controlar sus propios datos y accesos sin vincular la información a la plataforma tan que es muy importante y también es una forma de innovación para todos los proyectos que tiene ese sentido de proteger la identidad y los datos del usuario, así que a través de esa manera ahora vamos a construir todo el sistema y luego mostraremos a los miembros de nuestra comunidad y también a los usuarios que saben que funciona.</p><p>Creo que no habría mucha barrera entre la forma de inicio de sesión tradicional para descentralizar la forma para que los usuarios simplemente inicien sesión como lo hacen antes, pero en realidad está protegiendo su identidad utilizando las soluciones de identificación, lo cual es realmente genial.</p><p>Humpty<br>Sí, creo que otra cosa que vale la pena señalar si observamos que rocki está construido en la Binance Smart Chain, por lo que esta es una plataforma, un producto que no está operando en Ontology, pero está operando en otra blockchain, por lo que es importante tener en cuenta que Ontology ha implementado estas soluciones de identidad en otras cadenas de bloques correctamente, por lo que puede decirnos brevemente cuáles son algunas de estas cadenas de&nbsp;bloques.</p><p>Raindy <br>Sí, además de BSC, también estamos probando soluciones como Ethereum, Polkadot, Tron y todas las cadenas públicas líderes, diría que puede encontrar el registro de w3c en su sitio oficial para ver cuántos hicieron soluciones y registro el cual es proporcionado por la Fundación de Ontology. Entonces, creo que no importa el “ID de ONT” o el O-score, no solo se limita a la cadena de Ontology y el ecosistema que debería ser a todo el sistema blockchain, por lo que estamos impulsando más aplicaciones y rocki es un buen comienzo para fomentar más proyectos. sobre la base de BSC para considerar que las soluciones que pueden ser empoderadas en sus propios proyectos.</p><p>Humpty <br>Absolutamente quiero decir que realmente me encanta esa idea de que conozcas la interoperabilidad y la portabilidad de esa identidad, porque si estás creando soluciones de identidad y las estás bloqueando dentro de un protocolo en particular, ya sea que conozcas una plataforma como esta o solo una blockchain, tú sabes que hay valor para los usuarios, pero ese valor es limitado. Es genial que lo que Ontology está construyendo, usted sabe en ONT-id y O-score y todos estos otros protocolos de identidad es esa interoperabilidad, porque de esa manera las personas que, por ejemplo, pueden utilizar su identidad en Binance Smart Chain, podrían llevar esa identidad a otra blockchain como Ontology.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, esa es la idea para que todos tengan su identidad descentralizada, pero no quieren que sea individual, por lo que debería funcionar siempre que sea posible, así que eso es lo que hacemos y hacer nuestros esfuerzos para eliminar todas las barreras y límites entre las diferentes cadenas para ser la verdadera diafonía.</p><p>Humpty <br>Sí, absolutamente, creo que en los últimos años hemos visto el valor de la interoperabilidad, ya sea para crear algún tipo de puente entre cadenas para activos digitales o incluso dentro de DeFi con el derecho de compatibilidad de estos protocolos para que puede crear un ecosistema más dinámico Creo que lo mismo va a ser cierto para la identidad, habrá una necesidad de esa interoperabilidad y compatibilidad para crear una experiencia más rica, una experiencia más sólida y segura para las personas.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, definitivamente genial.</p><p>Humpty<br> De acuerdo, en realidad, esta es una diapositiva genial, me gusta mucho esta y, de hecho, podría hacer de esta mi foto de perfil por un tiempo porque me gusta que muestra el rico ecosistema y profundo de ONTO-id, la cantidad de blockchain en la que se encuentra actualmente y sabes que esto está creciendo.</p><p>Quiero decir, vemos como dijiste que algunas de las cadenas de bloques líderes aquí tenemos Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Near Protocol, Elrond, Tron, Klaytn, Ontology obviamente, así que es realmente genial ver que conoces el desarrollo que cubre la gama. de blockchains, al igual que tiene su token favorito, es probable que su blockchain favorito, ONTO-id ya esté&nbsp;allí.</p><p>Entonces, ONTO, mi billetera favorita, ve a Twitter, verás que hablo lo suficiente sobre eso y luego sabes que las charlas que tengo en el clubhouse, ¿hay algo que no sepamos sobre ONTO o tal vez otra perspectiva sobre ONTO que creas que es valiosa para que sepamos más allá del hecho de que es una cadena múltiple que admite múltiples tokens y del hecho de que es una forma sencilla de crear su identidad descentralizada.</p><p>Raindy<br> Creo que hay tres puntos los puntos brillantes de ONTO, que el primero es que es una billetera descentralizada, que es diferente de las billeteras centralizadas, por lo que solo mantienen sus activos criptográficos en su servidor y aún tiene el riesgo si lo hacen, algún daño a los activos, por lo que también puede evitar ese tipo de&nbsp;riesgos.</p><p>El segundo es la verdadera cadena cruzada con él, por lo que significa que una vez que tenga su propio wallet, una vez que descargue y abra hasta que realmente se vincule a los otros activos que se admiten como se enumeran, debería haber como 14 en total para que no lo haga, no es necesario obtener una copia de todas las palabras dinámicas para cada diez, pero solo necesita obtener una clave privada para eso, por lo que ahorra tiempo y esfuerzos para que los usuarios administren sus activos y aunque vayan a apagar sus dispositivos. como si tuvieran el nuevo teléfono, luego descargan ONTO en su nuevo móvil e importan fácilmente sus activos&nbsp;allí.</p><p>Entonces, el tercero es que es el único veredicto criptográfico con la identidad activada en poderes, por lo que obtiene el ONT-id y puede tener su puntaje O con el ONTO-id dentro de ONTO, el cálculo se basa en su comportamiento en la cadena también los activos criptográficos que tiene, por lo que es realmente diferente y el criptográfico líder quería, entre otros, diría y otra cosa es que no solo es la billetera móvil porque el mes pasado obtuvimos la versión web de ONTO, por lo que es una extensión de Chrome, por lo que no importa si está usando el teléfono móvil o la PC, en realidad está usando la misma billetera y que es fácil de saltar la barrera entre los interruptores, por lo que solo tiene un ONT-id y puede administrar sus&nbsp;activos.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sabes, creo que tener esa flexibilidad para poder ir desde tu billetera de escritorio o debería decir la billetera de tu navegador e ir a tu billetera móvil para poder utilizarla no solo para activos digitales sino para identidad. Creo que es una experiencia rica esta dinámica, utilidad que le das a la gente creo que eso hace que la billetera sea mucho más valiosa es una de las cosas que digo cada vez que hablo con la gente sobre billeteras digitales lo digo y lo sabes honestamente, además creo que la billetera digital ha recorrido un largo camino desde el principio pero sabes que todavía hay espacio para la evolución, todavía hay espacio para mejorar y a medida que la identidad comienza a convertirse en un elemento importante para ayudar a que blockchain y cryptos,&nbsp;maduren.</p><p>Creo que veremos un montón de valor en tener billeteras que tengan estas soluciones integradas en estas soluciones de identidad y quiero decir que no estoy diciendo que sepa lo que hacen todas las billeteras, pero no creo que haya otra billetera.</p><p>Esto es lo que tiene ONTO en términos de esa flexibilidad y esa rica utilidad de conocimiento que va más allá de simplemente mantener activos digitales o más allá de simplemente trabajar en múltiples cadenas de&nbsp;bloques.</p> ¿Por qué&nbsp;ONTO? <p>Humpty <br>Entonces, ya sabe un poco sobre lo que acabamos de hablar en términos de por qué desea usar ONTO, sepa que es esa billetera descentralizada, usted es dueño de sus activos, posee sus claves, le brinda o le permite tener su identidad también como parte de su billetera digital, creo que sabe que todos estos son elementos críticos para hacer que estas billeteras sean más seguras y las hace más valiosas para las personas, ya que, como dije, blockchain continúa creciendo y evolucionando.</p> Beneficiarios de ONTO&nbsp;ID <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, no sé si vamos a hablar sobre el o-score en una de estas próximas diapositivas, tal vez ya hemos ido más allá porque hemos hablado de ONT-id, pero creo que tal vez no deberíamos ir demasiado lejos, sin hablar de o-score, ambos van de la mano juntos o-score en ONTO-id siendo su identidad digital correcta y luego o-score siendo su reputación basada en esa identidad, ¿podría darnos una introducción rápida a qué es el o-score y por qué es importante desde su perspectiva.</p><p>Raindy<br> Claro, entonces, una vez que todos tienen la identidad, es como un identificador para que la gente lo conozca, quién es usted, pero cómo pueden juzgar su confianza, eso se basa en el puntaje o-score, por eso tenemos el o-score el protocolo de puntuación en nuestro ecosistema, por lo que todos pueden obtener una puntuación extra de las clasificaciones o puntuaciones que se basan en su ONTO-id y se vincula a todos los comportamientos que hacen en el chat, pero se puede personalizar de acuerdo con sus propias demandas, por lo que diría que no hay límite o pautas para decirle a la gente que cómo se generará su puntaje o porque es bastante diferente, depende de diferentes demandas, por lo que básicamente el caso de uso, Wing Finance, la plataforma DeFi que es desarrollada por la autoridad, por lo que hay un grupo inclusivo que es una plataforma de aprendizaje basada en créditos, por lo que una vez que obtenga su puntaje o, le permite estar sub-caracterizado para obtener los activos criptográficos permitidos.</p><p>Digamos que tienes $1000 USD como garantía, puede ser el USDT y obtienes un puntaje muy alto, entonces te permite pedir prestado como $ 1.000 y $ 100.000 USD tal vez en función de la confianza que tengas en el chat, por lo que hace que en la aplicación real permitir que las personas usen la reputación de sus credenciales y obtengan los beneficios reales a lo largo de ella, por lo que es un protocolo importante para el mundo de la cadena de bloques porque está resolviendo los problemas sobre el estrés, por lo que ¿Cuál es la cadena de bloques el objetivo y el valor de la transmisión? Diría&nbsp;yo.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, sabes, creo que existe una relación sinérgica entre ONTO-id y o-score, realmente la forma en que se utilizan y, como dijiste, hay mucha flexibilidad en cómo se puede crear esa puntuación. Realmente me gusta lo que ha hecho Ontology con Wing porque realmente está demostrando que el futuro de DeFi, sabes que aún es tan temprano que no tiene que estar demasiado colateralizado, sabes que no es así como funciona el mundo real, tienes una reputación en el mundo real y esa reputación es lo que le permite tomar prestado correctamente y, por lo tanto, con o-score y en Wing como un ejemplo como el que mencionó Raindy, es solo para reiterar porque creo que es importante que luego pueda obtener mejores tasas ya sea que se trate de un préstamo con garantía insuficiente o de mejores incentivos, lo digo en serio, eso también depende del protocolo en el que se integran el puntaje en el sitio y el puntaje o, usted sabe que puede haber un caso de uso diferente.</p><p>Ejemplo… Veo que Alonso aquí en el chat es preguntar si los sistemas de fidelización del consumidor es un buen caso absolutamente, sabes que te imaginas ahora mismo sabes que en el mundo real tienes estas tarjetas de fidelización y cuántas tienes o tal vez tienes que descargar la aplicación y cada vez que vas tienes que escanear esto pero realmente es esto la mejor manera es que haya una manera de que pueda potencialmente llevar esa reputación a todas las diferentes tiendas y sitios web que conoce que visita, si lo hace, tal vez sea una representación más precisa de quién es usted sabe que va a cinco mercados y estás diciendo&nbsp;… bueno, quiero comprar las mismas cosas y voy a todas partes bien con ONTO-id con&nbsp;o-score.</p><p>Potencialmente esta información nuevamente esta es tu identidad tus datos depende de ti cuánto de esto quieres para compartir, digo que quiero compartir esta información con estos cinco proveedores y, a partir de ahí, ellos pueden dictar su lealtad y luego otorgarle recompensas basadas en esa cadena que conoce en el mundo real o en la que conoce en la web también, porque, por supuesto, la mayor parte del mundo se ha vuelto digital, por lo que la mayoría de nosotros compramos todas nuestras cosas en línea, definitivamente un caso de uso muy bueno para los airdrops, dice&nbsp;Liu.</p><p>Estoy preguntando absolutamente que sabes en términos de lanzamientos aéreos, tal vez Raindy, podrías hablar un poco sobre cómo se está utilizando hoy en&nbsp;día.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, y en realidad, el equipo está trabajando en el caso de uso relacionado con el lanzamiento aéreo con el ID de ONT, porque en el mundo de las criptomonedas, especialmente cuando el nuevo proyecto está lanzando los tokens, habrá lanzamientos aéreos masivos allí, así que lo que el equipo del proyecto puede decir es que saben que pueden evitar que los robots obtengan los lanzamientos aéreos de forma gratuita y que es un poco perjudicial para los usuarios reales y los miembros reales de la comunidad obtener las recompensas de una manera confiable, por lo que a través del sistema ONTid y lo llamaremos Al igual que lo hicieron, las soluciones SDK brindaron a los proyectos que estamos buscando formas de evaluar a todas las personas que participan en la dirección como acreditaciones y también en función de sus retiros anteriores en la cadena, por lo que es una especie de solución de los problemas y sus inquietudes, no estoy en ese caso porque Gloria, nuestra jefa de líderes de desarrollo de ecosistemas, está liderando los proyectos, así que creo que podemos guardar esas preguntas en nuestras notas y buscaremos información más detallada con ella y le daremos las respuestas directamente.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, creo que es algo genial, reo que una de las cosas valiosas de eventos como este es que recibimos preguntas que, aunque no somos la persona técnica o no tenemos toda la información, podemos usar esto para asegurarnos. que podemos ayudar a continuar educando a la comunidad sobre todos estos casos de uso particulares e incluso algunos de los que ya estamos explorando, tal vez solo para tocar los lanzamientos aéreos un poco, ya sabes, en una de las llamadas que he alojado en la ClubHouse.</p><p>Alguien dio un muy buen ejemplo y sabes que UNI lanzó Uniswap por airdrop, debería decir que UNI lanzó a toda su base de usuarios, pero sabes una de las cosas, una de las preguntas que nos hacemos en términos de que sabes la forma en que se distribuyó frente a tal vez si hubieran usado algún tipo de solución de identidad es si una persona hubiera usado 10 billeteras y una persona solo usó una billetera, ¿cree usted que es justo que la distribución se envió de manera justa porque una persona obtuvo mucho más que otra? Es decir, porque no saben que está mal que esté usando 10 billeteras diferentes, pero ahora la distribución de esa riqueza de esa ficha no es justa, no es por persona, ahora va a las billeteras correctamente, así que si realmente queremos busque formas de crear una distribución más justa de estos&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Potencialmente, podemos buscar soluciones como ONT-id para asegurarnos de que lo estamos enviando a personas reales correctamente y cómo verificamos que estas personas son reales. Quiero decir, si descarga ONTO, puede ver que hay formas de&nbsp;hacerlo.</p><p>En la verificación social, también puede hacerlo a través de algunos métodos de verificación estrictos que utilizan el elemento KYC que conoce, por lo que ciertamente hay muchas formas diferentes en que podemos hacer esto y usted sabe que lo realmente bueno es que hay muchas áreas que pueden ser explorado con identidad.</p> SAGA <p>Humpty<br> Bueno, estamos redondeando bien, somos todos, casi hemos estado aquí una hora Raindy, así que es fantástico, veamos si podemos terminar esta presentación.</p><p>Sé que Saga es algo que su equipo sabe que está desarrollando actualmente y explorando casos de uso para que pueda darnos un resumen muy rápido, qué es Saga y por qué es importante.</p><p>Raindy<br> Sí, Saga es un mercado de datos descentralizado que está diseñado tanto para individuos como para empresas, así que lo que estamos haciendo ahora es eso, recuerdo que un miembro de la comunidad mencionó que cuál es su comprensión de la saga es la pulgada de esos datos, por lo que es realmente impresionante porque obtuvo la idea principal, tan recientemente que en la mayoría de los casos en torno a los activos digitales, es por eso que tenemos tantas, muchas plataformas DeFi, pero en realidad tenemos los requisitos y preguntamos sobre los datos en largo plazo, esa es la razón por la que acumulamos datos y, como presentamos antes, Ontology es una cadena de bloques no solo para la identidad descentralizada sino también para los datos y el ONTid es uno de los elementos importantes del proyecto.</p><p>Entonces, ahora puedes iniciar sesión en el sitio web de Saga, ya está en vivo como por el año&nbsp;pasado.</p><p>Por lo tanto, puede intentar iniciar sesión con su ONT-id y comenzar a obtener los datos enumerados en el sitio web, pero a largo plazo vamos a construir más que eso, por lo que será un mercado de datos verdaderamente descentralizado, debería construirse en la Cadena de Ontology, pero será más interesante con la otra oportunidad, así que esa es la idea y hacer que este mercado sea más útil que la idea es que vamos a obtener más casos de uso que es el uso de la lógica de las plataformas de Saga y hacer el lanzamiento oficial en una etapa posterior para estar completamente preparados y mostrar nuestro profesionalismo y también el respeto a los antiguos usuarios, por lo tanto no nos queremos apresurar y mejor prestar más atención a los detalles para tenerlo mejor y más preparado.</p><p>Humpty<br> Sí, eso es fantástico, quiero decir, creo que lo que está haciendo Ontology es crear un ecosistema muy completo para la identidad y los datos correctos, si tiene su identidad digital, tiene su puntaje de crédito digital, tiene, debería decir, puntaje de crédito descentralizado, identidad descentralizada. tiene la integración de DeFi, que es la siguiente diapositiva a la que vamos a llegar con Wing, tiene la billetera que le permite utilizar todo este ecosistema, desde la creación de su identidad hasta la utilización de estos protocolos DeFi y potencialmente en el futuro utilizando SAGA, que es este mercado descentralizado.</p> WING <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, Wing la primera plataforma de préstamos de DeFi de cadena cruzada basada en crédito que es una gran realidad, básicamente la plataforma de préstamos tiene grupos flash tradicionales, actualmente es de cadena cruzada porque actualmente está en Ontology, está en Ethereum y en OKchain, que era lanzado recientemente el creo que hace una semana o&nbsp;dos.</p><p>El tiempo vuela, recuerdo que estábamos anunciando que era tan emocionante y luego lo interesante o el elemento único de esta plataforma es porque Ontology ha desarrollado estas tecnologías enfocadas en la identidad descentralizada, fueron capaces de crear, supongo que como un campo de pruebas de cómo eso podría funcionar y eso es derecho inclusivo.</p><p>Hablamos antes en términos de préstamos garantizados, mejores recompensas, lo cual es genial y creo que si saben que el futuro de DeFi será este, cuanto más escucho a la gente hablar sobre este tema en Twitter en Clubhouse. Sé que en YouTube, una variedad de canales de medios, la gente está viendo que actualmente la forma en que se construye DeFi no es justa, solo beneficia a aquellos que están&nbsp;contigo.</p><p>Conoces mucha riqueza, la palabra que veo que se usa mucho como plutocracia, lo que significa que tú tiene una tonelada más de dinero, entonces su voz cuenta más y sabe realmente lo que blockchain crypto está tratando de resolver es realmente ir en contra de muchas de estas formas tradicionales de cómo funciona la economía y quiere ser más justo y creo que con la Introducción de identidades y puntajes crediticios descentralizados.</p><p>Existe la posibilidad de aprovechar su comportamiento, su reputación para poder acceder a estos mercados sin tener necesariamente esta gran cantidad de activos digitales que usted conoce para poder respaldar eso préstamo.</p> Comunidad Ontology <p>Humpty<br> Entonces, creo que estamos casi al final de nuestra presentación aquí, Raindy, ¿quieres hacer algunos comentarios finales en términos de que conoces Ontology y este ecosistema tan&nbsp;rico?</p><p>Raindy <br>¡Si! Entonces, pienso a través de la charla de hoy y la presentación que la gente ya tuvo la idea de que lo que Ontology está haciendo, lo que estamos haciendo es enfocarnos en la identidad descentralizada que es lo primero y lo segundo son los datos, entonces, ¿Qué enumeramos en&nbsp;esto?</p><p>El gráfico de información muestra que lo que hemos logrado en este aspecto, pero más que eso, todavía estamos haciendo lo tradicional, como todos los proyectos de criptografía, estamos haciendo el ecosistema rico con todas las cadenas públicas, billeteras, proyectos e intercambios DeFi y también los otros protocolos y con el objetivo de construir palabras confiables con el esfuerzo de todos, para que pueda ver que ya hemos tenido comunidades de más de 29 idiomas y estamos presionando a nuestros socios a alrededor de 200, creo que debería ser más que eso recientemente y también hablando de la gobernabilidad, sabía que tenemos redes descentralizadas y globales de Ontology, como pueden ver, tenemos alrededor de 1.000 nodos en total y los 65 de ellos como nodos candidatos.</p><p>Por ende, incluso para los usuarios individuales que pueden apostar su ONT en cualquiera de los nodos y ganar ONG, la tarifa del gas es la que les da acceso para hacer transacciones en la cadena de Ontology y lo que es increíble es que ahora tenemos tantos ONT-ids creados en la Cadena de Ontología y es muy bueno ver que tanta gente tiene una identidad descentralizada a partir de Ontology, y espero que haya más personas que tengan sus ideas y datos que controlen por sí mismos a través de una manera descentralizada y Ontology seguirá esforzándose en estos aspectos y construyendo un mundo más confiable para&nbsp;todos.</p><p>Live session tomado de: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDojJAwTXhc">Ontology live session at Consensus 2021 by CoinDesk — YouTube</a></p><p>Traducido por:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/aidonker_x">aidonker</a></p><p>Encuentra mas en: <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology | A blockchain for self-sovereign ID and&nbsp;DATA</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/resumen-de-ontology-live-session-at-consensus-2021-by-coindesk-c668d5918061">Resumen de Ontology live session at Consensus 2021 by CoinDesk</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					  Nicht verpassen: Alles dreht sich um digitale Identitäten und den Einsatz von Vertrauensdiensten in der Praxis auf dem „eIDAS Summit“ des bitkom. Auf der virtuellen Hauptbühne spricht Dominik Deimel, Gründer von comuny, über “Föderierte Identitäten und Datensouveränität – ein Modell nicht nur für den Gesundheitsmarkt” (Bühne Vertrauensdienste in der Praxis, 11:50-12:10 Uhr, 15.06.2021). <p>Föderiertes Identitätsmanagement ist heute ein etablierter Standard, der es dem Nutzer erlaubt, mit seiner Identität verschiedenste Dienste im Sinne eines Single-Sign-On zu nutzen. Dieser Ansatz bedingt, dass ein Identitätsprovider (IDP) viele Informationen des Nutzers verarbeiten kann (Stichwort “Profilbildung”) gleichzeitig aber – in regulierten Märkten – einen hohen Aufwand für den Schutz persönlicher Daten betreiben muss. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Krankenversicherer, die den Zugang zu Diensten der Telematikinfrastruktur wie ePA oder eRezept organisieren. Hier brauchen die Teilnehmer eines föderierten Netzwerks im Gesundheitsmarkt gegenseitige Kontrolle und Akzeptanz. Die Herausforderung in Zukunft: Der souveräne Umgang des Nutzers mit seinen Identitätsdaten in der eID Wallet auf dem Mobilgerät.</p><p>Im Vortrag wird die Architektur eines IDP vorgestellt, der Vorteile und Vorgaben von OIDC und eIDAS als etablierte Standards sowie die Prinzipien von Self Sovereign Identities zusammenbringt. Damit lässt sich sofort und ohne Blockchain Technologie das Mobilgerät als komfortabler Authenticator mit einer mobilen eID Wallet nutzen. Beide Seiten profitieren: Nutzer behalten die Hoheit über ihre sensiblen Daten, und Unternehmen erfüllen die hohen Auflagen von Datenschutz und eIDAS. Dieser Ansatz bietet ein Geschäftsmodell, welches sich sehr gut auf andere Märkte übertragen lässt und offen ist für Business mit weiteren technischen Lösungspartnern und Integratoren.</p><p>#bitkom #eIDAS21 #comuny #Vertrauensdienste #DigitalIdentity #MyDataOperator #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p><p>Virtuelle Konferenz des Digitalverbands Deutschlands mit branchenübergreifendem Austausch, über 1.000 Expertinnen und Experten, #Tech-Trends, <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#Insights</a> &amp; <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#BestPractices</a> zur sicheren Digitalisierung von Prozessen.</p><p>Anmeldung und kostenfreie Tickets unter <a href="https://www.eidas-summit.de/de">https://www.eidas-summit.de/de</a> und mehr über den Ansatz von comuny <a href="https://www.comuny.de/produkt/">mehr über den Ansatz von comuny</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The growing degree of digitization and the ever-increasing online transactions has necessitated a strong and secure way to identify and authenticate digital entities. This has led to the emergence of Digital Identity Management, where digital documents that prove the identity of an entity are stored and shared digitally.</p><p>While there are many components in digital identity management, in this article, we will talk about a central component called identity&nbsp;wallets.</p> What’s an Identity&nbsp;Wallet? <p>An identity wallet is a digital wallet/storage where you can safely store your digitized documents and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and share them easily with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>You own this wallet and its contents, so you have the power to decide how and with whom you want to share your credentials. This concept of always being in charge of your identity is called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and it is one of the pillars of web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>So, how can this identity wallet be beneficial for you and why should you embrace&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here are five reasons why we think identity wallets are the&nbsp;future.</p> Reason #1: Keeps your Data&nbsp;Safe <p>One of the biggest issues facing the digital age is cyberattacks and the resultant <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-id-theft-what-happens-when-your-identity-stolen.html">identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>If you analyze identity thefts and their patterns, you’ll notice that hackers steal millions of identities from a single storage/database, and often, the owner of the identity would know of the theft only much later, and sometimes, may not know it at&nbsp;all!</p><p>But what happens when you do away with a central repository where all the data is stored and replace it with a decentralized form of storage where each entity stores its data separately?</p><p>It becomes that much harder for someone to steal data because it requires considerable effort to steal just one record, which is not tenable in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>To top it all, the owner is in complete control of the data at all times, so identity theft may not even be possible in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>In all, your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data is&nbsp;safe</a>.</p> Reason #2: Know Where Your Data is&nbsp;Used <p>Surveys and opinion polls overwhelmingly show that users are concerned about their privacy and want to know how and where their data is stored and&nbsp;used.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/2020/consumer-data-report-kpmg.pdf">survey by KPMG</a> shows that data privacy is a concern for 97% of U.S consumers and almost 54% worry about what companies do with their data. Likewise, the Eurobarometer survey states that 72% of users want to know how their data is processed.</p><p>These numbers clearly show that users will feel more comfortable when they know where their data is stored and how it is&nbsp;used.</p><p>The good news with identity wallets is that you control the entire data sharing process, so there’s no concern about how someone else can use your&nbsp;data.</p><p>You can choose to send <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">only the relevant data</a> to entities for processing. For example, if you have to prove your age, just send your date of birth credential without including other details such as your address or government ID. That’s how granular you can get with data sharing and its&nbsp;usage.</p> Reason #3: Meets Mandatory Compliance Requirements <p>The European Parliament and Council implemented the eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and trust Services) regulation in 2014 and paved the way for greater digital security. The more recent <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a> further empowers users to store their identities in a digital wallet and use it seamlessly where needed, even across boundaries.</p><p>Such forward-looking regulations are likely to be adopted by other countries as well, so before long, having an identity wallet can become a way of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Why not jump on the bandwagon early and proactively meet the required <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">compliance</a> requirements?</p><p>This way, you can enjoy its benefits early&nbsp;on.</p> Reason #4: Facilitates Quick and Easy Authentication <p>Besides keeping your credentials safe, an identity wallet can facilitate quick, easy, and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">hassle-free authentication</a>.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">opening a bank account </a>in a different country doesn’t have to entail the collection and submission of a ton of documents that could take weeks to process. With digital credentials stored in an identity wallet, the entire process can be completed in a few minutes because all that you have to do is share it electronically.</p><p>The concerned bank authorities can verify the data and open an account for you. That’s how easy it can&nbsp;be!</p> Reason #5: Perform a Wide Range of Tasks Electronically <p>As more businesses accept identity wallets, it won’t be long before you can share the pertinent information in your identity wallets with a wide range of online services.</p><p>Some possible tasks you can do with an identity wallet&nbsp;are:</p>  Prove that you’re 18+ years of age to buy alcohol or enter a&nbsp;bar  Share your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">past employment</a> and educational qualifications with prospective employers  Use it as a <a href="https://www.safetravel.affinidi.com/">health passport</a> for travel or to buy the prescribed medicines in any part of the&nbsp;world.  <p>Here are some more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world ideas</a> where an identity wallet can come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>Undoubtedly, identity wallets are an integral part of the future as it comes with a ton of benefits geared for the next-gen online security.</p><p>So, are you ready to use an identity wallet and leverage the many benefits that come with&nbsp;it?</p><p>Already, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">European Union</a> has set things in motion as it plans to create a digital identity wallet that will securely store payment details, passwords, digital documents, and PII of individuals from all the 27 member nations, so the same can be used when needed across a wide range of public and private online services.</p><p>To leverage this trend, Affinidi offers APIs and SDKs to create a secure identity wallet to store your verifiable credentials.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint was released mid-June to help shape the development of a cohesive but decentralized method of issuing, holding, and verifying the results of a COVID status test. The Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) is an open and publicly funded collaborative; it was founded by <a href="https://id2020.org/" title="ID2020">ID2020</a> and the working group is managed by the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/" title="Trust over IP Foundation">Trust over IP Foundation</a>. The <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/" title="blueprint">blueprint</a>, which is now available for public comment, lays out the most important and intentional design choices as well as recommendations to implement an interoperable and inclusive system.</p>
 Intentional design choices 
<p>The Good Health Pass outlines their recommended architecture aspects:</p>
 
 Individuals should be in control of their data: This goes on to describe the relationship between the issuer of a credential (a test center) and the holder of a credential (the individual being tested), as well as the relationship between the holder and a verifier (entity that checks the credential before granting access to a service, such as airport staff, border control, etc.). It is explicitly stated that there is no room for a third party in these interactions – the holder should interact directly with anyone needing to issue or verify their credential. It recommends being restrictive by design with privacy by default. To enable this, the blueprint chooses to use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" title="W3C Verifiable Credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> as a standard for interoperability, which also allows for selective disclosure of credentials. 
 Equity and Inclusion: There are concerns around tracking the health status of individuals and using it as a gatekeeper to accessing private and public services, and rightly so. When equal access to basic rights are sidelined in favor of promoting mobility, there are risks that some groups will be marginalized. It must be remembered that vaccines are not universally available. Therefore, a negative test must also suffice to allow equal access to services. Thus the name of a credentialing service is important. It should not be called a vaccine passport because it is misleading and would clearly create a barrier to services for large populations who do not have access or choose not to receive a vaccine. It is recommended to be called a “digital health pass”. Access also includes device and offline access. Although a smartphone is the preferred channel for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials, there must be an offline version for those who do not have a smartphone. QR codes on a hard copy credential can fulfill this, with multiple QR codes for different selective disclosure scenarios. 
 Decentralized for security and scalability: This blueprint argues that a decentralized approach boost security of holding and exchanging PII. This argument is made in more detail in <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80301/demystifying-the-blockchain-what-makes-a-blockchain-useful-to-a-firm/" title="other resources">other resources</a>. In terms of scalability, the GHPC explains that a decentralized digital health pass could reduce stress and traffic between healthcare information systems by shifting the work of issuing and verifying credentials to other parties, but the scalability of the decentralized ecosystems is not addressed. The scalability of decentralized ecosystems is still a relatively open question, with widely varying results based on the particular public/private/consortium blockchain arrangement used. 
 Open Standards for interoperability and participation: without a doubt, open standards must be followed so that a credential issued at one test center can be accepted at any verifier. The GHPC insists on a pragmatic and phased approach to designing and implementing. While that has led to a well-thought-out blueprint, it is already late to meeting real-world needs. In many countries, the initial rollback of lockdown measures has already occurred, and the reopening of economies means that systems to prove a negative COVID status have already been implemented in a disjointed way. The solutions that are out there many times provide a verifiable certificate, but can be missing other elements such as decentralization, the ability to certify a self-test without a smartphone, or the ability to just use one app for different testing stations. Decentralized systems also face a challenge of unified communication – already a trend in regional vs. federal measures where individuals may find it difficult to find reliable information that does not conflict with other sources. However, the systems in place are less than perfect but they do function to a limited degree and may disincentivize local governments from redesigning their initiatives based on the GHPC’s recommendations. 
 
<p></p>
 Identity Verification as a Foundation 
<p>Among the recommendations offered by the GHPC, binding the holder's identity with their credential is important to ensure that the credential does indeed belong to the holder. This lines up with the rising use of identity verification to accompany onboarding and authentication for higher security. Offline testing and credential issuance may rely on a manual check of a photo ID, but this does not last beyond the time of verification. Binding an identity to a Verifiable Credential remains valid beyond the point of verification by being able to match a real-time biometric data point with one which was logged at the point of verification – checking that a fingerprint matches the one which was logged when the credential was issued, for example. When using decentralized architectures, identity verification can still provide high and/or selective privacy for the holder while assuring the issuer or verifier that the credential can be trusted.</p>
<p>While the GHCP’s blueprint is well designed and offers concrete recommendations for a functional yet privacy-centric solution with implementation recommendations for 30, 90, and 180 day intervals, it comes late in the game and may face reluctance from public players. GHCP may also have limited the potential for its own adoption by relying on a decentralized architecture only, instead of building interoperability for health passes already in circulation. However, this may be the chance that decentralized identity has needed to demonstrate its efficacy on a global level. KuppingerCole will continue researching this market segment, as it has high potential to positively disrupt digital identity management for the individual as well as for the enterprise.</p>

<p>Companies today manage and maintain master data from business partners in multiple instances in various in-house IT systems — and do the same with their own master data in thirdparty systems. Each company has to invest a great deal of time and money in ensuring this data is of good quality. This is due to the high number of data sets created in the process — which amount to several million in the case of major corporations. In addition to this, suppliers have to submit hundreds of certificates year after year to customers such as car manufacturers. Sustainability certificates have recently become increasingly important, too. In practice, this usually results in a considerable amount of manual work on both sides that is very time consuming and prone to errors. The team responsible for the strategic advance engineering project “Economy of Things” (EoT) at Bosch Research is working with partners on an innovative concept that aims to tackle these very issues.</p>

			 Are Banks Missing Out on the Digital Money Revolution?<br>
 
<p>Digitalization continues to accelerate our everyday life, affecting people, businesses, governments and financial institutions. The Covid-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst that revolutionized the way people work, purchase, and invest. The hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) is evidence of the growing interest in investment opportunities brought by blockchain technology.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">According to a recent report</a>,&nbsp;security tokens are seen as the next blockchain wave&nbsp;and are predicted to reach a market of €918 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>Naturally, the demand for these new means of investment has pushed digital money into the spotlight. Why? Because&nbsp;the cash leg must be on the same infrastructure as the securities&nbsp;in order to allow a real transition to a decentralized network. While most banks are still waiting for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to show the way, stablecoins issued by crypto players have reached a record-high trading volume at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">$766.02 billion in May</a>, up 51.9% from the previous month, and nearly 15x greater than one year ago.</p>
<p>CBDC&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Commercial bank digital money&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Stablecoins:</p>
<p>First, let’s take a deeper look at the two forms of money in the current banking system: central bank money and commercial bank money. Central bank money is made available to the public in the form of cash and to commercial banks in the form of central bank reserves. Private money is deposited into commercial banks, and banks are required to hold a certain percentage of these deposits at the central bank as a cushion. The rest of the deposits are used to grant loans to individuals and companies, where commercial bank money is created at this point. Therefore,&nbsp;in traditional finance, commercial banks act like trusted entities&nbsp;to not only provide essential services to customers, but also help create capital and liquidity in the market.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Similarly, stablecoins require promise and credibility, and they must be interchangeable with existing forms of money, in other words, they have to be anchored. This means stablecoins require users to have the same level of confidence as commercial bank money. Therefore,&nbsp;in onchain finance, commercial banks must take this role of trusted issuer of tokenized cash&nbsp;as they are the most suitable entities to issue stablecoins anchored by fiat money. They have already missed the ecommerce revolution to payment giants such as Stripe, Adyen, and Alipay, and have lost significant retail market share to neobanks. Will this happen again in the digital currency revolution?</p>
<p>Banks are at a critical juncture for catching up with this new wave. If they don’t act quickly, they will be seriously disrupted. With the emergence of crypto players such as Circle (which just reraised $440M), Paxos (which is now a bank), and our partner Monerium (a fiat-eMoney payment gateway for security token investors),&nbsp;the race is already on to become the tokenized money provider for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

   One of the great things about my work here at Ping is that I get to explore identity matters from many different perspectives. I’m fortunate enough to be at a company that champions identity by delivering identity solutions like MFA, access management and data governance that empower companies, governments and organizations to secure their employees, customers and citizens.

<p>-- The Garden of Forking Paths, Jorge Luis Borges</p>
<p>The pre-technological world was already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">networked</a>. No material object and no idea has ever stood alone—"no man is an island". Language itself is a network of associations shared between a group of people. The question of technology is: how do we bring our web of associations into the realm of computers? The legacy internet has focused on social networks almost exclusively—our mammalian brains readily took to this, we all love to <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/robin-hanson/">signal</a>. But before “social media” there was something called hypertext: a seemingly modest way to connect documents shared between computers.</p>
<p>A footnote in a book used to require a library, locating the referenced book, and finding the cited page (which might have footnotes itself)! Hypertext allows one to traverse a network quickly and easily with just mouse clicks, making information accessible to those without the time and resources to hunt down physical artifacts. Urbit’s “%graph-store” is not the same as hypertext but it does bear some familial resemblances. Fundamentally, %graph-store is a data structure that can accommodate disparate data types within a single edifice. It is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph databases</a> and recent implementations such as <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>. To understand this data structure it is worth diving into the origins of hypertext—the original linked network.</p>
<p>The story of hypertext begins at the end of WWII with an article in The Atlantic that proposed to extend the human mind via machine. Vannevar Bush had seen first-hand the explosion of electronics manufacturing and scientific knowledge, recognizing the great peril and opportunity of such a revolution. His <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">description</a> of the Memex presaged the technological world of today, envisioning a personal device that would allow the user to draw upon a vast library of information, and link documents together arbitrarily—what he called "associative indexing"—a deliberate recreation of how the mind connects thoughts.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw the first implementations of these ideas. Ted Nelson's <a href="https://archive.org/details/SelectedPapers1977/page/n15/mode/2up">writing</a> around Project Xanadu elaborated this linking between documents into what Nelson called hypertext. Nelson imagined "a text arranged in a graph structure", centered around a corpus arranged in nonlinear sequence, manipulable by author or audience. The concept was first demonstrated in 1968, at Douglas Engelbart's 'Mother of all Demos', where a vision of computers as a collaborative social environment was revealed to the world. "<a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/137/#7">The Journal</a>", presented alongside other revolutionary demos, exhibited collaboratively edited documents with hyperlinked connections. Any time-travellers in the audience would have immediately recognized the first webpage. From here, the idea of a linked network of documents would be developed through successive phases of computing, from the mainframe to the PC.</p>
<p>Experimentation with these ideas continued through the 1970s and 80s. A team directed by Andy Lippman at MIT extended the concept to threaded visual hypermedia with the Aspen Movie Map, a user-directed virtual tour of Aspen, Colorado. Hypertext and hypermedia gained a mass audience for the first time with HyperCard, a program that shipped with Mac computers. Users were able to collect or create '<a href="https://archive.org/details/hypercardstacks">stacks</a>' of interlinked cards; a personal body of text, art, and knowledge could be accrued and modified, or shared with others—though not yet with native networking capabilities. </p>
<p>With the World Wide Web, hypertext achieved escape velocity. Initially a one-man <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">project</a>, the world wide web was similar to Bush’s vision of the Memex—a way to share, index, and connect information between individuals and groups. The web succeeded by utilizing the physical infrastructure already available: PCs with graphical interfaces, DNS, and the internet. Critically, its method of transmitting and traversing texts was a standardized protocol, allowing a free body of information to assemble atop the new infrastructure by anyone willing to learn the tools. A new frontier was cleared and cultivated with open standards, but it would gradually face enclosure.</p>
<p>In the following decade, after the first wave of social networking sites had crested but before phones became the primary web clients, Twitter was launched. Originally an awkward bridge between SMS and the web, its design eventually coalesced around static identity, posts with chronological sorting, and interlinked post threads. These simple primitives spawned a vast corpus of information, a graph-of-graphs intertwined and overlapped, mapping an entire platonic world. Twitter is fundamentally constrained by its very nature: it is the walled garden of an advertising company. The financial incentives of the server operators demanded seizure of the commons and the replacement of standardized protocols with proprietary databases.</p>
<p>As the first networked services withered, a new critique was implicitly articulated in the construction of a <a href="https://moronlab.blogspot.com/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html">new kind of abstract machine</a>. Urbit learned from the past: tightly defined protocols, baked-in cryptography, and decentralization were key. If power over the network was determined by those who ran the servers, then we would run the servers ourselves. </p>
<p>Urbit is not fundamentally a hypertext system; it is a new kind of computer, designed to participate in a peer-to-peer network that rejects the client-server model. All Urbit software takes its networking model for granted, it is not an ad-hoc layering of mismatched abstractions. Fundamental design decisions determine the trajectory of the future.</p>
<p>Early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j">implementations</a> of graph databases and projects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> hit on the same core idea: linked data needs its own data structure. In 2020 Urbit OS adopted an application called %graph-store that made use of a new, native <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Gwfg442kV3cdfG7NnWPEf2TMa3uLUTAKkZD70ALZkE/edit">data structure</a> which would act as a database service for social applications. Chats, long-form text, and other types of data produced in the course of social computing now share the same tent, a single structure extensible to new types of content. Each item added to it is a node in a personal graph—a tree that grows branches as your computer communicates. These nodes can be linked arbitrarily to other graphs—Urbit's global immutable namespace grants both permanence and ownership and allows the graph’s branches to intertwine with others. Graphs can accommodate a variety of content, from simple text, to code and media yet to be conceived. You own your graph, and it is a record of your digital journey with others.</p>
<p>Personal hypertext graphs are leaving behind proprietary platforms and gaining independence. Graphs until now have been used as tools of surveillance and marketing, but they are being reclaimed and sewn back into the network, each bound to the cryptographic identity of an individual, permanent computer. Where the map of your life was once splintered across a thousand systems and held in the custody of strangers, it is now possessed only by you and shared only as you see fit. On Urbit, an infinite forest of digital lives can take root, nesting their boughs and stalks.</p>

<p>The team at Dock has taken another step towards providing secure, decentralized credential solutions by transitioning our testnet to a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) algorithm. We have kicked off this testing phase by successfully onboarding a number of candidate validators to the network, and will transition our current PoA mainnet to PoS as well once the security audit and testing activities are successfully completed, which is expected to happen by the end of June 2021.</p><p>What is Proof of Stake?</p><p>Proof of Stake (PoS) refers to an algorithm in which the validators are selected on a blockchain based on the amount of tokens they have staked. Validators are entities who are charged with the important tasks of producing blocks (hence processing blockchain transactions) and validating the blocks that are produced by other validators. </p><p>In PoS, validators are selected based on how many Dock tokens have been staked (locked up) in support of each candidate. Before validators are selected, candidate validators can stake their own tokens, and/or be backed by other token holders (“nominators”) who stake their tokens on the candidates’ behalf, and receive rewards if the candidates get selected and start producing blocks. Once the nomination period is over, the algorithm automatically selects the candidates with the largest stakes to become validators. The validators are incentivized to perform their duties properly, as the staked tokens can be slashed (taken away) in case of validator misbehavior.</p><p>This is distinct from the approach taken in Proof of Authority (PoA) - the algorithm currently used on the Dock mainnet. In PoA, validators are trustworthy entities selected by the Dock Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to overseeing the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS takes the validator selection decisions away from a single entity (Dock Association) and distributes it across a network of nominators and validators, hence creating more decentralized power and greater security in the network.</p><p>An Open Network for Everyone</p><p>The transition to PoS also comes with further democratization of the network governance structure. Some of the governance for our current PoA mainnet is centralized to the Governing Council, as the Council members are the only ones who can vote on any changes to the network proposed by the Council or token holders. Once the mainnet transitions to PoS, however, Dock token holders will be able to vote on proposed changes to the network (including election of Council members) by locking up their tokens. This change, along with the ability for token holders to earn passive income by staking on behalf of successful validators, enhances the utility of the Dock tokens.</p><p>Participation by token holders as validators, nominators, and voters is made possible by the fact that the Dock network is a permissionless blockchain. This is unlike many of our competitors who leverage permissioned blockchains, and hence limit the access to their blockchain governance to the select few. It is part of Dock’s vision to build a network that has maximum participation and widespread adoption, and we believe that this can only be achieved through decentralization, democracy, and transparency offered by a public blockchain that is open for all token holders, and free from the control of a single entity.</p><p>What’s Next?</p><p>We will be running the PoS testnet for the next few weeks to ensure that all network features work correctly. During this time we will also work with <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a>, a team of security experts currently performing an audit on the PoS network, to ensure that the network is safe and secure. Once these steps are completed we will transition our mainnet to PoS as well. More posts will follow to keep the community posted on our progress and further explain the changes introduced in PoS.</p>

<p>In its latest Digital Signature report, Gartner identified InfoCert as a “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, ranking it among the leaders of the Digital Signature industry.</p>



<p>The consulting firm has served as an authoritative IT advisor for over 40 years. Recently, it released its eSignature market guide, “Market Guide for Electronic Signature”, a true reference for IT and technology solutions professionals and companies. Gartner’s report put InfoCert among the top providers of Digital Signature solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://infocert.digital/analyst-reports/the-gartners-market-guide-for-electronic-signature/">Download the report published by Gartner, free of charge, to see how the digital signature market has evolved and the main global players like InfoCert have performed</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Gartner’s analysis is intended to guide professionals and businesses in assessing the solutions available on the market offered by providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services. Gartner’s report divides Digital Signature and Trust Service providers into three categories. It assigned InfoCert to the “Full Service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” category, which includes firms able to provide highly flexible technological and process services that offer all the technological characteristics required to meet the needs of large, medium and small companies, and even individual citizens.</p>



<p>The report is very useful because it classifies providers according to their specific capabilities and the levels of service they offer. It is an excellent source from which to analyse the latest B2B, B2C and B2E Use Cases. The report also provides a detailed view of the latest “Assurance” requirements (i.e., compliance with the standards established by European reference regulations) and technology requirements – aspects to which companies should pay special attention if they intend to embark on a path of Digital Transformation.</p>



<p>The “Full-service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” segment, in which InfoCert has been recognised as a sector leader, includes Providers that adapt best to their clients’ every need. In fact, according to Gartner, these providers are able to support simple, advanced and qualified electronic signatures, they can include industry-specific processes in their Enterprise solutions, and they are able to offer “out-of-the-box” solutions that can be integrated with third-party platforms and software such as document, HCMs, CRMs and CLMs. They also support API integration, identity verification and knowledge-base verification tools.</p>



<p>The report also analyses the other two supplier categories: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platform” and “Enterprise digital signature providers”.</p>



<p>The Gartner team of analysts that prepared the report highlights that clients must have access to services that match their needs, their geographical areas (often characterised by different regulatory requirements) and the use case they take as reference. This is why it is essential that clients be able to choose the vendor that best meets their functionality and compliance criteria at every stage of the process.</p>

<p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p> Summary Rémi Müller — Unsplash<p>Lawns are a desert in biodiversity, yet they are still the default landscaping approach across Canada. In the region of Montreal alone, lawns cover a surface 317 times the Mount-Royal Park. In the United States, it is the largest irrigated crop. Transforming the culture of perfectly manicured lawns therefore represents an enormous opportunity for collective climate&nbsp;action.</p><p>One of the most devastating causes and impacts of climate change is the global decline in biodiversity. Beyond the development of public policies, legislative strategies and financial incentives, it is essential to increase the capacity for on-the-ground action among individuals and communities through the development of ecological gardening on residential yards. This strategy aims to create spaces that can enrich and support biodiversity and, by doing so, transform our relationship with Nature right at home. This effort involves helping people see that the land they own is part of a larger ecosystem that requires nourishment and care; the land they own is a common responsibility.</p><p>To achieve this ambitious goal, there is a critical need to develop tools that bring together all the available knowledge about ecological gardening in order to inspire and help residents take action; to legitimize the adoption of this new residential landscape aesthetics of biodiversity by creating a community of interest and practice; and to document and measure the socio-environmental benefits of these local actions at different scales in order to sustain the movement and provide municipal authorities with necessary tools and information to incorporate biodiversity and climate mitigation into landscape planning decisions.</p>Pilot project, summer 2020 — Vivant &amp; Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins<p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> aims precisely at developing a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. It is about establishing the foundations of a movement that proposes a new form of cohabitation between Nature and us, one yard at a time, across urban, suburban and rural divides. <a href="http://www.nouveauxvoisins.org">www.nouveauxvoisins.org</a> is meant to be a platform for informing communities, transforming grass into habitats rich in biodiversity, and mapping and measuring the impacts of a movement already gaining momentum.</p><p>This blog summarizes the case studies and the paper prototype of a platform developed thanks to the generous contribution of <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">The McConnell Foundation</a> as part of the Transition Catalyst Fund, and was done in collaboration with Nouveaux voisins, Dark Matter Labs and S. Karthik Mukkavilli.</p> Context <p>While the impacts of climate change are increasingly disrupting our lives, the potential climate strategies that individuals and communities can deploy often remain abstract.</p><p>Beyond the actions themselves, the impacts of these practices on climate change at the local and global scales has also been&nbsp;unclear.</p><p>In this context, it is essential to support, document and measure the contribution of citizen actions in order to make them visible and encourage public authorities to support those initiatives.</p> How could a platform be designed to coordinate citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  What are the necessary functions and structures of a platform that coordinates citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  Case studies <p>The first step in this research was to identify certain rewilding initiatives that could inspire the development of the Nouveaux Voisins platform — and inform the relationship between citizen science and remote sensing&nbsp;tools.</p><p>These case studies were selected to represent different dimensions of the Nouveaux Voisins project (e.g., type of ecological actions, citizen involvement, use of technological tools,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Following an initial search for international initiatives, 8 initiatives were selected. Following an initial analysis, these initiatives were classified into 4 main categories.</p><p>These case studies have highlighted certain key&nbsp;lessons:</p> Opportunities <p>Economies of care: While access to native plants and ecological gardening services has been identified as a barrier, encouraging a demand for rewilding resources can stimulate a respective shift in supply. This coordinated move towards a local market for native plants and ecological landscaping services can be the beginning of an economy of care and conservation.</p><p>Facilitating civic contracts between citizens, non-humans, and governments: Assembling small-scale citizen observations of local habitat at the landscape level can help gauge the impact of biodiversity on ecological services and public health. This insight can drive government and community programs that circle back to the needs of non-human beings (prioritizing habitat corridors) and citizens (funding for gardening projects, equal access to&nbsp;nature).</p><p>Fostering agency: Clarifying the links between small-scale practices and larger scale impacts can help reframe individual action as collective effort.</p> Challenges <p>Integrating equity and access: Ensuring environmental surveying is accessible to various publics and providing multiple channels for citizens to voice their experiences to their governments and communities. This challenge may call for citizen science toolkits, direct communication pathways between citizens and municipalities, community-building channels, and public events that value the stewardship of citizens unable to take part in gardening at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Respecting local specificity while pursuing common goals: Building in flexible strategies that respond to various ecological regions, community contexts, and individual constraints while navigating commitments and lessons at larger&nbsp;scales.</p><p>Deployment at scale: Assembling collective habitat from small-scale transformations and decentralized citizen observations depends on the engagement of many. Nevertheless, these case studies have highlighted the possibility for surprising collaborations to pursue overlapping goals such as public health and education.</p> Based on these lessons, how can we build a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private yards&nbsp;? <p>From what we learned from the case studies and the Service Blueprint, we decided to organize the platform design around five categories of&nbsp;actions:</p><blockquote>Informing<br>Transforming<br>Mapping &amp; Measuring<br>Modeling &amp; Visualizing<br>Coordinating and Influencing</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins</a> is intended to be a platform that consolidates various features; it provides information, assists in the concrete transformation of grassed areas, maps and measures the impacts of collective actions, and helps visualize possible&nbsp;futures.</p><p>Moreover, all the data collected will help mobilize communities wishing to promote biodiversity by helping them coordinate and influence different actors in their environment.</p><p>See below some early sketches of what it could look&nbsp;like:</p> Next steps <p>Currently, Nouveaux voisins is continuing its on the ground pilot projects with Vivant, while <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> continues to develop a full suite of deep code innovations in support of nature based solutions with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">Trees as Infrastructure</a> and other initiatives.</p><p>For this specific platform project, we are currently defining the minimum viable prototype and are looking for collaborators and investors around the world to build a first version of the platform.</p><p>If you have any interest or recommendation, please reach&nbsp;out!</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>Emile Forest <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Jonathan Lapalme <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p> Credits <p>Jonathan Lapalme — Co-Project Manager and strategist<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Emile Forest — Co-Project Manager and researcher<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>S.

<p><a href="https://cccv.to/">CCCV,</a> product of Blocko XYZ, is an incubated project by the AERGO foundation, that anchors member data on the AERGO public&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Blocko XYZ has announced that from June 11th, anyone who has their <a href="https://cccv.to/cccv.info">COVID-19 vaccination status</a> verified through the social DID service CCCV, will be able to receive a real badge and sticker that displays their status to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Starting July, the Korean government is waiving the outdoor mask mandate for those who are vaccinated. Once this policy is implemented, it will be difficult to discern who has been truly vaccinated. As the government has only issued confirmation stickers for people who have been vaccinated above the age of 65, there needs to be a method of distinguishing vaccinated people in younger age&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Although apps for digital vaccination verification have been developed and other similar services are being announced, there is continuing controversy over the issues of security and standardization, and all responsibility is being placed on the individual. Self-employed business owners who manage small scale businesses, such as health and fitness managers, pilates teachers and golf coaches, are particularly in urgent need of a way to distinguish unvaccinated clients who falsely claim to be vaccinated for the sake of remaining unmasked.</p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, Blocko XYZ has announced that it will award free stickers and badges to people who verify their vaccination status by signing up to social verification service&nbsp;CCCV.</p><p>Users can request a badge by clicking on the digital vaccination badge under the CCCV verification tab and uploading evidence of their vaccination status. The requested badge will be granted within 24 hours after the authenticity of the uploaded document has been confirmed by an administrator. After this badge has been granted, users will be able to request concrete vaccination confirmation stickers and badges by simply filling out the required information.</p><p>The digital verification badge can be selected as a top badge and shared with others in the form of a link. Users will be able to easily announce their vaccination status to their family, acquaintances and clients, and influencers may in this way encourage many others to also get vaccinated.</p><p>Kim Kyung-hoon, CEO of Blocko XYZ, announced, “We would like to actively offer our support in finding a solution to the various social problems that may arise following the loosening of the mask policy in July. As a social content business card service, CCCV is used by many self-employed people, from models and coaches to freelancers in various fields, for the sake of verifying their qualifications. We hurried to create the vaccination badge in response to the demand of users like this who required vaccination confirmation due to the frequent interaction with clients. However, consumers have complained that online proof is simply not convenient to apply to offline businesses. Since the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination APIs are not open, services are only being provided manually. So, we decided to produce a real badge that could be used offline.”</p><p>Blocko XYZ’s CCCV, which has introduced the vaccination confirmation badge, was launched in November 2020. It is a new online content business card service that combines a badge system for expressing one’s academic background, assets and various abilities, with a link sharing service. Since its launch, within just 6 months, CCCV has gained over 2 million subscribers and offers a variety of blockchain-based services including DID and&nbsp;NFT.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-incubated-project-cccv-creates-member-vaccine-verification-f7acc1893feb">AERGO incubated project CCCV creates member vaccine verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In our third Kong and Okta tutorial, we’ll go through the introspection flow implementation. This series will show you how to implement service authentication and authorization for <a href="https://konghq.com/kong-konnect/">Kong Konnect</a> and Okta using the <a href="https://konghq.com/blog/openid-connect-api-gateway">OpenID Connect</a> (<a href="https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/">OIDC</a>) plugin. Parts 1, 2 and 4 cover:</p>

 Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p>In this example, I’m using the Konnect control plane to create new APIs and policies and publish them to my data plane running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

<p></p>

 Introspection Flow 

<p>The introspection flow is part of the token validation process. <a href="https://konghq.com/kong/">Kong Gateway</a> evaluates the injected token at the request processing time to see if it’s still valid to the upstream services. The evaluation hits a specific Okta endpoint, passing the received token. Based on the response provided by Okta, Kong Gateway accepts or rejects the request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For production environments, the OIDC plugin provides caching capabilities for the Okta responses. However, for this tutorial, I’m going to disable caching to better view the flow.</p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>Regarding Okta’s settings, I’m going to use the same client credentials application I created before. With the client ID and client secret. However, my OIDC plugin has to be set with specific parameters to implement introspection.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>In the Konnect ServiceHub, I have an IntrospectionRoute OIDC plugin enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The settings should be:</p>

 
   
    <p>Config.Auth Methods</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Issuer</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspect Jwt Tokens</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspection Endpoint with a specific endpoint provided by Okta to implement introspection</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

 Test the Introspection Flow With Insomnia 

<p>To better view the flow, I will use <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>, Kong’s API spec editor, to send requests to both Okta and Konnect. Below are my two requests.</p>

<p>The first one I’m sending to Okta, passing the expected parameters to get it authenticated and receive a token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the second one to consume the route, I’m using a specific Insomnia capability called Request Chaining. With this, I’ll be able to extract values from the response of a given request to build new ones. In my case, I’m pulling the access token from Okta’s response to make the other request and then send it to Konnect.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Next, let’s send a request to Okta to get our token. There it is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This time, we can see that Kong’s request is ready to be sent since we got Okta’s token injected inside of it.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>And here’s the Konnect response:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s important to note that Konnect is validating the token behind the scenes. Here’s one EC2 terminal where my data plane is running. Since I disabled introspection caching for the OIDC plugin, Konnect hits Okta for each request to validate the token.</p>

<p></p>

 Deactivate the Okta Application 

<p>Another way to see introspection is by deactivating the Okta application. All tokens related to it will be considered invalid and, as a consequence, will not be accepted by Kong again.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to Okta’s application and deactivate it. We should get a 401 error code from Kong.</p>

 1.Introduction <p>CRISPY the&nbsp;world!!</p><p>Here is CRISPY WHALES selected as the second company for the AERGO incubation fund program. We are making the online platform, Banana Clips. Thanks to AERGO’s&nbsp;support.</p><p>Banana Clips is a platform that provides users to buy and sell short clips. It allows users to convert trendy video clips into NFT, and protects their copyrights of video clips through the service with patent technologies. Users on Banana Clips can easily purchase a variety of short clips without any concern about copyrights, and can trade their video clips and NTF assets. Please look forward to Banana Clips, the new paradigm of the short clip platform.</p> 2.On going Banana&nbsp;Clips <p>CRISPY WHALES is accelerating its development with the support of AERGO to open the Banana Clips service in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Not long before this report was written, new members with more than 10 years of experience joined us one after another to build and share the future of Banana&nbsp;Clips.</p><p>Among them, designer Jiwon Huh, who is leading the brand and UI/UX of our service, is with over 10 years of experience in various companies as Chief Design Officer (CDO) and has tremendous potential.</p>Jiwon Huh<p>Jiwon Huh</p>  ex CDO of&nbsp;3billion  ex CDO of Casual&nbsp;Steps  ex Design Director of&nbsp;Klleon   2–1. Creative <p>CRISP WHALES is currently working hard to develop Banana Clips. In addition to the technical part, we are putting a lot of effort into developing designs that users can directly&nbsp;feel.</p><p>PANTONE LLC, a global company that leads colour trends in various industries, selected Ultimate Gray and Illuminating, a yellow scale, as its 2021 colours, which contain warm and positive messages for tired humanity suffering from COVID-19.</p><p>This is Banana Clips’s primary colour, which naturally has melted the 2021 trend into our service. However, unlike other companies that use a yellow colour, we applied Baby Green, which reminds us of unripe bananas, to further clarify Banana Clips’ identity, to express the process of short clips becoming a well-cooked banana.</p><p>Banana Yellow</p><p>This colour means pure and warm affection, sincere participation and&nbsp;‘ego’.</p><p>We chose Persona, who shares fun and funny things with friends and blends from morning to night and blends in&nbsp;harmony.</p><p>Baby Green</p><p>This colour represents young and cute likning the unique to fresh-looking baby&nbsp;bananas.</p><p>It contains the future of short clips that can be anything with colours that contains infinite possibilities.</p><p>Banana Clips’ colors according to basic behaviors</p> 2–2.Growth <p>CRISPY WHALES is making great efforts externally as well for Banana Clips will blow a new wave in the contents business.</p><p>We have signed an MOU for a cooperative relationship between Videocon (videocon.co.kr), which is a video contest platform provided by Slate Media, and Banana Clips. Starting with this, we are preparing cooperations with various content productions and distribution channels like MOU. In addition, we completed a survey of popular works in major NFT markets and short clips’ markets and found out what they want through the main target community of video producers and editors. Based on these data, we will fill the service with various trending videos until the&nbsp;launch.</p> 2–3. Tech <p>CRISPY WHALES is a technical partner of AERGO and is in the process of maintenance on some of the AERGO modules. There are many aspects that have not been reflected in the AERGO source repositories because technical reviews are still in progress, but new features that suit the trend will be provided one after another&nbsp;soon.</p><p>In addition, the technical reviews for the recently announced ARC2 has been completed, and actual use is planned for the service currently under development. This smart contract will be mainly used for video transactions through our service, but we are not forgetting to carry out various usability experiments, so we look forward to introducing other use cases&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Finally, all videos uploaded to our service will be uploaded to the AERGO network after various information is extracted by our internal system. Currently, we are developing a video extraction system and search platform, but a new smart contract for this will be announced and distributed in time for the service opening in&nbsp;July.</p> TODO <p>CRISPY WHALES is planning several marketing plans to acquire early users and various contents according to the Banana Clips launch plan to be introduced in July. In addition, we plan to take steps to launch a global service and a mobile app in business. With Banana Clips, you will always have access to videos featuring local cultures from around the world. In addition, we will actively utilize SNS channels mainly used by each generation to share information about video creating and editing and NFT, so that community participants can use the service naturally at the same time as Banana Clips is launched.</p><p>The development team of CRISPY WHALES is putting development plans for another smart contracts and layer 2 on the roadmap in addition to ARC2 to safely store NFT, trading information and copyrights data on the AERGO blockchain network. We hope to share with our community extremely thrilling news&nbsp;, such as a new business model to increase the use of AERGO tokens in trading, but we ask for your understanding that we are still cautious about revealing many&nbsp;things.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES is doing its best to meet the AERGO community as soon as possible. In the next month or so, Banana Clips will be coming to you. Thanks to everyone who waited, and we hope that you will continue to keep in watching with a little more interest.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/crispy-the-world-9c6cb4fde3e5">CRISPY the world!!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

But what happens when that collaboration moves from a gallery or theatre on to the blockchain?</p><p>The answer is, well, just about anything.</p><p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is pioneering a new kind of digital art crafted as a collection of live, editable “Layers”. Artists can maintain control of those Layers, sell ownership of individual Layers to collectors, or program the Layers to adapt programmatically based on anything from time of day to fluctuating stock market prices. What results is a fascinating realm of art that morphs and evolves, reacting to its community and the world at&nbsp;large.</p><p>I sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/breadbreaker22">Lisa Liang</a>, Co-founder of Async Art, to learn more about how <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> helps make it all possible.</p><a href="https://async.art/art/master/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-1494">Desert Clockwork</a>, Cyrus James Khan, 4-state autonomous NFT,&nbsp;2021 Appealing to a wider&nbsp;audience <p>When Async launched, new users were required to log in using a crypto wallet. This seemed reasonable for a platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, but user onboarding quickly became a bottleneck for the company’s growth. As Async began branching out beyond the crypto art community, it was clear that using crypto wallets like MetaMask was a serious challenge for many&nbsp;artists.</p><blockquote>“Before Magic, only a very small percentage of new artists actually ended up minting a&nbsp;piece.”</blockquote><p>According to Lisa, “A lot of traditional artists aren’t even on Twitter. The concept of using MetaMask or buying ETH — these are huge user onboarding hurdles. Magic makes it a lot&nbsp;easier.”</p><p>Like any NFT platform that relies on wallets, the Async team regularly spent hours walking new artists and potential buyers through the wallet setup process. This meant that the startup production team had less time to spend on developing important new features, and only a certain percentage of artists ultimately minted and listed artwork. Something had to&nbsp;change.</p> Onboarding built for&nbsp;everyone <p>To appeal to a wider audience, the Async team knew they needed an onboarding flow that didn’t rely solely on a wallet integration. On the flip side, they had an existing user base of NFT collectors who were passionate about crypto and decentralization. Magic provided Async with the intuitive user experience they needed while maintaining the security and integrity that are table stakes for a Web3 application.</p><blockquote>“Having Magic there eliminates 4 or 5 steps from our onboarding funnel.”</blockquote><p>Async’s top priority is enabling groundbreaking new forms of art, not necessarily exposing users to the tech stack that makes it possible. Lisa said it best: “Our vision for Async Art is to make this accessible for everyone. This is not just about NFTs, this is about utilizing digital technology to create artwork that could never have existed&nbsp;before.”</p><p>With Magic, new users simply enter their email address, click a magic link, and then dive right into the bold new world of programmable art. This streamlined onboarding flow translated to a smoother, faster creation process for artists. After implementing Magic links along with other additional features, Async more than doubled the amount of artworks created on their platform.</p> Focusing on fundamentals <p>Considering Async has invented an entirely new medium of art, newcomers already have quite a bit to wrap their heads around. Magic authentication means login is one less thing for new users to worry&nbsp;about.</p>Almost 40% of Async’s new users are now onboarded with&nbsp;Magic<p>The Async team has seen a growing number of new users opt for passwordless login since implementing Magic just a few months ago. As of May 2021, about 39% of all new users opt for magic link login instead of using a wallet. For Lisa and the rest of the team, this has been immediate validation that choosing Magic has had a positive impact on Async’s&nbsp;growth.</p><blockquote>“Magic makes everyone’s lives&nbsp;easier.”</blockquote><p>In addition to providing a smoother, more accessible onboarding experience for users, Magic has helped the Async team get back valuable time. Lisa told me login-related support requests are now practically nonexistent. That means the Async team can stop worrying about wallet creation and instead focus on trailblazing the future of digital art with new offerings like <a href="https://async.art/music">Async&nbsp;Music</a>.</p><p>Whatever comes next, I can honestly say I’m thrilled to see where the journey takes&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/async-art-is-bringing-nfts-to-life-with-a-little-help-from-magic-ef558e7c1184">Async Art is bringing NFTs to life with a little help from Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Writing about legal topics is always a challenge. I am not a lawyer, but as an analyst and advisor, however, I almost inevitably encounter the implications of laws and current case law. Thus, this text describes only a personal assessment and is not intended to be, and should not be used as, legal advice (and in any case KuppingerCole Analysts do not provide legal advice). At the end of the day, any action should be clarified with colleagues properly qualified to do so, including the legal team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_small" title="ruling of the European Court of Justice">ruling of the European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ), which has gained some notoriety under the name "Schrems II", has caused great uncertainty among many organizations. The fact that the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/ccpa-gdpr-as-a-catalyst-for-improving-data-protection-outside-the-eu" title="data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America">data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America</a>, is to be considered non-compliant with the requirements of the European Union and the General Data Protection Regulation has had a direct significant impact on an assessment of the processing of personal data abroad, especially of course in the USA. The mechanism previously known as "Privacy Shield" was rendered void overnight. This, of course, particularly impacts the use of cloud services, which had grown significantly over the past year and a half, not least due to the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/pepp-pt-bridging-the-gap-between-covid-19-pandemic-control-and-privacy-by-design" title="pandemic-induced migration to digital services">pandemic-induced migration to digital services</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kerl_kinast" title="state of limbo">state of limbo</a> and lack of legal certainty required a comprehensive solution. This is now available in the form of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/1_en_act_part1_v5.pdf" title="final version">final version</a> of the "standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries" (published on June 4, 2021). This document, which was published by the European Commission, and the measures it describes are intended to make it possible to continue transferring personal data to countries outside of the EU and to process it there.</p>
 More than just paper – tangible supplementary measures are needed. 
<p>However, merely amending the contractual basis is not enough: tangible technical and organizational measures that ensure the minimization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization#New_Definition_for_Pseudonymization_Under_GDPR" title="pseudonymization">pseudonymization</a> (as defined by the GDPR) and encryption of transferred data must be developed, and implemented precisely as described. This not only puts the onus on the providers of such Internet services (and their supply chain, end-to-end) to support these measures, but also forces the users of cloud services, for example, to practice data hygiene and reduce the volume of data, which can only be beneficial in terms of improved data protection. The SCCs (Standard contractual clauses) will only be considered effective providing these measures are in place.</p>
<p></p>
 Call for action 
<p>Considering this development as a layman in legal matters this document and the updated SCCs represent an important first step in my opinion. Even if the actual problem (the root cause) namely the possibility of American authorities viewing personal data on the systems of American providers, is not solved. Consideration must now be given to each individual case where personal data is transferred outside of the EU to select and fully implement the correct tools for encryption, pseudonymization and minimization of data at rest, in transit and during processing. While this will involve considerable effort, it is certainly more favorable when compared to the previous legal uncertainty.</p>
<p>This is where we as analysts and advisors come into play. Concepts, technologies, and products that can help implement appropriate technical and organizational measures are evolving quickly. Information Protection and Secure Information Sharing will become increasingly important. These include, for example, Azure Information Protection or advanced tools that enable the transparent encryption and use of critical information, including personal data. Sensitive data discovery, data cataloging and encryption concepts will play a significant role in light of this development. This holds true for structured data and unstructured data alike. Data governance will become a key area to exercise appropriate control over data of varying sensitivity. Data catalogs and data management will facilitate transparency regarding the nature, location and flow of data.</p>
<p>Finally, the requirement for organizational and technical measures to protect transferred data will also have a significant impact on the spread and use of more sophisticated, emerging technologies for encrypting data during use. For example, providers of technologies for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/homomorphic_encryption" title="homomorphic encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> can make a substantial contribution to the definition and implementation of appropriate measures.</p>

<p>Pikkle is the first blockchain-based voting and global viewer participation service application built on the AERGO platform. Without understanding blockchain technology, users can access voting as well as attendance results in real-time. Pikkle will be used by the <a href="http://www.kba.or.kr/">Korean Broadcasters Association </a>and developed by <a href="https://www.blocko.io/">Blocko</a>, AERGO’s technology partner.</p><p>What problems is Pikkle trying to resolve with the traditional voting&nbsp;system?</p><p>1. Cost inefficiency</p>  In general, the voting process is complicated and incurs substantial cost in voter targeting, identity verification, ballot count, opening process tables as well as checklists  <p>2. Trust in voting&nbsp;result</p>  There has been trust issues with the electoral system for a long time. Many people do not trust the result of votes — such as resident votes, broadcast program votes and legislative elections  There is a prevailing believe that views and poll results collected via social network services can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platform provider’s own&nbsp;interest  <p>Main Features:</p><p>Voting:</p><p>With the Korean Broadcasters Associations, Pikkle aims to provide a reliable voting service for all users. Pikkle collects users’ views and help their decision-making process through an app service rather than the traditional text voting or spam-type cold calls. ‘Pikkle’ will solve the existing voting problems by storing key data of the voting process (identification of voters, validation of voting, voting results etc.) using blockchain technology.</p><p>Many polls and surveys are still conducted by classic methods such as texting or phone calls despite the current rate of mobile phone penetration. Pikkle encourages users to simply scan a QR code to participate in festivals and voting actions. In this manner, we believe it can be a more convenient and fun&nbsp;service.</p><p>This method has been attempted by many big tech platforms. However, due to public interest and platform dependency issues, it was previously difficult to be socially accepted. Using blockchain technology, Pikkle aims to prevent platforms or stakeholders from interfering in decision-making processes and to promote two way communication by introducing a fair voting system in many content based industries.</p><p>Event Participation:</p><p>In addition to participating in various cultural and artistic events, festivals and broadcasting programs, you can use Pikkle in ‘Metaverse’ events. Pikkle diversifies the participation experience by issuing NFT digital tickets built on the blockchain.</p><p>Mobile tickets with blockchain NFTs (Non-Fungible Token) applied can be used to prove the ownership in the offline world. It even provides features such as joining a queue and tickets for concerts in the virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pikkle’s vision and&nbsp;roadmap:</p><p>2021</p>  Q2: Develop Pikkle Service ver&nbsp;1.0  Q3: Release Pikkle Service ver 1.0 and integrate the system with broadcasting companies and festivals  Q4: Develop Pikkle Service ver 2.0 — Payment&nbsp;system  <p>2022</p>  Q1: Develop Pikkle Service ver2.0 — issuing tickets on<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/ARC2NFT"> ARC2 NFT </a>(AERGO Non Fungible Token Contract)  Q2: Develop and release Pikkle service ver 2.0 — Integrate the system with Metaverse  <p>Origins of&nbsp;Pikkle</p><p>Pikkle originates from the words ‘Pick’ and ‘People’.</p><p>Pikkle’s logo was designed using a round shape feature to emphasize friendliness for every user. Purple is the primary color of Pikkle as the color reflects credibility and creativity.</p><p>Pikkle’s symbol was inspired by ‘P’ from the word ‘Pikkle’ and the shape of a cell phone camera lens that is used to scan QR&nbsp;codes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/pikkle-x-aergo-7d1b3421e1ff">Pikkle x AERGO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p> Viele Unternehmen nutzen heute mehrere Cloud-Dienste, wobei ihre Enduser regelmäßig Dutzende oder sogar Hunderte verschiedener SaaS-Anwendungen verwenden. Diese große Cloud-Migration hat erfolgreich eine Ausweitung des mobilen Arbeitens ermöglicht und beschleunigt Initiativen zur digitalen Transformation. Eine steigende Anzahl an Cloud-Diensten bedeutet allerdings ebenso einen Anstieg an IT-Sicherheitsherausforderungen. Neben den grundlegenden Cloud-Sicherheitsaspekten entsteht eine zusätzliche Komplexität sowie Interoperabilitätsprobleme, die sich aus siloartigen Identity Stores, nativen Toolsets und einem Konflikt aufgrund der geteilten Verantwortlichkeiten der Cloud-Anbieter ergeben. All das schafft eine erweiterte Angriffsfläche und muss von Unternehmen adressiert werden.</p>
<p>Die Identity Challenge ist die wichtigste Sicherheitsherausforderung die es für Unternehmen zu lösen gilt und wird primär durch die Standardisierung des Managements und der Sicherheitskontrollen im gesamten IT-Ökosystem bewältigt. Nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil und erfahren Sie mehr über:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Die wichtigsten Cloud-Sicherheitsrisiken&nbsp; 
 Wo native Toolsets Lücken in der Sicherheit hinterlassen, die Sie adressieren müssen&nbsp; 
 Wie Sie mit Privileged Access Management (PAM) Best Practices für Cloud-Sicherheit implementieren, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit und das Ausmaß von Sicherheitsverletzungen in der Cloud deutlich zu verringern

   Zusammenarbeit und neue Arbeitsformen ermöglichen, IT-Modernisierung unterstützen 
<p>IAM (Identity und Access Management) ist ein Kernelement jeder Strategie im Bereich der Cybersicherheit. Kontext- und risikobasierte Zugriffssteuerung und adaptive Authentifizierung sind Kernelemente jeder funktionierenden Sicherheitsstrategie. Gerade für Zero Trust mit seinem Grundsatz „Nicht vertrauen – überprüfen!“ ist ein gutes, modernes IAM essentiell, um eben diese Überprüfung durchführen und Zugriffe in Abhängigkeit vom Risiko steuern zu können.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger wird in seinem Vortrag auf die Bedeutung von Zero Trust-Strategien ebenso wie für SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) eingehen, aber auch für die Möglichkeiten, IT insgesamt zu modernisieren. Dabei wird er aufzeigen, wie ein modernes IAM die heutigen Anforderungen unterstützen kann und dabei hilft, eine IT zu schaffen, in der Zusammenarbeitsmodelle mit Partnern und Kunden ebenso wie neue Arbeitsformen für Mitarbeiter flexibel und sicher unterstützt werden und die bereit für alle Varianten von Deployment-Modellen ist.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kuppinger-zero-trust-sase-iam"></a>

 The Day the Veriscope Secretariat Responded to the Financial Action Task Force&nbsp;(FATF) <p>Veriscope and Shyft Network’s response to FATF Draft Guidance on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers</p><p>Last March, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued a<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html#:~:text=asset%20service%20providers-,Public%20consultation%20on%20FATF%20draft%20guidance%20on%20a%20risk%2Dbased,and%20virtual%20asset%20service%20providers&amp;text=In%20July%202020%2C%20the%20FATF,G20%20on%20so%2Dcalled%20stablecoins."> Public consultation</a> on FATF draft guidance on a risk-based approach to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. Their high-level objective is simple: to update its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/RBA-VA-VASPs.pdf"> Guidance on the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)</a>.</p><p>As long-time players in the crypto industry, the decision to participate in the consultation was an easy one. The Guidance is an extremely important piece of international policy for our industry; it sets the pace for all member states of FATF on how to treat and deal with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing issues when it comes to cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><blockquote>… we support the FATF’s overarching objectives of updating its pre-existing Guidance in a manner that maintains a level playing field for VASPs, minimizes opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and preserves the intended technological neutrality of the FATF Standards. However, in our view, further revisions are required to ensure that the updated guidance achieves these objectives without going beyond the requirements of the FATF Standards or introducing elements that will have undesirable or intended consequences.</blockquote> Intro <p>The consultation presents five different areas of focus for participants to comment. For the purposes of keeping this post simple, we will only summarize the responses.</p><p>In general terms, the Veriscope Secretariat sees several omissions or shortcomings in the proposed guidance. Should these remain in the updated guidance and become policy, the development, adoption and improvement of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as a nascent industry will be at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If you want to read the complete document, please click on the following link:<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/public-consultation#public-consultation-on-fatf-draft-guidance--a-risk-based-approach-to-virtual-assets-and-virtual-asset-service-providers"> Response by the VERISCOPE Secretariat &amp; Shyft&nbsp;Network</a>.</p> The Response  I. Definition of VASP and VASP activities subject to the FATF Standards <p>The revised Guidance expansive approach to the definition of VASP appears to be inconsistent and its scope could potentially lead regulators to consider, for example, key signers for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s), as VASPs, regardless of their ability, or lack thereof, to participate in the decision making process and custodial obligations.</p><blockquote>We see unintended consequences from this that could move to eliminate key signers from these processes which can further lead to security vulnerabilities at the smart contract level (putting innocent users of these systems at risk), and could introduce innovative obfuscation techniques that further eliminate governance methods that play important roles in transparency and functionality.</blockquote><p>Here’s an example of how this approach can create unnecessary complexity or, worse, roadblocks in the development of solutions for better financial inclusion: Key signing entities in community-run asset pools in DeFi protocols do not have the ability to verify the destination of fund transmissions, and, at times, these signing parties are involved in the blind transmission of assets through autonomous routes. We proposed a review of the definition of control and the role of key signers entirely in the process of transmission.</p><p>In addition, the expanded guidance touches on the role of developers, and the distinction between development companies in contrast to open source software developers (a very common occurrence in our space), is unclear to the point of being&nbsp;blurred.</p><blockquote>It should be noted that in the event this was to be true, even public protocols that are being designed today to solve FATF guidance and travel rule requirements would therefore be VASPs. This would lead to a massive slow down in current timelines and the ability for the industry to utilize smart contract native systems in enabling effective methods of risk mitigation for regulatory purposes.</blockquote><p>Our recommendation to the FATF is to redraft the areas that describe “developers” making a clear distinction between development companies and individuals paid on a fee basis. The blockchain space has grown, in many ways, thanks to open-source software and independent contractors; it’s imperative that we defend and promote this practice.</p> II. Mitigation of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks relating to peer-to-peer transactions <p>We think that the measures and controls in the draft guidance will not mitigate the ML/TF risks that might emerge when P2P transactions gain widespread acceptance. Most of the proposed measures will place additional obligations on VASPs and other obligated entities, resulting in minimal impact of mitigating the ML/TF risks of P2P transactions of unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We support the recommendation that countries would consider ways of mitigating ML/TF P2P transaction risks through blockchain analytics. We encourage the FATF to further explore how blockchain analytics and other innovative technological solutions can provide greater visibility over P2P transactions between unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> III. Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>We believe that further clarity is needed around the FATF’s expectations of VASPs when transacting with unhosted wallets since the recent drafting suggests that the transactions should be treated as higher risk without providing a supporting rationale.</p><p>Based on our reliance on VASPs and their role as the verifying entities of the largest amount of KYC’s users in the space, we proposed that the FATF allow time for travel rule solutions to work directly on unhosted wallet discovery as well as VASP discovery before determining risk profiles and mitigation methods that may inaccurately assume the risk and hinder&nbsp;growth.</p> IV. FATF and Stablecoins <p>The revised FATF Guidance is generally helpful in confirming the applicability of VASP regulations to stablecoin issuers. However, when it comes to the specific details of comparing stablecoin issuers to other VASPs, particularly for the purpose of conducting an AML/CFT risk assessment, there are several aspects of the Guidance that appear to reflect a misunderstanding of how centrally administered stablecoins function. We believe that conducting an accurate risk assessment of stablecoins is contingent upon having a thorough understanding of how these products currently function, in practice.</p><p>Stablecoins have become an essential element in the crypto industry, with <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/90439/on-chain-stablecoin-volume-december">billions of $USD in volume being transacted through them</a>. The FATF’s understanding of the key features of stablecoins is somewhat limited to them being a volatility avoidance instrument. We expanded on this definition and discussed that their true nature is speed, reliability and low cost for cross-border transactions. Their usability is not limited to issues related to virtual assets, rather, to limitations of cross-border banking.</p><p>Our position, in general terms, is that the risks of stablecoins and their issuers are analogous to the risks of VAs and other VASPs and that prior guidance was already sufficient to mitigate these potential risks. New recommendations by the FATF necessitate an updated risk assessment of this&nbsp;sector.</p> V. Effective implementation of FATF Standards <p>One important element that we identified and discussed was the licensing or registration of VASPs in the applicable jurisdiction. We view this, and the suggestion that local authorities impose conditions on VASPs seeking a license to be able to be supervised as an unfair adaptation of prudential and market conduct requirements for traditional financial institutions unfit for purpose in an AML/CFT context for the VASP&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications.</p><p>Rather than imposing requirements, we recommended that the FATF follows a similar path as it did with money or value transfer services (MVTS), which, like VASPs, may have no physical presence in the country where a transaction is sent or received. In its risk-based approach guidance for MVTS, the FATF encourages competent authorities in the host and home jurisdictions to liaise as appropriate to ensure any ML/TF concerns are adequately addressed. We believe that this would be a more appropriate approach in the VASP context that would ensure a more level playing field among AML/CFT-obliged entities and would reinforce the FATF’s principles of information-sharing and cooperation amongst VASP supervisors.</p><p>We also commented on the risk assessment requirement the FATF seeks to implement. To this point, we asserted that the currently available framework is insufficient in helping the industry identify, assess and understand their ML/TF risks. The crypto industry is rapidly evolving and, unlike the traditional financial sector, hasn’t developed effective controls over decades of experience and operations. That said, industry stakeholders are already initiating a risk assessment exercise and welcome the FATF to an open dialogue.</p> Wrapping up <p>As it pertains to the approach to effective regulation, we believe that the FATF will likely need a fundamentally different approach to regulation.</p><p>When it comes to decentralized systems and smart contracts that do not, and cannot, centralize the data collection and compliance processes that traditional intermediaries hold, we need to look at new approaches to compliance and KYC verification. This is especially true for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Systems are being built today that allow us to decentralize or passport the identities and KYC data sets of users across smart contracts and noncustodial wallets. We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications. These systems can allow us to have source nexus points for user validation and onboarding, but still allow those users (represented by the public addresses they use today to move assets) to utilize smart contract applications while leveraging reliance on the source data stores and validating onboarding entities. This will be the future of how compliant opt-in systems work across this ecosystem and can solve many of the largest risks and threats that are inherent from an AML/CFT perspective.</p><blockquote>While this infrastructure is currently being developed in systems like Shyft Network among others, we believe that users should not be required to take on compliance or sanctions obligations directly. These systems, when they are solely in the non-custodial realm, are extensions of bearer instruments like cash, and effective regulation needs to focus its efforts on the on-ramps and off-ramps (like that of the traditional financial system) without requiring innocent civilians to take on compliance obligations and the responsibility of sanctions requirements.</blockquote><p>Decentralized systems should be looked at largely as public utilities and enhancements to the utilization of digital bearer instruments that are designed to invoke user freedom and the betterment of individual choice, while still ensuring law enforcement has the ability to effectively address illicit activity. Our ability to ensure these networks do not unintentionally transition to deeper levels of obfuscation is critical in this current time to ensure we can maintain visibility and transparency into how these networks publicly function. Regulations can help maintain this visibility in collaboration with this technology, or hinder it if we do not act collaboratively and cautiously to nurture its benefits.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The global digital&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;spend&nbsp;is&nbsp;set to hit nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://au.oberlo.com/blog/digital-marketing-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20digital%20ad%20spend,on%20by%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.">USD&nbsp;390&nbsp;billion&nbsp;in 2021</a>. But in&nbsp;yet&nbsp;another&nbsp;blow&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;big tech&nbsp;companies reaping the rewards,&nbsp;a bipartisan group of&nbsp;US senators has raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/senators-raise-security-concerns-over-selling-personal-data-a-16351">national security concerns&nbsp;</a>over&nbsp;the&nbsp;automated process that makes personalized&nbsp;ads possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, their concerns relate to what’s known as&nbsp;“real time bidding”, the split-second automated&nbsp;auction&nbsp;process used to&nbsp;rapidly place&nbsp;personalized ads&nbsp;on&nbsp;web&nbsp;pages, and&nbsp;the “bid stream data”, comprising a users’ personal data, that&nbsp;is&nbsp;used in the bidding process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;three&nbsp;important&nbsp;things to understand here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp;  



  How real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;  



  The privacy issues that potentially risk the safety of US citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>On April 1, 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-bipartisan-senators-question-online-ad-exchanges-on-sharing-of-americans-data-with-foreign-companies">six&nbsp;US&nbsp;senators</a>&nbsp;sent a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/040121%20Wyden%20led%20Bidstream%20Letter%20to%20ATT.pdf">letter&nbsp;</a>to AT&amp;T, Index Exchange, Google, Magnite, OpenX, PubMatic, Twitter and Verizon&nbsp;demanding&nbsp;to&nbsp;know,&nbsp;by May 4, 2021,&nbsp;every “foreign-headquartered or foreign-majority owned company” to whom&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies&nbsp;had given&nbsp;the&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data&nbsp;of&nbsp;US users&nbsp;over the pastthree&nbsp;years. In addition, they want to know:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The specific data about users, their devices and the websites and apps they’re using that&nbsp;these companies are sharing&nbsp;with&nbsp;ad&nbsp;auction&nbsp;participants&nbsp;  Every&nbsp;foreign and domestic company that has received bid stream data in the past three years&nbsp;thatisn’t&nbsp;contractually&nbsp;prohibited&nbsp;from using&nbsp;that&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;any&nbsp;way&nbsp;unrelated&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bid&nbsp;process&nbsp;  Any contractual restrictions in place prohibiting the sharing, sale, or secondary use of bid stream&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data and&nbsp;all&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;audit efforts&nbsp;and results.&nbsp;  



<p>The&nbsp;senators&nbsp;fear&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;easy access to&nbsp;bid stream data during&nbsp;the&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;process allows&nbsp;foreign governments to&nbsp;profile&nbsp;US citizens.&nbsp;To wrap your head around that risk, it’s important to understand&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;and the significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues&nbsp;that result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 How&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">Real time bidding</a>&nbsp;is an exchange&nbsp;that happens in the&nbsp;milliseconds&nbsp;before a web page loads.&nbsp;It&nbsp;automates&nbsp;the process of buying and selling ad space online&nbsp;and makes personalized ads possible.&nbsp;It’s often&nbsp;difficult for non-tech people to believe this&nbsp;data exchange and ad placement&nbsp;can&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;milliseconds of real time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;like an auction in that advertisers bid on&nbsp;available space on web pages and&nbsp;the space typically goes to&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest bidder.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">four-part process</a>:&nbsp;</p>



  Once a user clicks on a link to open a web site, the site’s publisher sends the dimensions of its available ad space to what’s known as a supply side platform (SSP), a technology platform (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/">WebFX</a>) that automates the process of web&nbsp;publishers&nbsp;selling their ad space to advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The SSP then analyzes the user’s cookies to gather as much data as possible about the user. This is known as bid stream data&nbsp;and&nbsp;typically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adpushup.com/blog/what-is-bidstream-%20data/#:~:text=All%20the%20data%20passed%20with,Information)%20is%20exc%20hanged%20using%20bidstream">includes</a>&nbsp;URL, device type, model, screen size, CPU,&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;and connection, web browsing activity and interests, IP address and ZIP code location, as well as age and gender.&nbsp;This data determines the most relevant ad for the user.&nbsp;  



  Next, a demand side platform (e.g. Google Ad Manager) uses the bid stream data&nbsp;from the SSP&nbsp;to assign a dollar value to the user’s impression (display of the ad on the user’s screen)&nbsp;and place&nbsp;bids from&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;on the ad space.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Finally, the SSP receives the bids and awards the ad space to the highest&nbsp;bidder.&nbsp;The web page then loads with the ad&nbsp;in the contested slot.&nbsp;The publisher has sold their ad&nbsp;for profit, the advertiser has&nbsp;got its&nbsp;product in front of its highly targeted audience,&nbsp;and the user is none the wiser&nbsp;that&nbsp;their&nbsp;profiledata was&nbsp;up for grabs&nbsp;only moments before.&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 5&nbsp;significant privacy issues&nbsp;of&nbsp;the process &nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>You guessed it: the process is fraught with significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues:&nbsp;</p>



  Hundreds of companies can participate in the real time bidding process. Every auction participant gets access to the bid stream data and they don’t even have to bid.&nbsp;  



  Most anyone can participate in the auction: barriers to entry are low.&nbsp;And while there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">penalties</a>&nbsp;for misusing bid stream data, parsing the data is still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">highly valuable</a>&nbsp;to participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Bid stream data&nbsp;can be harvested&nbsp;even&nbsp;without third party cookies&nbsp;so recent efforts by&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>&nbsp;to ban third party cookies do nothing to&nbsp;mitigate the privacy risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The bid stream data is usually&nbsp;anonymized&nbsp;but, as we’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/re-identification-of-anonymous-data-is-scarily-simple/">recently&nbsp;covered</a>,&nbsp;it’s relatively easy to match a user to their information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Data brokers readily package the bid stream data&nbsp;(particularly valuable location data)&nbsp;and&nbsp;sell it&nbsp;to other companies&nbsp;and&nbsp;even&nbsp;governments&nbsp;with little oversight — the key point of&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators’ concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Sen. Ron&nbsp;Wyden,&nbsp;D-Ore.,&nbsp;who&nbsp;led&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in&nbsp;writing to the eight ad exchange firms,&nbsp;says: “Few Americans realize that some auction participants are siphoning off and&nbsp;storing&nbsp;‘bid stream data’&nbsp;to compile exhaustive dossiers about them. In turn,&nbsp;these dossiers are being openly sold to anyone with a credit card, including&nbsp;to hedge&nbsp;funds, political campaigns and even to governments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concern of course is that the information ends up with foreign governments who could create digital profiles of US citizens.&nbsp;“This information would be a goldmine for foreign intelligence services&nbsp;that could&nbsp;exploit it to inform and supercharge hacking, blackmail and&nbsp;influence&nbsp;campaigns,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see which companies reply, what they say, and what happens next. It’s definitely yet another reason to put a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">US national privacy law</a>&nbsp;in place&nbsp;and to&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">proactively protect</a>&nbsp;your users’ personal data while we wait.&nbsp;</p>

			 The growing interest in security tokens 
<p>Capital markets are advancing into a digital-first world and financial institutions have never been so enthusiastic about investing in digital assets. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?">According to a study</a> conducted by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Plutoneo, and Tangany, the European security token market is expected to grow approximately 81% annually over the next five years, and is projected to reach €918 billion by 2026. Its market volume could surpass the cryptocurrency industry in the next five years.</p>
 Identifying wallet owners is a regulatory obligation 
<p>Security tokens are becoming popular and are likely to become a major investment option in the future as the interest keeps growing. However, the change in market infrastructure does not change the fact that securities need to comply with financial regulations. In the tokenization world, investors hold their assets in blockchain wallet(s). Therefore, it is critical for issuers to be able to identify who the wallet owner is and whether this owner is eligible to own the security. Blockchain identities solve this legal problem for issuers. Digital identities not only allow issuers to address compliance issues, but also enable protection for investors through recovery processes.</p>
 Digital identities enable the recovery of security tokens 
<p>If a cryptocurrency holder loses their private key or wallet access credentials for their self-custody wallet, the assets (Bitcoin etc.) are lost and cannot be recovered as most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and controlled by algorithms. Unlike cryptocurrencies, security tokens are controlled by issuers who are liable to their investors by law. As each investor is identified on the blockchain by his/her self-sovereign digital identity instead of the wallet, issuers can recover security tokens to the investor’s new wallet after confirming his/her identity. The traceability of ownership is recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX open source protocol</a> are able to trigger a recovery function present by default in the suite of smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the issuer (or its agent). 
 Verify the digital identity – <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>: The issuer (or its agent) verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the issuer triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. 
 
<p>Therefore, issuers and securities custodians can fulfil their securities restitution obligations, whilst investors can participate in tokenized investment opportunities with greater confidence.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Custodial wallets vs self-custody wallets 
<p>As security tokens are recoverable, investors can choose to use custodial wallets or self-custody ones to store their security tokens with low risk. A self-custody wallet, such as Metamask, allows investors to self-custody their assets by managing the private keys themselves. However, in the case of private key loss, the issuer may charge a recovery operation fee.</p>
<p>While self-custody may seem like a good option, it can be difficult for the layperson due to the technical knowledge required.&nbsp; Some investors may want another regulated party to hold the asset custody accountable, such as institutions. A custodial wallet is a more suitable option for them because regulated entities like banks, issuers or marketplace operators will then keep their private keys. The cost of a custodial wallet will obviously be more expensive, and is sometimes based on assets under management (AuM).</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Regardless of the type of wallet, digital identities lie at the heart of security tokens custody for investors, and secure the assets against loss and theft. As such, wallets are less important to tokenized securities holders than to cryptocurrency holders. With security tokens, the digital identities of investors double up as their blockchain account, with one or several wallets, where assets are controlled and managed, while their wallets are more like blockchain browsers where assets are viewed and where they confirm actions. Digital identity paves the way for the new era of asset custody.</p>

Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals.

It follows and operationalizes the Interoperability Blueprint (the “Blueprint”) of the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC), an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID certificates. LFPH has co-led the process drafting the Blueprint, which was released on Monday for a period of public&nbsp;review.</blockquote><p>So what does this all&nbsp;mean?</p><p>Between Cardea’s verifiable credentials platform and the GCCN registry to promote standardization and interoperability, we’re that much closer to having a portable identity that works (and facilitates travel) across borders — all while giving users ownership and control over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Learn more:   <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">Introducing the Global COVID Certificate Network</a>&nbsp;(GCCN)  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-first-covid-verification-technology-takes-a-giant-step-forward-with-cardea-301286983.html">Indicio Announcement of the Cardea Project contribution to Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health</a>  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-welcomes-new-projects-and-members-to-advance-public-health-safely-reopen-amid-covid-19-301298729.html">Linux Foundation Public Health announcement of the Cardea&nbsp;project</a>  <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea App webpage</a> with community meeting information (as well as links to meeting archives in Github, Slack,&nbsp;Twitter)  <a href="https://ledgerinsights.com/good-health-pass-publishes-blueprint-for-health-credential-interoperability/">Ledger Insights pre-announcement coverage of&nbsp;GCCN</a>  <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass</a> (and Blueprint)   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 Implementing the Good Health Pass’s recommendations with Cardea 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Cardea is a fully open-source and field-tested verifiable digital credential that meets the major requirements of the Good Health Pass.   
			   
				
				
				 <p>With the rollout of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (previously called the Digital Green<br>Certificate), digital health credentials for managing COVID-19 are now a reality. Political urgency has, unsurprisingly, driven the certificate’s development. A borderless political bloc needs a safe way to ensure travel within its member states. The question is how to make these certificates work—and evolve—in a way that maximizes privacy and security, while interoperating with other credential systems outside the EU.</p>
<p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) is leading two collaborative projects that aim to do this. The Global COVID Certificate Network, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">announced today</a>, is a way for COVID-19 test certificates issued in one country to be recognized as authoritative in another. The second is the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>, an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID-19 certificates themselves so that they are privacy-preserving, secure, and interoperable. The Good Health Pass “blueprint” is currently in public draft review.</p>
<p>Cardea, a full, open-source ecosystem for verifiable health credentials developed by Indicio and now a community-led project at LFPH, meets the major recommendations of the Good Health Pass and facilitates the goals of the Global COVID Certificate Network.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the alignment between Cardea and the Good Health Pass recommendations—and where development efforts will be focused to enable full compliance.</p>

				 <p>Cardea has been <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">successfully trialed</a> on the island of Aruba by SITA, the leading global provider of technology to the air transport industry. The pilot project enabled travelers to prove their Covid-test status to restaurants and hospitality locations around the island without having to share any personal information. Dangui Oduber, Aruba’s minister of tourism, public health and sport, <a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/aruba-tests-blockchain-enabled-covid-credential-app">described</a> the ability to trust important health information while preserving visitors’ privacy as “a revolutionary step forward.”</p>
<p>Cardea’s strength as a functioning, deployable ecosystem is that it is built using open source software and doesn’t require any proprietary technology for implementation. It is based on the Hyperledger Indy platform, and uses Hyperledger Aries agents and Hyperledger Ursa cryptography—each backed by dynamic developer communities.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea Community Group</a>, which meets weekly, is led by co-chairs, Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, and Keela Shatzkin of Shatzkin Systems. The Cardea Steering Committee, which will guide Cardea’s development&nbsp; is currently composed of Trevor Butterworth, Indicio; Kristy Gale, Honor DRM; John Kindervag, ON2IT; RJ Reiser, Liquid Avatar;&nbsp; Adrien Sanglier, SITA; Mitja Simcic, GlobaliD, and Mike Vesey, IdRamp. The Cardea Steering Committee is committed to inclusion in developing this project and will actively engage in recruiting a diversity of voices to join the committee.</p>

 “Identità Digitale, opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni” 



<p>Le Identità Digitali stanno creando un paradigma in cui servizi online e transazioni elettroniche possono sfruttare nuove forme di identificazione digitale per gestire in modo più rapido, efficace e remotizzato quei processi in cui il riconoscimento è obbligatorio. In questo evento cercheremo di dare una panoramica il più possibile completa su: opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni in fase di studio.</p>



<p>Marta Gaia Castellan farà un intervento che avrà come focus “Il rischio del furto di identità digitale e le attività antifrode degli Identity Provider SPID”.&nbsp;Luca Boldrin invece, affronterà il tema “Self Sovereign Identity: un nuovo modello di identità decentralizzata”.</p>



<p>Chairwoman dell’evento sarà Claudia Sandei, dottore di ricerca, avvocato e professore associato di Diritto Industriale e delle Nuove Tecnologie dell’Università di Padova, Fondatrice di Itll.it.</p>



<p>Grazie alla collaborazione del ClubTI di Milano e di Infocert avremo i seguenti relatori:</p>



  Alberto Zanini – Esperto Identità Digitale e Consulente Commissione Europea  Andrea Danielli – ClubTI Milano  Fabrizio Lupone – ClubTI Milano  Gianluca Marcellino – Vice Presidente ClubTI Milano  Sergio Stefanoni – CIO Bein  Marta Gaia Castellan – Business Compliance, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert  Luca Boldrin – Innovation Portfolio, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert  



<blockquote><p>Le conoscenze e le competenze di RAO (Registration Authority Office), Incaricati al Riconoscimento e di tutti i soggetti coinvolti nell’attività di Identity Provider SPID sono varie e complesse: diplomatica del documento di identità (tecniche di stampa, microscritte, rilievi tattili, timbri), controlli antifrode, utilizzo incrociato di banche dati ministeriali, elementi di social engineering. L’obiettivo fondamentale è proteggersi dal rischio di furto di identità durante la fase di rilascio, e in particolar modo dall’utilizzo di documenti di identità falsi, rubati, contraffatti, attraverso precisi processi di identity proofing e di vetting.</p>Marta Gaia Castellan – Business Compliance, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>In parallelo all’evoluzione del quadro normativo per un’identità digitale europea, negli ultimi anni sta acquisendo importanza un nuovo modello per la gestione dell’identità digitale, noto come Self Sovereign Identity” (SSI). La principale differenza rispetto ai più diffusi modelli di identificazione e autenticazione sta nel fatto che non richiede la presenza di trusted parties per l’autenticazione: in questo senso si usa spesso lo slogan “you are your own identity provider”. Anche se spesso viene associato a distributed ledger e a nuovi standard (formati, protocolli), SSI è in realtà un paradigma che può essere implementato su diverse tecnologie e in diversi flavour. Questa presentazione fornirà una panoramica del mondo SSI e di alcune importanti iniziative a livello globale ed europeo.</p>Luca Boldrin – Innovation Portfolio, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCer</blockquote>

A step towards portable identity for the&nbsp;EU EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Photo: Radikale&nbsp;Venstre<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">FT</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The EU is set to unveil detailed plans for a bloc-wide digital wallet on Wednesday following requests from member states to find a safe way for citizens to access public and private services&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>The digital wallet would securely store payment details and passwords and allow citizens from all 27 countries to log into local government websites or pay utility bills using a single recognised identity, said people with direct knowledge of the&nbsp;plans.</blockquote><blockquote>The EU-wide app, which can be accessed via fingerprint or retina scanning among other methods, will also serve as a vault where users can store official documents such as a driver’s licence. Using the wallet was not compulsory, those involved said, but citizens who chose to sign up would benefit from an extra-secure digital ecosystem and greater flexibility ideal for post-pandemic life.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1399839260971356165">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>A step in the right direction towards a more portable form of identity — well, at least for Europeans.</blockquote><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">The AP on the portable&nbsp;aspects</a>:</p><blockquote>All EU residents would be entitled to an e-wallet, but they won’t be mandatory, according to the EU Commission.</blockquote><blockquote>But dominant online platforms would be required to accept the wallet, a provision that aligns with the commission’s goal of reining in big tech companies and their control of personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Vestager said people would be able to use their EU digital wallets to access Google or Facebook instead of their “platform-specific” accounts.</blockquote><blockquote>“Because of that, you can decide how much data you want to share — only enough to identify yourself,” the commissioner said from Brussels during a virtual media briefing.</blockquote><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">EU set to unveil digital wallet fit for post-Covid life</a>  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">EU plans digital ID wallet for bloc’s post-pandemic life</a>  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en?mc_cid=7b73084a87&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">EU Digital COVID Certificate</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/anej">/anej </a>— <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/01/apple-pay-competitors-could-include-a-european-union-digital-wallet/">Apple Pay competitors could include an EU digital wallet — 9to5Mac</a>   2.

This includes things like “faceprints and voiceprints,” the policy explained.

Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p>New York governor <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1399863589045952518">Andrew&nbsp;Cuomo</a>:</p> 4. A landmark Supreme Court decision over data&nbsp;access <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">the EFF</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The Supreme Court rightly overturned the Eleventh Circuit, and held that exceeding authorized access under the CFAA does not encompass “violations of circumstance-based access restrictions on employers’ computers.” Rather, the statute’s prohibition is limited to someone who “accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer — such as files, folders, or databases — that are off limits to him.” The Court adopted a “gates-up-or-down” approach: either you are entitled to access the information or you are not. If you need to break through a digital gate to get in, entry is a crime, but if you are allowed through an open gateway, it’s not a crime to be&nbsp;inside.</blockquote><blockquote>This means that private parties’ terms of service limitations on how you can use information, or for what purposes you can access it, are not criminally enforced by the CFAA. For example, if you can look at housing ads as a user, it is not a hacking crime to pull them for your bias-in-housing research project, even if the TOS forbids it. Van Buren is really good news for port scanning, for example: so long as the computer is open to the public, you don’t have to worry about the conditions for use to scan the&nbsp;port.</blockquote><p>And here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd:</p><blockquote>If one accesses a public website or a private website with user permission, it should NEVER be a felony crime to do so. While it is certainly possible to have penalties that publish misuse of public or private information, it is crazy to have a reading of a statute that can be used to penalize mere access to public data or a user’s delegated access to their own&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Public access to public data is a public good. And private access to one’s own data is a right not a privilege. Neither Linkedin/Microsoft nor Microsoft should be able to intimidate startup developers for innovating around these principles on behalf of users. We look forward to building on our past victories in this realm with additional ammo from the Supreme Court that included support from elements in both the liberal and conservative branches.</blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf">check out the Supreme Court decision here</a>&nbsp;(pdf).</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">Van Buren is a Victory Against Overbroad Interpretations of the CFAA, and Protects Security Researchers</a>   5. On the topic of data rights and Big Tech bullying — New York to “revolutionize” antitrust <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/business/dealbook/amc-meme-stocks.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The act’s passage would put New York at the “vanguard” of a national movement, 15 state and national labor and policy groups wrote in a letter to legislators that DealBook is first to report. The organizations argue that the law would “rein in many abusive tactics corporations use against other firms and workers that are difficult to challenge under current antitrust law and precedent.”</blockquote><blockquote>Market dominance would be presumed with 40 percent market share. Currently, companies qualify as dominant if they have 70 to 90 percent of a market. “It’s not illegal to be dominant,” said Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, one of the groups that signed the letter. “It’s just illegal to block others from the market unfairly.” In the act, an “abuse of dominance” standard would replace the current “consumer welfare” standard.</blockquote><blockquote>“Where New York goes, often the rest of the country follows,” Garofalo said, and lawmakers at the federal level could be motivated “if they see the ship is leaving&nbsp;port.”</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>What would this bill do? It would change standards for how a firm is considered to be too powerful. While changing standards seems technical and wonky, such a change would in fact be a revolutionary act to break the power that dominant firms have over our economy. (I testified on behalf of the bill last year, and my organization has written an explainer of the legislation.)</blockquote><blockquote>Right now, to be considered subject to monopolization law, a firm has to have 70–90% of a market, plus it has to engage in egregious behavior that economists measure as inefficient. This bill would blow up that entire framework. First, a firm would only have to have 40% of a market to be considered dominant. Plus, firms that are powerful enough to set wages across an industry, ahem Amazon, would also be considered dominant. It wouldn’t be illegal to be dominant, but under this legislative framework, dominant firms would no longer be allowed to engage in predatory conduct or block competitors from the&nbsp;market.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation would also expand what would be considered anti-competitive behavior. A bunch of stuff that is now dead-letter law, like predatory pricing or selling below cost to capture market share, could come back. The bill would also let private actors sue under these new standards, so it would allow newspapers, grocery stores, pharmacists, manufacturer and employees to sue if they are being abused by a powerful buyer, seller, and/or distributor.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, on the Federal side of things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-f64b55d3-ae02-40c9-ad4c-07352527058d.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Divisions within party caucuses, particularly Republicans, are emerging as a new threat to Congressional action against alleged monopolistic behavior by tech giants, Axios’ Ashley Gold and Margaret Harding McGill&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s a blow to the longstanding theory that a bitterly divided Congress could still agree to tighten the antitrust screws on Big Tech, since both sides have beefs with the industry.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/d71eae">Briefing: Facebook Will Face UK and European Antitrust Probes Into Data&nbsp;Use</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/eu-uk-antitrust-investigations-facebook-classified-5ab1e7e6-b18f-4f3b-b6ca-e737ec828af6.html">EU, U.K. launch antitrust investigations into&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">New York State to Revolutionize Antitrust</a>   6. At Bitcoin Miami 2021 — it was all about community <p>GlobaliD senior product manager <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90/status/1401789767063269376">Paul Stavropoulos</a>:</p><blockquote>My biggest takeaway from Bitcoin2021 in Miami — we’re just scratching the surface on how tokens + NFTs will be used together to facilitate community.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mariashen/status/1401505500567638020?s=21">Maria Shen</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/markonovak">/markonovak</a>):</p><blockquote>I saw crypto being used in the coolest ways in Miami this week &amp; none of them had to do with payments.</blockquote><blockquote>All of them had to do with building strong communities.</blockquote><p>Maria should check out GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups!</p><p>And here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey</a> on “money=community”:</p><blockquote>Our $DESK experience was a reminder that money has always been about community. There’s a feedback loop between people’s desire to own and use a currency and the way in which it intermediates human interaction. Regardless of how functionally advanced your currency is as a technology, this community function is a major determinant of its&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Let’s face it, technologically, the dollar is outdated. The inefficient U.S. banking and payments system still uses paper checks, for crying out loud. It integrates none of the cutting-edge monetary policy and governance features that comes with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. Yet, it rules the world thanks largely to the self-reinforcing power of a “dollar community.”</blockquote><blockquote>Now, for the first time, that community is looking a little less united. As concerns rise about the political and economic sustainability of a dollar-centric global financial system, and as technologies spanning crypto, data services, trading and social media foster new approaches to payments and other financial services, people are exploring alternatives. It’s why everything around money suddenly seems unmoored, as a baffling array of new finance acronyms and memes leaves many in the mainstream confused: NFTs, SPACs, stonks,&nbsp;DeFi.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey: Miami, Piranhas and the Power of Community — CoinDesk</a>   7.

 African Cities — Disrupting the Urban&nbsp;Future Harare, Zimbabwe<p>The future of humanity is urban. Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent in the world with an expected 1.2 billion urban residents by 2050.<a href="https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/af2"> The continent’s urbanisation comes with extraordinary transformative potential, but the structural hurdles are equally huge.</a> Historically, there is<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Urban_West-t.html"> compelling evidence</a> to suggest that urbanisation and economic growth are mutually reinforcing. Yet in Africa, urbanisation is happening in a context of slow structural transformation, pervasive urban poverty and inequalities that compromise a hopeful urban&nbsp;future.</p><p>Building on last year’s Istanbul Innovation Days, the 2019 Harare Innovation Days on #NextGenCities will focus on the strategic risks and opportunities inherent in Africa’s rapid urbanisation. It will invite senior civil servants responsible for cities and bring them together with cutting-edge practitioners working on urban solutions from digitally-enabled distributed infrastructure provision to nature-based solutions, and from participatory city-making to sustainable food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Harare Innovation Days is twinned with an Asia-Pacific focussed Innovation Days in March 2020 event on #NextGenGov. Following both events we aim to open up new pathways for targeted support for collaborative experimentation and learning trajectories within governments starting in the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Arab States&nbsp;region.</p> #AfricaIsNow <p>The numbers may be familiar but are staggering nonetheless. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/01/21/urban-resilience-challenges-and-opportunities-for-african-cities">the continent’s urban population is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2050. </a>Currently, the continent has three megacities: Cairo (10 million), Kinshasa (12 million) and Lagos (21 million). But this is just the start: if Nigeria’s population continues to grow and people move to cities at the current rate, Lagos could become the world’s largest metropolis, home to up to 85 or even <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247816663557">100 million</a> people by 2100 — more people than California or Britain today. And Lagos is not alone — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos">according to some scenarios</a>, Kinshasa may have 83.5 million inhabitants at that point; Niamey, currently home to fewer than a million people, may have 46 million; and Kigali could grow from 1 to 5 million residents already by 2050. And it’s not just over the next 30 years, with all of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/africa-cities-organisational-structure-cairo-institutions">world’s 10 fastest growing cities are going to be in Africa over the next 16 years.</a> In this context, it’s crucial to remember that over 60% of the land projected to become urban by 2030 is <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/sites/default/files/Brochure%20for%20Urban%20Resilience%20flagship%20report.pdf">yet to be developed</a>.</p><p>The accelerated growth, not just of Africa’s megacities but also its medium sized growth hubs and even <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/04/how-bidibidi-uganda-refugee-camp-became-city/">previously rural areas</a>, poses extraordinary challenges for national governments and municipalities. But behind the evident everyday challenges of Africa’s rapid urbanisation — <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/knowledge/publications/african-economic-outlook">unemployment</a> and informality; the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/africa-regional-studies/publication/african-cities-opening-doors-to-the-world">infrastructure gap</a>; structurally underfunded municipalities; huge <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1229079/ghana-the-worlds-fastest-growing-economy-has-a-trash-problem/">waste problems</a>; widespread issues with <a href="https://landportal.org/book/dataset/afrb-surv">land</a> registry and corruption — we see a range of more long-term, interdependent strategic risks: whether <a href="https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/maplecroft-in-the-media/fast-growing-african-cities-at-extreme-risk-from-climate-change-analysts/">climate change</a> and the impact of <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-africas-invisible-silent-killer-1">air pollution</a> on the health of urban dwellers; <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/economic-growth-sub-saharan-africa-challenges-risks/">uncertain economic development</a> and rising inequality; the lack of l<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04685-1">ocally rooted evidence</a> and its impact on planning and governance; the unintended consequences of disruptive technology; food insecurity and the risks of <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511?platform=hootsuite">nutrient decline</a>; or the impact of rapid development on the natural ecosystems cities rely on. They all call into question the current pathways to greater prosperity and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>On the other hand, it also provides a massive opportunity. Frequently celebrated under the banner #AfricaIsNow, we are seeing incredible dynamism, creativity and innovation across the continent, spearheaded by industry, forward-looking governments and creative, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and enabled by new technologies and new platforms enabling cross-sectoral collaborations.</p> NextGenUNDP <p>By building on such disruptive and pioneering ways of working from across the continent, the Innovation Days seeks to unlock an urban future that addresses the current challenges and strategic risks of our time — a future that is uniquely African, rooted in the diverse identities of Africa’s peoples and places, and the continent’s ability to combine global innovations with local solutions. Through the Harare Innovation Days and ongoing support, UNDP aims to accelerate this African future by supporting next generation strategic experimentation.</p><p>The 2018 <a href="https://apolitical.co/solution_article/how-to-make-governance-fit-for-the-future-7-lessons-from-innovators/">Istanbul Innovation Days</a> on <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c">NextGenGov</a> already showed how disruptive technologies are shifting the ability of cities to serve their populations, from the blockchain-enabled real-time pollution monitoring system pioneered by<a href="https://www.commonsimpact.org/"> Commons Impact</a>, to<a href="http://metasub.org/"> MetaSUB’s</a> use of advanced microbiome data to enable predictive approaches like early warnings on looming epidemics or emerging signs of microbial antibiotic resistance. Equally, it recognised that new spaces are needed for citizens and communities to access and make sense of such digital opportunities — showcasing institutions like<a href="https://www.medialab-prado.es/"> Madrid’s Medialab Prado</a> that enable such engagement and which develop participative tools like <a href="https://consulproject.org/en/">Consul</a>, a software now being adapted and adopted across the world including in the rebuilding of Mogadishu.</p><p>Recognising African cities are a key entry point to address the interconnected issues of uncertain economic growth, climate breakdown, social disruption and governance shortfalls; in Harare, we will explore how a series of cutting edge innovations already being pioneered in Africa could further develop cities’ capacity for sustainable and resilient growth. In an uncertain urban future it is essential we co-build the institutional capacity to explore and lead towards opportunities that are genuinely relevant to Africa without trying to replicate western models and mistakes. To do this, UNDP is reaching out to senior level civil servants across some of Africa’s fast-changing cities — the key risk holders in the decades ahead. The aim of the Harare Innovation Days is to be a springboard to supporting them with hands on policy experiments in urban governance, development and infrastructure provision, with UNDP providing the required infrastructure to help these key decision-makers develop experiments that will help address their strategic risks. By convening them alongside some of Africa’s leading innovators and disruptors in the technology, urban planning and policy space, we aim to build a platform and peer to peer network for accelerated learning and implementation capacity for urban innovation.</p> Zones of Experiment <p>We propose four initial focal themes below. Of course they are not all-encompassing, but they are indicative of the complexities and possibilities of urban change in Africa. They go across a series of cross cutting themes — new pathways to creating <a href="https://www.ilo.org/africa/media-centre/pr/WCMS_444474/lang--en/index.htm">secure livelihoods</a> and meaningful jobs in an often informal and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africa-future-of-work">changing economic context</a>; accelerating the shift to environmental sustainability and ecological regeneration; using the best of cutting edge technologies (AI, IoT and real-time satellite data) to provide us with <a href="https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/digital-earth-africa-satellite-dat/">new governance capabilities</a>; and securing pathways to inclusion across highly diverse populations. These are indispensable elements for the achievement of the&nbsp;SDGs.</p> Participatory city-making <p>The future of urban development in Africa cannot solely rely on state actors or large-scale corporate investment; to be resilient and legitimate, it needs to tap into the creativity, passion and drive of local communities and embedded entrepreneurs to co-create urban spaces and re-imagine how they are used. This is crucial in order to build on the unique identity of cities and the creativity of young people as a source of strength and dynamism — to engender new cultures of participation that cut across ‘online’ and ‘offline’, and in turn to enhance sense of belonging (especially in a case of unprecedented migration from rural areas). For example: the <a href="https://www.blockbyblock.org/">Block by Block</a> project uses Minecraft (a game) to give citizens an opportunity to design and re-create local public spaces; <a href="https://www.sei.org/projects-and-tools/projects/i-cmiist/">i-CMiiST</a> in Nairobi and Kampala are using creative methods to explore more sustainable mobility and RanLab’s <a href="https://www.ranlab.org/deliberative-polling-in-uganda-on-resilience-issues-in-the-mt-elgon-region">deliberative polling experiments</a> across Africa show that offline settings for participation can enable better implementation of difficult policy decisions like the relocation of communities due to flooding.</p><p>This is being supported by a range of diagnostic tools, from Arup’s City Resilience Framework to <a href="http://capacitybuildingunhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/workshops/2017-foundational-training-course-climate-compatible-sustainable-and-resilient-cities/Day%203_%20Urban%20Resilience/Module%204%20-%20Urban%20Resilience/Engagement%20Steps%20.pdf">UN-Habitat’s City City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP)</a>, and newfound collaborative energy. The latter converges around innovation hubs which put African talents and innovation at the forefront of a movement that will shape their urban future. These hubs from — <a href="https://ihub.co.ke/">iHub</a> in Nairobi to the<a href="https://cchubnigeria.com/"> Co-creation Hub</a> in Lusaka — serve as data-driven catalysts and tech incubators for young creative talents to experiment with unlikely ideas that address gaps in service delivery in their local communities and beyond. Equally, networks of young civic innovators like <a href="https://i4policy.org/">i4policy</a> foster a collaborative dialogue amongst policy makers, technologists and local communities, in order to create policy frameworks conducive to bottom-up innovation. Such networked movements show how people are already finding ways for their voices to be heard, shaping fertile ground for creative problem solving as well as the leapfrog innovation the continent needs.</p><p>How can we build on such dynamics to re-invent urban governance fit for the 21st century, rather than merely tweaking the structures we&nbsp;have?</p><p>Distributed, hybrid infrastructure (and service) delivery:</p><p>While many African cities struggle after decades of underinvestment, they also have the opportunity to learn from the past mistakes in creating centralised large scale public works. Huge increases in the demand for electricity mean there are now more than 100 million urban Africans<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/living-under-the-grid-110-million-of-africas-unconnected-customers-represen#gs.l4g9ee"> who live right under a grid, but lack an electricity connection</a>, with massive impacts on productivity — but various alternatives are being tested to make systems more affordable, faster to deploy and less fragile both physically and organisationally.</p><p>In response to this, we are seeing a growing series of infrastructure experiments that utilize decentralized approaches, leading to more resilient urban infrastructures that help to stimulate local economic development. These dynamics can be found across mobility infrastructure — with <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2016/10/mobilized-construction-pilots-new-way-of-fixing-africas-roads/">Mobilized Construction</a> piloting a digitally enabled approach to sensing needs for road repair and creating micro-contracts that can be procured locally, often at a fraction of the cost — and housing — with <a href="https://www.ibuild.global/">ibuild</a> creating a digital ecosystem that provides the transparency and accountability for both governments to procure locally and people to incrementally build shelters/housing based on their socio-economic state — as well as sanitation and waste management with start-ups such as <a href="http://wecyclers.com/">Wecyclers</a> which work with low-income households using an incentive-based model to tackle Lagos’ widespread waste problems. This also provides much-needed opportunities for the <a href="https://www.energy-generation.org/about-us">creation of innovative enterprises</a>, e.g. in renewables, that strengthen local economies by generating income. Enabling many of these is the rise of technological innovations, from smart-contracts to digital cash — ranging from the well known large-scale success stories such as Ecocash to local initiatives such as<a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/about"> Grassroots economics</a>, which issue digital complementary currencies to foster local&nbsp;growth.</p><p>How can cities embrace such distributed approaches in their policies and strategies to build the infrastructures for the 21st Century at the scale, speed and inclusion necessary?</p><p>Food as a lense for circular economies</p><p>Cities have a unique opportunity — and need — to spark a transformation towards a circular economy for food, <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/cities-and-circular-economy-for-food">given that 80% of all food will be consumed in cities by 2050</a>. In many African cities, urban agriculture already plays an important role in poverty reduction, food security, flood protection and (as biogas) energy generation. However a combination of population growth, development pressures and cultural change is threatening this provision model. On top of production, the arrival of industrial food processing and distribution (such as supermarkets) has in many cases gone hand in hand with a rise in low-nutrient food types, replacing traditional foods with nutritionally inferior food; extractive economic models and the rise of open food systems that create externalities — leading to reductions in economic, social and environmental sustainability.</p><p>In response, several entrepreneurial experiments are combining new technologies with traditional products to recover wealth from waste products — such as<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45978942"> </a><a href="https://singularityusouthafricasummit.org/2019-summit-speaker/murendeni-mafumo/">Kusini Wate</a>r which uses Macadamia nut shells in mobile solar powered water treatment — as well as using the mobile revolution to develop more transparent, equitable value chains such as<a href="https://twiga.ke/"> Twiga foods</a> in Nigeria and <a href="https://freshinabox.co.zw/#/">Fresh in a box</a> in Zimbabwe. Taking this to city-wide systems change scale, Lusaka’s<a href="https://foodchangelab.org/food-change-labs-in-lusaka-province-zambia/"> Food Change Lab</a> is starting to work with local stakeholders to create a new urban policy approach to the food system and Antananarivo have set up a <a href="https://www.ruaf.org/antananarivo-food-policy-council-policy-practice">Food Policy&nbsp;Council</a>.</p><p>How can new technological capabilities harness the potential inherent in such locally-rooted pathways to better food, jobs, and&nbsp;health?</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>Urban growth is damaging vital ecosystems globally, with land use change a key issue alongside pollution, waste and carbon emissions. African cities are starting to recognise the importance of integrating climate change information into long term planning and design for critical (and green) water related infrastructure which also drive economic development and inclusion. As our built world is made up of complicated, open-loop systems that subsume and deplete the substrate of our complex environment — it is imperative that we create city systems that don’t depend on depletion and accumulation dynamics.</p><p>City-wide innovations focused on strategic infrastructure include multiple examples of innovative financing such as the<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/africa/stories-in-africa/nairobi-water-fund/"> Upper Tana River Water Fund</a>, which uses payments from downstream water users to provide education and support for over 20,000 farmers in methods that increase yields while reducing the maintenance costs for Nairobi’s water infrastructure. Other innovations include disruptive technologies, such as the use of real-time sensors to create<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kala_fleming_easing_water_scarcity_by_understanding_when_and_where_it_flows"> Digital Aquifers</a> in Kenya; community based solutions such as <a href="http://ecolooafrica.com">EcoLoos</a> which provide a sustainable waterless sanitation solution while creating fertilisers, and <a href="https://massdesigngroup.org/">Mass Design</a> which uses exclusively local, responsibly sourced materials, with community members trained and employed throughout the construction process.</p><p>Given cities’ vulnerability to the effects of climate change, how can we build the strategies, regulations and investment pathways to ensure that nature-based solutions become the norm instead of the exception?</p> NextGen UNDP: An antifragile organization <p>These innovations hint at alternative futures, ones where innovation has been nurtured in our policy-making and regulatory capacities and our agile, multi-level governance models are more fit for purpose. In this context of high complexity and accelerated change, our ambition as UNDP is to transform into an antifragile organization, borrowing from Nassim Taleb, that adapts to change and converts strategic risk into strategic opportunity. We understand that the key to antifragility is the ability to fail in small doses and to use external stressors, like the significant strategic risks that cities face, to ‘gain from disorder’ over time and arrive at better outcomes. Our collective ability to deal with such risks and shocks, and to rapidly learn and re-configure our strategies, technology, people and interventions, (in short: our transformational capability) will enable our partner governments and their partners to show how #AfricaIsNow isn’t just true for the continent’s booming creative industries but also its unique urban&nbsp;future.</p>

 Blockchain Layer Enhancement 
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon, and our customers can now choose to deploy their security tokens on Polygon or Ethereum.</p>

		 
	 
                               <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This month we’ll take a look at our recent integration with&nbsp;<a href="https://polygon.technology/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GeROieC2104YV1g-15YG54LvxpTPUngYOeS9eIiuZaINXDRGm-SLLuYKrcN2JMUcEKn8p">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>Polygon (previously known as “Matic Network”) is growing rapidly, and has recently overtaken the likes of Stellar, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Tezos in terms of its market capitalization. In the last months Polygon made some serious strides with some blue chip DeFi protocols migrating, including Aave, Curve finance, and 0x.</p>
<p>But what does our integration with Polygon mean for our security token customers?</p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, we have seen gas fees skyrocketing as a result of network congestion and ETH price increase with an all-time-high reached last month. Transaction processing times have also been varying a lot depending on the network load. The congestion and issues related to fees should get resolved through the gradual implementations of various deliveries of Ethereum 2.0 in the course of this year and next. However, for our customers and for ourselves having live activity on the network, these congestion issues have become a handicap over the last few months.</p>
<p>Foreseeing that this will continue to be a problem for our customers, we benchmarked several so-called Layer 2 solutions and sidechains as well as some separate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains and we selected Polygon as the best alternative solution for deploying our products (ONCHAINIDs, the T-REX protocol and the T-REX platform) on Ethereum Public for the time being.</p>
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon to make sure that the deployment of new security tokens or the migration of existing ones will be as seamless as possible for our customers and their investors. The first T-REX security token has already been deployed successfully on Polygon in May on behalf of one of our customers.</p>
<p>Our customers will benefit from Polygon being:</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the network is secured by a proof of stake consensus and by the Ethereum network;</p>
<p>Performant&nbsp;– transactions are executed in seconds for fees that are usually under 1 cent, making transaction fees virtually irrelevant (we have seen a fees reduction by a factor of 1/10000 compared to what they have been over the last few months on Ethereum Public);</p>
<p>Easy to use&nbsp;– users can still use their Ethereum-based wallets, such as a Metamask or custodial wallets like the ones connected to ONCHAINID;</p>
<p>Additionally, the consensus mechanisms used on Polygon are far-less energy-consuming and as a result more environment-friendly. The Polygon team has an aggressive roadmap to implement interconnection with other blockchains and support interoperability. It has also proved over the last months that it is delivering the products planned as per its roadmap with the introduction of full stack scaling last week (26/05/2021).</p>
<p>Obviously, we remain fully compatible and supportive of the Ethereum Public network, and our customers will be offered the choice between deploying their security tokens on one or the other network. Existing customers will also be offered the possibility to migrate existing tokens from one to the other. Finally, this integration makes us confident that our products and services could be adapted to other EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions, sidechains and blockchains going forward according to our customers needs.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow 
 
 
<p>Last week, the EU Commission published a draft for the so-called digital identity wallet “EUid”. According to it, within 12 months of the law coming into force, every EU state must provide its citizens with a digital wallet.</p>
<p>The draft for the “Digital Identity Wallet” states the following: Every citizen will be given access to a so-called digital wallet. They have to identify themselves once and the data will be stored for further use.</p>
<p>In addition to electronic signatures, documents such as birth and marriage certificates or driving licences are to be stored in the digital wallet in future. This goes hand in hand with numerous use cases – from digital administrative procedures such as address changes or tax returns to the use of health services. A possibility that would revolutionise our daily lives.</p>
<p>According to the draft, each country has three options for implementation: either it launches a solution for its citizens and businesses itself. Or it commissions a private company to develop the wallet and make it publicly available. The third option is a government-approved certification programme that allows private companies to certify applications for identification. The exact technical standards are currently still being discussed at EU level. Only after publication of these standards, the member states will be able to start implementing the respective solution. In doing so, they will have to pay attention to two aspects in particular: high security standards as well as a user experience that is as pleasant as possible. This is the only way to ensure that the solution is accepted by as many citizens as possible.</p>
<p>From our point of view, the introduction of the digital wallet is a necessary and right step to simplify the everyday life of citizens and to overcome digital identification borders within the EU. With the new regulation, it is possible to create an overarching infrastructure.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow itself is working on its own technology for digital wallets. With the “IDnow Wallet”, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. Fingerprint or facial recognition (Touch or Face ID) is used to release the data for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. Due to the zero-knowledge principle, it is not possible for IDnow as a provider to gain access to the user’s data. As a certified identification service by the Registration Authority according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future.</p>

<p>The second edition of Tools for Thought Interchange took place on June 3rd – or June 4th if you were joining us from the other side of the international date line! And in fact, Iian Neill did just that from Australia, plus Frode Hegland calling from the other side of midnight in the UK, rounded out by Brian Rubinton in North America.</p> Fission: IPFS as global data commons <p>Boris kicked things off with why we at Fission care about the category of tools for thought, and offering the IPFS protocol as part of the answer to interchange: a global data commons. </p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/toolsforthought/2021-06-03%20Tools%20for%20Thought%20Part%202.pdf">Slide deck PDF »</a><p>For those that aren't familiar with it, <a href="https://docs.ipld.io/">InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)</a> is also worth digging into.</p><p>JeffG from Fission also briefly talked about an idea we're exploring: an open source browser extension to be used as a shared web clipper by any tool for thought, with content clipped and shared to IPFS for maximum re-use. If you're interested in #ProjectPachyderm, get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/midijeffg">JeffG @midijeffg</a>.</p><p>As always, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 2 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 2. <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tools-for-thought-interchange-part-1/">Part 1 is also available on the blog here.</a></p> Iian Neil, Codex Editor &amp; Standoff Editing <p><a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor">Iian Neill</a> talked about Codex Editor and the concepts around it:</p><blockquote><p>"We need a file system for thought" <a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codexeditor</a> <br><br>Multiple apps, semantic artifacts that can be shared across each other. Something "like" an operating OS, or at least the desktop OS metaphor for knowledge workers.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThought?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThought</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3Q3hRUdmm">pic.twitter.com/h3Q3hRUdmm</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400628265975386112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>The follow up here with Iian and what he has built with Codex was meant as a compliment to Blaine's talk on atJSON: the concept of Standoff Editing, where annotations don't just exist as inline markup, but in fact are meant to be multi player – including with past / future versions of yourself.</p><p>"Liberate the user from the tyranny of embedded markup" was a particularly strong phrase!</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sHt8j3UwYqNOnRCBFLqZjNBxwkdAlmyKisrjKXjWRxI/edit?usp=sharing">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://github.com/argimenes/standoff-properties-editor">Standoff Properties Editor on Github</a>  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor">Main page for Codex Editor on Patreon</a>  <p>As well as his on camera presentation, Iian also prepared an extended demo to YouTube:</p> Frode Hegland, Visual Meta <p><a href="https://twitter.com/liquidizer">Frode Hegland</a> took us all the way back to the <a href="https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/">original Tools for Thought: Howard Rheingold's book by that name</a>.</p><p><a href="http://visual-meta.info/">Visual Meta</a> is what Frode demo'd for us, "BibTeX and a little JSON": a way to put metadata directly into documents, that is both human readable and machine readable.</p><p>Frode made an amazing case for PDF as the 1000 year format:</p><blockquote><p>"I expect PDF to be around in 1000 years"<br><br>"I don't want my son to grow up with PDFs that are basically JPEGs"<br><br>Visual Meta is meant to add more info to PDFs. <a href="https://t.co/JO2DGEf5kl">pic.twitter.com/JO2DGEf5kl</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400640639390208017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>His sentiment about building for his son called back to our presentation with <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/overview-of-logseq-by-tienson-qin/">Tienson, creator of Logseq, who also mentioned building for his daughter</a>. </p><p>Frode invites everyone to join the Future of Text community, as well as to submit work for inclusion in the forthcoming second volume.</p>  <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeialfrkxg5ip7npzp6xyzqzif3zka64zk62ovtrj5w6eulhikmak6u/Hegland%20VM%20Presentation%20T4T.pdf">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://www.augmentedtext.info/">Augmented Text Company</a>, supporting Visual Meta in Author &amp; Reader, both apps available for macOS  <a href="https://future-of-text.circle.so/c/welcome">Future of Text Community on Circle »</a>  <a href="https://futuretextpublishing.com/future-of-text-2020-download/">Future of Text Volume I</a>   Brian Rubinton, Kanopi &amp; RDF for interchange <p>Brian Rubinton joined us to talk about and demo <a href="https://kanopi.io/">Kanopi</a>, his fully RDF-based note taking tool.</p><blockquote><p>Crowded market, BUT "Almost everyone is still using digital paper. There is still a very long way to go"<a href="https://twitter.com/brianru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brianru</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThoughts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThoughts</a> <a href="https://t.co/wStIFLQXWf">pic.twitter.com/wStIFLQXWf</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400643189308989445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>This point about "digital paper" in the crowded market of note taking was in reference to limited "meaning" embedded in those notes (same as Frode's PDFs-as-JPEGs comment). Which perhaps was the theme that ended up emerging from all three presentations: more meaning.</p>  <a href="https://app.pitch.com/app/public/presentation/345a5721-0401-4c79-8009-f7a5fe2e07c8">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUF4aFGjwN2GnO2bkf3cUdTQIRgSCwAkU">Demo playlist on Youtube</a>   Video <p>Even though we had one less presentation, we still ended up going for almost 2 hours.</p><p>We had many wonderful attendees keeping the chat active, including a number of European night owls. The chat log is once again checked into the <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/blob/main/2021-06-03-chat.txt">TFTInterchange repo</a>.</p> TFTInterchange Community <p>This two part series was organized by Boris and the Fission team. Tools for Thought are a recurring theme in our <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tag/presentation/">presentations</a>, and we'd love to keep supporting Interchange with our Zoom webinar account and our time at the very least!</p><p>We'd like to get a more diverse group of people involved, and make this more of a community project, that bridges community discussion, open source code, and interoperable formats.</p><p>There seemed to be general interest in at least a monthly community event, so perhaps along with timezone differences, we'll see if we can stagger them and so still have a presentation every 2 weeks or so.</p><p>Next steps:</p>  Please share your thoughts and notes from Part 1 and Part2: #ToolsForThought on Twitter, add a link in the comments on this post  Who wants to help organize ongoing talks? <a href="https://twitter.com/shuyunzhang99">@shuyunzhang99</a> has already <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/4">volunteered in this thread on Github</a>. She's in Australia, which naturally may give us an organizing lead for that time zone.  What open source code and interchange can we work on together? Boris has proposed <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">ePub to atJSON</a> in the Github repo as a project, please add your own ideas.   <p>Fission invites presenters most Thursdays on a broad set of tech topics. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get notified of future events »</a></p>

   Vision 
 Buying a star can be a daunting prospect, even for those who have owned a planet for some time. A star is much more expensive than a planet, and it comes with new and confusing vocabulary. What's a naked star? Are some stars in lockup? Is mine in lockup? If it is in lockup, how does it get unlocked?

   Vision 
<p>Buying a star can be a daunting prospect, even for those who have owned a planet for some time. A star is much more expensive than a planet, and it comes with new and confusing vocabulary. What's a naked star? Are some stars in lockup? Is mine in lockup? If it is in lockup, how does it get unlocked?</p>
<p>If the prospective buyer is not using an established website such as OpenSea, and is instead buying from an individual, these problems become much worse. What makes a star commodity grade? How can the buyer verify the status of the star?</p>
<p>This documentation will function as a Guide for the Perplexed. It will tell the buyer what to look for, and how to look for it, in entirely non-technical language. More daunting tasks such as verifying the star status on Hoon and/or Ethereum will be described clearly and plainly. By following this guide, the buyer will be able to verify the star's status, not merely trust the seller.</p>
 Design 
<p>The documentation will be entirely text. Since I know few of the answers to these questions, I will post in The Marketplace and other channels on Urbit to seek community input. I will gather knowledge from anyone willing to share, and compile an easy-to-read and well-sourced document that can be posted and shared anywhere useful.</p>
 Me 
<p>I'm a full-stack software engineer and former lawyer. I'm adept at navigating new domains and sharing what I've learned in an accessible and pleasant way.</p>
 Milestones 
 Documentation is merged 
<p>1 stars
1-2 months, probably toward the end of July 2021</p>

<p>This is the second of two blogs on our new White Paper: <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transform At Scale</a>. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-new-white-paper-achieving-transformation-at-scale-f97320f8447e">first blog</a> focused on the infrastructure challenge. This blog focuses on the parallel need for institutional innovation.</p><p>Sometimes, when a society confronts a new challenge, the institutions it previously relied on to provide solutions cannot cope. New, different institutions are needed. We think this is the case with personal data. Traditionally, our society has looked to two main types of institution to unleash social and economic opportunities: private sector firms focused on maximising their profits and state-owned enterprises. But as this blog explains, these types of institution cannot rise to the particular challenges posed by personal data. A different type of institution is needed, and thankfully we have one to hand: the Community Interest Company&nbsp;(CIC).</p><p>Many people are still not familiar with CICs, which often come across as a rather strange hybrid beast. CICs&nbsp;are:</p>  asset locked. This means any assets a CIC develops cannot be sold to another entity that is not also asset locked and equally committed to pursuing its community purpose. Mydex is not seeking a trade sale or ‘exit’: it is committed to continuing the operation and extension of its platform as permanent infrastructure to benefit its community (citizens).  dividend capped. Only 35% of distributable profits can be returned to shareholders. The remaining 65% must be reinvested in furthering the community benefits for which the CIC was established.  <p>Why has Mydex chosen this unfamiliar CIC&nbsp;status?</p> Mission logic <p>One simple explanation is that when Mydex was established back in 2007, its founders didn’t just want to sell a product in order to make money. They wanted to produce a service that brings benefits to people and communities and recognised they needed to make money in order to fund this service provision. Making money isn’t the purpose of the business. Benefiting the community by achieving its mission is the purpose, and making money is a means to achieving that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>A second reason is that we recognised that personal data throws up huge issues and challenges relating to trust. We reasoned as follows: If there is a lack of trust surrounding the collection and use of personal data, its full personal, social and economic potential will be hampered by mutual suspicion, power struggles and conflict and therefore never realised. A new type of institution that builds trustworthiness into what it does, and how, is needed for this challenge.</p><p>How CIC status helps us rise to this challenge is not immediately obvious but the logic is powerful. It’s worth exploring.</p> Economic logic <p>The unique and particular challenges (and opportunities) of personal data lie in the fact that unlike physical products and most services, data is a resource that can be used by many different people and organisations for many different purposes without ever getting ‘used up’. Because of this, it breaks the boundaries imposed by current notions of ‘private property’. Institutions organised around the notion of ownership of private property and profit maximisation are struggling to come to terms with a new world where value is created by data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This takes us to the first unique challenge for Mydex: the question “What makes an enterprise economically viable and successful?”</p><p>It’s commonly assumed that the acid test of an enterprise’s economic success is how much money it makes. But that relates to its financial success, not its economic&nbsp;success.</p><p>If you stop to think about it, organisations’ economic results always lie outside their traditional legal and accounting boundaries — in the value their products or services generate in being used by other parties (while how much money they make is an internal measure). So, for example, the economic (and social) value of electricity isn’t measured by the money electricity suppliers happen to make. It lies in all the many uses our society uses electricity for.</p><p>This is true of all enterprises. The job of a car or phone maker is to provide people with cars or phones — that provide them with mobility and help them communicate: things they want to do in their lives. The job of a hospital is to treat the sick; the job of an orchestra to delight audiences with its music; the job of a local shop to make accessing the necessaries of life&nbsp;easy.</p><p>For most enterprises, this external economic impact is implicit. It’s not something they worry about too much, because they are focused on the internal measures that matter to them. But in the case of Mydex it needs to be made explicit, because the whole purpose of the organisation is the external value it helps to create: making data available to people (especially citizens) outside its traditional organisational boundaries, so that they can use this data for their own purposes. Adopting CIC status makes this external purpose explicit and focuses attention (of people both inside and outside the organisation) on this external&nbsp;purpose.</p> Financial logic <p>If it’s true that financial success is not the same as economic success, then how much money an organisation happens to make has got nothing to do with its external economic impact. If it’s a charity or public service, it could deliver huge economic benefits but not ‘make’ any money at all. If it’s a mafia syndicate, it could make huge amounts of money while its external economic impacts are 100% negative.</p><p>But to survive, an organisation needs to cover its costs, and how it does so&nbsp;matters.</p><p>If it’s a charity, it needs income from donations. If it’s a public service, it needs to be paid for by taxes. If it sells products or services, it needs customers willing to pay for them. If it needs external investment, it needs investors willing to&nbsp;invest.</p><p>Each of these approaches to funding has its advantages and disadvantages. At Mydex, we chose not to be a charity for two reasons. First, because with a focus like ours on personal data we feared that we would end up spending so much time and effort seeking benefactors and donations that this quest could end up diverting our attention away from actually delivering our mission. Second, this constant need to attract benefactors might place us under pressure to bend our mission to these benefactors’ whims.</p><p>Likewise, we don’t think an organisation with a mission like ours, relating to personal data, should rely directly on taxpayer funding for two reasons. First, there are immense risk and trust issues involved in the state having comprehensive citizen databases under its control. Second, taxpayer funded services often find themselves at the mercy of shifting political winds. That is why we chose to be a company that can cover its costs from what it sells: so that it isn’t dependent on external funders and remains free to make its own decisions. For us, this strategic independence is extremely important.</p><p>But does this mean we simply have to bend to the will of a different set of external parties, namely customers (e.g. the organisations who pay Mydex fees to connect to its platform) and investors?</p><p>It could, in theory. But we have designed our business model carefully to avoid this risk. We have designed our revenue streams so that we are financially incentivised to be a neutral enabler, not a ‘data monetiser’: we only sell connections to our platform to enable safe, easy, low cost data sharing; we don’t sell or rent any data itself. And the dividend cap for shareholders means the community always benefits from the lions’ share of any profits we happen to&nbsp;make.</p><p>Getting this balance right is crucial because of the extraordinary potential of the Mydex business model: the more it grows the more profitable it gets. Exponentially. As a platform business, Mydex’s core operating costs do not rise rapidly with volume use. But the more organisations that connect to this platform, the more revenues the platform generates. In other words, as Mydex grows its revenue streams grow much faster than its costs — which means that Mydex has the potential to become extremely profitable. By creating a legally-enforceable dividend cap that requires it to reinvest two thirds of any profits it makes in its community mission, CIC status ensures that Mydex’s external, economically beneficial community purpose always remains paramount.</p><p>(This has an important knock-on internal cultural impact. It means that in everything we do and how we do, we focus all our efforts on doing those things that will continually improve the external value we generate — our community contribution — on ‘making’ rather than ‘taking’. It creates a discipline and a yardstick for decision-making.)</p> Strategic logic <p>But this external value focus creates a potential problem. Why should investors bother investing in a company that only returns a third of the profits it makes to them when they could in theory get all the&nbsp;profits?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is that a third of a very large sum is much bigger than all of a tiny&nbsp;sum.</p><p>There is a paradox to this answer which goes to the heart of Mydex’s CIC status. It relates to the two separate elements: the ‘very large sum’ and the ‘tiny&nbsp;sum’.</p><p>Let’s start with the very large sum. With its data sharing infrastructure Mydex is creating the equivalent of a mass production assembly line for the entire data economy. Henry Ford’s assembly lines reduced the costs of making motor cars by over 90%. They made a transformational product affordable to ordinary people, unleashed a tidal wave of product innovation and transformed the way societies and economies worked. Mydex is doing the same with personal data: slashing the costs of accessing and using it, making its benefits available to ordinary people, unleashing innovation and transforming the way our society and economy uses our data in the process. The potential scale of this business is enormous and global. It could generate very large sums of&nbsp;money.</p><p>What about the tiny sum? A year or two ago, the UK Treasury published a paper on the Economic Value of Data. It contained a crucial insight. It noted that “innovative uses of data can generate powerful positive externalities (i.e. benefits) that may not always accrue to the data creator or controller. This can result in data being under-exploited or under-shared.”</p><p>In other words, the Treasury was accepting that private companies focused only on profit maximisation have no reason to pursue the transformational external economic benefits we have been talking about: they have no reason to build the data sharing infrastructure that Mydex is building.</p><p>This means that without a new type of institution that prioritises the external benefits identified by Treasury they won’t ever happen. If we stick with existing institutions with their existing priorities, the very large sum becomes a tiny sum. Forever. Investors who insist on having access to all the profits will get close to none instead. The opportunity will be stillborn.</p><p>This goes deep into Mydex’s role. The UK Treasury was highlighting a strategic collective action problem. It would greatly benefit all parties if investment was made into the infrastructure that makes the safe, efficient, privacy protecting sharing of personal data possible, so that all its uses and potential can be realised. But it’s not in the immediate interests (or role) of any current data controllers (e.g. organisations collecting and using personal data) to take on the cost, risk or responsibility of making this investment.</p><p>Somebody else needs to take on this role. But this somebody has to be different. They cannot be focused on grabbing all the benefits for themselves. They have to be focused on creating external community value. And these priorities need to be baked into how they work. That’s what CIC status does: bake these purposes into the organisation’s legal structure. As a CIC Mydex is legally required to share financial rewards equitably. And, as a CIC, we are legally required to keep to the above promises in perpetuity (unlike venture capitalist funded outfits that are incentivised to make all the promises in the world and to break these promises once they have achieved a profitable ‘exit’).</p><p>To put it simply, to break the Treasury’s collective action problem and to fully unleash personal data’s ‘positive powerful externalities’ we need a new type of institution that every stakeholder can trust. Only a new, neutral, independent, non-threatening, non-competing, trustworthy body can break the collective action logjam and Mydex’s CIC status formally confirms and signals to everyone concerned that this is its positive, permanent, enabling&nbsp;role.</p> The final piece of&nbsp;jigsaw <p>There is one more piece of this jigsaw that finally locks all the others into place. There are two main types of Community Interest Company: companies limited by guarantee and companies limited by&nbsp;shares.</p><p>Companies limited by guarantee are not-for-profit enterprises, while companies limited by shares can make a profit and distribute (some) dividends to shareholders. Mydex has chosen to be a company limited by shares.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>To some purists, CICs limited by shares are not ‘real’ community interest companies. The purists’ assumption is that if any shareholder stands to make any money out of investing in the company, then by definition they are extracting value from it and therefore exploiting the community that the company is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.</p><p>We don’t see it that way. Mydex is building nationwide infrastructure that will last for decades and building such infrastructure takes time (decades) and money. Which means it needs investment.</p><p>Most financial investors today adopt the role of cherry pickers. They search around for ripe fruit ready for the picking and invest in the cherry picking operation: big, quick, low-risk returns. Mydex is doing the opposite. We are planting and tending a cherry orchard from seedling to maturity — without which there will be no cherries to pick (the ‘positive externalities’ the Treasury was talking about). But this requires a different type of investor: one who ‘gets’ the mission and is prepared to be patient (because reaching the point where those increasing returns kick in will take many&nbsp;years).</p><p>Paying dividends (limited to one third of any profits made) to such investors is not exploitation of the community. It is paying for a service that makes a community benefit possible, just as paying staff to develop the software is not staff exploiting the community but making the community benefit possible. Once again, CIC status helps us to turn potential conflict into alignment to achieve a positive way&nbsp;forward.</p> Locust or&nbsp;bee? <p>Mydex’s mission — to empower every individual with their own data — is potentially global, long term and paradigm-changing: if successful it would put the modern data economy on a new and different footing.</p><p>In nature, we find many strategies for survival. There are predators and prey, parasites and hosts, foragers, scavengers, hunters. Locusts flourish by devouring the value other organisms have produced. Bees flourish by helping plants flourish — to flower and&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>Today’s personal data economy is dominated by locusts, intent on extracting as much profit as they can from individuals’ data. In choosing to be a Community Interest Company, Mydex brings together economic, financial and strategic logic to make it possible for the company to flourish as a bee, and therefore for the orchards to flourish and fruit too. We flourish by helping others to flourish. That, we believe, is why in the long term we will be successful. And that is why we are a Community Interest&nbsp;Company.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/can-i-trust-you-6771a6ca0e35">Can I trust you?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Session Management is a pretty scary term for a lot of developers.  Most of the mechanics of session management are abstracted away from developers, to the point where they don’t properly learn about it until it’s necessary.  Usually, this means a late night trying to figure out a vulnerability, a bug, or how to work with a new session management library.  Hopefully, I can remove some of the magic behind session management in NodeJs and give you a good fundamental place to start.  In this article, you will learn what sessions are, how to manage them in Node.js, and some details that should help you minimize bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>

 Overview of Sessions 

<p>I will start at the beginning.  When a user uses your web application, they make an HTTP request to the webserver.  The server then knows what to do with this request and returns a response.  The user’s request must contain all the necessary information for the server to make a decision.  For example, is the user authenticated?  Is he/she authorized to view a specific page?  Does the user have a shopping cart that needs to be displayed?  All this information that makes the user experience feel seamless, as though he/she is  using one continuous application, must be transmitted from the client to the server.  If the application were to transmit all this data back and forth on each request, you would introduce massive security and performance concerns.  There are many ways to streamline this effort, but for the sake of this article, I will focus on cookie-based sessions.</p>

<p>When a user sends a request to your web application, they will add a session cookie to the request headers.  If this is the first time a user has requested your site, the server will create a new session cookie and return it to the client.  The session is given an ID that both the client and server can reference.  This enables the application to split the session data between that which is stored on the client-side and that which is stored on the server.  For example, the cookie may tell the application the session ID and that the user is authenticated.  The server can use this information to access the user’s shopping cart in the server’s store.</p>

<p>Of course, any time an application sends information to the client it could possibly end up in an enemy’s hands.  The majority of your users aren’t necessarily bad actors, but bad actors are certainly looking for ways to exploit your application.  Most security concerns should be addressed by you, the developer and maintainer of the application and the developer of whatever session management library you’re using.</p>

 Session Management Risks 

<p>As an aside, I should note that it’s generally better to use a well-established session management library than to roll your own.  You will see a few examples of that later in this article.  For now, let’s take a look at some common session security concerns.</p>

 Session Prediction 

<p>Each session has an associated session ID with it.  It is very important that this session ID is properly randomized, such that an attacker cannot simply guess a few options and bypass any security associated with the session ID.  Suppose your session IDs were sequential integers.  An attacker could log in, create a new session, and see their session ID is <code>12345</code>.  The attacker could then try to pass the session ID <code>12344</code> or <code>12343</code> to the server in an attempt to hijack a session from another user.</p>

 Session Sniffing 

<p>In session sniffing, an attacker can use a sniffing application such as Wireshark or a proxy to capture network traffic between a client and server.  As you’ve learned, that traffic will ultimately contain a request with a session cookie in it.  This cookie will have the session ID which can then be hijacked.</p>

 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks 

<p>In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker sits between the web server and the client.  The attacker can then pass requests from the client to the server and respond without detection from either.  But along the way, the attacker has gained access to the session.</p>

 Client Side Attacks 

<p>There are many strategies for attacking the client.  Some of the best known are Cross-Site Scripting, Trojans, and malicious javascript codes.  Sometimes it just takes some good old-fashioned social engineering to obtain session information from a client.  The idea here is that the attack will attempt to exploit the client itself to get access from the cookie in the browser’s storage.  For example, an attacker that can inject malicious Javascript code could inject the following javascript:</p>

   <code>alert(document.cookie);
</code>   

<p>With that simple line of code, the attack can now gain access to the cookie along with all the session goodies in it.</p>

 Good Session Management Practices 

<p>All of this is probably a little scary,  But many people are working on the other side to help prevent these attacks or minimize their impacts.  Most of these strategies are rolled into session management libraries, and any library that is continuously maintained should be up to date with the latest security enhancements.  But, it’s important for you, as a developer who takes security seriously, to understand what security should be in place.</p>

 Session Secret 

<p>Any good session management library should come with an option to change the <code>session secret</code>.  It may have slightly different names but the idea is always the same.  The secret is used to compute a hash against the session ID.  This helps to prevent session hijacking by ensuring the session cookie hasn’t been tampered with.</p>

 Session Expiration 

<p>Another good practice is to expire the session after some predetermined time.  There are two ways to expire a session: (1) based on inactivity or (2) absolutely.  When you base your expiration on inactivity, it will keep the session open until the user hasn’t made a request for some amount of time.  When you choose to expire it absolutely, then the session will expire after some predetermined time, regardless of activity.  The session will then need to be refreshed.  You should at least set an inactivity session expiration so you don’t have stale and vulnerable sessions available for attack.</p>

 Cookie Expiration 

<p>Similar to session expiration, you can also expire the cookie that was sent to the browser.  Many times, cookies are set to expire when the session expires.  However, it is possible to allow the cookie to remain available indefinitely.  This is a poor decision for the same reason as session expiration.  Generally, session expiration is a strong tool for minimizing the impacts of attack, but implementing cookie expiration is also helpful.</p>

 Regeneration of Session After Login 

<p>When a user first accesses your site, he/she can use an anonymous session.  This is a fairly common practice where you want to track a user’s movements in your application but don’t want to require them to log in.  For example, consider a shopping site where an anonymous user can have a shopping cart but can’t check out until he/she logs in.  In this case, there is still a session ID provided to the user.  When the user does log in, you should regenerate the session ID to prevent session fixation attacks against your web application.</p>

 Session Management in Node.js 

<p>Node.js has become wildly popular over the last 10 years.  With it, several frameworks and session management libraries have cropped up to support it.  Most frameworks use their own session management middleware.  For example, <code>express</code>, the most popular server framework for Node.js, has the accompanying <code>express-session</code> for session management.  Similarly, <code>koa</code> uses <code>koajs/session</code> for its session management.</p>

<p>For this article, I want to focus on <code>express-session</code>, as it is one of the most mature and widely used session management libraries available for Node.js.  For a full rundown of the <code>express-session</code> package, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme">readme here</a>.  Below are some of the highlights:</p>

<p>Registering the middleware for <code>express-session</code> is very simple.</p>

   <code>var session = require('express-session')
var app = express()

app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);
</code>   

<p>This is the minimum you need to do to get <code>express-session</code> working in a development environment.  As discussed, the secret is used in hashing the session ID, to ensure it isn’t tampered with between the client and the server.  This should be some very long, complex string that is hard to guess.  This string should be rotated periodically to ensure that if it was compromised, it doesn’t stay that way long. The <code>secret</code> can also take an array of secrets to make it even harder to guess.</p>

<p>The <code>resave</code> option enforces that the session is resaved against the server store on each request, even if the session wasn’t modified.  The <code>saveUninitialized</code> property forces a new session to be saved. Both the <code>resave</code> and <code>saveUninitialized</code> options are left to your discretion on how best to implement.  Generally, <code>saveUninitialized: false</code> is used to reduce the session storage on the server for unauthenticated requests.  <code>resave</code> is defaulted to true, but to reduce overhead you can set it to false if your store allows.</p>

<p>Speaking of the store, you notice in this example you haven’t implemented one.  The default server-side session storage is <code>MemoryStore</code>.  According to the documentation, this is purposely not designed for production.  This means it’s fine to leave the above code this way in development, but you should implement a different store in production.  Not doing so can result in memory leaks and does not scale past a single process.  A list of compatible session stores <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#compatible-session-stores">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The following example uses <code>express-sessions</code> (note sessions instead of session) as a server-side store using MongoDB:</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    })
}));
</code>   

<p>Now your application will use your MongoDB instance to store the server session data.  <code>Express-sessions</code> also supports a Redis implementation.  Furthermore, there are many libraries for supporting other databases and in-memory solutions.  Your stack will likely dictate what package you need to use.</p>

<p>Coming back to the security aspect of sessions, you learned that you should expire the session and the cookie.  The example below builds on our working example to do just that.</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    }),
  cookie: { maxAge: 2628000000 },
}));
</code>   

<p>In the above expression, only the session ID is stored in the cookie, so you can set the <code>cookie.maxAge</code> value to expire the session and the cookie in one shot.  There is also an option for <code>cookie.expires</code>, however it is recommended that you set the <code>maxAge</code> option instead.</p>

<p>Now from your routes, you should be able to access the <code>session</code> object from your request object.  Earlier you learned that you should regenerate your session after the user logs in.  Let’s take a look at that using express and the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> from Okta.</p>

   <code>const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: {yourOktaDomain} + "/oauth2/default",
  client_id: {yourClientId},
  client_secret: {yourClientSecret},
  appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
  scope: "openid profile",
  routes: {
    login: {
      path: "/users/login",
    },
    callback: {
      path: "/authorization-code/callback",
    },
    loginCallback: {
      afterCallback: "/users/afterLogin",
    },
  },
});

app.use(oidc.router);

app.get("/users/afterLogin", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
  request.session.regenerate(function(err) {
    // will have a new session here
  })
});
</code>   

<p>In the above example, you are registering the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> middleware provided by Okta to handle the login.  After the successful login, you redirect the users to the <code>users/afterLogin</code> router, which then has access to the <code>request</code> object.  <code>Express-session</code> has attached the <code>session</code> object to the request for you and you can use the <code>session</code> API to call <code>regenerate</code>.  This will create a new session for the logged-in users.</p>

<p>Session management is a topic that you could spend days researching and understanding.  As I noted, the session management package you will use in Node.js will largely depend on your stack and your server framework.  However, by becoming familiar with implementing safe and optimized session management in one framework, you can carry that knowledge to all other Node.js frameworks.</p>

 Representing base IP with ERC721 and fungible IP licenses with ERC20, to combine benefits of&nbsp;both  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard. This article links ERC721 &amp; ERC20, and describes how combining them gets benefits of&nbsp;both.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Scenarios <p>There are two big-picture scenarios on how base IP and sub-licenses relate.</p>  Just base IP. This is quite simple. It’s a single artifact and there is no sub-licenses. For example, an artist paints a painting and has a copyright of it. That painting is sold to a collector who then gets exclusive rights to it. The base IP started as copyright held by the painter, then was transferred to the collector.  Sub-licenses against the base IP. This has many varieties. Typically the sub-licenses are fungible. For example, an author writes a book and has copyright of it; he does an exclusive license of this base IP to a publishing house. The house sells 10,000 physical books, each having its own fungible sub-license against the base IP. As a second revenue stream, it might also sell 20,000 e-books, each having its own fungible sub-license (a different license compared to the physical&nbsp;books).   1.2 Implementing Scenarios in Blockchain <p>Here’s how these scenarios might get implemented in blockchain.</p><p>For scenario 1 above, the Single-Edition ERC721 described in Article 1 is appropriate.</p><p>Scenario 2 is much richer, leading to several implementation possibilities. Article 1 described how Limited-Edition ERC721 could be used, and Article 2 described how ERC20 could be used. This article will describe a third approach that combines both. But first let’s do some comparison.</p> 1.3 Comparing ERC721&nbsp;andERC20 <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC721 for limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  EC721 Benefits. First, if history of each unique token matters, and its provenance needs to be traced. Second, user experience is decent, since ERC721 wallets explicitly hold ERC721 tokens and render images alongside the ERC721. ERC721 markets have good price discovery for truly non-fungible assets, typically using auctions.  ERC721 Challenges. Limited-edition ERC721 assumes the tokens are non-fungible, even if the actual asset is fungible IP licenses. This makes the pricing problem harder, because it converts an apples-to-apples comparison into an apples-to-oranges one. Then, it can’t use AMMs and other powerful ERC20 price discovery tools. Finally, limited-edition ERC721 doesn’t model who owns the base IP at all, let alone make it easy to&nbsp;manage.  <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC20 for Limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  ERC20 Benefits. First, tokens can go directly in AMMs which allows automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation. Second, tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to loans. Third, base IP is represented by ERC20.owner address, and therefore it can be transferred and&nbsp;managed.  ERC20 Challenges. While base IP can be transferred and managed, tooling doing so is poor. For example, wallets only store the private key for the ERC20.owner address; it doesn’t show up as a&nbsp;token.  <p>Here’s the key takeaways. First, the benefits of one are roughly the challenges for the other. Second, neither does well in managing base IP. It’s nonexistent for ERC721 and poor for ERC20. Yet managing base IP is extremely important! We want to make it easy for people to sell base IP, have multiple revenue streams against it, link it with physical objects and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;How <p>This section describes at a high level how to combine the benefits of ERC721 and ERC20, and better manage base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The basic idea is to tokenize the base IP and tokenize sub-licenses against it. Let’s bring in specific token standards.</p>  Base IP is non-fungible, so ERC721 is a good way to represent it.  Fungible IP sub-licenses are best represented by fungible token standard ERC20. And, we generalize this to multiple revenue streams against the base IP; some use ERC20, some may use ERC721, and others may use other standards or fully custom approaches [1]. A “good default” is simply&nbsp;ERC20.   1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;Benefits <p>This leads to benefits at a high level, benefits from ERC721, and benefits from ERC20. Here are high-level benefits:</p>  Simple mental model non-fungible base IP → non-fungible token standard, and fungible IP licenses → fungible standard.  Enables multiple revenue streams against the base IP, with different sub-licenses. For example, a book might have a kindle version, softcover print version, and hardcover print version&nbsp;[8].  <p>Base IP inherits benefits of&nbsp;ERC721:</p>  Direct wallet support for base IP. Render images, transfer base IP, versus just holding the private key for ERC20.owner  Sell base IP in marketplaces focusing on ERC721 NFTs, with corresponding price discovery tuned for ERC721. E.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>  Easier to link physical objects with base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.wisekey.com/press/wisekey-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-launch-trustednft-io-a-decentralized-marketplace-for-objects-of-value-designed-to-empower-artists-creators-and-collectors-with-a-unique-solution-for-the-auth/">WISeKey chips in paintings, linked directly to&nbsp;NFTs</a>  Tools to fractionalize ownership of base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.org/">Niftex</a> tool. This allows co-ownership of base IP, such as <a href="https://www.vita-dao.io/">VitaDAO</a> for drug discovery data  <p>Fungible IP sub-licenses inherit benefits of&nbsp;ERC20:</p>  Fungible IP tokens can go directly in AMMs, for automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation.  Fungible IP tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to&nbsp;loans.  <p>This combines the UX benefits of ERC721 with the fungibility benefits of ERC20. ERC20 doesn’t have to be limited-edition either; for example ERC20 tokens (licenses) could be minted on-the-fly.</p><p>At Ocean Protocol for V3, we built an ERC20-based IP framework. We’re now working on ERC721+ERC20 for Ocean&nbsp;V4.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC721+ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 + ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions   To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self, and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata follows<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721"> ERC721Metadata extension</a>. Then, use ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing. The ERC20 can be linked to ERC721 in one of many&nbsp;ways.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [6]. For legals, T&amp;C states that owning ≥1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. Those sub-license rights associated with the given ERC20 contract, not the ERC721 contract.  Base IP: represented by the tuple of {ERC721 deployment, tokenId}.  Base IP holder: represented by the owner of the address at ERC721.owners[tokenId].  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.   2.2 ERC20 + ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC721._safeMint() to claim the base IP, which sets the value at ERC721._owner[tokenId=7] is set to addressP. Then the publisher calls ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint() to mint 3 sub-license tokens with addressP as initial owner; this sets the value at ERC20.owner to addressP, and ERC20.balances value at key addressP is set to&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Step ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract, and work exactly like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling ERC721.safeTransferFrom() which changes ERC721.owners[tokenId=x] to a new&nbsp;address.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 ERC20 + ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The two images below illustrate.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners[tokenId=7] value is addressP, meaning the publisher is the base IP holder. The ERC20._balances attribute holds one entry with key addressP and value 3.0, meaning the publisher holds three sub-licenses.</p><p>The ERC20 can link to the ERC721 in one of many ways. In this example, we riff on ERC20 Ownable mixin with an NftOwnable mixin, replacing ERC20.owner with ERC20.nftOwner that points to the NFT tuple {ERC721 address, tokenId}. Ability to mint ERC20 tokens and other permissions that Ownable gave to the address at ERC20.owner now go to the address at ERC721._owners[tokenId].</p><p>Steps ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract. They only change ERC20._balances variables just like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps. ERC721 state is not&nbsp;changed.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Structure Diagram, steps&nbsp;1–4<p>When ❺ is complete, base IP has been transferred. ERC721.owners[tokenId=7] now holds the value address3 (not shown). The address3 owner now controls ERC20 minting and other permissions.</p>ERC721+ERC20: Structure Diagram, step&nbsp;5 3. Conclusion <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard.</p><p>This article connected IP to ERC721+ERC20 Solidity implementations, and how it combines the benefits of ERC721 and of ERC20 individually.</p> 4. Appendix: Related Approaches  4.1 NFT&nbsp;Vaults <p>This is another approach represent base IP &amp; fractional licenses. Start with ERC20 setup of article 2, but put the private key that owns ERC20.owner attribute into an NFT “vault” using <a href="https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/nfwallets-recErbcXq0xNSP8zX">NFwallets</a>, <a href="https://charged.fi/">Charged Particles</a>, or <a href="https://circuitsofvalue.com/">emblem.vault</a>.</p><p>This seems simple at first glance. However, each ERC20’s owner would be represented by a different NFT, which causes ambiguity if only one of those NFTs is transferred. Also, the workflow to publish is clumsier. Finally, the overall mental model is more complex, which hinders adoptability.</p> 4.2 Fractional ownership of&nbsp;ERC721 <p>Base IP can have fractional ownership. Here’s a traditional example: a company holds a patent, and that company has 10 shareholders. Each shareholder therefore has fractional ownership of the base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Standards like <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1633">EIP1633</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2981">EIP2981</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3601">EIP3601</a>, and tools like Niftex allow one to shard ownership of an ERC721 token, where ERC20 tokens represent the fraction of ownership into the ERC721 token. That’s highly useful to shard ownership for base IP, including the setup in this article where base IP is represented by&nbsp;ERC721.</p><p>The main goal of this article is to contemplate representing ERC20 as fungible IP license against ERC721 base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>In short, there are (at least) two complementary ways to use ERC20 in relation to ERC721: ERC20 to shard an ERC721 token, and ERC20 for fungible IP licenses against base ERC721 IP. This article focuses on the&nbsp;latter.</p><p>Interestingly, by using ERC20 for fungible IP licenses, we get fractional ownership of these IP licenses (if decimals &gt; 0, which is usually the&nbsp;case).</p> Acknowledgements <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series acknowledges the many people that have helped towards the whole series, including this article. Thank you&nbsp;again!</p> Notes <p>[1] Having base IP represented as ERC721 tokens is general enough to allow monetization beyond basic ERC20 IP sub-license datatokens. For example, have Superfluid ERC20 datatokens for streaming payments in C2D or subscriptions. Or, have ERC721 IP sub-licenses. Basically anything, since they just point to the&nbsp;ERC721.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">NFTs &amp; IP 3: Combining ERC721 &amp; ERC20</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<br>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/35">first upgrade</a> to the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> smart contracts which make up Urbit ID was
put up to an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade proposal vote</a> by the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate/">Galactic Senate</a>. This vote is still open and will
last for 30 days (June 20th) or until an absolute majority is reached. We’d like
to take this opportunity to discuss two things. <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#changelist">First</a>, what the
proposed changes are, and <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">second</a>, a review of how Urbit governance
works and where we’re at in the decentralization process.</p>
<p>Before we dive into what the proposed changes are, let’s review what the Senate
is actually capable of changing. Urbit ID is really two sets of smart contracts:
Azimuth and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ecliptic/">Ecliptic</a>. Azimuth is the data of the
public key infrastructure - roughly, this is the list of
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> and which Ethereum addresses own them, along
with other data such as networking keys and sponsorship status. The Senate has
no ability to touch this data directly. This is in direct contrast to all
existing centralized services, where your account is always at risk of being
taken away from you. What the Senate can change is Ecliptic, which is the
“business logic” that decides how you can interact with the data in Azimuth.
These are mechanisms such as what powers various
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a> have, how stars/planets are released over
time, and how sponsorship works. Put another way, the data and database format
must remain the same, but the rules by which we interact with it may change
according to the governance rules we <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">detail below</a>.</p>
 Changelist 
<p>The Galactic Senate is voting on the following changes to Ecliptic: </p>
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility  
 Self-modifying proxies  
 Upgraded Claims contract 
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility 
<p>In Ecliptic, the contract includes various functions and events
that make it conform to the ERC721 (non-fungible token) standard. However, two
events have <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/issues/8">ever so slightly
non-confirming</a> descriptions. This
causes Ethereum explorers like Etherscan to incorrectly recognize Azimuth as
ERC20 (fungible token), rather than ERC721.</p>
<p>The proposed change simply modifies the event descriptions to accurately match
the ERC721 definition. This does not affect any functionality within the
contract itself.</p>
 Self-modifying proxies 
<p>Owners of Azimuth assets are allowed to configure "proxy addresses" for those
assets: Ethereum addresses allowed to act "as" the owner, but only for a subset
of operations. For example, setting the management proxy will let you change
your networking keys and sponsor using that address, just like your ownership
address can. This is useful for keeping the ownership keys in very cold storage
while still letting you perform lower-value operations.</p>
<p>Currently, only the ownership address is allowed to change proxy addresses.
Fairly early on after Azimuth's deployment, we realized it might be nice for
proxies to be able to change themselves.</p>
<p>This means that, in addition to being able to configure networking keys and
sponsorship, your management proxy would be able to assign a new management
proxy. This would allow you, or a trusted third party holding your management proxy,
to rotate your proxy keys without needing to take your ownership keys out of cold
storage.</p>
 Upgraded Claims contract 
<p><a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/blob/master/contracts/Claims.sol">The Claims
contract</a>
lets asset managers associate various "claims" with their identity. For
example, an Ethereum address to send donations to, or proving ownership of a
Twitter account.</p>
<p>For ease of use by off-chain tools and services, the contract emits events
(notifications) whenever any claims are updated. However, the current version of
the contract has a bug where it does not emit events when all claims are removed
at once (clearClaims()). This "gap" in the event stream makes it much more
difficult to write off-chain tools around this contract. Considering Claims has
seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a#events">practically no
use</a>
since it was first deployed, it should not be a problem to simply start over
fresh with a new contract that contains <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/32">the
fix</a> for the described bug.</p>
<p>The reason we must do an Ecliptic upgrade to switch to a new Claims contract, is
that it is tied in with the logic for transferring an asset. If an asset is
flagged for "reset" (common when transferring to/from someone other than
yourself), its configured proxies, networking keys and claims are cleared during
transfer. As such, Ecliptic will need to know about the address of the new
Claims contract.</p>
 Urbit Governance 
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Urbit is to become a digital republic manifested as a peer
to peer network owned and controlled by its users. The goal of Tlon, then, is to
become one of many companies who build products for Urbit rather than being the primary
driving force behind its development. We’d like to take this opportunity to
spell out our perspective on where we’re at in that process. Here are some previous posts that are relevant, but please note that
some of them are several years old and as such may not accurately reflect our
current position, but still serve as useful historical markers. We hope to
revisit and refresh these documents soon. </p>

 Galactic Senate 
<p>The Galactic Senate is composed of all <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">galaxy</a>
holders, which at present consists of more than 100 individuals and a few
organizations, including Tlon and the Urbit Foundation. Using the Azimuth
voting contract, the Senate can present and vote on two kinds of proposals:
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/docvote/">document proposals</a> and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade
proposals</a>. Thus far, all matters which the Senate
has voted on have been document proposals. The <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/34">most recent
vote</a> declared the Urbit network as
(i) being secure (as confirmed by a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/security-audit/">third party
audit</a>) and (ii) having reached continuity (as in, no
further <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/breach/">network breaches</a> are expected). Previous votes
were to declare that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/25">Azimuth is live</a>
and that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/24">Arvo is stable</a>.</p>
 Address space distribution 
<p>Perhaps the most informative measure of how decentralized Urbit is in terms of
how many independent parties hold address space. By the very nature of Urbit, it
is impossible to know this with great accuracy (a common feature of
decentralized projects). However, the movement of galaxies is closely watched
and thus we have a fairly good idea of how distributed they are.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Urbit’s creator Curtis Yarvin was in possession of the entire
address space - all 256 galaxies, and everything underneath it. A network of one
is no network at all, and so over the last decade Urbit’s development has been
primarily driven by selling or giving away these galaxies. On <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-urbit-address-space/">June 1,
2016</a>, the allocation was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95, to the Tlon Corporation. 50, to urbit.org, the future community
foundation. 40, to Tlon employees and their family members (24 to Curtis, who
started in 2002; 16 to everyone else, who started in 2014). 34, to outside
investors in Tlon. 37, to 33 other individuals, who donated to the project,
contributed code or services, won a contest, or were just in the right place
at the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, Tlon has sold a number of
its galaxies to fund development and others have changed hands to the point
that Tlon and urbit.org no longer possess a majority share of galaxies. In
January 2019, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell/">Curtis gave all of his galaxies</a> to
Tlon when he left the project. In August 2020 we shared an update on the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/value-of-address-space-pt3/">known
distribution of address space</a>, where
Curtis’ galaxies are marked as Tlon’s “naked galaxies”. Shortly thereafter, Tlon
disbursed its naked galaxies among the employees that wanted one who did not
already possess one, thus removing Tlon and urbit.org’s controlling share of the
Senate. Galaxies held by current and former Tlon employees are entirely
independent of Tlon Corporation—they may do with them, and vote with them, as
they please. <code>~ravmel-ropdyl</code> plans to give more color to this decision in the
near future.</p>
<p>Distribution of stars is much more difficult to know. There is an active market
for stars on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id">OpenSea</a>, so we know that
they are changing hands frequently, but checking the number of distinct Ethereum
addresses that hold stars does not tell you very much information since a single person can control multiple adresses.</p>
 Software and smart contracts 
<p>As was written in <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">The DAO as a Lesson in Decentralized
Governance</a>,
we are keenly aware of the threat of decentralization theater. Urbit has
undergone steady progress towards decentralization, and with the developments we
outline below, it’s never been more clear that the project is beginning to leave
the cradle of Tlon. It’s also important to note that the decentralization of a
project is always a movement away from an initial centralized state⁠—you cannot
go from A to Z without first traversing every letter in between. While Urbit was
centralized at the beginning, the journey towards a network owned and
controlled by the users is now well underway.</p>
<p>In the past, nearly all Urbit software was written by Tlon. While Tlon is still
the only corporation actively updating Urbit’s MIT-licensed open source
software, namely <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> (the runtime),
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a> (the kernel),
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/landscape/">Landscape</a> (the client), and
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/bridge/">Bridge</a> (the ID manager), unaffiliated individuals have been making enormous contributions to Urbit over the past couple of years via the <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/history">grants program</a>. Recent examples include the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4940">Bitcoin node and wallet integration</a>, <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/21131866-webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app">WebRTC integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arthyn/port">Port, an Urbit installer and ship manager</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4820"><code>|fuse</code>, an important primitive for 3rd party software distribution</a>.</p>
<p>The only real power Tlon holds over Urbit is the ability to push <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> via <code>~zod</code>, and suggest that people
download our binaries. To the best of our knowledge, all extant galaxies
retrieve their OTA updates from <code>~zod</code>, who forward it to their stars, who
forward it to their planets. This software distribution route is merely a
convenient default setting. Ships initially retrieve OTA updates from their
sponsor, but they have full authority to retrieve updates from whoever they want
with the <code>|ota</code> command, or even to only install software updates by hand if
they so choose.</p>
<p>In the future, one can easily imagine many organizations shipping their own
distributions of Urbit from their own urbit nodes, somewhat analogously to the
large number of Linux distributions which exist today. There is nothing we can
do to stop a group from forking Urbit, declaring <code>~sampel-palnet</code> the new <code>~zod</code>
(both for updates and for sponsorship purposes), and retrieving all OTA updates
via that route and building their own binaries. This is all by design, and we
wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>The use of the Azimuth smart contracts is also somewhat optional. By changing a
few lines of code to point their ships at another set of PKI smart contracts,
they could rid themselves of hierarchical peer discovery entirely and make use
of some other routing strategy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia based DHT
routing</a>. This would likely give rise to
an entirely separate network. The fact that the network is fully capable of such
a schism helps keep the Senate honest and accountable to the users. If they ever
were to vote on a contract modification that greatly angered or upset a portion
of the user base, they would be inviting such a schism and be entirely deserving
of it. In that sense, the power to control the network is already held by the
users, they just have not yet had a reason to make use of it.</p>
 Legitimacy 
<p>The only way by which Tlon and the Senate hold any power is via legitimacy.
Vitalik Buterin recently wrote a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">very informative
article</a> on the role of
legitimacy in decentralized governance, and I do not know of a better source to
understand how Tlon and the Senate are kept in check by the users. Besides the
DAO split resulting in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic mentioned in the article,
perhaps the most prominent example of the power users have over a decentralized
network is the saga of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power">Steem and Justin
Sun</a>.
The short version of the story is that Justin Sun bought a controlling share of
the Steem blockchain and attempted to exert control over it, and the users
banded together to fork the blockchain into one called Hive, which was identical
to Steem except with Sun’s token balance set to zero. An analogous outcome for
Urbit would be that the Senate makes sweeping changes to the PKI and invites a
schism like that outlined above.</p>
<p>For these reasons, there are strong disincentives for any one organization or
individual to acquire too many galaxies. If galaxy ownership becomes more centralized, individuals will be less incentivized to build on the network which will reduce the value of address space. Furthermore, such centralization might provoke a fork if such centralized powers are perceived as malicious by the users. This is in contrast to real-life republics, where there is little risk
for one party to accumulate as much power as they can manage since the cost to
the citizens to overthrow that power is enormous. Thus, only especially
egregious displays of power ever result in rebellion. Within the Urbit republic,
users need only to change the code they run to leave the Senate powerless, and
so the threat of rebellion is much more real. We estimate that within a digital
republic like Urbit, the centrifugal forces outweigh the centripetal forces, and
that the outcome of this is more stable than the reverse.</p>
 Why have governance at all? 
<p>An important question the reader may still have lingering is: why does Urbit
need governance at all? The short answer is: (i) there will always be necessary
protocol upgrades that cannot be foreseen, and (ii) a total lack of governance
inevitably gives rise to a shadow government with undefined powers that is
almost impossible to hold accountable.</p>
<p>With (ii), we see this to be the case on many early blockchain projects where
power is shared by the developers and the miners, but what each is capable of
doing has never been codified, and thus users of the blockchain can never have a
great deal of certainty of what changes might occur in the future. This doesn’t
guarantee a bad outcome, but it does create more wariness among developers when they cannot know whether they really have a say in
the project's direction. Recognizing this issue, many newer blockchain and
blockchain-adjacent projects have built-in governance mechanisms that lay out
exactly what an individual can expect should they join and contribute to that
network.</p>
<p>As for (i), with Urbit being a wholly new kind of network, it would take
incredible luck to get the PKI exactly right on the very
first try without ever needing another modification. Thus, some mechanism was
needed to guarantee that the PKI’s logic could be altered. Leaving control of
Azimuth in the hands of Tlon would have just granted Tlon dictatorial power, which Tlon nor Urbit users desired. There’s certainly
room to argue that the Galactic Senate is not a perfect system: our interim
constitution did outline potential roles for stars and planets to play in
governance in the future, so there is ample opportunity for the system to evolve
in response to the will of the users. As always, it is important to keep in mind
the unfinished nature of the Urbit of today and the still moldable clay of the
Urbit of tomorrow⁠—nothing yet is set in stone.</p>

<p>A lot of what I've shared recently has been about Holo hosting -- getting all the bits really robust so they handle both 'happy path' user interactions (everything is working as expected) and 'sad path' ones (HoloPort goes down, login fails, etc). But I haven't spent much time talking about how Holochain itself is improving -- and when I have, it's usually been about bugfixes to support the aforementioned Holo work.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Holochain has been getting some big upgrades to some of its parts. This is mainly to make it faster -- fast enough for the next stages of Elemental Chat testing. (And of course, Elemental Chat testing is really about Holo hosting and Holochain.)</p> LMDB to SQLite: the road to infinite scalability <p>A lot of peer-to-peer networks, from decentralised social networks like <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> to blockchains like Bitcoin, are built on something called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip protocol</a>'. It's a simple protocol, and it works like it sounds like it would work: I know a bunch of people (or rather, computers), and when one of my friends shares something with me I share it with everyone else I know. With this protocol, messages spread rapidly through networks without a central authority.</p><p>And it also creates a lot of network traffic. That might be fine for blockchains, in which every machine is online most of the time and needs to know about everything anyway. But for networks that power everyday applications, you want to be respectful of your users' bandwidth -- and you can't expect their machines to be on all the time either. (Even blockchains tweak gossip to make it more efficient.)</p><p>Holochain is based on the idea of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">'neighbourhoods' of authority</a> -- each piece of data gets an address, and it's only sent to a group of machines that have taken responsibility for the range of addresses that cover its address. That means traditional gossip is too chatty -- as an authority, you need to constantly make decisions about what to share with your neighbours, given that they aren't responsible for the exact same range that you are.</p><p>It gets more complicated when machines are turning on and off all the time (which happens a lot when they're just users' devices). A machine that's been offline for a while will want to get up to date with the latest gossip, and will ask its peers for a digest of new stuff since they were last online.</p><p>This means you have to be able to ask your own database questions like "which of my neighbours' responsibility ranges start before, and end after, address <code>531993928</code>?" and "what new data have I collected within my neighbour Alice's responsibility range <code>112513216</code> to <code>241661317</code> since yesterday morning at 08:37 UTC?" These sorts of questions, called range queries, are really hard for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database">key/value database</a> like <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">LMDB</a> to answer, but they're really easy for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> like <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>.</p><p>Because all data in Holochain is just keys (addresses) and values attached to those keys, LMDB initially made sense -- it was much faster than any relational database out there when it came to key/value lookups, as well as being gentle on CPU and RAM. But as the core developers started looking at <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">sharding</a>, it became obvious that the large amount of range queries would hurt performance unacceptably if they stuck with LMDB.</p><p>As a side bonus, SQLite also makes it possible for us to encrypt source chain and DHT data at rest using <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher</a>. (Note: this doesn't prevent you from reading your peers' published data -- that's not how Holochain works. But it does prevent an attacker from stealing it if they gain access to your computer.)</p> Other gossip upgrades <p>As mentioned, when machines come back online after being offline for a while, the catching-up process has been pretty network-heavy. Now when it happens, machines <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">compare their lists</a> of held data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>. This technique results in more back-and-forth messages between nodes but less data being exchanged overall. This is already speeding up syncing, even though sharding is yet to be introduced.</p> New versions of Wasmer and Rust <p><a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> engine we're using to run the 'rules' of a Holochain app, is now at version 1.0, so we've <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/801">upgraded it</a>. It comes with better memory management, a faster compiler and runtime, and a bunch of bug fixes. It also lets us compile and run Holochain on ARM CPUs like the HoloPort Nano.</p><p>Wasmer 1.0 will also let us implement compute metering for Holo hosting, as well as runtime budgets to prevent infinite loops from <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/">chewing up all of a host's CPU capacity</a>.</p><p>A new version of the Rust programming language has been released as well, so we've upgraded Holochain to use that too.</p><p>As a side effect, macOS developers are now first-class citizens again -- these updates plus some bugfixes have <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/pull/212">resolved</a> the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/issues/211">macOS build issues</a> for Holonix, our development environment.</p> What's next? <p>Wasmer 1.0 and Rust 1.52 have already been integrated into Holochain, and they'll be rolled out along with the SQLite update. Expect to see faster install times soon too; we're researching automated build servers for Holonix so you don't have to wait an hour for everything to compile!</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/767">work of integrating SQLite is done</a>, and the slower performance of key/value lookups is more than offset by the faster performance of range queries. It's currently being tested on a single HoloPort with an automated Elemental Chat test involving 20 hosted users and one self-hosted instance, which has revealed a bug related to clogged processing queues. If there are no other show-stopper bugs, it'll replace the current LMDB-based Holochain on all HoloPorts soon.</p><p>Now that this work is almost ready, the core devs have been able to work on sharding the DHT. So far it's been 'full-sync', which means everybody stores everything, a lot like a blockchain. This is good for redundancy but bad for performance (although community testers have been consistently talking about how fast Elemental Chat already is). So far they've completed about half of the tasks involved in sharding.</p><p>Sharding has always been part of our promise to make dApps fast and scalable, so I'm excited to see this happening.</p> Reminder: Register for Dev Camp! <p>The next community-led <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Dev Camp is starting at the end of June</a>. The project you'll be working on, a game called Tragedy of the Holocommons, will help you understand how to design an app that works well without a single source of truth. I think it's a brilliant idea.</p><p>Dev Camps are still free, and they’re run by a fantastic and knowledgeable group of volunteers.</p><p>The Holochain developer community is growing, along with the ecosystem of learning materials and open-source libraries, tools, and apps.

<p>Nacha’s WEB (meaning internet-initiated entry) debit compliance rules are designed to protect both the ACH network and your company from rising ACH fraud. The <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">Association of Finance Professionals</a> (AFP) 2020 Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report found that 81% of businesses were targets of payments fraud and 55% of businesses were directly impacted by ACH fraud, with 33% of that fraud from ACH debits and 22% from ACH credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud usually occurs when a criminal accesses a customer’s account and submits an unauthorized ACH transaction. In the past, all a criminal needed was an account number and a bank routing number. How many abandoned checkbooks might be floating around in the landfill, waiting for an eager fraudster?</p>
<p>With a third of businesses falling victim to ACH WEB debit fraud, it’s no wonder Nacha is updating its rules to protect both the ACH network and your company.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Nacha WEB Debit Compliance Rules? 
<p>Nacha has established operating rules that keep the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH network</a> secure. As part of those operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries must use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to screen those debit transactions for fraud. What that detection system specifically looks like has been largely up to the businesses initiating ACH transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nacha <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">has recently augmented this requirement</a> and now specifically requires that the “fraudulent transaction detection system” includes account validation. Under the new rule, an account must be validated with the first use of the account number, or after any changes to the account number. This updated rule aims to cut down on the WEB debit fraud that continues to climb.</p>
 When Do Businesses Need to Be in Compliance? 
<p>Nacha had originally set January 1, 2020, as the effective date for the new WEB debit rule. The Board of Directors then approved an extension to March 19, 2021 to allow businesses to educate themselves and implement the new processes. As of now, the WEB debit rule is in effect. Originators of WEB debit payments have one year from the effective date of the rule to implement an account validation solution.</p>
 How Can You Ensure Your Payments Are Compliant? 
<p>To be compliant with Nacha’s WEB debit rule, your payment solution must include some form of account validation. This validation can take several Nacha-approved forms:</p>
 
 Prenotification entry: The payment originator sends a zero-dollar entry through the ACH network to the account several days prior to the live entry. 
 Micro-deposit verification: Small amounts—usually between a couple cents and a dollar—are sent to an account and must be verified by the account holder. 
 Instant account validation: The customer provides consent to access their account information, ideally through a direct API connection to the customer’s financial institution. Of these verification methods, instant account validation delivers the most accurate information in real time and doesn’t rely on the customer manually keying their account and routing information. They simply log in to their account and provide consent for the validation. 
 
<p>Nacha also notes that companies may leverage other validation means. For example, proving that an account has a reliable history of prior successful payments may act as a sufficient validation. Ultimately, Nacha recognizes that every company’s position and situation is unique, and so determining whether an account validation method is “commercially reasonable” will differ, and each company should consult their own attorneys, risk department, or other advisors to ensure the validation method is compliant.</p>
 How Finicity’s Instant Account Verification Prevents Fraud and Enables A Better User Experience 
<p>Through our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a><a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/"></a>&nbsp;solution set, we offer instant account validation that satisfies Nacha’s updated WEB debit rule and provides additional valuable data to improve the experience and efficiency of ACH payments. Our instant account validation enables money movers to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner verification, and balance checks to streamline and secure ACH payments. And with easy and fast consumer permissioning, our validation solution empowers consumers to benefit from their own data to have better financial services experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to validating account information, the consumer-permissioned data Fincity’s open banking platform provides can be used to check balances prior to processing payments to avoid fees and returns due to insufficient funds. It can also support Know Your Customer (KYC) by providing the name and address of the account owner on file at the financial institution. While this data is useful for payments, it can also be leveraged in account opening, digital wallet or prepaid card funding, or other use cases where similar information is needed.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Nacha has named Finicity a Preferred Partner, which guarantees that our validation solution aligns with Nacha’s core strategies to advance the ACH networks. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">According to Nacha</a>, those who are preferred partners:</p>

<p>What are push attacks? Push attacks are used by malicious actors whose goal is to get past mobile push-based multi-factor authentication (MFA). The malicious actor spams the victim with notifications to authenticate until they are fatigued and finally accept it. When deployed on a mass scale, even a low success rate of <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-2-factor-authentication-isnt-foolproof/">less than 3% is significant.</a></p>
      
<p>Push attacks are a growing concern among security experts, and many of today’s MFA solutions offer push authentication as a form of MFA. That’s why the latest HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12 offers a technology preview of QR code login.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>No Passwords, No Push, Just Scan QR to Log In</p>
      
 HYPR’s QR Code Login 
      
<p>6.12 now enables users to log into their SSO-managed web apps by scanning a QR code with the HYPR App or camera on their smartphone.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is a passwordless MFA alternative in situations where push notifications to the mobile device aren’t available, or undesirable from a security standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Before partnering with HYPR, a higher education customer struggled to secure their 3,500-person University campus with their existing password-based login and potential push-related security risks. Push fatigue inadvertently allowed access to another user who correctly guessed the victim’s username and spammed their account for a push authentication.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is impactful because it prevents push fatigue and its potential for push attacks. It gives more control to the end-user as they initiate their authentication by scanning the code rather than waiting for a push notification to arrive on their smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Device pairing is still required to register a trusted device, so the QR code will only prompt the user to verify their identity with their registered device.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12</p>
      
<p>In addition to QR code login, another notable update includes our API Endpoint Security Enhancement feature. This feature further improves the overall security posture across components of the HYPR Cloud Platform by passing an encrypted token to the HYPR Server when making internal API calls.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>To learn more about what 6.12 has to offer, read our latest release notes for <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/installinghypr/docs/workforce-access-6120">Workforce Access 6.12</a> and <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/integratinghypr/docs/customer-authentication-6120">Customer Authentication 6.12</a>.

 Representing Intellectual Property rights via ERC20 for AMM-based price discovery and&nbsp;more  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard. This article focuses on the ERC20 fungible token standard for blockchain * IP, and describes how it helps price discovery and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Article 3</a> links ERC721 &amp;&nbsp;ERC20.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Fungibility &amp; Price Discovery <p>Apple-apple. If you have two identical apples side by side, and one sells for $0.75, then you can readily establish the price of the other apple as $0.75. You can swap them for each other and it doesn’t matter. That is, they’re fungible. With gold, one ounce of can be swapped for another; it’s fungible. Same for TSLA stock. Same for Bitcoin. Same for ERC20 tokens (fungible token standard).</p><p>Apple-orange. If you have an apple and an orange side-by-side, and the apple sells for $2, you still don’t have much information to price the orange. The apple and orange can’t be swapped for each other. They’re non-fungible. This makes them harder to price. An ounce of gold can’t be swapped for an ounce of silver; it’s non-fungible. A one-of-a-kind painting can’t be swapped with another painting; it’s non-fungible. Same for ERC721 tokens (non-fungible token standard).</p><p>Price discovery. Of the two scenarios above, it’s easier to price apples to apples, rather than apples to oranges, because “apples to apples” are fungible. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this: fungibility greatly helps price discovery. It’s easier to price ERC20 tokens <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1353091225897869312">than ERC721</a>&nbsp;[1].</p> 1.2 Fungible IP&nbsp;Licenses <p>When a publisher prints a book, they print thousands or millions of copies. Coming off the press, each of those copies can be swapped for another. They’re fungible.</p><p>Open up a book to one of the first pages and you’ll find information about the place of publication, and what printing round it was. Importantly, you’ll also see the well-known copyright © symbol, and the name of the base IP rights holder. This matters because the physical copy of that book includes a license to use that copyrighted material, that base IP. Holding that book in your hands gives you physical access to use that IP. A printed book includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>If you rent a movie from Amazon Prime, you’re getting a license to the IP of that movie, that base IP. You get digital access to it for 48 hours. Over time, millions of people may rent that movie, i.e. license that base IP. A rented movie includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>Consider a weather station recording temperature, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and air pressure over years. The weather station owners hold this dataset as IP, and license it to thousands of weather-prediction agencies throughout the world. Each license is just like the other licenses. A weather data license is a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>There are plenty more examples in music, video games, photographs, and more. It goes beyond copyright IP; it happens for trademark IP and patent IP as well, anytime there is more than one swappable license.</p><p>Fungible IP licenses may have limited or unlimited editions. Limited edition use cases are around collectibles and the art world. Unlimited edition use cases include licensing stock photos, renting movies, buying e-books, and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.2 ERC20&nbsp;Standard <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a> is a fungible token standard. It’s the most popular standard for tokens, fungible or otherwise.</p><p>Most crypto wallets support ERC20. AMM DEXes exploit ERC20 fungibility property for price discovery, to great success: they now have have billions in daily volume. It’s not just for exchanges; the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance"> DeFi</a> community has developed tools for loans, stablecoins, insurance and more, all around ERC20. Even many non-Ethereum chains support&nbsp;ERC20.</p><p>If one wants to tokenize fungible assets, ERC20 is a good&nbsp;choice.</p> 1.3 Fungible IP Licenses via&nbsp;ERC20 <p>IP licenses can be fungible; and ERC20 is the leading fungible token standard. Then, ERC20 is a logical choice to represent fungible IP licenses. The NFT<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70"> field</a> uses it accordingly; let’s review some examples.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_%28musician%29">RAC’s</a><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape"> $TAPE</a> token is an example using ERC20. Here, 1.0 TAPE tokens are used to<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-democratization-of-value"> redeem</a> a music license in a cassette medium.<a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc85cdd3240385af9958ef99bc2ff0c4de5640bcb"> TAPE is on Uniswap AMM</a>, enabling price discovery to around <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4K per token</a> these&nbsp;days.</p><p><a href="https://unisocks.exchange/">$SOCKS</a> is another example, where SOCKS tokens redeem a pair of socks. Or, <a href="https://www.saintfame.com/fame">$FAME</a> and<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/introducing-bankless-apparel"> $BAP</a> are used to redeem t-shirts. While the focus is on the physical artifact, each has an associated copyright design. AMM price discovery has led to a single $SOCKS edition hitting $164K, and $thousands for $FAME and $BAP. These are exciting use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The above are example one-off tokens. <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> scales this, as a platform that makes it easy to publish, stake/swap and redeem<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837"> ERC20 tokens for IP</a> with appropriate<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> legals</a>. It uses<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3"> AMMs for price discovery, liquidity, and curation</a>. Ocean Market is a reference marketplace; more than a dozen teams have forked its Apache2 frontend code to make their own blockchain IP markets for their own&nbsp;niche.</p> 1.4 *Non* Fungible IP Licenses &amp;&nbsp;ERC20 <p>In the book example above, the author got copyright for their book committing their creative writing to paper. The author could then print many copies of the book themselves, as fungible licenses. However, printing books may not be the author’s forte. So they’d typically do an exclusive license of the base IP to the publishing house; then, the house prints the books as fungible sub-licenses.</p><p>Same for music. The musician could license their works directly to their thousands of listeners. Traditionally this has been hard, so musicians would typically do an exclusive license of the base IP (“master tape”) then the label would do fungible sub-licensing to listeners etc. The exclusive licensee takes over the rights that the copyright holder had initially.</p><p>ERC20 has a means to represent the owner of this base IP (copyright / exclusive license): the address that controls ERC20.owner [4]. We elaborate below.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP <p>This section describes how ERC20 code-level behavior maps to an IP framing. To emphasize similarity to the limited-edition ERC721 approach given in the first article, here we use an example on limited-edition ERC20 (vs. unlimited edition; without loss of generality).</p> 2.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition ERC20s means there are several licenses (editions) for the same base IP. Here’s how to implement.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC20.constructor(), and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata is stored as an<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1046.md"> extension to ERC20</a> or in a<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/metadata/Metadata.sol"> separate contract</a>. Then, ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [2]. For legals, the T&amp;C states that owning 1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. In deploying the ERC20, one could set decimals=0 to represent exactly 1 license always. Even better, if we set decimals=18 we allow fractional ownership of licenses [3], and enable the token to work for AMMs, loans, etc (a big&nbsp;plus).  Base IP: represented by the ERC20 address from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: Stored in ERC20.owner. This means that ERC20 gives a convenient way to identify the base IP&nbsp;holder.  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.  <p>It’s important that the tokens of a given ERC20 contract can only redeem a single type of license / item, otherwise it inadvertently replaces the semantic meaning of the ERC20 token itself (“it’s a license”) with simply being a unit-of-exchange token.</p> 2.2 Limited-Edition ERC20: Management of Base&nbsp;IP <p>ERC20 tokens themselves are for management of IP licenses. Interestingly, the setup supports managing the underling base IP (copyright or exclusive license). Here’s&nbsp;how.</p><p>First, recall that base IP ownership is stored in a state variable (ERC20.owner). So, one can transfer base IP ownership by changing its value to a new address via<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a>. Base IP ownership is fractional when a multisig wallet or DAO controls the address. Value can accrue to base IP before any licenses are created, ie before ERC20 tokens are minted. To monetize with &gt;1 license types (e.g. e-book vs print book), create one ERC20 contract for each license type, each with the same base&nbsp;IP.</p> 2.3 Limited-Edition ERC20: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC20.constructor() method to claim the base IP, then ERC20.mint() to mint 3 tokens with addressP as initial owner. The ERC20’s owner attribute (an address) gets updated to addressP, and its balances attribute (a mapping) gets updated to 3.0 at index addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of one edition, from Publisher to Licensee1 (address1). ERC20.balances gets updated: the value at addressP is decremented by 1.0, and the value at address1 gets set to&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Licensee1 to Licensee2. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Publisher to Licensee3. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a> which changes ERC20.owner to a new address. (Note: this step wasn’t shown for Limited-Edition ERC721 because it’s not possible in that&nbsp;setup.)</p>ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.4 Limited-Edition ERC20: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the value of ERC20.owner is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP holder. ERC20._balances indicates that addressP is the only holder of sub-licenses (3 of&nbsp;them).</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), addressP owner has 2 sub-licenses(from 3) and address1 owner has 1 sub-license (from&nbsp;0).</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then addressP, address2, and address3 owners have 1 sub-license each. The Base IP holder remains addressP&nbsp;owner.</p><p>When Completed ❺, the Base IP holder has changed, to address3 owner (not&nbsp;shown).</p>ERC20: UML Structure Diagram 3. Auto Price Discovery in ERC20&nbsp;IP <p>When ERC20 tokens represent IP licenses, then AMMs and other ERC20 &amp; DeFi tools can help tremendously with automatic price discovery, liquidity and curation. The image below illustrates.</p><p>The ERC20 IP tokens may initially be distributed in an AMM (image: top right), Dutch Auctions,<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq"> LBPs</a>, or any mechanic used for traditional Initial Coin Offerings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering">ICOs</a>). These tokens may go on to secondary markets in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange"> DEXes</a> like AMMs (image: bottom right) or<a href="https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Centralized_Exchanges_%28CEX%29"> CEXes</a>. Being ERC20-based allows for IP index funds (<a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1339534813330628612">example</a>), IP loans, IP-backed stablecoins, and ERC20 DeFi tools applied to&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The DEXes and CEXes naturally allow for automatic price discovery and liquidity. Fees and airdrops incentivize providing liquidity. The amount of liquidity in a particular IP’s pool is a useful curation signal — the more stake the higher the quality of the IP&nbsp;asset.</p>ERC20: Structure Diagram showing automatic price discovery 5.

<p><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/">Write the Docs Portland 2021</a> has concluded, and I wanted to share a couple of key insights and observations from the conference.</p><p>First, it was fun, a wonderfully nice group of people, and a well-organized event. Virtual conferences are new for many events and Write the Docs pulled it off really well.</p> Docs as Code <p>One repeated theme throughout the conference was technical writers embracing git-based workflows. Writers can more easily collaborate with developers when they work on documentation iteratively. Benefits include avoiding a rush to document at the last minute before a release, less out-of-band communication to understand upcoming changes, and less tooling across an organization.</p><p>The cost is that technical writers must learn git, git-based workflows, and plain-text formats, but the benefits are significant, and many writers are learning or already actively using these tools.</p><p>Write the Docs has a page with more information on <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Docs as Code</a>.</p> Evolutionary Documentation <p>One of the more striking talks at the conference was “Always complete, never finished” given by Daniele Procida. The <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/speakers/#speaker-daniele-procida">talk summary</a> states it best:</p><blockquote>an incremental, evolutionary way of working on large documentation tasks that makes every step, from the very first one, a value-adding improvement</blockquote><p>Large documentation refactors taken as a single task can be stressful, time-consuming, and may be out-of-date before they are complete. Instead, documentation can evolve in iterative steps that each improve the overall quality of the documentation.</p><p>Notice the iterative nature of this process and how it relates to Docs as Code. Yes, they are synergistic and work together nicely.</p> Vale: A syntax-aware linter for prose <p>As documentation matures, consistent style and tone grow in importance, and many organizations adopt a style guide or develop their own. While these rules are needed, it can be bothersome and inefficient to need to refer to the style guide manually to keep writing consistent.</p><p>One unconference session was devoted to <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale">Vale</a>, a tool that lints prose based on the rules in a style guide. I love a good code linter, and this tool looks fantastic for prose.</p><p>The Vale ecosystem seems great and includes:</p>  A GitHub action: <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action">GitHub - errata-ai/vale-action: The official GitHub Action for Vale -- install, manage, and run Vale with ease.</a>  A VSCode extension: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server">Vale - Visual Studio Marketplace</a>  Emacs support: <a href="https://github.com/abingham/flycheck-vale">GitHub - abingham/flycheck-vale: Flycheck integration for the vale natural language linter</a>  A nix package: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&amp;show=vale&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=vale">NixOS Search</a>  <p>It can be used on a variety of plain text formats, comments in code in many languages, and some GUI-based tools (with a paid subscription). See the <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/scoping#formats">complete list of supported formats</a>.</p> So Many More <p>These were just a few of the great things from Write the Docs this year, but there were so many more! All of the talks should now be posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ">Write the Docs YouTube channel</a>.</p> <p>Brian is part of the Developer Success team at Fission and spends a lot of time improving our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">guide</a> and making better code examples and other ways to help developers succeed in using Fission.</p>

 Elliptic’s analysis of blockchain transactions reveals that a Hamas-linked terrorist group has received a surge of Bitcoin donations since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza clashes. Over $100,000 in Bitcoin donations have now been received by the Al-Qassam Brigades since January 2019. We show how the transparency of the blockchain allows this activity to be monitored and disrupted.

 Compare and Contrast — IRMA vs Verifiable Credentials IRMA vs&nbsp;VC<p>Self-sovereign identity, the next step in the evolution of identity management, revolves around empowering users to own their identity and control how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Given the many concerns revolving around privacy and data sharing that exist today, SSI is being increasingly seen as a potential solution for secure sharing, privacy, and interoperability in the digital world. As a result, the last few years have seen the development of many systems and frameworks to bring SSI closer to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>In this article, we will be comparing two such SSI-based systems, namely, “I Reveal My Attributes” (IRMA) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p> What is&nbsp;IRMA? <p>IRMA was founded by the Digital Security Research group at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. The aim of this group was to create open, secure, and privacy-friendly systems that would give users complete control over their identity.</p><p>This pilot project was called IRMA and it was based on the Idemix technology.</p><p>Idemix is a public-private key pair where the private key is used by the issuer to sign a credential and the public key is used by the verifier to establish that the credential is signed by the issuer and hence is authentic.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VC in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.   Underlying Cryptography <p>Both IRMA and VCs can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> as their cryptographic foundation, but they use different cryptographic frameworks. While IRMA uses Idemix, many VC implementations rely on the Charm framework.</p><p>Idemix is a Java library while Charm is a Python API that works well for key pairings and signature schemes. The Charm Framework uses a hybrid design that combines mathematical operations in the C language with crypto modules written in high-level languages.</p><p>When you compare the two, Charm is a more advanced crypto framework that supports rapid prototyping. It also reduces the development time and allows the components to be reused. It comes with standard APIs as well that are conducive for digital signatures and encryption.</p> Schemas <p>The schemas used by IRMA and VCs are vastly different too, as VCs use the more popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a type of identifier to enable digital identity. The advantage with DIDs is that it gives users complete control over the usage of verifiable credentials, but the disadvantage is that it lends to the creation of different custom&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Here’s how a VC schema looks&nbsp;like.</p> {<br>  "type": "<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json</a>",<br>  "modelVersion": "1.0",<br>  "id": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T;id=06e126d1-fa44-4882-a243-1e326fbe21db;version=1.0",<br>  "name": "PassportCredentialSchema",<br>  "author": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T",<br>  "authored": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",<br>  "schema": {<br>    "$schema": "<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>",<br>    "description": "Passport",<br>    "type": "object",<br>    "properties": {<br>      "PassportNumber": {<br>        "type": "number",<br>      }<br>       “DateofIssue": {<br>        "type": "date",<br>        }<br>        “FirstName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>         “LastName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>    },<br>    "required": ["passportNumber", “dateofIssue”, “firstName”, “lastName”],<br>    "additionalProperties": false<br>  },<br>  "proof": {<br>      "created": "2019-09-27T06:26:11Z",<br>      "creator": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T#key-1",<br>      "nonce": "0efba23d-2987-4441-998e-23a9d9af79f0",<br>      "signatureValue": "2A7ZF9f9TWMdtgn57Y6dP6RQGs52xg2QdjUESZUuf4J9BUnwwWFNL8vFshQAEQF6ZFBXjYLYNU4hzXNKc3R6y6re",<br>      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018"<br>  }  "proof": {<br>    "type": "RsaSignature2018",<br>    "created": "2020-09-14T21:19:10Z",<br>    "proofPurpose": "authentication",<br>    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",<br>    <br>    "challenge": "1f44d55f-f161-4938-a659-f8026467f126",<br>    "domain": "4jt78h47fh47",<br>    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..kTCYt5      XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVIw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgREEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qq_PbChOMqs LfRoPsnsgxD-WUcX16dUOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPktb3rk-BuQy72IFLN25DYuNzVBAh<br>      4vGHSrQyHUGlcTwLtjPAnKb78"<br>  }<br>} <p>IRMA’s approach to schemas is a stark contrast to VC. It uses a more centralized approach and IRMA has published its schemas on GitHub. Those wanting to create new schemas have to reach out to IRMA and add it to their&nbsp;list.</p><p>IRMA uses such a centralized approach because it finds no immediate need to decentralize the creation of new schemas at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>Here’s how the Schema Manager looks like in&nbsp;IRMA</p> SchemeManager  +-- IssuerName  |   +-- Issues  |   |   +-- CredentialName  |   |       +--- description.xml  |   |       +--- logo.png  |   +-- PublicKeys  |   |   +-- 0.xml  |   |   +-- 1.xml  |   +-- PrivateKeys (need not be present)  |   |   +-- 0.xml  |   |   +-- 1.xml  |   +-- description.xml  |   +-- logo.png  +-- description.xml  +-- index  +-- index.sig  +-- pk.pem  +-- timestamp <p>As you can see, the schema creation process of each of these frameworks comes with its share of advantages and disadvantages, so there’s really no better one. Just depends on the implementation and developer preference.</p> Real-world Implementations <p>At the time of writing this piece, IRMA has three known implementations in the real&nbsp;world.</p>  Age verification in liquor stores in Almere, Netherlands  A consortium of e-health companies called nuts.nl that identify and authenticate users using&nbsp;IRMA  A work-in-progress (WIP) implementation to mitigate fake news using digital signatures.  <p>VCs, on the other hand, have many implementations.

 How tools of IP can help creators and collectors better protect their rights and&nbsp;monetize  Summary <p>This article aims to improve understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP), as a tool to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It gives a mini backgrounder on IP, then connects IP to ERC721 NFTs at Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p>Follow-up articles explore <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">ERC20</a>, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">ERC721+ERC20</a> for NFTs &amp;&nbsp;IP.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;Bitcoin” <p>Ownership of a hundred dollar bill is straightforward: “if you hold it, you own it”. Same for a physical painting. Ownership of real-world objects is defined through physical access control [0]. This has benefits: it’s a simple mental model, it protects the owner, and transfer of ownership is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>We’re half a century into the computer era. Yet it hasn’t been easy to translate ownership of physical assets to intangible assets like electronic money or digital art. As a workaround, the world has used human-readable contracts for these intangible assets. Alas, these “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">wet-code</a>” contracts are tedious to understand, expensive, slow, and error-prone. For example, “this 100-page document says you own it”&nbsp;😬.</p><p>Then along came Bitcoin, a “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">dry-code</a>” machine-readable approach to electronic money, with blockchain as the basis. Like real-world assets, ownership of digital assets is defined through access control. For Bitcoin this means “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinIsrael">Your keys, your Bitcoin</a>”. This gains the benefits of real world assets: simple mental model, protects the owner, and easy transfer of ownership. It’s cheaper, faster, and less error-prone than previous “wet-code” approaches to digital assets. Digital tools can track ownership of physical assets as&nbsp;well.</p> 1.2 IP as a Tool → “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;NFT” <p>Inspired by Bitcoin, in 2013 we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1376105737827594241">built</a> <a href="http://trent.st/content/2015-06-24%20ascribe%20whitepaper.pdf">ascribe</a> for “dry code” digital art and other creative works. ascribe leveraged Bitcoin blockchain. Our mantra was “<a href="https://medium.com/silicon-allee/art-and-tech-in-berlin-a-powerful-combination-c40e9b328f7">own digital art the way you own Bitcoin</a>.” Blockchain technology helped creators and collectors secure their work and monetize.</p><p>Early on in ascribe, we discovered that Intellectual Property (IP) was an incredibly useful toolbox to help creators and collectors protect their rights and earn a living. The language and laws of IP go back literally centuries. All the books you’ve read, music you’ve heard, and movies you’ve watched have IP language backed up by laws to protect the authors, musicians and filmmakers.</p><p>So for ascribe, we used the language of IP to make the rights for creators &amp; collectors maximally clear. It’s a powerful tool, and we leveraged it heavily. We also used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160606190958/https://www.ascribe.io/terms/">legal contracts</a> to help bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Whereas ascribe was an early IP * blockchain project, IP * blockchain has now evolved into full-fledged <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70">field</a>: NFTs. The mental model is all about access control: “your keys, your&nbsp;NFT.”</p><p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has been my focus for several years now. It’s about sharing, buying and selling data as an asset, by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">tokenizing digital access control</a>. Since data is IP, Ocean is about data IP assets. “Your keys, your data.” In Ocean, we also leverage the language of IP and, as a bonus, legal contracts to bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p> 1.4 Outline <p>We’ve realized that our experiences over the last eight years may be helpful to others in the NFT field. The aim of this post (and subsequent posts) is to help clarify. This post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Section 2 is an IP mini-backgrounder. In it, we introduce key terms from the language of IP — copyright, exclusive rights, licenses — along with a brief history and legal implementation.</p><p>Then in sections 3 and 4, we describe what the most popular NFTs standard — <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> — is doing from a framing of IP language, and how to leverage IP law for further protection.</p>  We do this for two specific cases: single-edition ERC721 (section 3) and limited-edition ERC721 (section&nbsp;4).  For each section, we first describe definitions — how “publish”, “sub-license”, “base IP”, “sub-licensee” etc is modeled in smart contracts and license terms. Then we provide a sequence diagram to illustrate the actions, followed by a structure diagram to show system state after each action. It’s fairly technical — we found this necessary in order to have enough clarity, all with the goal of protecting rights of creators and collectors.   2. IP Mini-Backgrounder <p>This section is a mini-backgrounder on intellectual property (IP), which is all about property of the intellectual variety.</p><p>IP and Copyright Law. Rights on digital art, physical art, music, books, and data all fall under IP law, specifically copyright law [1]. The<a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/summary_berne.html"> Berne Convention</a> of<a href="https://www.wipo.int/"> WIPO</a> was signed by<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> 179 countries</a> including USA and Germany. Each country enacts its own laws according to its guidelines.</p><p>Copyright. The Convention provides creators “with the means to control how their work is used, by whom, and on what terms”. In it, the “creator of a work<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> doesn’t need to apply</a> for copyright, or to register it.” Rather, copyright automatically exists once it has been put it into “a fixed form”, e.g. as a recording on audio tape or as magnetic bits on a hard disk. However the Convention does suggest registration, to help prove that you’re the creator of the work in the event of&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Exclusive Rights. If a publishing house “buys the rights” to an author’s work, they typically get an exclusive license (a contract) to use that work for their own profit. The base IP goes from the author to the publishing house. If a music label “buys the rights” to a musician’s work, the base IP goes from the musician to the label. And so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>Sub-licenses. When you buy an e-book, you’re buying the license to read it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell 1000 copies, since your contract doesn’t include those rights. When you buy a song from iTunes, you’re buying the license to listen to it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell it or play it on the radio, since you don’t have the license for&nbsp;that.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical. It describes what <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> code is doing from an IP perspective. We start with single-edition NFTs.</p> 2. Single-Edition ERC721 code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions <p>This section describes how IP legals get implemented in Single-Edition ERC721 [3]. The two main actions are to publish and to sub-license. They’re defined, and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, i.e. copyright or initial exclusive license. This is implemented as ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self&nbsp;. To implement legals, metadata points to a T&amp;C stating that _safeMint() is a claim of base&nbsp;IP.  To Sub-license means transfer exclusive license to new exclusive licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom(). To implement legals, the T&amp;C states that safeTransferFrom() is a sub-licensing action that grants specific&nbsp;rights.  <p>Base IP, Base IP Holder, and Licensee are defined and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Base IP means the artifact being copyrighted. Represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder means the holder of the Base IP. Represented as the the actor that did the initial “publish” action.  Sub-licensee is the holder of the sub-license. Represented as the entity that controls address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x].   2.2 Single-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example with focus on behavior. The corresponding image is below. We use a UML sequence diagram. Each arrow indicates a Solidity method call to the ERC721 contract. The origin of the arrow is the entity who initiated the call, such as publisher or licensee1. The arrows do not show value transfer, e.g. from publisher to licensee1. The UML structure diagram farther below helps to build intuition on the result of each method&nbsp;call.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls the deployed ERC721 contract’s _safeMint() method, keeping ownership to themselves (to=addressP). An ERC721 contract can hold many NFTs; therefore the publisher must specify which one (tokenId=7). The ERC721’s _owner attribute (a mapping) at tokenId=7 gets updated to addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Publisher to Licensee1. The publisher calls ERC721.safeTransferFrom() to send the NFT to Licensee1 (to=address1). The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❸ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Licensee1 to Licensee2. The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 Single-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The corresponding image is below. It roughly follows the format of a UML Composite Structure Diagram&nbsp;.It focuses on which actor has which IP rights, i.e. who owns&nbsp;what.</p><p>After Step ❶ (Publish), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT hasn’t been transferred yet, then the entity at this address can be interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❷ (exclusive Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now set to address1. The address1 owner is the exclusive licensee. Since the license is exclusive, this entity is also the Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❸ is like ❷, except now the address2 owner is exclusive licensee and Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Structure Diagram 3. Limited-Edition ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  3.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition NFTs means there are several NFT tokens for the same base IP [4]. Each token is its own&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Each edition may be considered fungible or non-fungible:</p>  Fungible if the edition can be swapped with another edition and no one cares. For example, a digital visual artwork in a gif has 10 limited editions available and there are no serial numbers. Or an e-book novel with 1000 limited editions.  Non-fungible if a swap does matter. For example, the NFT has a history of ownership or usage (provenance) that influences the price. Or collectors assign higher value to a particular edition number (“edition 3 is more valuable than edition&nbsp;17”).  <p>Here’s the implementation using ERC721. It would be fairly similar if using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>; for ease of reading we will focus on&nbsp;ERC721.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. This is implemented as one ERC721._safeMint() call for each edition. Each call has a unique tokenId input. The IP claim is being made a separate time for each call; this works assuming one address does all initial&nbsp;minting.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom().  Base IP: represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: whoever performed the initial publish&nbsp;actions.  Sub-licensee: the owner of address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x,y,z] (example of 3 editions).   3.2 Limited-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls _safeMint() method three separate times, specifying tokenId=7, 8, and 9 for each&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7, from Publisher to Licensee1. The limited edition for tokenId=7 is sub-licensed to Licensee1 (address1). This method call is a non-exclusive sub-license; compare to an exclusive sub-license for the same call in the single-edition ERC721&nbsp;case.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7 from Licensee1 to Licensee2.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=8.</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 3.3 Limited-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners at tokenId=7, 8, and 9 are set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now address1, meaning the address1 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP). There isn’t an explicit way to do an exclusive sub-license of the base IP. This has a different interpretation than single-edition ERC721, where the same method call means an exclusive sub-licensing of the Base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then the address2 owner is sub-sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7, and the address3 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=8. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP).</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 4. Conclusion <p>This article aimed to improve understanding of Intellectual Property (IP), as a tool to help creators and collectors.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Google has launched <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai" title="Vertex AI">Vertex AI</a>, its fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform for the enterprise. It tackles the challenge of operationalizing AI/ML projects with automated pipelines, accessibility for business users, data scientists, and ML engineers, and pre-trained APIs for speech, vision, video, and more. The divide between technical know-how and precise customization and implementation of ML models is shrinking rapidly, thanks to AI Service Clouds.</p>
 Fully Managed will be a Distinguishing Feature 
<p>Fully managed will become a distinguishing feature of AI Service Clouds. Although attention is primarily given to the AI capabilities of AI Service Clouds, such as plug-and-play language, cognitive, and prediction capabilities, the implementation of these is simplified with managed services. For a wide variety of personas to collaborate on an AI project, a few things have to be in place: a user interface that abstracts away complexity from reliable AutoML that assists in data preparation, model selection, feature engineering, testing, validating, and beyond. The computational effort to power AutoML for model development, let alone implementation, is accessed most realistically from the cloud. The requirements are many: data storage of training and operational data, flexible training requirements like distributed, spot, or batch, model versioning, and much more. AI Service Clouds that are managed services abstract away the complexity of running AI/ML projects and hand off managing the computation-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>AI Service Clouds is an emerging market space, with much emphasis on AutoML, automated pipelines, pre-build models accessible via API, and making AI/ML accessible to business users without formal training in the field. But the computational effort that is required to make MLOps appear so effortless remains a fundamental part of this new wave of enterprise AI.</p>
<p></p>
 Our Recommendations 
<p>Be aware of your data: Your data has gravity, and whether intentional or not, the place where your data resides has an influence on the vendors and services you use. Especially in the AI/ML field which is so data-reliant, be strategic about planning where and how data is stored <a></a>so that it can serve your use cases in the best way possible. Security and privacy controls of your ML data should be considered on-prem and especially in the cloud. Google Cloud Vertex AI does provide additional security measures for sensitive data, such as encryption and dataset aggregation and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Be aware of your use cases: It’s okay to dream big when it comes to AI/ML, but don’t let the dream steer strategy. Always consider what the business needs are, then consider which technologies or revised processes could serve it. Don’t pursue AI for its own sake.</p>
<p>Be aware of who your AI/ML project impacts: If there is any time to implement multi-stakeholder practices, it is with your AI/ML projects. You will need a diverse development team to ask the right questions: How was the data that we use for training collected? Is it representative of your customers, or does it identify or alienate any group? Does the data adequately meet the needs of the business case? What communication strategies with end users are in place?</p>
<p>By automating and abstracting away complexity, AI Service Clouds make diverse teams more feasible, offer ready-made MLOps tools to the enterprise, and bring flexibility to the computation question. Read the Market Compass: AI Service Clouds to learn more.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce Anonyome Labs is listed in the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs joins&nbsp;355&nbsp;other&nbsp;qualified organizations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;compendium of&nbsp;privacy tech vendors. This is a significant increase from the 44 vendors listed in the inaugural report in 2017.&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories&nbsp;is also higher in 2021: now 11 categories split across two groups&nbsp;—&nbsp;Privacy program management and&nbsp;Enterprise privacy management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this growth in both vendor numbers and&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories as evidence of the explosion in market awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;of&nbsp;the vital need to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;among consumers and enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP agrees, saying these changes represent as a “metamorphosis” in the privacy landscape in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the IAPP released its 2017 report, it described the privacy technology marketplace as being “on the precipice of a major evolutionary shift”. You’ll recall the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;was about a year off becoming law and the marketplace had some early tech vendors.&nbsp;(<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;was around at this time—we were established in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">2014</a>&nbsp;through the pioneering foresight of our early founders—but&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still developing our early products.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2017,&nbsp;the world has&nbsp;seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;2018</a>, Brazil’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/">General Data Protection Law2018</a>, and other privacy laws around the world, including plenty of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;movement at the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state level in the US</a>.&nbsp;This raft of&nbsp;new&nbsp;compliance requirements has brought&nbsp;a corresponding increase in the demand for privacy tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, the rise of privacy&nbsp;tech was the focus of an expert panel at this year’s Data Privacy Day. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">8 Key Takeaways From the ‘Rise of Privacy Tech’ Panel With Our Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;for some considered insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In releasing the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;Privacy Tech Vendor Report&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the IAPP&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">observes</a>: “Privacy tech has undergone a paradigm shift over the past five years, affecting everything from the development of&nbsp;privacy tech tools to the attitude toward privacy tech vendors. The five-year mark of the report’s existence is perhaps the proper time to look at how far the privacy tech market has gone and where it will go in the future”.&nbsp;(We’ve been thinking about the future of privacy for a while. Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">10-year forecast</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2021 report, Anonyome Labs is listed under the Privacy Information Managers category&nbsp;as the best fit, but we acknowledge that our enterprise offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, is difficult to categorize given its unique depth and breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;is&nbsp;a scalable developer platform that provides companies with the necessary tools to build privacy and&nbsp;cybersafety&nbsp;solutions into new and existing products for their end users. The&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform’s public APIs and SDKs offer developers various privacy-oriented capabilities including private telephony and email services, end-to-end encrypted communications, private browsing, password management, virtual card payments. These capabilities are available for mobile, desktop, and web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Inside&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>At the heart of&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform is our&nbsp;innovative digital identity concept called the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo</a>. A Sudo is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile and manage it.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos are the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;of our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a> complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">MySudo</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions, they can use the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a> delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>When giving the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a> Annual Informatics Lecture, our co-CEO and CTO, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, spoke on <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and the tech driving it this <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly identity and anonymous profiles online. Paul shared that in developing the&nbsp;Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before. And that’s what the global fight for privacy will demand from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages with user data: out of the box thinking and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the Internet was born in 1983, computer networks lacked a standard method of communicating with one another. In the years since — as online communications have grown interwoven with our daily lives and revolutionised the world we live in — there remains a crucial thing we still don’t have a standardised way of talking about in the digital world: you.</p>



<p>Without a standardised way of identifying people online, websites began to use local accounts with usernames and passwords. You likely have several of these that you rely on in your daily life: your Amazon account, your email account, your Netflix account. These sites also began storing usage information, personal data and data about the user obtained through 3rd party sources in the user account. This approach created&nbsp; so-called siloed identities.</p>



<p>As the internet has grown to encompass everything from your private inbox to your grocery orders, your workout regimen and your finances, your personal data is now collected and stored in dozens of places outside your control. You — the digital you that is — are a string of accounts where third parties hold your information on their servers.</p>



<p>This creates big problems. Your data resides in silos that are potentially vulnerable to hackers, data leakage and other privacy breaches. Just ask the 338 million customers of Marriott Hotels whose personal information, including passport numbers, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54748843">leaked</a> between 2014 and 2018. In 2020 alone, the number of personal records <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/#download">compromised</a> in data breaches grew 141 percent to 38 billion, according to security firm Risk Based Security (RSB). The other problem is that the usage of this data, even if it is secure, cannot be controlled — the user even doesn’t know what is stored where and has no direct access. Not to mention that this approach requires a separate account for every service you use, leaving you with dozens or even hundreds of passwords and logins (remember, you should never reuse a password!), multiplying the spread of your personal data across the internet and contributing to a less-than-satisfactory user experience. What’s more, this situation leaves internet users vulnerable to phishing and other scams that trick people into giving away their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of&nbsp; internet giants like Google and Facebook came the idea of federated identity. That’s when third parties allow you to log in to their site or app using, for example, your Gmail account. If you go to a website and use the “sign in with” functionality, known as “single sign-on”, you’re using a federated identity — Google or Facebook are playing the role of identity provider.&nbsp; In such a setup, the multi-account problem may have been solved, but new, serious problems arise. The companies that dominate the federated identity space, basically acting as middlemen for your digital existence, have huge economic incentive to collect as much data about your online interactions as possible — and mine it for profit. Google, for example, has been accused of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49593830">secretly tracking</a> its own users in Europe, and was fined for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html">illegally harvesting data</a> from children in the US. A less obvious issue is that the providers of single sign-on services also have control over where you are allowed to use your identity and can potentially deny its usage according to their will, be it economic interest, opaque&nbsp; ethical principles or governmental pressure. Twitter can ban you forever, Instagram can close your account, Facebook can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/facebooks-australian-news-wipeout-showed-it-can-delete-our-history-at-any-time">wipe your page</a>. You could say that they control your digital existence.</p>



<p>Thankfully, a better way is emerging. It’s a third kind of online identity where your personal data is neither strewn across an inefficient patchwork of silos nor controlled by a big company that mines your personal data for money.</p>



<p>It’s called self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is the next major step in the evolution of digital identity. It closes the gap on inefficiencies and privacy concerns around the ways you make yourself known online by putting you in control.</p>



<p>First, here’s the theory behind it.</p>



<p>Basically, SSI means a person, or an organisation, completely owns, controls and manages their identity online. You are your own identity provider — there is no one else who can claim to “provide” your identity for you because it’s intrinsically yours.</p>



<p>In a more formal way we can say that SSI follows 10 key principles, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">as first outlined by Christopher Allen</a>:</p>



  SSI provides an independent existence and absolute control for its users, who hold the access to their own data. That means no intermediaries owning or sifting through your data: it belongs to you.  SSI is transparent (so that you can understand any system or algorithm involved), interoperable (so it integrates well with other systems) and portable (meaning no vendor or device lock-in).&nbsp;  SSI offers persistence (the identities will last for as long as you want them to last… no need to worry about Facebook deleting your Instagram account) and protection (erring always on the side of protecting individuals’ freedoms and rights).&nbsp;  SSI prioritises consent (users must always agree to how their identity is being used — whether that’s to disclose or restrict data) and minimisation (you should only disclose the data that you need to, supporting privacy as much as you can.)&nbsp;  



<p>To this practical list, <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> adds an 11th principle of our own:</p>



  SSI values usability — it’s&nbsp; easy to use, adopt and understand. There are no complex bells and whistles, just the means to share and use the information you want, when you want, and it’s easy to carry around with you.  







<p>From the user perspective, practical SSI looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the user, you possess a digital identity wallet which stores the data related to your identity and interacts with other SSI-enabled systems. The wallet can be in the form of an app on your mobile phone or a web-based service or, often, a combination of both.</p>



<p>Your personal data is stored in the wallet in the form of verifiable credentials, rather than on centralised servers. It’s kept under the user’s sovereign control and literally in the user’s possession. A verifiable credential itself is a representation of data which is cryptographically tamper-proof and traceable to its origin (more on that later).</p>



<p>What sort of personal data can be stored in the identity wallet? Any statement about you that can be represented digitally! This could include digital representations of personal ID cards, education diplomas, login credentials, property deeds, corporate badges, vaccination passports, COVID-19 test results, any transaction records and much, much more. Using the wallet, you can selectively present some of these credentials to an interested third party, either some of the time or all of the time. You can record your consent to share data with others, and easily facilitate that sharing. Your data is persistent and not reliant on any single third party to be stored or forwarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have the basic components, let’s look at the interactions they enable. In the below diagram, we have a mental model for how identity can be managed in a way that delivers on the SSI principles. It is known as the SSI Trust Triangle.</p>







<p>Let’s walk through this diagram step by step.</p>



<p>An issuer makes claims or assertions about a user. These claims are bundled together into verifiable credentials and given to the user, who stores them in their digital wallet. From there, they can decide which verifiers they want to present these credentials to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the issuer in this case is a university. The assertion they want to make about you is that you’re a graduate and that you have an MBA. So they issue a verifiable credential that you can store in your identity wallet. Now, let’s say you’re applying for a job at a financial agency. As part of your application, you’re able to prove that you have an MBA by making your credential visible to the company you’re applying to. Note that the verifier — in this case the prospective employer — does not need to contact the university to confirm the authenticity of the diploma credential. Conversely, neither the university, nor anyone else, will know which companies you are applying to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many real-world business interactions involve a similar flow of data.</p>



<p>Need a fishing license? Rather than go to a government office, with SSI you could apply using a digital driver’s license. Want to sign up for an industry conference? Use a digital work ID issued by your employer. Want to rent a flat? Confirm your ID, your proof of solvency and your employment status to your new landlord by presenting the relevant credentials in your wallet.</p>



<p>If you were looking carefully at the diagram you might have noticed that it also has “blockchain” in it — we haven’t mentioned that yet! Read on to learn the role distributed ledger technologies play in SSI and why they work so well together.</p>



 What’s the Technology Behind SSI? 



<p>SSI relies on modern cryptography and decentralisation to make the things described above work.</p>



<p>The core idea is to give users free, unique, machine-readable, user-controlled, persistent and anonymous identifiers that are decoupled from the “personal data” about the user they “identify”. These are called decentralised identifiers, or DIDs. This might sound intimidatingly jargonistic, but the idea of identifiers is of course not new — email addresses, phone numbers, profile IDs and all sorts of other sensitive numbers have a long tradition of being (mis-)used for such purposes. The difference is that they are neither free, persistent, anonymous nor user-controlled.</p>



<p>DIDs can not only be generated&nbsp; for people, but also for organisations, objects, digital documents and more. Every participant in the SSI ecosystem needs at least one, but you can also have more than one DID in the same way that you might have one email address for work and one for personal use. Each DID is cryptographically linked to a secret key that only the DID owner knows, along with a corresponding public key that other users can use to verify claims made by the DID owner. Aside from this, DIDs are anonymous: they don’t contain or reveal any information about their owner.</p>



<p>The blockchain is used to perpetuate this linkage in a way that guarantees that the data associated to the link can be changed by the owner of the DID, cannot be maliciously manipulated and persists forever. (NB: this is of course based on the assumption that a decentralised structure with many autonomous nodes will not go down, as a one single company could. There are also SSI architectures that work without&nbsp; distributed ledgers.)</p>



<p>The second pillar of SSI is the concept of verifiable credentials, or VCs, which can be thought of as a “file format” for storing the claims about an entity which guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the data. They also come with useful features like selective disclosure of claims, Zero Knowledge Proofs, and semantic overlays that do not have analogue alternatives. For now, though, all you need to remember is that a VC contains real-world relatable data about a thing or person — the credential subject — and that it is linked to the DIDs of the issuer and the subject and is tamper-proof.</p>



<p>The main function of your identity wallet is to manage the user’s private keys, store VCs about the user securely and enable safe communication with other identity wallets, in order to exchange VCs and data derived from them in a way that protects your privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you need to disclose information to a third party, your wallet will let you pick the relevant data attributes from different credentials and combine them with the DIDs of the corresponding issuers, as well as your own DID and a cryptographic signature. This is called a verifiable presentation (VP). From here, the VP can be transferred to the verifier, who, based on the cryptographic signature in the VP, is able to independently verify two things:</p>



  The data contained in the issuer’s claims have not been changed, and  the person who presented the VP is the same person about whom the issuer originally made the claim.  



<p>Of course, this is just an overview and does not cover important aspects such as security, revocation of credentials and governance structure. In the meantime, the <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a> and the SSI community continue to explore and develop these topics. Expect blog posts on them soon!&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Your Identity 



<p>It won’t happen overnight, but the move away from conventional siloed and federated identities is already underway, giving people more control over their lives as well as more convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, SSI projects exist that:</p>



  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-refugee-funds-idUSKCN1T1025">Help refugees</a> prove their identities and credentials in their new homeland.  Onboard <a href="https://www.evernym.com/onfido-deloitte/">new customers</a> at major financial institutions.  Allow you to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iata-travel-pass/index.html">present Covid-19 tests and vaccination records</a> when you travel.  



<p>The possibilities for the technology are virtually endless. Policymakers see this, too: The European Union is developing its own European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), and has invested in companies developing SSI projects and platforms.</p>



<p>The benefits of&nbsp; adopting SSI are also clear: increased privacy, fewer data breaches, and more efficient administration of business and government, which helps in the process of wealth creation. At this point, it’s no longer a matter of if, but when.&nbsp;</p>

 Key insights about scaffolding mental wealth and humane development in the 21st&nbsp;century Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<blockquote>This is the second in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #2 is a preview of our international portfolio around mental wealth in Sweden, Dubai, England and South Korea as well as some of the learnings that are coming out of it, externally and internally.</blockquote>Screenshot from the last DM Download on mental&nbsp;wealth What is mental&nbsp;wealth? <p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. We call this societal scale intangible infrastructure — Mental Wealth and scaffolding this will be of the highest priority during our nascent rebuilding phase after COVID-19.</p><p>However, already four years ago Dark Matter Labs started exploring Mental Wealth’s relations to our build environment, our ways of learning, the technological advancement, society’s changing demographics, the development of our ecological systems and how our deep codes (financing, contracting, policy making, regulating, governing) impact these. Below we share a summary and key insights of various streams of work on the ground and we invite you to join the continued conversation and exploration.</p> Invisible Landscapes: <br>We Are&nbsp;They <p>We Are They was an exhibition by DML as part of the Invisible Landscapes series at the RA in 2018. The animation is based around the idea of the built environment as an infrastructure for health and wellbeing, and tries to outline how technology is allowing us to both understand and quantify the effects of the modern city, as well as how we might democratize the power to analyse and update&nbsp;it.</p> Logic Model of ‘Viable* conditions into thriving&nbsp;society” <p>*viability: ability to work as intended or to succeed/ability to continue to exist or develop as a living&nbsp;being</p><p>Our shared timeline to become aware of and act for our planetary future is limited and we realise the need for a radically different thesis in order to unlock our current lock-ins*. Our current version of the world has systems optimised for minimum viability for the whole and maximum viability for the few. For instance, The average income of the top 10% in Sweden, was 6.3 times higher than that of the bottom 10%.* In an age of complexity and uncertainty we recognise the need for a multi-dimensional and multi-actor transition that sees the unprecedented opportunity to create a hyper-viable world. The fundamentals of this transition will be rooted in the way we realise and recalibrate the values on which our ecosystem of relationships is based on. Humane relationships that rely on trust and our sense-making ability to separate signals from noise. In this sense, Viable Cities and Dark Matter Labs have developed the logic models of hyper viability to understand multi dimensional conditions of humane thriving and viable&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Logic model:</p><p>We often use a logic model to understand complex relationships between resources, activities and impacts and to comprehend the underlying logic behind visible data. In other words, the logic model tends to fail (despite its usefulness), because there are always gaps in details &amp; interrelational logics. The logic model of ‘hyper viability’ had various iterations:</p>  The 1st logic model identified three key economies: technology, health and natural systems at the centre of transitions towards a thriving society. There are differences between dimensions of time and speed in each&nbsp;economy.  The 2nd logic model explored key trends and drivers influencing economies impacting humane thriving.  The 3rd logic model discovered that transitions require tapping into multiple layers of the system by understanding new forms of relationships — to self, others, nature and the future, instead of putting humane development as the ultimate aim of a thriving&nbsp;society.  The 4th logic model proposed that the transition towards a viable thriving society requires a thriving life for all within planetary boundaries. This requires a fundamental shift in the way we understand and make sense of our interconnected ecosystem, ranging from our relationships, culture, institutions, psychology/sociology and environment to technology.  <p>In order to collectively move towards a thriving society, we need to understand what kinds of transition capacities and capabilities we need to build. The 5th version of the viability logic model is in the making, which emphasises the need to enable our shared sensemaking, innovation and democratic fitness capacity and capabilities towards transition, alongside an investment into our underlying human development contexts.</p> Mind//Shift: <br>Towards a 21st Century Caring&nbsp;Economy <p>Our 21st century will require us to look at mental health and wellbeing beyond treatment, to systemically embrace prevention and most importantly enable thriving. In 2019 Dark Matter Labs joined the creation of <a href="http://www.mindshift.health/">MIND//SHIFT</a> to better understand and drive deep code experimentation that address Sweden’s most important intangible infrastructure for long-term sustainable development — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">Mental Wealth</a>. For advanced knowledge economies where high levels of cognitive, emotional and social functioning are a key advantage, looking after this infrastructure is critical to ensure that people can be creative, productive and imaginative in a rapidly changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social functioning when COVID-19 has triggered increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when hope seem lost? These are the challenges we are facing as we embark on a year of experimenting and campaigning together with the our partners at MIND//SHIFT.</p>Ecosystem for local experimentation RewirEd: <br>Rethinking Education Models and Learning Environments <p>The project involves partners based in Dubai, but the reach (i.e. experimentation) will involve multiple countries. <a href="https://rewired2021.com/">RewirEd</a> stands for “Rewiring education for a prosperous and sustainable future” and we have been developing this global platform for education with our team in Dubai — <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a>. In the past year, we have engaged with various stakeholders in education (and beyond) to develop a <a href="https://rewired.kumu.io/rewiring-nodes-in-the-education-system">system map</a> charting the interconnected issues in education and human development. Drawing on these insights, we have begun to develop a set of provocations that would serve as both an anchor and trigger for collective action towards education systems&nbsp;change.</p>On the left: Rewired System Map, In the middle: Rewired Provocation &amp; Experiments, On the right: Rewired Provocations &amp; Experiments v.2<p>There are 6 provocation areas relating to: sustainability, well-being, lifelong learning, ‘humane’ education, coalition building and education financing. The first four areas prompt us to imagine — if we put the human being at the centre, and ask what kind of conditions and support do we need in order for humans (and other beings) to collectively thrive — they would revolve&nbsp;around:</p><p>1. Learning with Nature: building more capacity for consciousness and action on issues of sustainability, as well as incorporating wisdom from indigenous communities and orienting schools towards principles of circular&nbsp;economy</p><p>2. Well-being in Education: measuring mental, physical, emotional health and making them a part of critical school outcomes and community objectives</p><p>3. Learning Beyond School: creating new incentives and infrastructures for lifelong learning and learning beyond the boundaries of the school — such as in communities and&nbsp;cities</p><p>4. Humane Education: nurturing humane values and capacities such as relational intelligence, creativity, empathy, storytelling and sensemaking</p><p>The last two areas are centred on the how — “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?”</p><p>5. Collaboration for Impact: representing the need for cross-sector coalitions, innovation partnerships, and mechanisms to ensure collective commitment.</p><p>6. Novel Financial Infrastructures: creating new incentive mechanisms, innovative funding modalities, and decision-making apparatuses that can allow actors in the system to pursue radical transformations.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.dubaicares.ae/">Dubai Cares</a>, <a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/">Expo 2020&nbsp;Dubai</a></p> Key insights   Provocations must address both the what and the how. Many of our ideas are centred on the what — proposing new learning models, focus &amp; content — however, it is equally important to address the question, “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?” because this capacity at the system level needs to be nurtured in order for change to&nbsp;happen.  Radical imagination requires a legitimate foundation. System mapping process engaging multiple stakeholders enables discovering, analysing, cross-validating the challenges together, and strengthens the credibility in the process. This foundation builds legitimacy and reinforces radical imagination.  Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to preventative initiatives and perhaps more critically thriving.  It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without the metrics that look at mental wealth in a systemic way, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.  Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is central to building mental wealth, at the same time as it is dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.   From the Inside Out: <br>Our Internal approach to Human Development and Wellbeing <p>We are in the process of exploring what mental wealth means for us as an organisation and how that can be realised and nurtured in our context of increased uncertainty and psychologically demanding work. We are hoping to share a blog post with our take aways and learning towards the end of the&nbsp;year.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1 here</a>, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

What crypto means for the future of the monetary&nbsp;system <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard</a>:</p><blockquote>“I do believe that in the context where we maintain the role of safe central bank money as a foundation for the payment system, there’s a lot of room for competition and innovation to flourish,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“I think in a world where consumers and businesses retain access to a form of safe central bank money as part of that digital ecosystem, in fact we would see greater competition,” she said. “And that’s a good thing, it would be good to see a more dynamic, more innovative payment system foundation, a safe foundation that could provide greater opportunity for private sector participants to innovate.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF division chief Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’m not saying this is the case for the U.S. dollar,” explained Mancini, whose full title is division chief of IMF monetary and capital markets payments and infrastructure team. “This is a theoretical argument that underpins the greater stability of the world with multiple reserve currencies. So I think from an international perspective, that there’ll be more than one is a welcomed proposition,” Mancini said. He added that the world already has multiple reserve currencies including the dollar, the euro and the Japanese&nbsp;yen.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“For crypto assets to be a significant risk to central banks, there needs to be a considerable amount of currency substitution,” Mancini said, which in this context means countries would have to use a (theoretically) more stable cryptocurrency instead or in addition to the local currency.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-cbdc-economic-retaliation-consensus-2021">CBDC May Give China ‘Leeway for Economic Retaliation’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF Official: ‘A World With More Than One Reserve Currency Is a More Stable World’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-brian-brooks-digital-dollar">Brian Brooks: Digital Dollar ‘More a Discussion Than a Reality’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jared-polis-colorado-governor-consensus-2021">Gov.

Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Société Générale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It’s happening right&nbsp;now.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">CMT Digital co-founder and CEO Colleen Sullivan</a> on why Chicago is becoming a DeFi&nbsp;hotspot:</p><blockquote>She puts the Chicago situation down to New York’s BitLicense, the state’s regulatory framework that debuted in 2015 and requires startups to obtain a license for cryptocurrency activities. It got 22 applications in its first round, while 15 companies closed down. Between 2015 and 2020, only 25 firms were approved. New York’s loss was Chicago’s gain and the result has turned the Illinois city into a hotbed of crypto collaboration.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">BlockFi CEO Zac Prince</a> on the appeal of&nbsp;yields:</p><blockquote>“If you try to explain how the blockchain works, or why bitcoin has value, or some of the other more complex and in-the-weeds topics to folks when they’re on their journey into the crypto ecosystem, they might struggle to wrap their heads around it,” he said. “Everybody knows what an interest rate is. And everybody knows that earning 8.6% on something is better than earning&nbsp;0.2%.”</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“The fact that everyone can participate in affecting what the interest rate will be in these markets is a very big thing because, traditionally, big interest-rate movements have been decided by the banking industry; for example, by a few people sitting down with a room in London,” said Kulechov.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum’s Andrew Keys — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">DeFi Is Rising in Chicago — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">High-Yield Crypto Ecosystem Offers Alternative to Low Interest Rates — CoinDesk</a>   4.

Half of Top Shot’s users have paid for packs or in trades, and between 150,000 to 250,000 log in every&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>The sterling growth numbers come as the broader NFT market gradually cools down from the breakneck highs of early 2021. Top Shot was no exception: desirable moments of top National Basketball Association stars traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars during the peak NFT&nbsp;craze.</blockquote><blockquote>“The headlines are always, you know, ‘LeBron sells for $200,000 or $300,000,” Gharegozlou said, “but the reality is, out of the four and a half-ish million transactions on the marketplace in the past few months, over 3 million have been less than&nbsp;$50.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">Christie’s Noah&nbsp;Davis</a>:</p><blockquote>“This is the art world’s Napster, potentially, because it could be that disruptive to the way people do business,” said Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, referring to the music-sharing service. The British auction house announced in February it would accept ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency, as a payment method, right before Beeple’s watershed digital artwork went under the hammer. The artwork was eventually sold for $69 million to Singapore-based blockchain entrepreneur MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">NFTs Are ‘Art World’s Napster’: Christie’s Auction House Exec — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/gary-vaynerchuk-consensus-2021">Gary Vaynerchuk: The Next Mickey Mouse Could Be an NFT — CoinDesk</a>   5.

We need to rethink our frameworks for the&nbsp;internet <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cory-doctorow-web3-seize-means-of-computation">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p><blockquote>“We live in this world where bandits run amok wanting to do terrible things to you and your data,” the science fiction author, blogger and privacy advocate said Wednesday night at Consensus 2021. “But rather than defending yourself, you can ally yourself with a warlord like Apple or Google or Facebook or Salesforce.”</blockquote><blockquote>In this “feudal security model” (a phrase Doctorow attributed to cryptography legend Bruce Schneier), when the masses try to vote with their dollar or their click, as they would in a free market, they can’t escape the oligopoly power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>“Both implicit and explicit forms of collusion, combined with a monopoly rent by not having to compete, allows firms to really structure markets and create policies that advantage them,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-libra-diem-morgan-beller-consensus2021">Libra co-creator Morgen Beller</a> on why it probably won’t be Facebook:</p><blockquote>“I think I have some PTSD and regulatory scars,” Beller, who is now general partner at the venture fund NFX, said during a session at Consensus 2021, speaking alongside representatives of Visa, the Dash cryptocurrency and Terraform Labs.</blockquote><blockquote>Beller is credited as a co-creator of the Libra project, a cryptocurrency envisioned by the social network as a global payments rails.

 Introduction <p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to securely sell their datasets by maintaining their data privacy (using our Compute-to-Data technology). Data consumers can discover and purchase datasets to train their AI algorithms on that&nbsp;data.</p><p>OCEAN is the reserve currency and utility token of Ocean Protocol. It has multiple utilities today and we are adding many more utilities. This article is a compilation of DeFi utilities of OCEAN, focused on staking and liquidity provision opportunities for OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>If you want to learn about OCEAN dynamics and value accrual, please refer to the post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean Token&nbsp;Model</a>.</p> OCEAN Utilities in&nbsp;DeFi  1. Staking / Liquidity Provision  Ocean Market <p>OCEAN holders can stake their OCEAN on datasets in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and become stakers. By staking OCEAN, stakers receive guaranteed swap fees from subsequent staking, unstaking and data purchase activities that happen in their staked data pools. By staking on promising datasets, stakers also speculate on attractive future returns on their staked tokens. But needless to say, such staking opportunities comes with some risks. For more info on staking opportunities and risks in Ocean Market, check out <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">this blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> POP! Town <p>OCEAN holders can provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto POP! Town’s <a href="https://new.pop.town/">Mutual Liquidity Pool (MLP) marketplace</a>. By participating in the MLP as a farmer, holders will receive rewards in 3 tokens: POP!, OCEAN, and ALBT. In addition, should users experience Impermanent Loss (IL), a portion of it will be mitigated through POP!’s unique Rebalancing Mechanism.</p>  LP Mining Rewards: APY &gt; ~100% at the time of&nbsp;writing.  Provide liquidity on POP! Town&nbsp;<a href="http://new.pop.town">here</a>.   Balancer   Swap Fees earned per transaction: Vary for different pools.  Provide Liquidity in one of the Balancer pools&nbsp;<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore?token=0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.   Uniswap V2   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.3%.  Provide Liquidity on Uniswap&nbsp;<a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.   SushiSwap   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.25%.  Provide Liquidity on Sushiswap <a href="https://app.sushi.com/add/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48/ETH">here</a>.   ODollar/USDC   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.01%.  LP Mining Rewards: UMA (APY ~ &gt;60% dependent on price of UMA + total supply of ODollars)  Provide Liquidity on Balancer&nbsp;<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x4e2579468f414f3b2c683e8562d4c67056d5cb4b/">here</a>.   Bancor   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.20% (can&nbsp;vary).  Pros — Provide single sided liquidity in OCEAN with 100% impermanent loss protection when staked for 100&nbsp;days.  Provide Liquidity on Bancor&nbsp;<a href="https://app.bancor.network/eth/portfolio/stake/add/single/0xCDfF066eDf8a770E9b6A7aE12F7CFD3DbA0011B5">here</a>.   2. Lend/Borrow  OpenDAO <p>OCEAN holders can borrow ODollars by locking their OCEAN at 0% interest in OpenDAO’s <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. These ODollars can then be swapped with USDC, which OCEAN holders can use however they&nbsp;want.</p>  OCEAN has to be locked into the contract to mint ODollars. Minimum collateral ratio is 1.25 but for safety against black swan events, OpenDAO platform applies collateral ratio of &gt;2. This means that even if OCEAN price decreases by 50% in a day or an hour etc., your OCEAN will be unlikely toreach liquidation point, and you could lock more OCEAN to increase your position or pay ODollars back to unlock your&nbsp;OCEAN.  Locked OCEAN can be unlocked anytime by locking the account by paying owed ODollars back into the <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. Those ODollars are burnt and taken out of circulation to ensure that each ODollar has sufficient value (OCEAN) backing&nbsp;them.  On March 31, 2022 theODollar contract will expire — meaning that anyone holding ODollars can unlock equivalent locked OCEAN (in dollar terms) by burning their ODollars.   C.R.E.A.M. Finance <p>OCEAN was listed on <a href="https://app.cream.finance/">C.R.E.A.M. Finance</a> recently. We are currently working on increasing OCEAN collateral factor on Cream Finance. Once done, OCEAN holders will be able to deposit their OCEAN and earn yields or can stake OCEAN as collateral and borrow against&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Today, OCEAN holders can actively participate in theDeFi ecosystem by:</p>  Staking, lending, and/or borrowing to earn attractive yields;  Providing liquidity to earn swap fees and LP mining&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Rest assured that we are actively working on bringing more utilities to OCEAN. We sincerely thank you for being an important part of the Ocean Ecosystem and a proud OCEAN&nbsp;holder.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Where to Stake your OCEAN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated IT transformation in many ways. Lessons learned, among other things, is that IT software architecture must be highly flexible and scalable to handle the unforeseen tsunami waves of network traffic and flexible enough to address cyber-attacks in areas least expected or prepared, such as potential vulnerabilities in communication applications like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Trello. Organization's sudden imperative to shore up cybersecurity systems such as Access Management became strikingly apparent.</p>
 Zero Trust 
<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, the in-office workforce abruptly shifted to a work-at-home environment opening the door to many potential attack vectors. Physicians, too, used their personal computers and mobile devices to help care for patients as they did in the medical office remotely through Telemedicine tools. Medical staff needed to authenticate and gain authorization to access patient information in locations outside their typical work areas to provide security while preserving privacy. Taking a zero-trust approach became even more relevant using a zero-trust principle to always verify the user identity before providing access to any resource. Identity assurance begins with Identity proofing and further uses fraud detection capabilities. This industry requirement became apparent in the 2020 KuppingerCole Access Management Leadership Compass, which saw an uptick in the number of Access Management products providing some level of identity proofing and fraud detection features or indicated that those capabilities are on its near-term roadmap.</p>
<p></p>
 Access Intelligence is Stepping Up to Play a Larger Role 
<p>Beyond core Access Management functionality such as authentication, authorization, federation, audit reporting, and even areas of API security, the use of analytics and access intelligence is increasing. Intelligence gives the ability to make access decisions that can be acted upon based on the patterns and trends found through data analytics and other machine learning techniques.&nbsp; Access intelligence can be used to discover new applications or API endpoints introduced to the network, identify potential access risks, make recommendations on security posture improvements, and reduce fraud, as some examples. The level of access intelligence seen in the market today is being driven by its usefulness and has become a significant differentiator between cybersecurity product vendors.</p>
 Automation 
<p>The automation of everyday Access Management tasks is becoming a priority for many organizations. Intelligence can drive automation to reduce the workload of IT security and administrative inefficiency and human error sometimes experienced through the manual completion of Access Management tasks. Organizations use automation with the intent of making their operations leaner and achieve lower TCO. Access Management automation can be applied to tasks such as the management of user access, applying roles, or automated discovery of applications and APIs on the network and then applying the applicable access and compliance policies.</p>
 So, Where Does Access Management Go from Here? 
<p>Although the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to make some unanticipated changes in their cybersecurity services, Access Management must still provide core functionality. Still, it can enhance its effectiveness by utilizing analytics, intelligence, and automation through more innovative Access Management products and services.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of Access Management in this pandemic era and how it continues to evolve to meet recent business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join the German Cyber Access Summit 2021 to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>
