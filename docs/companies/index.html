<p>Il prossimo mercoledì 18 maggio, InfoCert parteciperà alla 3a edizione del TRUSTED, l’unico evento italiano dedicato alle evoluzioni dell’Information Technology sui temi relativi al Trust, alla Digital Identity, alla Biometria e alla Sicurezza Informatica.</p>



<p>Parleremo di Identità Digitale nell’intervento curato dal CTO di InfoCert, Daniele Citterio. Nel suo speech: “L’era dell’Identità digitale: l’European digital identity wallet come catalizzatore della transizione verso la self sovereign identity”, analizzeremo le strategie di lungo periodo elaborate dalla Commissione Europea in tema di Identità Digitale (EIDAS Toolbox&nbsp; e Digital Europe Programme call for proposal); per poi concentrarci su l’iniziativa privata e gli use case abilitanti, come i &nbsp;consorzi europei e <a href="http://dizme.io">DizmeID</a> , una soluzione di digital wallet che vede InfoCert come soggetto promotore.</p>



<p>Concluderemo, infine, con una vista dedicata alle evoluzioni che stanno portando il mercato da soluzioni di corporate wallet al progetto pilota “shared KYC” con Associazione Prestatori Servizi di Pagamento.</p>



 Incontra InfoCert al Trusted 2022 



<p>Durante la manifestazione verranno presentati numerosi case study relativi alle evoluzioni tecnologiche in merito a temi come Strong Authentication, strumenti di Privileged Access Management per la prevenzione di frodi e gestione dei rischi legati all’utilizzo dell’Identità Digitale.</p>



<p>L’evento dà la possibilità a decision makers come CIO, COO, Digital e General Manager di Banche, Assicurazioni, Retail &amp; Marketplace, Utilities &amp; TLC, Aziende Sanitarie, Aziende Farmaceutiche, Automotive, Travel Services di confrontarsi sulle evoluzioni relative al Trust nel mondo dell’information technology. Durante la giornata sarà infatti possibile partecipare a tavole rotonde, momenti di approfondimento e confronto con diversi player del mercato che operano in ambito nazionale ed internazionale come InfoCert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecco gli ambiti che verranno approfonditi durante il Trusted &amp; Digital Identity:&nbsp;</p>



  prevenzione di frodi, furti identitari o falsificazione di informazioni sui canali digitali grazie a Robotica, AI e Biometria;  sviluppo di nuovi driver a tutela delle minacce cyber e sviluppo di processi di autenticazione sicuri;  tracciamento di flussi monetari sui canali digitali, contenimento dell’evasione fiscale, mitigazione delle frodi fiscali nelle relazioni fra istituti bancari e marketplace.

<p>Da oggi la PEC di Infocert – già scelta da oltre 2,9 milioni di imprese e professionisti -è disponibile anche per usi non professionali</p>



<p>Roma, 17 maggio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, presenta Legalmail Personal, la <a href="https://www.legalmail.infocert.it/prodotti/legalmail-personal/">casella di Posta Elettronica Certificata (PEC) Legalmail</a> dedicata esclusivamente agli utenti non professionali, per tutte le comunicazioni che necessitano di valore legale. Alternativa alla tradizionale raccomandata e più conveniente di una PEC dedicata ad imprese e professionisti, Legalmail personal è la nuova offerta InfoCert a supporto della digitalizzazione dei cittadini, in continuità con il successo di SPID che la società ha contribuito ad ottenere.</p>



<p>Con dominio @pecprivato.it, le caselle Legalmail Personal di InfoCert offrono – nella versione base – 1 gigabyte di spazio, la ricezione illimitata delle comunicazioni di terzi e un pacchetto di 5 invii inclusi.</p>



<p>Qualora si dovesse esaurire il plafond di GB a disposizione o di invii prima della scadenza, sarà possibile richiedere comodamente pacchetti addizionali. Viceversa, in caso di mancato utilizzo, giga e invii non andranno perduti ma saranno disponibili al rinnovo.</p>



<p>I servizi base Legalmail Personal possono essere arricchiti con tool extra di cybersecurity per phishing e password protection, per una difesa ancora più efficace dalle minacce informatiche.</p>



<p>“L’Italia sta progressivamente guadagnando posizioni in Europa in termini di digitalizzazione: lo testimonia il fatto che, nel giro di soli 5 anni, il nostro Paese è passato dalla venticinquesima alla ventesima posizione nel DESI Index. A raggiungere questo risultato hanno indubbiamente contribuito gli sforzi di professionisti, imprese e pubbliche amministrazioni in termini di trasformazione digitale, ma – parimenti – è stato fondamentale il cambio di passo compiuto dai cittadini, sempre più propensi a preferire i canali e gli strumenti digitali a quelli fisici e tradizionali.” Commenta Giuseppe Tusa, responsabile marketing di Legalmail, InfoCert – Tinexta Group “Per questo abbiamo realizzato la versione Personal della nostra storica PEC Legalmail: per offrire uno strumento semplice ed economico a tutti gli utenti privati che potranno inviare via PEC disdette di abbonamenti, iscriversi ad un concorso, gestire comunicazioni all’interno di associazioni o condomini e scambiare messaggi certificati alla PA.”</p>



<p>Come tutte le altre versioni di Legalmail, anche la casella Personal – disponibile in promozione da 4,90 euro fino al 31 luglio, IVA inclusa – è utilizzabile via WEB, tramite App mobile ed è anche integrabile nel client di posta già in uso dall’utente per l’invio e la ricezione dei messaggi e-mail “tradizionali.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale).

InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>

The popular algorithmically-backed stablecoin was supposed to maintain a value of one dollar, but it fell to as low as 9 cents on May 16th. Previously, Janet Yellen had spoken quite positively and optimistically in regard to the stablecoin market and its potential for financial innovation and inclusion.

  <p>The demands placed on front-end web applications continue to grow.  As consumers, we expect our web applications to be feature-rich and highly performant. As developers, we worry about how to provide quality features and performance while keeping good development practices and architecture in mind.</p>

<p>Enter micro-frontend architecture. Micro frontends are modeled after the same concept as microservices, as a way to decompose monolithic frontends. You can combine micro-sized frontends  to form a fully-featured web app. Since each micro frontend can be developed and deployed independently, you have a powerful way of scaling out frontend applications.</p>

<p>So what does the micro-frontend architecture look like? Let’s say you have an e-commerce site that looks as stunning as this one:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might have a shopping cart, account information for registered users, past orders, payment options, etc. You might be able to further categorize these features into domains, each of which could be a separate micro frontend, also known as a <code>remote</code>. The collection of micro-frontend remotes is housed inside another website, the <code>host</code> of the web application.</p>

<p>So, your e-commerce site using micro frontends to decompose different functionality might look like this diagram, where the shopping cart and account features are in their separate routes within your Single Page Application (SPA):</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might be saying, “Micro frontends sound cool, but managing the different frontends and orchestrating state across the micro frontends also sounds complicated.” You’re right. The concept of a micro frontend has been around for a few years and rolling your own micro-frontend implementation, shared state, and tools to support it was quite an undertaking. However, micro frontends are now well supported with Webpack 5 and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a>. Not all web apps require a micro-frontend architecture, but for those large, feature-rich web apps that have started to get unwieldy, the first-class support of micro frontends in our web tooling is definitely a plus.</p>

<p>This post is part one in a series where we’ll build an e-commerce site using Angular and micro frontends. We’ll use Webpack 5 with Module Federation to support wiring the micro frontends together. Then we’ll demonstrate sharing authenticated state between the different frontends, and deploy it all to a free cloud hosting provider.</p>

<p>In this first post, we’ll explore a starter project and understand how the different apps connect, add authentication using Okta, and add the wiring for sharing authenticated state. In the end, you’ll have an app that looks like this:</p>

 Micro-frontend starter using Webpack 5 and Module Federation 

<p>There’s a lot in this web app! We’ll use a starter code to make sure we focus on the code that’s specific to the micro frontend. If you’re dismayed that you’re using a starter and not starting from scratch, don’t worry. I’ll provide the Angular CLI commands to recreate the structure of this starter app on the repository’s README.md so you have all the instructions.</p>

<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example">Angular Micro Frontend Example</a> GitHub repo by following the steps below and open the repo in your favorite IDE.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
cd okta-angular-microfrontend-example
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Let’s dive into the code! 🎉</p>

<p>We have an Angular project with two applications and one library inside the <code>src/projects</code> directory. The two applications are named <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code>, and the library is named <code>shared</code>. The <code>shell</code> application is the micro-frontend host, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> is a micro-frontend remote application. The <code>shared</code> library contains code and application state we want to share across the site. When you apply the same sort of diagram shown above for this app, it looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this project, we use the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency to help encapsulate some of the intricacies of configuring Webpack and the Module Federation plugin. The <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code> application have their own separate <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Open the <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code> file for either the <code>shell</code> or <code>mfe-basket</code> application to see the overall structure. This file is where we add in the wiring for the hosts, remotes, shared code, and shared dependencies in the Module Federation plugin. The structure will be different if you aren’t using the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency, but the basic idea for configuration remains the same.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the sections of this config file.</p>

   <code>// ...imports here

const sharedMappings = new mf.SharedMappings();
sharedMappings.register(
  path.join(__dirname, '../../tsconfig.json'),
  [
    '@shared'
  ]);

module.exports = {
  // ...other very important config properties
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      library: { type: "module" },

      // For remotes (please adjust)
      // name: "shell",
      // filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      // exposes: {
      //     './Component': './projects/shell/src/app/app.component.ts',
      // },        
        
      // For hosts (please adjust)
      remotes: {
        "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
      },

      shared: share({
        // ...important external libraries to share

        ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
      })
    }),
    sharedMappings.getPlugin()
  ],
};
</code>   

<p>In the <code>webpack.config.js</code> for <code>mfe-basket</code>, you’ll see the path for <code>@shared</code> at the top of the file and the configuration to identify what to expose in the remote application.</p>

<p>The <code>shell</code> application serves on port 4200, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> application serves on port 4201. We can open up two terminals to run each application, or we can use the following npm script created for us by the schematic to add <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code>:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>When you do so, you’ll see both applications open in your browser and how they fit together in the <code>shell</code> application running on port 4200. Click the Basket button to navigate to a new route that displays the <code>BasketModule</code> in the <code>mfe-basket</code> application. The sign-in button doesn’t work quite yet, but we’ll get it going here next.</p>

<p>Note - Another option I could have used for the starter is a <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx workspace</a>. Nx has great tooling and built-in support for building micro frontends with Webpack and Module Federation. But I wanted to go minimalistic on the project tooling so you’d have a chance to dip your toes into some of the configuration requirements.</p>

<p>The <code>@shared</code> syntax might look a little unusual to you. You may have expected to see a relative path to the library. The <code>@shared</code> syntax is an alias for the library’s path, which is defined in the project’s <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. You don’t have to do this. You can leave libraries using the relative path, but adding aliases makes your code look cleaner and helps ensure best practices for code architecture.</p>

<p>Because the host application doesn’t know about the remote applications except in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>, we help out the TypeScript compiler by declaring the remote application in <code>decl.d.ts</code>. You can see all the configuration changes and source code made for the starter <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/commit/b851320ca9418b8e28890fab15c7da5313eb8275">in this commit</a>.</p>

 Add authentication using OpenID Connect 

<p>One of the most useful features of Module Federation is managing shared code and state. Let’s see how this all works by adding authentication to the project. We’ll use the authenticated state in the existing application and with a new micro frontend.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You’ll need those values here soon.</p>

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-angular">Okta Angular</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta Auth JS</a> libraries to connect our Angular application with Okta authentication. Add them to your project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@5.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.4
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> into the <code>AppModule</code> of the <code>shell</code> project and add the Okta configuration. Replace the placeholders in the code below with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>After authenticating with Okta, we need to set up the login callback to finalize the sign-in process. Open <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project and update the routes array as shown below.</p>

   <code>import { OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Now that we’ve configured Okta in the application, we can add the code to sign in and sign out. Open <code>app.component.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. We will add the methods to sign in and sign out using the Okta libraries. We’ll also update the two public variables to use the actual authenticated state. Update your code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { filter, map, Observable, shareReplay } from 'rxjs';
import { OKTA_AUTH, OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  public isAuthenticated$: Observable&lt;boolean&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.isAuthenticated ?? false),
          shareReplay()
      );
  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState &amp;&amp; !!authState.isAuthenticated),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')
      );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService, @Inject(OKTA_AUTH) private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) { }

  public async signIn(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  public async signOut(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to add the click handlers for the sign-in and sign-out buttons. Open <code>app.component.html</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. Update the code for Sign In and Sign Out buttons as shown.</p>

   <code>&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(isAuthenticated$ | async) === false; else logout"
    class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
    (click)="signIn()"
  &gt;
    &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign In&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;ng-template #logout&gt;
      &lt;button 
        class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
        (click)="signOut()"
      &gt;
        &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign Out&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/ng-template&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>. Now you’ll be able to sign in and sign out. And when you sign in, a new button for Profile shows up. Nothing happens when you click it, but we’re going to create a new remote, connect it to the host, and share the authenticated state here next!</p>

 Create a new Angular application 

<p>Now you’ll have a chance to see how a micro-frontend remote connects to the host by creating a micro-frontend app that shows the authenticated user’s profile information. Stop serving the project and run the following command in the terminal to create a new Angular application in the project:</p>

   <code>ng generate application mfe-profile --routing --style css --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>With this Angular CLI command you</p>
 
   Generated a new application named <code>mfe-profile</code>, which includes a module and a component 
   Added a separate routing module to the application 
   Defined the CSS styles to be inline in the components 
   Skipped creating associated test files for the initial component 
 

<p>You’ll now create a component for the default route, <code>HomeComponent</code>, and a module to house the micro frontend. We could wire up the micro frontend to only use a component instead of a module. In fact, a component will cover our needs for a profile view, but we’ll use a module so you can see how each micro frontend can grow as the project evolves. Run the following two commands in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng generate component home --project mfe-profile
ng generate module profile --project mfe-profile --module app --routing --route profile
</code>   

<p>With these two Angular CLI commands you:</p>
 
   Created a new component, <code>HomeComponent</code>, in the <code>mfe-profile</code> application 
   Created a new module, <code>ProfileModule</code>, with routing and a default component, <code>ProfileComponent</code>. You also added the <code>ProfileModule</code> as a lazy-loaded route using the ‘/profile’ path to the <code>AppModule</code>. 
 

<p>Let’s update the code. First, we’ll add the default route. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add a new route for <code>HomeComponent</code>. Your route array should match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('./profile/profile.module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule) }
];
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll update the <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> templates. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app.component.html</code> and delete all the code in there. Replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hey there! You're viewing the Profile MFE project! 🎉&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/home/home.component.html</code> and replace all the code in the file with:</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;
  There's nothing to see here. 👀 &lt;br/&gt;
  The MFE is this way ➡️ &lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, we can update the code for the profile. Luckily, Angular CLI took care of a lot of the scaffolding for us. So we just need to update the component’s TypeScript file and the template.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code> and edit the component to add the two public properties and include the <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> in the constructor:</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { filter, map } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  templateUrl: './profile.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class ProfileComponent {
  public profile$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; state.idToken?.claims)
  );

  public date$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; (state.idToken?.claims.auth_time as number) * 1000),
    map(epochTime =&gt; new Date(epochTime)),
  );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open the corresponding template file and replace the existing code with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h3 class="text-xl mb-6"&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div *ngIf="profile$ | async as profile"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.name}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="my-3"&gt;Email: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.email}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last signed in at &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{date$ | async | date:'full'}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the <code>mfe-profile</code> app by itself by running <code>ng serve mfe-profile --open</code> in the terminal. Notice when we navigate to the <code>/profile</code> route, we see a console error. We added Okta into the <code>shell</code> application, but now we need to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and share the authenticated state. Stop serving the application so we’re ready for the next step.</p>

 Module Federation for your Angular application 

<p>We want to use the schematic from <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and add the necessary configuration. We’ll use port 4202 for this application. Add the schematic by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng add @angular-architects/module-federation --project mfe-profile --port 4202
</code>   

<p>This schematic does the following:</p>
 
   Updates the project’s <code>angular.json</code> config file to add the port for the application and updates the builder to use a custom Webpack builder 
   Creates the <code>webpack.config.js</code> files and scaffolds out default configuration for Module Federation 
 

<p>First, let’s add the new micro frontend to the <code>shell</code> application by updating the configuration in <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. In the middle of the file, there’s a property for <code>plugins</code> with commented-out code. We need to finish configuring that. Since this application is a remote, we’ll update the snippet of code under the comment:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
</code>   

<p>The defaults are mostly correct, except we have a module, not a component that we want to expose. If you want to expose a component instead, all you’d do is update which component to expose. Update the configuration snippet to expose the <code>ProfileModule</code> by matching the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
name: "mfeProfile",
filename: "remoteEntry.js",
exposes: {
  './Module': './projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.module.ts',
},
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the micro frontend in the <code>shell</code> application. Open <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code>. Here is where you’ll add the new micro frontend so that the <code>shell</code> application knows how to access it. In the middle of the file, inside the <code>plugins</code> array, there’s a property for <code>remotes</code>. The micro frontend in the starter code, <code>mfeBasket</code>, is already added to the <code>remotes</code> object. You’ll also add the remote for <code>mfeProfile</code> there, following the same pattern but replacing the port to 4202. Update your configuration to look like this.</p>

   <code>// For hosts (please adjust)
remotes: {
  "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
  "mfeProfile": "http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js"
},
</code>   

<p>We can update the code to incorporate the profile’s micro frontend. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. Add a path to the profile micro frontend in the routes array using the path ‘profile’. Your routes array should look like this.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeProfile/Module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)},
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>What’s this!? The IDE flags the import path as an error! The <code>shell</code> application code doesn’t know about the Profile module, and TypeScript needs a little help. Open <code>projects/shell/src/decl.d.ts</code> and add the following line of code.</p>

   <code>declare module 'mfeProfile/Module';
</code>   

<p>The IDE should be happier now. 😀</p>

<p>Next, update the navigation button for Profile in the <code>shell</code> application to route to the correct path. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app.component.html</code> and find the <code>routerLink</code> for the Profile button. It should be approximately on line 38. Currently the <code>routerLink</code> configuration is <code>routerLink="/"</code>, but it should now be</p>

   <code>&lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is everything we need to do to connect the micro-frontend remote to the host application, but we also want to share authenticated state. Module Federation makes sharing state a piece of (cup)cake.</p>

 Micro-frontend state management 

<p>To share a library, you need to configure the library in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Let’s start with <code>shell</code>. Open <code>projects/shell/src/webpack.config.js</code>.</p>

<p>There are two places to add shared code. One place is for code implementation within the project, and one is for shared external libraries. In this case, we can share the Okta external libraries as we didn’t implement a service that wraps Okta’s auth libraries, but I will point out both places.</p>

<p>First, we’ll add the Okta libraries. Scroll down towards the bottom of the file to the <code>shared</code> property. You’ll follow the same pattern as the <code>@angular</code> libraries already in the list and add the singleton instances of the two Okta libraries as shown in this snippet:</p>

   <code>shared: share({
  // other Angular libraries remain in the config. This is just a snippet
  "@angular/router": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-angular": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-auth-js": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },

  ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
})
</code>   

<p>When you create a library within this project, like the basket service and project service in the starter code, you add the library to the <code>sharedMappings</code> array at the top of the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. If you create a new library to wrap Okta’s libraries, this is where you’d add it.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve added the Okta libraries to the micro-frontend host, you need to also add them to the remotes that consume the dependencies. In our case, only the <code>mfe-profile</code> application uses Okta authenticated state information. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. Add the two Okta libraries to the <code>shared</code> property as you did for the <code>shell</code> application.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to run the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>, and the cupcake storefront should allow you to log in, see your profile, log out, and add items to your cupcake basket!</p>

 Next steps 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this first post on creating an Angular micro-frontend site. We explored the capabilities of micro frontends and shared state between micro frontends using Webpack’s Module Federation in Angular.  You can check out the completed code for this post in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/local"><code>local</code> branch in the @oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example GitHub repo</a> by using the following command:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch local https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
</code>   

<p>Stay tuned for part two. I’ll show how to prepare for deployment by transitioning to dynamic module loading and deploying the site to a free cloud provider.</p>

<p>Nobody likes spending excessive amounts of money. Be it Elon Musk, or your neighbor down the street. Fortunately, banks have stimulated spending money with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-credit-cards-for-credit-scores-of-580-and-below/">credit cards</a> at grocery stores, movie theaters, sports events, etc. over the years, with one very swift move — cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Well, what’s the trick? Where does this money come from? In this article, we will review what cash back is, how it works, use cases, and 4 ways to earn cash&nbsp;back.</p> What is Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback is a way of getting money back when you’re buying something, and it’s a feature that some credit cards have. Instead of paying the full price for things you buy with your credit card, you get a percentage of that cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Credit cards with cash back rewards offer a certain percentage of every qualifying purchase back. For example, if you buy a pair of shoes with your credit card that offers one percent cash back, you’ll receive one percent of the amount you spent on the boots back into your&nbsp;account.</p><p>While not every credit card and bank works with the same percentage, typically it’s between 1–2% on average, with some unique campaigns in which you can earn even a more considerable rate.</p><p>This is not an enormous amount of money, but the bigger your credit card bill, the more significant the saving you can potentially make. If you make $2 per 100 spent, imagine what will happen if you spend $10,000. That’s $200 out of&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>However, you should pay attention to the condition set by credit card issuers, before you go on a shopping spree. Some of them have limits (for example, up to $5,000 or $6,000 are eligible for earning cash&nbsp;back).</p> How Does Cash Back&nbsp;Work? <p>As the name indicates, cash back is money you receive in some way — be it via cash back rewards, money back into your account, or any other&nbsp;means.</p><p>Cash back credit cards are just one of many rewards credit cards out there, but this type of card is so popular because it can pay out at a high rate. For example, you can earn 5% cash back on your first $1500 in purchases every month. These rewards can also help you avoid paying interest charges or come close to them since they pay out money you would have otherwise spent.</p><p>All you need to do is find out if the grocery stores, gas stations, or other businesses that you regularly shop from are eligible for cash back, as banks don’t redeem cash from every place out&nbsp;there.</p> What About Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Cards? <p>There should be something for the bank, as cash back doesn’t come for free. You know the old&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Money doesn’t grow on&nbsp;trees.</blockquote><p>That’s also valid here. Each credit card company (like VISA, Mastercard, and Amex) makes its money by applying a transaction fee on card payments (it’s floating, but let’s assume it’s around&nbsp;3%).</p><p>Since these companies are interested in you paying with a card rather than cash, they incentivize banks as mediators to offer you something in return. But banks also have another benefit — to promote their credit&nbsp;cards.</p><p>As we stated in the last point, not every place you shop from is eligible for cash back rewards. There is a criterion that should be met. Let’s see some of the common rules that&nbsp;apply:</p>  Unapproved stores — if you’re shopping from your local cafeteria, you might not receive a cash back, as the store is not recognized as a trusted&nbsp;seller.  Money exchange — if you use your money to exchange for another fiat currency, you won’t receive a cash back, as you are not spending&nbsp;money.  Gambling — gambling or anything associated with betting is among the spending categories that won’t qualify as eligible.   4 Ways to earn cash&nbsp;back  1. Cash back credit&nbsp;cards <p>I have already mentioned credit cards as the main way to receive cash back, but I’ll repeat myself again. If you’re not using cash back cards, you’re literally wasting cash. It’s the most straightforward way to get a percentage of almost everything you purchase. You can usually get 2–3% if you have good credit&nbsp;scores.</p> 2. Rewards&nbsp;sites <p>Another trend is <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">rewards sites</a>. They make things easier. Instead of getting a new credit card issued in your name and thinking of potential issues with interest and overspending, you can use rewards sites such as Monetha, where you receive awards for every purchase you make. You can then spend the cash rewards on gift cards from major shops and services, donate to charity, and even convert to crypto (visit <a href="https://monetha.io/">Monetha</a>&nbsp;now).</p> 3. Coupon&nbsp;websites <p>You can find fantastic promotional codes and offers on sites like Groupon, Livingsocial, and Rakuten. Not only will you receive a great deal on your purchases, but you can also earn money back in the form of discounts or cash back&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Post-purchase cash&nbsp;back <p>Post-purchase services provide cash back on purchases. The most common scenario is to get a percentage back after shopping, but you can also receive an extended warranty or join the lottery for free tickets to Paris or a new car. Some of these services are run by the stores you buy&nbsp;from.</p> How to Use Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Once you have generated enough cashback balance, then it is probably time for the sweetest part — to spend it somewhere. But where can you spend&nbsp;it?</p> As a statement credit <p>If you have a mortgage or some credit card debt, you can cover some of it with the cash back. The way it works is simple: it funds your available balance.</p><p>For example, you owe your bank $200 each month for a small housing decoration loan. When you generate $50 in cash back, in your statement credit report you will find the number -$150 instead of -$200, as a small portion, is absorbed by the cash&nbsp;back.</p> As an available balance <p>That’s certainly better than having a debt. Instead of financing your debt, you earn money that goes straight to your bank account, thus increasing your available balance.</p><p>Let’s say you have $1,000 available in your bank and have $100 redeem rewards. Once you receive them, you’ll have $1,100 to&nbsp;spend.</p> As a Gift&nbsp;Card <p>One common way to use your cash back is via a free credit for online shopping on Amazon, eBay, or other places. The gift card is a fixed amount that you can use either once or multiple times until the credit runs&nbsp;out.</p><p>There is one condition, though. The only way to pay the difference is by&nbsp;card.</p> As a&nbsp;Donation <p>It’s always a good idea to donate money to charity, and cash back is a good option to spend some money on good deeds without breaking the bank. In fact, you will pay a grand total of $0 of your own funds, but you will help people in a&nbsp;need.</p> When is a Good Idea to Have a Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Card? <p>Before we talk about the best cash back credit cards on the market, you need to decide for yourself if you’re up for it. Let’s see the ideal situation in which it’s worth having a&nbsp;go:</p>  You have good credit health — if you have an acceptable credit history, you will be able to access more cash back opportunities and grab better deals. This means you’ll have lower interest rates and much better paybacks.  You are disciplined — credit cards are a big gamble in the wrong hands. Failing to meet the deadline means you will pay brutal APRs which will often overshadow any perks of having cash back&nbsp;options.  You have shopping patterns — in order to get the best value out of your cash back provider, you have to shop from the same places to keep collecting points.   What are the Best Cash Back Credit Cards Out&nbsp;There? <p>Which are the hot offers if you would like to open a cash back credit card? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Discover it® Cash&nbsp;Back <p>This is the best option for huge spenders. You can get up to a 5% reward rate which is quarterly rotating spending categories. It comes with an impressive 0% annual fee and no minimum cashback redemption. It requires you to have a Credit Score of at least 700, and has a standard APR starting from&nbsp;12.24%.</p> 2. Capital One® Walmart Rewards®&nbsp;Card <p>There is a sweet 5% cash back bonus for the first 12 months of using the credit card. On top of that, there is a great 2% cash back that you can use for hotel stays and restaurants, which make it a very good option for Walmart shopping and traveling. You can apply with a Credit Score of 650+ points, making more people eligible. However, the APR is extremely high, often reaching up to&nbsp;30%.</p> 3. Chase Freedom&nbsp;Flex <p>Chase Freedom Flex is one of the best options for travelers, as it can rival even travel cards. There’s a generous welcome bonus of $200 and you pay $0 in annual fees. However, the APR is about 16–20% on average, and you should have an outstanding Credit Score of 700+ points to apply for&nbsp;it.</p> 4. Ink Business Unlimited® Credit&nbsp;Card <p>This credit card is one of the most generous, as you earn a $750 bonus cash back as a welcome bonus + 0% APR for the first year. You also don’t have an annual fee but you do have about 17%-20% APR on it. However, one of the main perks is the unlimited 1.5% cash back rewards on all purchases. This is great for businesses, but the Credit Score requirements are also high — 700+&nbsp;points.</p> 5. Amazon Business Prime American Express&nbsp;Card <p>If you’re constantly using Amazon for your online shopping, this card is the right choice. You can receive up to $100 cash back, there’s no annual fee, and you can earn up to 5% back from Amazon’s orders. You can also swap the 5% for 90-day 0% APR financing, which is the main benefit of the card. Bear in mind you should be an Amazon Prime member with a good Credit Score (700+ points), and the penalty APR is&nbsp;huge.</p> 6. U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite™ Mastercard® <p>One of the most generous welcome offers is the one promoted by the U.S. Bank. Up to $500 cash back as a welcome bonus, paired with a 0% annual fee, is a fantastic boost. It also has a promotional 0% APR + 3% cash back on different bonus categories. However, there’s one catch — there is a huge standard APR (it can easily exceed 25%), and there’s a balance transfer fee that can eat up you&nbsp;savings.</p> 7. American Express® Business Gold&nbsp;Card <p>Unlike other cards on the list, the AMEX Business Gold card works with points that you can collect. It is a superb value for money if you’re traveling a lot with up to 20–25% cash back on travel flights. You receive up to 60–70 thousand points and 4 points per dollar for the first $150,000. However, there’s a $295 annual fee which is steep. On top of that, the APR rate is not low, starting from 15% and going well beyond the&nbsp;20s.</p> 8. The Hilton Honors American Express Business&nbsp;Card <p>If you travel to luxurious destinations or prefer quality for your business trip, this is the right credit card. You get an excellent value for the annual fee of $95, and on top of that, you’ll get more than 100,000 points. There are no foreign transaction fees, which is a great added bonus, and it’s a great option if you are a Hilton hotel fan. However, you should bear in mind this card has no real value if you’re not a Hilton user. On top of that, there is a high APR fee of up to&nbsp;25%.</p> What Stores Give You Most Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Of course, when we talk about generous offers from credit card issuers, we need to mention the stores that give the best credit card&nbsp;rewards.</p> 1. Kroger <p>Kroger is quite generous with its offer. You can get up to $120 cash back at the store with Discovery card, and you also have to up to $300 for debit cards. There are some things to consider, though: there is a $0.50 fee for cash back amounts of up to $100 and $1.50 for amounts between $100.01 and&nbsp;$300.</p> 2. Whole&nbsp;Foods <p>Whole Foods is pretty standard in its offering. They include all spending categories but can redeem $100 back which is not a bad&nbsp;amount.</p> 3. Walmart <p>Walmart limits you to $20 up to $100 cash back, and it depends on the bonus category you’ve chosen. However, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> 4. Target <p>Target lets you cash back up to $40 and just like Walmart, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> Final Thoughts <p>If you already have a credit card, you can benefit from a lot of bonus cash via cash back. It’s money that you can use for so many purposes — you can pay less, cover your debts, and even&nbsp;donate.</p><p>But in case you don’t have a credit card yet, you should consider the benefits against the disadvantages. If you’re not disciplined enough and cannot take control of your spending, you might end up in massive debt, as APR on credit cards is much higher than standard loans and mortgages.</p><p>And if you don’t have a credit card and have no intention to get one, we have to say that there are many options to get a lot of cash back. All you need to do is sign up with a rewards site like Monetha, and you can save as you&nbsp;spend!</p><p>If you like this article, check out our blog post about how to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earn money from your&nbsp;data</a>!</p><p>*Disclaimer: All the information is based on Monetha’s research.

			<p>16th May, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.dltjewel.com/">Jewel</a>, a Bermuda-based digital asset banking platform that has applied for a combined full-service bank and digital-asset license in Bermuda, seeks to offer a full range of digital asset services to institutional clients including payments, banking, custody and lending. In partnership with digital asset compliance infrastructure provider <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, Jewel will power real time settlement for digital asset institutions via its own bank issued USD stablecoin on the Polygon, the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable and sustainable Web3 infrastructure.</p>
<p>Longer term, Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to other digital asset and financial institutions B2B, allowing those businesses to provide cheaper, easier and near real time payments with stablecoins issued and redeemable directly at the bank level at Jewel.</p>
<p>As digital transformation flourishes across all industries and aspects of finance, banking, and payments, businesses are demanding payment solutions that are fast, inexpensive and programmable. Conventional payment systems are often fragmented and inefficient, creating a challenge for customers who trade and transact globally 24/7/365.</p>
<p>Jewel was an early driver for the use and acceptance of distributed ledger technology and stablecoins within banks tied to bank deposits. Today, Jewel’s bank direct approach is becoming an intelligent and appropriate risk-based approach that US and other regulators are now touting for the structure of stablecoins and their issuance and administration, as reflected in the Biden Administration’s recent Report on Stablecoins from the US President’s Working Group (stating their opinion that stablecoin should be issued by banks and other regulated deposit-taking institutions). This was then further defined under the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. Jewel’s stablecoin, Jewel USD (JUSD) will eliminate the need for reconciliation and enable instant payments and transfers to members of its settlement network, “Jewel Settle”.</p>

		 
	 
    Our proposed banking license will allow us to service global firms from Bermuda as we issue fiat-backed stablecoins, first with USD and then a growing number of other proposed single fiat currency stablecoins globally. Through our partnership with Tokeny, we’re able to ensure compliant stablecoin issuance and management in a scalable and easy-to-integrate manner. As a result, we can devote most of our time and resources to further developing our business opportunities. We are already in discussions with exchanges, bank and non-bank financial institutions, and governments, and there is a considerable amount of interest in our offerings.  Chancellor BarnettJewel Founder and Chairman    
	 
		 
			<p>Jewel has chosen Tokeny, the leader in the tokenization field, as its technology partner to assist them with the issuance, transfer, and management of fiat-backed stablecoins on the Polygon Network. Through Tokeny’s API-based solutions, Jewel can issue ERC-3643 permissioned tokens, ensuring the necessary controls and compliance that are required by regulators.</p>

		 
	 
    We are pleased to provide our partner Jewel with a tailored technology solution, so they can focus on their core businesses without having to worry about technology. Together, we can transform the global payment system and accelerate the growth of the digital asset ecosystem.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny

<p>Brand loyalty measurement is more challenging to measure than you think. Consumers are smart and savvy. They change their habits when they are presented with other options that better meet their needs and&nbsp;desires.</p><p>There is an ultimate cost-benefit analysis happening in the mind of consumers on a constant basis. Each time you recommend, highlight, or show off your brand, however, you are adding value. That value must exceed your competitors for it to be effective and build brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> What is Brand&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>What is brand loyalty? It’s the tendency for consumers to remain loyal to specific brands. A consumer who exhibits brand loyalty will remain loyal even when alternatives are less expensive or offer more features. When a consumer demonstrates brand loyalty, they develop personal feelings toward the brand and its products that influence their choice of brands in a category. Some reasons why consumers exhibit brand loyalty can&nbsp;include:</p>  An emotional attachment to the brand and its&nbsp;identity  A belief in the company’s mission statement and its products/services  A belief in the company’s quality and reliability  <p>Some businesses use loyalty programs to reward frequent customers for returning (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty programs best practices here</a>), while others attempt to build customer loyalty through marketing campaigns or social media interactions.</p> Why is Brand Loyalty Important? <p>Brand loyalty can be important for several reasons. For example, it helps to build a positive reputation for a company and its products. If a customer is satisfied with their experience with a brand, they are likely to tell other people about their positive experience. Word of mouth is an extremely powerful tool that can bring in new customers.</p><p>A loyal customer base can also be extremely helpful to any business, because they are more likely to remain loyal to the company’s products even if they encounter other products that may be comparable or better, as long as they have had a positive experience with the brand. This is especially helpful in the case of businesses that sell very specific products or services where it is unlikely that there will be many comparable products on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Another major advantage of brand loyalty is that it can help companies save money by reducing marketing costs and increasing sales. Loyal customers are more likely to purchase items from the same brand over and over again, so businesses don’t have to keep investing in advertising campaigns to promote their products.</p> What is the Difference Between Brand Loyalty and Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>Brand loyalty and customer loyalty are two terms that are often used interchangeably; however, there is an important difference between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Customer loyalty refers to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-commitment/">customers’ feelings of commitment</a> or dedication to a company, brand, or product. Brand loyalty refers to customers’ feelings of commitment or dedication to a particular product within a company’s line of products.</p><p>This can be confusing because many companies use the term “loyalty” when speaking about both brand loyalty and customer loyalty. To avoid confusion, it is important to recognize the difference between these&nbsp;terms.</p><p>The main differences between brand and customer loyalty&nbsp;are:</p>  Brand loyalty means that customers will buy anything that comes from a particular company/brand, while customer loyalty means that customers will only buy a specific&nbsp;product.  Brand loyalty usually refers to brands in the same industry, while customer loyalty usually refers to related products within the same industry.  Brand loyalty can be measured over time, while customer loyalty can be measured once the sale is&nbsp;made.  Brand loyalty is not as strong as customer loyalty because of potential changes in the company/brand’s image.  <p>Another significant difference between brand and customer loyalty is that brands tend to be valued by consumers for their symbolic meaning in a way that companies themselves can’t control, whereas customer-company relationships are mostly based on subjective evaluations of a company’s products and services.</p><p>For example, Coca-Cola has been <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/coca-cola-christmas-marketing/">associated with Christmas</a> for many years now, and people just associate it with this holiday — that’s what makes it a brand. However, Coca-Cola can’t control these associations in the same way it can determine how its products or services are perceived by customers.</p> How to Measure Brand Loyalty: The 6 Key&nbsp;Metrics <p>Brand loyalty is an important thing to measure because it will tell you how customers feel about your brand. If you have high brand loyalty, that means that you’re gaining customers who will purchase your products again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>High brand loyalty can also mean that you have a high customer satisfaction level, which is always a good sign for any business.</p><p>To determine brand loyalty, you’ll want to measure the following metrics:</p>  Customer churn rate&nbsp;(CCR)  Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS)  Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV)  Customer Retention Rate&nbsp;(CRR)  Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR)  Purchase Frequency (PF)  <p>Once your target market feels connected with your company, they’ll be more likely to show brand loyalty towards&nbsp;it.</p> 1. Customer Churn Rate&nbsp;(CCR) <p>Customer churn rate (CCR) is a ratio of customer losses to total customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost during a period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. It is often expressed as a percentage value.</p><p>When calculating CCR, only leave-of-absence cancellations should be included in the numerator, and future expected cancellations should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator.</p><p>The resulting value represents an estimation of how many customers will cancel service during a given period, whether because they are not satisfied with the service or because they are leaving the region where the service is provided.</p><p>Counting and excluding cancellations correctly is important for assessing both how well your company retains its existing customers and how much future revenue will be generated by current services.</p> 2. Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS) <p>There are a number of metrics that can be used to measure brand loyalty. The most common is called the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how willing customers are to recommend your business to other people. NPS is calculated by having your customers rank their likelihood of recommending your business on a scale from 1 to&nbsp;10.</p><p>Customers that answer with a 9 or 10 are considered “promoters” of your brand, and customers that answer with a 6 or lower are considered “detractors.” The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters and provides you with your NPS score. This score can go from -100 (all detractors) to 100 (all promoters). The higher your NPS score, the more loyal customers you&nbsp;have.</p><p>NPS consists of a survey that asks one question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” The answers range from zero (not likely at all) to ten (extremely likely). Customers who answer with a nine or ten are called “Promoters.” Customers who answer with seven or eight are called “Passives.” And finally, customers who answer with six or below are called “Detractors.”</p><p>To calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. Passives count toward the total number of respondents, but they don’t count toward the score itself. So if 50% of your customers are Promoters, 40% are Passives, and 10% are Detractors, your NPS is&nbsp;40%.</p> 3. Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV) <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess brand loyalty. It predicts your customer’s worth to your company, so it’s a great way to show how much the customer values you and your brand. The higher the CLV, the more loyal the customer is likely to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Once you have an idea of the monetary value of your customers, you can use that data to determine the cost of customer retention.The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) gives you an idea of how much revenue a single customer can bring to your business over their lifetime as a customer. It is basically a measure of the value of each individual customer to your business.</p><p>When calculating CLV, you’ll need to estimate the average amount of time that a customer remains loyal to your company. This is fairly simple: just divide the total number of months you’ve been in business by the number of customers you have lost since&nbsp;then.</p> 4. Customer retention rate&nbsp;(CRR) <p>Customer retention rate (CRR) is a term used by businesses to describe the percentage of customers that return to purchase additional products or services. A company usually measures its CRR as a ratio, showing how many returning customers there are for every 100 new customers that are acquired. The higher this ratio, the more confident management is that the company will be able to make future sales and keep growth&nbsp;steady.</p><p>The purpose of calculating CRR is to figure out how effectively a business is retaining customers: if it can retain more customers than it loses, management knows that it is not going to lose money in the long run. It’s also a way of evaluating how well a business communicates with its existing clientele and what type of loyalty program would be best at encouraging them to stay. One thing important to note here: CRR only measures the number of current customers who purchase again from the business, not those who switch over to another brand or&nbsp;company.</p><p>In most cases, managers will calculate CRR by dividing the total number of returning customers by the total number of new customers acquired in one year. There are other ways to measure this ratio-like dividing the number of returning customers by the number of active accounts-and they will yield very different results.</p> 5. Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Repeat Purchase Rate, also known as Customer Loyalty Index (CLI), is a business metric that measures how much customers come back to buy from a brand again and again. Repeat Purchase Rate is a strong indicator of your customers’ loyalty to your brand. To calculate Repeat Purchase Rate, add up all the sales you had in one period and divide that number by the number of customers who purchased at least once during that&nbsp;period.</p><p>For example, an RPR that is calculated for a month can be thought of as the proportion of customers who made a purchase at some point in that month and then went on to make another purchase during that same&nbsp;month.</p><p>RPR can be divided by industry because customer behavior can vary dramatically between industries. For example, Amazon has an impressive RPR due to their expansive product offerings and low prices. A local hardware store may have a lower RPR because their product offerings are more&nbsp;limited.</p><p>In general, a high RPR indicates that your customers are happy with your products and services, and are therefore likely to make repeat purchases from you. A low RPR may indicate that your customers have had negative experiences with your brand, or that they were not able to find what they were looking for in earlier purchases. This could be due to many factors including poor product quality, unfavorable pricing, or poor shopping experience on your&nbsp;site.</p> 6. Purchase frequency (PF) <p>In order to measure and increase brand loyalty, companies can use <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">purchase frequency</a> (PF). Brand loyalty is a consumer’s inclination to remain committed to one product in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Product loyalty is most often measured by customer purchases of the same brand(s) over an extended period of time. Loyal customers are far more likely to repurchase, more likely to purchase more products, and less likely to switch&nbsp;brands.</p><p>To understand why consumers become loyal, researchers have studied consumer loyalty from all angles: demographic, psychological, and behavioral, among others. Demographic factors include age and income level. Psychological factors include product beliefs and attitudes toward the brand. Behavioral factors include frequency of purchase and product involvement.</p> How to Build Brand Loyalty in 4 Easy&nbsp;Steps <p>Building brand loyalty is a process of identifying, anticipating, and meeting the needs of customers. It is important to know when and how to best reach potential new customers.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to build brand&nbsp;loyalty:</p> 1. Create an exceptional customer experience <p>All companies should strive to create an exceptional customer experience that makes customers feel as though they are getting more value than what they paid for. When a company creates an exceptional experience, customers feel like they have been treated extraordinarily well, which causes them to return and buy&nbsp;again.</p> 2. Reward customers for their&nbsp;loyalty <p>Companies should reward customers for their loyalty in order to encourage repeat purchases and increase sales revenue. If a company does not reward loyal customers, then the loyal customers may stop returning because there is no incentive for them to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p><p>PS: if you’re looking for ways to get customers to buy from you more often, don’t miss our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing</a>.</p> 3. Encourage referrals and word-of-mouth <p>Advertising through social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter where customers can share with friends about how great their experience was with your&nbsp;company.</p> 4. Offer discounts on future purchases <p>If they refer someone new who makes a purchase within 24 hours of being referred by one of these loyal customers who already has an account with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Creating brand loyalty begins with the customer. The customer needs to feel a sense of trust and engagement toward your company, which requires that you build a relationship with them. Building this relationship includes knowing what your customers want, being able to get it to them at the right time, and offering them incentives for doing business with or continuing business with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Keep in mind that when attempting to build brand loyalty, as well as other types of marketing strategies, you should always consider the long-term effects. You want to make sure that you are having a positive impact on your customers’ lives and that they will continue to do business with you over the&nbsp;years.</p> Give Your Brand Loyalty a&nbsp;Boost <p>How do you make sure your customers aren’t just content with your product, but in love with your&nbsp;brand?</p><p>Create an emotional connection between them and your products and vice versa. Learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">the psychology of loyalty</a> and make use of these important insights.</p><p>It’s all about getting to the root of what makes someone feel connected to a company. Find out what makes them tick, why they buy the things they buy, and how to make their experience feel like more than just a transaction, but an experience.</p><p>And don’t forget about surprise and delight tactics. Even if you have a lot of repeat customers and people who are completely loyal to you, keep them on their toes. Make sure there are always new reasons to come back for more from your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Brand loyalty is one of the most important metrics in marketing, and yet it is poorly studied. Most brand loyalty studies focus on repeat purchases. Socially conscious consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that align with their values. Brand alignment is a commonality between the social consumer and the brand that creates additional loyalty beyond repeated purchases.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Commitment is a bold word, and we can all agree on that. And while in some situations, it’s a positive word bringing a lot of vibes-for example, a marriage, in another context, it might have a negative connotation-if you’re into debt, paying it is a commitment. It isn’t necessarily beneficial for&nbsp;you.</p><p>But we will discuss one other type of commitment in this article-customer commitment. In this article, we will see what customer commitment is, review its importance, mention the types, and give you some tips and tricks on how to improve&nbsp;it.</p> What is Customer Commitment? <p>You can find one of the best descriptions of customer commitment in the book <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/explaining-customer-loyalty-to-retail-stores/238383">Explaining Customer Loyalty to Retail Stores: A Moderated Explanation Chain of the Process</a>. According to Arturo Vasquez-Parraga and Miguel&nbsp;Sahagun,</p><blockquote>Customer’s engagement or continuous obligation to buy the same product or use the same&nbsp;company.</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, companies are making their services so influential for customers that the latter willingly (or not) keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> Why is It Important? <p>It’s essential to give your customers a reason to come back after you have converted them for the first time (see more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers and how to convert them here</a>). Offering your customers discounts, loyalty programs, and social share programs are all ways to build lifetime value with them. Innovative e-commerce features such as an app store, in-app payments, rewards, and one-click purchasing keep your clients returning again and again. People want to feel like a part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>Going the extra mile will be rewarding for your business and your customers. Let’s see&nbsp;why.</p> 1. Better relationships with your customers <p>If you invest in the relationship between you and your clients, you will make them more satisfied with your products. Customers value the personal approach and will always highly regard companies that use it in their marketing strategy.</p> 2. More sales over the long&nbsp;term <p>Every company that invests in its customers will get more committed visitors. Instead of looking for products, they will try to find ways to add more items to their cart, even if they don’t have much money left in their banks, because they like you and your business!</p> 3. Growth potential <p>Customer commitment makes company growth possible. Repeat purchasers can help you invest more in adding extra personnel and investing in new customers, as you will have the available funds.</p> 4. Reduced marketing cost <p>Running an e-commerce store is a challenging endeavor, as advertising on Google, Facebook, and all the other platforms out there is not cheap anymore. However, if you have enough committed customers to your brand, you will drive revenue without spending excessive money and reducing your profit. According to Forbes, converting leads into customers is 5 times more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=39d455325a8e">expensive</a> than investing in your current&nbsp;clients.</p> What are the Types of Customer Commitment? <p>Okay, we already told you about customers’ commitment and why it’s crucial to have more customers coming back to you. But what are the three main types, and how is each one different from the other ones? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Affective Commitment <p>Affective commitment is the emotional attachment to a brand. If a customer’s emotions are wrapped up in a brand, they’ll become more likely to keep coming back. This means that businesses should be sure to create genuine connections with their audience and make consumers feel like they’re part of the&nbsp;family.</p><p>But to generate affective commitment, it’s not enough to achieve high customer satisfaction. There should be more offered on the table, something exclusive. Affective commitment is like creating a “cult” toward a brand and its&nbsp;product.</p><p>Affective commitment is what each company should be fighting for, and it creates brand advocates who are a great asset for future&nbsp;success.</p> Affective Commitment Examples <p>Apple</p><p>Apple is a common example of a brand that drives customer loyalty because of a “cult” around its name. There are plenty of people who choose the company and buy the latest products. Whenever a new iPhone is released, there are massive queues for people who desire to have the latest model, no matter the cost. Typically, Apple’s products are more expensive than the competition, yet they drive more interest than their&nbsp;rivals.</p><p>A lot of customers’ devotion to Apple is explained by the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty</a>, which we have talked about on a previous&nbsp;article.</p><p>Ferrari</p><p>It’s a dream come true for customers who can afford to drive the “Red Horse” badge. And while the cheapest model from their product range (Ferrari Roma) starts with a base price of over $200,000, successful people would love to join the list of people who have access to this masterpiece. Sadly, you can’t go full-throttle in town, but still — it’s better to wait in traffic with a “Red Horse”, rather than in a Fiat,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Nike</p><p>Nike is one of the brands with the most brand advocates among sports fans. Being promoted by some of the most notable sports names — like Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, and Rafael Nadal- attracts clients who wear a jersey of their favorite sports clubs and buy the iconic Air Jordans or Air Max&nbsp;series.</p> 2. Continuance Commitment <p>Continuance commitment occurs when customers are not that highly impressed by the company. They choose to stay because they give it more value than other choices, and they pick it for logical&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Although continuance commitment is an important factor of loyalty, it doesn’t bring the “buzz” effect. There is a thin line between affective commitment and continuance commitment.</p><p>Affective commitment focuses on customers choosing a service provider because they feel attached to the brand, while continuance commitment happens when customers choose because it is reasonable.</p> Continuance Commitment Examples <p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft is a typical example of a company that customers find reliable and trustworthy. Nobody is proud of using Microsoft Office or Windows. However, most users engage with the company because they know what to expect: consistency, predictability, and good value for&nbsp;money.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>While Walmart doesn’t attract such devoted fans as Apple or Tesla, it has become a synonym of great deals. While some people love the company, most customers shop there because they can find various brands and purchase goods at outstanding prices. The company slogan “Save Money. Live better.” perfectly fits the customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>IKEA</p><p>Just like Walmart, people know what to expect when they buy from IKEA. Reasonable prices and a variety of products. But that’s not all. IKEA has built a name for Swedish quality and minimalistic design, often attracting customers. While luxurious furniture fans cannot usually be seen there, IKEA is a go-to place for millions of customers worldwide.</p> 3. Normative Commitment <p>Instead of customers remaining committed to a brand because they enjoy doing business with it, the term normative commitment refers to when a customer remains committed to a brand because they feel they have to keep using the service, despite their&nbsp;will.</p><p>However, normative commitments are the worst of the three types, as customers who experience them are not happy. While we still have customer retention, this is the last stage before customers abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Normative commitment is also found in the relationship between employers and employees where the latter want to leave but have no better options at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Normative Commitment Examples <p>Adobe</p><p>Adobe is known for its excessive charges. You cannot buy any of Adobe’s products. Instead, you should subscribe to a single software or get access to all of them. $52.99 per month on an annual basis is what you should pay for one license. It’s definitely a steep price no one wants to pay, but since it’s an industry-standard software, you can’t really settle with a cheaper alternative, as they are not good&nbsp;enough.</p><p>SAP</p><p>If you ask employees, 90% of them probably do not like working with SAP. It’s a monolith platform, has a very outdated UI, costs a fortune, and is very heavy. But why do most Fortune 500 keep using it? Because it is proven to work with large batches of data, and it’s one of the legacy companies of its kind, so migrating to a competitor might be a disaster for clients; thus, they stay despite the shortcomings.</p><p>T-Mobile</p><p>Mobile service providers are often topping charts of unpleased customers simply because there isn’t much competition. T-Mobile is a leading provider, yet it receives very poor feedback for lack of mobile signal, unstable 5G connection, and poor customer service. However, customers keep using it, as loyal customers can still get better plans. Otherwise, if they change their carrier, they risk losing the perks that were stacked over the&nbsp;years.</p> How to Increase Customer Commitment <p>There are many ways to increase customer commitment, and fortunately, it isn’t hard to achieve better results. Let’s see some of&nbsp;them:</p> 1. Offer discounts <p>One of the most popular ways to create a more committed customer base is to offer occasional discounts. Of course, it’s not a good practice to have discounts 24/7 available on all products. But coming up with different offers makes people maintain their interest in your e-commerce platform and check out the website/app more frequently.</p> 2. Reward frequent purchases <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">Loyalty programs</a> are a superb way to reward repeat purchasers. It is an opportunity for you to connect with your customers personally and build your relationship with them. A rewards program gives your customers a unique feeling of gratitude, regardless of the order value or the amounts of orders they&nbsp;make.</p> 3. Set up subscription services <p>Many subscription-based programs offer incentives to customers that other e-commerce sites don’t. For example, a customer can pay $50 per year and in return receive free shipping and a 10% flat discount on all orders. It is a strong reason for customers to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> 4. Ask for feedback and reply to&nbsp;it <p>Users can feel more involved with your brand if you offer the option to write a review for your product or service. This way, you show them that their opinions matter to your business. But do not forget to respond. It may take no more than 1–2 minutes to come up with a reply, but the effect can be huge. You can thank them for each positive review and provide an apology and explanation for negative&nbsp;reviews.</p> 5. Offer a “Thank you”&nbsp;email <p>A “Thank You” email isn’t much effort to create, and it has become a common practice among companies. All you need to have is email automation software and some original ideas. Your effort ends with no more than a couple of hours of work until you write a good&nbsp;one.</p> 6. Personalize your&nbsp;message <p>Countless advertisements can work against your brand, especially when you oversaturate the market with web banners and newsletter pop-ups. However, by adding personal touches to every campaign and interacting directly with an audience, you can stand out from the competition by giving something that clients&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Focus on delivering a great customer service experience <p>To improve your store’s performance, you need to make yourself available to your customers. Adding customer care agents will significantly improve your performance. Try to add as many channels as possible: email, live chat, phone. Having quick-to-react customer service might make the difference between affective commitment and customers quitting your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Customer commitment is vital for your business, and it can help your brand generate more money by capitalizing on existing customers and converting leads into new clients. But if you fail to offer something any short of the best, your clients can quickly abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Did you like this article?

<p>3.8 billion — that’s the number of memberships US <a href="https://www.claruscommerce.com/blog/17-staggering-customer-loyalty-stats-that-will-change-your-perspective/">customers</a> hold in loyalty programs. There’s no question that loyalty programs are popular with consumers.</p><p>That loyalty programs are a staple of consumer marketing is therefore no surprise. These programs can be a powerful tool for businesses looking to keep their customers happy (learn more about the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty&nbsp;here</a>).</p><p>Let’s explore the basics of loyalty programs and learn loyalty programs best practices that will keep your customers coming back for&nbsp;more.</p> What’s a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program is a marketing strategy used by companies to reward customers for their continued patronage. Programs can be as simple as a punch card that gets the customer a free item after a certain number of visits, or as complex as a points-based system that allows customers to redeem rewards for products or services.</p><p>Loyalty programs are popular because they offer customers an incentive (read more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing here</a>) to keep coming back to brands and businesses of their choice. They also help businesses build customer loyalty, which ultimately manifests itself in increased sales and&nbsp;profits.</p> 12 Loyalty Program Best Practices <p>There are a number of factors that go into creating an effective loyalty program. Here are some best practices that businesses like you can&nbsp;follow:</p> 1. Make it easy to join and&nbsp;use <p>Your loyalty program strategy should make it easy for your customers to join the program and use it. Customers should be able to sign up and start earning rewards points quickly. The program should also be easy to navigate, with a clear rewards chart and easy-to-use redemption process.</p><p>This best practices suggestion encourages your customers to quickly join and engage in a loyalty program. Make it easy to participate as well, allowing transactions from any point of sale system and a hassle-free billing&nbsp;cycle.</p> 2. Evolve and&nbsp;upgrade <p>Loyalty rewards programs should constantly evolve in order to keep up with the latest consumer trends. For example, if you notice that many of your customers are using their loyalty program to collect points for free products, then consider adding a new tier of rewards that allows them to redeem their points for a discount on a future purchase, or freely exchange points for another set of products.</p><p>You could also change the way you reward your long-term customers. If you use a points system for every purchase, why not explore rewarding social media subscriptions, likes and&nbsp;shares?</p><p>This best practices standard rule will help your brand stay in touch with current trends and the changing expectations of your consumers.</p> 3. Explore company partnerships <p>One best practice rule that many businesses are hesitant to try is to open up their loyalty programs to company partnerships. You may worry that doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your program, or that customers will be confused about how the program&nbsp;works.</p><p>However, research shows that a coalition loyalty program strategy can lead to an increase in engagement from customers. This is because customers appreciate being able to earn points from more than one source. Additionally, partnering with other businesses can help introduce your customers to new products and services.</p><p>Consumers appreciate the flexibility a partnership-based loyalty program offers. Making points and rewards transferable attracts more customers and gives you a better understanding of what your target market is&nbsp;buying.</p> 4. Personalize <p>Personalize your loyalty program to stand out from the crowd. This can be as simple as sending customers special offers or birthday messages, or it can be more complex, such as tailoring the program to each customer’s preferences. Your rewards program could be used to suit their shopping&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Personalization is a best practices rule that shows customers that you appreciate their faith in you. It also keeps customers engaged with your brand, and encourages them to continue participating in your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Some companies structure their loyalty programs into modules, so customers themselves customize the offerings of the rewards program to suit their preferences. It is a customer-driven personalization and could take form in several ways, such as levels of membership, and the option of selecting and using the program through multiple channels, such as mobile apps, online e-commerce sites, and physical&nbsp;stores.</p> 5. Track and reward loyal customers <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM software) is a great way to keep track of and reward your loyal customers. CRM makes it easy to identify and track your most loyal customers using customer data through their transaction history and behavior. It also allows you to automate the process of rewarding customers for their&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>When a customer is loyal, your CRM could immediately track their purchases and transactions and quickly reward them. Your customers don’t have to go to customer service or call anyone to receive their rewards; your management groups your loyal customers and identifies them for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Using this is not only a best practices rule for your business strategies but also for your brand as a whole. It will make your customers feel appreciated, and such customers are more likely to return and/or recommend your business to&nbsp;others.</p> 6. Offer Excellent Rewards <p>A loyalty program should offer excellent rewards that appeal and interest your current and existing customers. There are a number of different types of rewards that you can offer as part of a loyalty program. Some of the most popular include loyalty points, free and discounted products or services.</p><p>But don’t forget to experiment with different rewards to find out what works best for your loyalty program&nbsp;members.</p><p>So, what makes a good reward? Rewards should be relevant to the customer. If they’re not interested in the reward, they’re not going to redeem it. Review customer demands and searches, and see what you could offer to meet them. The rewards should not be expensive, but they should be valuable and be something that the customer would&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Create Emotional Connection <p>Customers tend to remain loyal to a brand because of an emotional connection to a company or brand. This connection could stem from familiarity or tradition. Smart brands often use this connection as part of their loyalty marketing strategy.</p><p>Customers often prefer brands that show the brand cares for their consumers, the environment and have a deeper understanding of their target audience. If your customers consider you to be empathetic and sharing the same values as them, you’d become an integral part of their purchase decisions.</p> 8. Optimize Your Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Optimizing a customer loyalty program to make it accessible to digital users makes it all the more utilitarian, especially at this time when most people are online using social media and e-commerce sites. Making a loyalty program accessible across several channels increases the chances of a customer buying a product or brand. A seamless omnichannel experience would help you score brownie points with your customer.</p><p>Digital optimization makes it easier for your back office systems to track customer engagement and interaction, making the calculation of CLI, CLV and customer engagement scores easier. You could improve your customer service and listen to incoming customer requests through digital&nbsp;media.</p> 9. Offer Rewards and Incentives Beyond Transactions <p>Most brands focus on rewards when customers do actual purchase transactions, but good customer loyalty programs reward customers for any engagement. Explore what your loyal customer base does on social media and give them additional rewards for reviews, likes, shares or even subscriptions to social media&nbsp;handles.</p><p>Also, if you give program benefits to existing customers when they complete surveys and download your apps, then it would encourage customers to participate in your rewards&nbsp;program.</p> 10. Have a comprehensible reward and incentive structure <p>The incentive and rewards system of your loyalty program should be simple for the customer to understand. They should know what rewards they could receive from&nbsp;you.</p><p>If your customer knows what they will earn and when they will receive the reward, they are more likely to repeat a purchas. A frequent flyer point may seem attractive enough, but sometimes when a customer reaches the frequent flyer miles they’ve been targeting, the airline just blocks them with the unavailability of flights or&nbsp;seats.</p><p>For some companies, the customers affected simply did not understand the requirements of the reward. But for customers it is another example of a useless reward program and will not likely renew their membership.</p> 11. Stay in touch with&nbsp;members <p>Your most valued customers value your proactiveness more, since they are the ones who continue to buy your products for a longer time. They are the ones who need regular updates on discounts, sales and offers, and are more likely to respond and avail of these special&nbsp;offers.</p><p>Additionally, communicating with them gives this exchange an air of exclusivity, and makes the membership to the loyalty program something coveted.</p> 12. Be profitable <p>The goal of a loyalty program is not only to incentivize repeat and most profitable customers, but also to increase your profit. Repeat customers are valuable because they do not require new marketing techniques to improve awareness and engagement. You do not need a new campaign to attract repeat customers, but enhance the existing customer-brand relationships to keep your brand loyalists satisfied.</p><p>Track customer spending and product margins when designing your loyalty programs. Ensure that the loyalty program is profitable for the company but also satisfying for the customer.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">measure your brand loyalty</a> and keep those metrics in check! This might help you to better direct your efforts in marketing and&nbsp;sales.</p> How Can You Measure Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>There are a variety of ways to measure customer loyalty. One way is to survey individual customers and ask them how likely they are to recommend your company to others, and to rate factors such as quality of products/services, price, customer service,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Another way is to analyze customer retention rates and see how many customers are returning or have returned to your business. You can also look at the amount of money customers are spending currently, and compare that to how much they’ve spent in the past. All of these require measurable customer data, and the following are the most common metrics used to measure customer&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 1. Net Promoter&nbsp;Score <p>The net promoter score (NPS) is a way to measure customer experience. You could calculate it using this question: how likely are you to recommend the product to a friend or colleague?</p><p>The NPS uses a scale from 0 to 10 and rates answers into three groups: promoters (9–10), passives (7–8), and detractors (0–6).</p><p>The percentage of detractors subtracted from the percentage of promoters produces your NPS. The higher the NPS, the more your customers are likely to buy and recommend your&nbsp;brand.</p> 2. Repurchase Ratio <p>The number of customers who come back to buy your brand divided by the number of one-time buyers is called the repurchase ratio. Most of a company’s revenue comes from repeat or returning purchasers, though they may be fewer than the total number of their customers.</p><p>The repurchase ratio also depends on the business model. Subscription-based retail models calculate the repurchase ratio by dividing the number of people who continue the subscription by the number of people who cancel after the first contract.</p><p>For retail businesses using a transaction-based model, the number of repeat customers must be calculated first. You can do this by finding the average time between the first and second buys of a repeat customer. The repurchase ratio can then be calculated by dividing the number of repeat customers by the number of non-repeat buyers.</p> 3. Upsell&nbsp;Ratio <p>The upsell ratio is the number of customers who have bought more than one type of product from you compared to the customers who buy only one. The upsell ratio only tracks customers who buy new products, and does not include repeat customers who buy the same&nbsp;thing.</p> 4. Customer Lifetime&nbsp;Value <p>The customer lifetime value (CLV) is the dollar value of a customer’s total purchases over the entire course of their relationship with a company. This metric is used to measure the profitability of a customer, and to help businesses like you determine how much they should spend to acquire new customers.</p><p>There are a few ways to calculate the CLV. The most simple way is to multiply the average purchase amount by the number of purchases made. You can also take into account customer retention rates and calculate how much each customer is worth over time. This gives you a more accurate picture of the value of a customer.</p> 5. Customer Loyalty&nbsp;Index <p>The customer loyalty index (CLI) is a tool that tracks customer loyalty. It uses a set of questions addressing three vital&nbsp;points:</p>  How likely are you to try the brand’s new products?  How likely are you to recommend the brand to your friends and&nbsp;family?  How likely are you to buy from the brand again in the&nbsp;future?  <p>The average for these responses is the CLI of a customer, which they rate from 1 to 6, with 1 for “Definitely Yes” and 6 for “Definitely No”. The customer data and customer insights taken from these surveys help in measuring CLI.</p> 6. Customer Engagement Score <p>Another way to measure customer loyalty is to use the customer engagement score. This is based on individual customers’ activity with your business. You can group your customers using demographics, transactions, and customer behavior. Using these customer segments could help you identify which customers are likely to become repeat purchasers and predict which ones will repurchase or try other new products.</p><p>The customer engagement score is calculated by measuring frequency of use ( <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">click here</a> to learn more about purchase frequency), level of use, actions by customer, time spent on activities, and other performance indicators and metrics that represent engagement success.</p> Give Your Loyal Customers What They&nbsp;Deserve <p>A loyalty program marketing strategy is a great way to reward your best customers for their continued business and retain them for a long time. However, simply having a loyalty program is not&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Loyalty is more than a transaction to your customers; it is a shared value they share with you. Your loyalty program should reflect that&nbsp;too.</p><p>PS: if you’d like to know about your potential customers and how to convert them in the first place, we highly recommend you to read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers</a>.

<p>Based on recent statistics, 41% of US consumers make an online <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/448659/online-shopping-frequency-usa/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20survey%20published,shopping%20once%20every%20two%20weeks.">purchase</a> once or twice per week. 24% buy something every other week. Your task as a business is to ensure you are among those they buy from and do it&nbsp;often.</p><p>Purchase frequency is one of the core metrics every business should track. It directly affects your profitability and revenue since you are 6X times more likely to <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">sell</a> to existing customers than new ones. High or average purchase frequency means customer loyalty, while low rates show that people rarely return after the first purchase.</p><p>Find out how to calculate and increase your purchase frequency below. Our tips will help you boost your customer retention metrics.</p> What is Purchase Frequency? <p>The purchase frequency (also PF) is the number of times an average customer places an order within a time period. By measuring PF during the limited time frame you get more accurate results and can compare customer behavior&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The higher the purchase frequency, the more likely your is brand to turn repeat customers into loyal ones. For example, people buy low-cost consumables more often than luxury cars or accessories with a significantly higher average order value. The purchase frequency for these product categories cannot be compared. Hence, you should track average customer purchases within your company or use industry benchmarks for estimates.</p> Why is Purchase Frequency Important? <p>Purchase frequency over a given period is one of the critical indicators for any eCommerce store. But why is it so important? Here are the main reasons for calculating purchase frequency:</p>  Calculating purchase frequency rates allows you to track customer retention. When a customer buys from you repeatedly, you work in the right direction. Without the purchase frequency KPI, you won’t be able to measure&nbsp;this.  It boosts the customer lifetime value. When you increase purchase frequency, the customer lifetime value also grows since an average buyer generates more revenue and stays for a longer time&nbsp;frame.  Repeat purchases are cheaper than customer acquisition. The cost of activating existing customers is much lower than attracting unique customers, which may considerably cut your expenses. <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">82% of companies agree that customer retention</a> is cheaper than acquisition.  Loyal customers with a large average number of orders are more likely to recommend your brand. People that have completed multiple purchases favor your brand and are ready to invite a friend or join a loyalty&nbsp;program.  Purchase frequency provides reliable data for marketing campaigns. If you are unsure whether your marketing is fruitful, purchase frequency rates help evaluate&nbsp;this.  <p>As you can see, you get more loyal customers, boost sales, and grow revenue when you increase purchase frequency. It’s a must-watch metric for any retailer.</p> How do You Calculate Purchase Frequency? <p>Now, we reach the logical question: How to calculate purchase frequency? All data you need for calculations is in your transactional data. The purchase frequency formula is also pretty easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>You will need to follow these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Learn the number of orders customers placed with your company during the selected time frame (usually 12&nbsp;months).  Learn the number of unique customers your business served during the same time&nbsp;frame.  Use the gathered information in the purchase frequency formula for calculation.  <p>Purchase Frequency = Number of Orders / Number of Unique Customers</p> Example <p>Suppose you run a business that sells clothes and want to check the purchase frequency. Based on the previously collected statistics, you know that your company had 2500 unique customers and 3300 orders for the same&nbsp;period.</p><p>Then, the purchase frequency is 3300/2500 =&nbsp;1.32.</p> Difference Between Purchase Frequency (PF) and Repeat Purchase Rates&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Many people use the terms purchase frequency and repeat purchase rate interchangeably. Yet these metrics have some significant differences, so it’s necessary to differentiate them for the clarity of this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The purchase frequency rate shows how often an average customer buys something from a single merchant within the specified time frame. On the other hand, the repeat purchase rate is a share of customers who have purchased at least a second time. To calculate repeat purchase rate, you need to divide the number of customers who’ve purchased more than once by the total number of customers.</p><p>While purchase frequency allows you to understand how often consumers buy something, the repeat purchase rate focuses on the share of repeat customers. Both these metrics are helpful to evaluate customer retention and&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 8 Ways to Increase Purchase Frequency <p>If you want to have a flourishing business, you should engage new customers and continuously nurture existing ones. Repeat customers generate more revenue than occasional purchasers. Hence, you must put more focus on them if you expect to grow&nbsp;sales.</p><p>This section includes several most effective ways to increase your purchase frequency by building better customer relationships and more relevant&nbsp;offers.</p> 1. Know your customer before planning marketing campaigns <p>Before you take steps to promote or sell something, you need to know who you target. This information will allow you to choose the best ways to encourage customers to repeat purchases. You will also be able to focus on people who are more likely to convert than&nbsp;others.</p><p>Advanced software is an optimum way to collect details about your target audience (including demographics, purchase history, average order value, preferences, favorite communication channels, etc.). Modern CRM systems integrated with email marketing tools, social media, data analytics, and other solutions automatically record priceless information about customers. They process this raw data to generate insights about what people want and whether they are ready to&nbsp;pay.</p><p>Once you have these details, it’s possible to segment your customers based on their characteristics. This way, you will tailor your marketing and increase frequent purchases.</p> 2. Launch personalized email marketing campaigns <p>Email marketing is the cornerstone of a marketing strategy focused on increasing the number of customers who make repeat purchases. Emails are the most convenient and standard way to communicate with customers about their purchases, special offers, or sales. These communications remind people about your brand to encourage customers to buy something again.</p><p>Yet to boost the efficiency of email marketing campaigns, you’d better make them personalized. Using the person’s name in an email subject line can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/email-personalization-techniques-tools-stats-2021-guide-josh-turner/">increase open rates by 26%</a>. When more customers open your message, customer activity grows, increasing purchase frequency.</p><p>Besides the person’s name, you can customize the content and style of emails based on the recipient’s characteristics, previous responses, purchases, and other details. For example, you can send a custom selection of similar products based on the purchase&nbsp;history.</p> 3. Make limited-time special&nbsp;offers <p>Limited-time offers are steroids for any marketing campaign that considerably affect customers’ behavior. When the person hears that the chance to get something at a lower price will disappear after the set time frame, they rush to take action. As a result, the customer buys a product or service they haven’t planned to purchase before as the offer seems too good to miss it. Such customer behavior increases the purchase frequency and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Yet you should be careful and avoid overusing limited-time offers. Consumers will get used to such a customer experience and stop buying without discount codes or sales. It may be counterproductive for the overall purchase&nbsp;rate.</p> 4. Communicate with existing customers through multiple&nbsp;channels <p><a href="https://www.mackenziecorp.com/23-omnichannel-stats/">Over 50% of modern brands use at least 8 channels</a> to interact with customers. You should be ready to serve consumers through emails, social media, messengers, phone calls, online chats, etc. The ability to stay in touch through top popular communication channels directly affects the quality of customer service and satisfaction rates.</p><p>Imagine users find your new product and are ready to place an order, but you don’t reply to their emails for several days. Guess what? The chances they will leave to a competitor are very&nbsp;high.</p><p>You should avoid such issues and provide continuous support via the main communication channels. To make things clear from the start, indicate what channels consumers should use for help on your&nbsp;website.</p> 5. Implement a loyalty&nbsp;program <p>The best customers are loyal customers. They already love your brand, trust you, and make frequent purchases even without you asking them about this. <a href="https://inmoment.wpengine.com/blog/earning-and-destroying-customer-loyalty-retail-cx-trends-you-need-to-know/">60% of loyal customers</a> say they are ready to purchase from their favorite companies more&nbsp;often.</p><p>That’s why you should think about having a customer loyalty program. Offer buyers points for every purchase, give them discounts or make special offers, or find any other incentive that can inspire people to join your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Not sure how to implement loyalty programs? <a href="https://www.monetha.io/business/">Join Monetha</a> to get a ready solution for eCommerce loyalty campaigns.</p> 6. Use software to automate manual sales and support&nbsp;tasks <p>Apart from nudging your customers to convert, you must be ready for increased purchase frequency on your side. As the purchase frequency rate grows, the volume of orders you need to process also skyrockets. It may turn out that your sales and support teams are not ready to meet the&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Therefore, to increase the productivity of your sales and support teams, you need automation software. Modern tools can automatically respond to standard emails, implement online website chats, track order fulfillment, update order statuses, and complete many other actions you would otherwise do manually.</p><p>It reduces the load on sales and support departments allowing them to enhance customer service and focus on strategic tasks.</p> 7. Introduce gamification elements <p>When a customer purchases a product, it should be a fun and pleasant experience. Therefore, gamification elements in your sales strategy are a great way to stir buyers’ interest and increase purchase frequency.</p><p>Gamification is the most relevant in loyalty campaigns where users can win points, move from one level to another, or even compete with peers. When people get engaged and want to reach the highest level, they willingly do what you ask them to do. For example, when a buyer needs ten orders to move from the starter level and enjoy additional benefits, they are more likely to place ten orders than without incentives.</p> 8. Fight cart abandonment <p>Abandoned carts are among the most upsetting types of customer behavior for businesses. People browse your website, select products, add them to the cart, and leave at the last moment without paying. Given that the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">average customer abandonment rate is 69.57%</a>, the impact on the purchase rates and overall revenue is enormous.</p><p>Even though you won’t be able to make all customers complete the order, you can take steps to remarket them. Try sending them a reminder email, offer a discount on the products added to the cart, etc. Remarketing can convince a part of abandoners to come back and restore the purchase frequency.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Have you wondered why you keep buying lattes from your local cafeteria, even though Starbucks charges you $1.50 less than that? Is it because of the smile you receive from the merchants every time you order or the reward proposition of 1 free coffee every ten orders? Or because of the&nbsp;habit?</p><p>In this article, we will review one of the critical components for every successful company-regardless of size, location, and staff number-loyal customers.</p> What is a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program, also known as a reward program, is an initiative by a brand to offer its customers special incentives based on their past purchases. These objectives can vary from brand to brand; one company might want to tempt people with discounts or by <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">giving customers cash back</a>, while another might reward people for completing repeat&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Regardless of the goal, all loyalty programs seek to keep customers interested in the brand by building and strengthening <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">brand loyalty</a> — and keeping them close. An interesting stat from <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">SmallBizGenius</a> indicates that 72% of adult US citizens are part of at least one loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Why Are Loyalty Programs Important? <p>Customer loyalty has become a cornerstone topic for businesses, and brands are constantly coming up with new rewards programs to attract more clients. But for both parties-brands and consumers, loyalty points are more than just numbers. And it means so much more! Let’s see some of the crucial benefits of incorporating points programs.</p> 1. Improve the relationship between brands and&nbsp;clients <p>To emotionally engage customers and encourage them to come back, brands must provide more than just the possibility of a free bottle or free glasses-they must create an experience. Giving customers a chance to meet with other dedicated fans of a personality or brand, for example, can inspire a feeling of community and belong among new shoppers.</p> 2. Attract new customers <p>A happy customer is a repeat customer. According to a study conducted by Nielsen, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2015/digital-formats-are-among-the-most-trusted-advertising-sources-despite-slow-growth/">83% of new customers</a> will trust a personal recommendation from friends and family members. That’s a lot more than any other type of marketing. So, the importance of your loyal customers can not only bring you increased value from them-your efforts can actually bring you business from new customers!</p> 3. Repeat customers have better&nbsp;ROI <p>A loyalty strategy in place is well worth it. If you put more effort into keeping your current clients happy, you will have up to a 300% revenue increase. That’s right-300%. According to RJMetrics, you can get three times the business volume. Of course, you need to get real; these numbers are optimistic.</p> 4. Reduced marketing costs <p>As the digital economy grows and evolves, brands need to adapt their strategies accordingly lest they be left in the&nbsp;dust.</p><p>But why splash tons of money acquiring new customers (considering that marketing does not guarantee you a sale) when you can spend five times less to reward customers and keep them loyal to your business? That’s right, a new customer “costs” about 5X more than a current&nbsp;one.</p> 5. Loyal customers are easier to upsell and cross-sell <p>Loyalty programs aren’t just a tool to increase customer retention; they also boost your business profit. Because upselling and cross-selling use AI to predict customer behavior, you can offer your clients better-suited offers that reward them for the bigger purchase.</p><p>Since your loyal consumers are aware of your brand, they can take advantage of a good deal and be happy. You will be astounded by the way how most people embrace&nbsp;deals!</p> 6. Free marketing <p>Instead of spending 1000’s of dollars trying to figure out the market and swearing Facebook and Google about their ever-changing algorithms, you can sit comfortably and watch how word of mouth marketing can benefit your business passively.</p> 7. Access to precious customer&nbsp;data <p>Brands can implement a loyalty program that collects critical data and leverages customer behavior with machine learning to improve the customer journey across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Clients are more willing to share data with businesses they know which can be your key to success. You can personalize their experience, building an even more solid emotional foundation.</p> The Psychology Behind Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Loyalty programs and all the tools that calculate progress and track results are based on real-world research made by leading psychologists. There are several pivotal principles when it comes to the psychology of&nbsp;loyalty.</p> First impression matters more than anything&nbsp;else <p>The first impression of your ecommerce store proceeds even the first purchase by your customer.</p><p>According to research, 94% of first impressions are design-related, so you should invest in looks just as much as giving your clients different freebies and discounts.</p><p>A good loyalty program lies on the foundation of an attractive proposal that is “dressed” well. The color theory plays a huge role-branded colors can give an additional boost to any loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Positive reinforcement for forming a&nbsp;habit <p>Positive reinforcement is a reward that gives a positive outcome after completing an action. Giving your customers a positive stimulus makes them more likely to respond to it. The greatest loyalty programs are fueled by positive reinforcement. Rewarding users for their loyalty and interaction with your brand encourages them to keep participating in that behavior.</p><p>While using this technique can make driving permanent, consistent behavior patterns easier, it’s essential to be thoughtful about approaching your rewards system. But if you do, purchasing from your store might become as light as buying goods from the local grocery store -a&nbsp;habit.</p> Applying the “Rule of The&nbsp;Boxes” <p>Typically, if users choose between two products, they pick the cheaper one. If Product A costs $50 but offers 2–3 key functions while Product B costs $100 but offers 10–15 key features, people will choose the cheaper&nbsp;option.</p><p>However, if we add something in between-Product C, which costs $80 but has 8–12 options, people will find it the best deal. That’s the rule of the&nbsp;boxes.</p> The goal gradient&nbsp;effect <p>The goal gradient theory proves that consumers are motivated to make more purchases when closer to achieving their goals. The goal gradient theory focuses on the relationship between effort and the level of motivation that goes into attaining specific&nbsp;goals.</p><p>The goal gradient effect is easily accessible. For example, many cafeterias offer a free coffee for every ten orders, making customers more prone to purchase to get the&nbsp;freebie.</p> The FOMO&nbsp;effect <p>FOMO (in short for “Fear of Missing Out”) is a very popular effect. Research shows that we’re more motivated to avoid losing something than earning it. This is called loss aversion, and recently it’s been applied to loyalty programs.</p><p>Loss aversion explains the difference between a one-time point-based survey and a rewards program; instead of earning points, customers are motivated when they see how many points they can&nbsp;lose.</p><p>In the sports betting industry, it’s a common strategy to offer customers to cash out. If they are betting on 5–6 events, they can cash out (while missing some of the potential profit) but keep some of their profits, or keep playing and lose everything, including their&nbsp;bets.</p> A sense of exclusivity <p>As humans, we’re naturally attracted to the feeling of gaining social status. High-tier rewards give shoppers an excellent reason to keep coming back and incentivize them to spend&nbsp;more.</p><p>People can easily find this exclusivity effect in real life. For example, the famous travel website Booking gives its users an additional discount if they reach a certain level (Genius 1, Genius 2, Genius). They have to book more holidays within a certain period to achieve&nbsp;it.</p> Increased commitment <p>Once customers have invested in your brand, they’re more likely to remain loyal than if they had only entered your&nbsp;store.</p><p>The “sunk cost fallacy” is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals see investment as an increase in their own worth, so any withdrawal from that investment becomes a loss of personal&nbsp;value.</p><p>In other words, the more your customers engage with your ecommerce store, the more likely they are to keep purchasing from&nbsp;you.</p><p>PS: want to learn more about the topic? Then read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">customer commitment here</a>.</p> Summary <p>Loyalty programs are the backbone of almost any business, but businesses must constantly innovate to avoid becoming complacent and falling behind. Customer perception is crucial-marketers can customize everything from rewards to customer engagement techniques to appeal to audiences’ mindsets.</p><p>Rewards are the most direct way for customers to appreciate your brand-they give people something they want, so long as they continue buying your product or&nbsp;service.</p><p>And as you already saw, understanding and leveraging psychology will not only give you short-term results, but it will help your business succeed in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Did you like this article?

We all know the consequences - username and password still being the dominant paradigm and, even more important, users not having control over information that personally identifies them. The risk of data misuse, of being hacked or manipulated has become a significant challenge and and requires a new approach in times of an emerging web3 and its core capability of transferring value.

  <p>Trust is not just technical, and it’s not just derived from a process or an organisation. The need for Trust is also variable based on the risk involved in a transaction or the risk appetite of the service provider. Sometimes trust is almost irrelevant. Digital doesn’t make things any easier as we often have multiple parties involved in the communication of trust from issuer to holder of credentials, and on to a relying service not to mention requirements for onboarding, verification, issuance, and authentication to name but a few along the way.</p>
<p>Emerging standards and relentless innovation make many things better, but they also introduce challenges when we want multiple systems to work together and for trust to be largely independent of the underlying technical stacks.</p>
<p>To make Trust work in diverse ecosystems we need clear rules of engagement that champion the needs of all participants and clearly define their responsibilities to one another, and to the wider legal and business ecosystems they ultimately interact with. Efforts in multiple jurisdictions in both the public and private sector are developing these rule sets right now – this is what we can learn from the rise of the Trust Framework.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-cooper-trust-rules"></a>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>IIW was established in 2005, and boasts over a hundred sponsors, with hundreds in attendance. As the focus is on “getting things done” the agenda is created live each day by attendees present at the opening of the day, giving you the opportunity to establish what you want to talk about and getting the real time ability to see which topics others will be deliberating that you might want to join in on.</p>
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.”</p>
<p>The Take Aways</p>
<p>Because of the unique style of this conference you are sure to take part in, sit in on, or just overhear a variety of conversations on all kinds of work in the identity space. Here are some of the topics Indicio’s team at IIW found interesting.</p>
<p>Trust registries and Machine Readable Governance: The question, “How do we know which Issuers to trust?” was brought up several times at IIW with “Trust registries” being a common response. But&nbsp; there seemed to be a division over what a trust registry is or should be. One interpretation saw it as a third party fulfilling a top-down, command-and-control, pay-to-play, API-to-call function in determining which credential issuers can be trusted. The other saw it as something collaborative, a resource for governance files that allows those files to be cacheable among agents through machine readable governance. This triggered interest in what machine readable governance was, how it made a trust registry portable,&nbsp; and how it could be implementedThere</p>
<p>DIDComm as a Control Channel: This concept is all about using DIDcomm as a coordinating service, connecting two endpoints that want to communicate and handling everything from authentication to coordinating money transfers or shipping details, while also adding an additional security layer for the end user. While it was a new idea to many, there were a few people that raised their hands and said that they have already implemented something like this and showed some real world examples, increasing excitement around the possibilities and promoting further adoption.</p>
<p>Interoperability: As usual, many people were concerned with how to solve interoperability challenges in the community. The crowd was very keen on the idea of running an Aries Interop-a-thon (based on the hackathon style events Indicio has run for the Cardea Project at Linux Foundation Public Health) The idea that IIW tickets be issued as credentials so the community can personally test its solutions and try to iron out some of the interoperability challenges was proposed, and has a good chance of moving forward.</p>
<p>The really thought provoking discussion was about the current state of identity interoperability vs interoperability in other areas of tech. When compared to browsers, it was said it is tempting to feel like we are in the Netscape era of standardization. When in reality we are likely more in line with the Compuserve-AOL era of standardization and have much further&nbsp; to go.</p>
<p>AnonCreds VS W3C JSON-LD Creds: Our team expected some disagreement about this topic, but both sides seemed to realize that delivery is what matters here, and additional argument isn’t going to help. Multiple sessions were run trying to identify which credential format to use, resulting in 7+ different formats being discussed, with Anoncreds &amp; W3C JSON-LD being the most popular for debate. The ISO mDL 18013-5 credential format was also brought up for use in drivers licenses.</p>
<p>Why should you participate in the next IIW?</p>
<p>No wrap up or bullet point list can capture every conversation. This year was the first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic and every member of our team was excited to go.</p>
<p>While it was cheaper to attend over zoom, the conversational opportunities presented by in-person attendance—the ability to to really dig into the technology, simply don’t occur online. While this could be said for any conference, the unconference style of IIW encourages much greater audience participation. The number of engineers in these discussions drives challenging, exciting, and insightful ideas, so much so in fact, that In the middle of this IIW they decided to do the next one in person, rather than one remote and one in person per year as had been previously planned.</p>
<p>And worse case scenario, you can use the opportunity of bringing your team together for some sweet photo ops like our team did.</p>
<p>Tickets sell out quickly so for more information and to make sure you can join the next event we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW website</a>!</p>

<p>Es zirkulieren falsche Annahmen und Missverständnisse in den Medien über das Potenzial und die Risiken von SSI. In diesem Artikel setzen wir uns mit einigen Missverständnissen auseinander und fassen die wichtigsten Kernthesen über SSI zusammen. So entsteht am Ende ein übersichtliches Bild darüber, was SSI ist, und vor allem: was SSI nicht ist und sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Können SSI Daten gestohlen und ohne mein Wissen verwendet werden? Ermöglicht SSI einen Datenmarkt und weiteren Missbrauch von unseren Daten?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei SSI stehen die selbstbestimmte Nutzung und gleichzeitige Datensicherheit für das Individuums im Mittelpunkt. Gleichzeitig ist Datensparsamkeit wichtig: der User sollte immer nur das erforderliche Minimum der Informationen über sich preisgeben müssen, das für die Nutzung eines Dienstes notwendig ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man die Daten gibt, nicht aber, was mit ihnen passiert – was keine technische Frage ist, sondern den Trust Frameworks und der Umsetzung von Policies geschuldet. Dies wird über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt, da so Vertrauen in die am Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure hergestellt werden kann. SSI selbst bietet keinen allgemeinen Schutz vor Datenmissbrauch. Dennoch stellt es die Möglichkeit dar, durch das Prinzip der Dezentralität die eigenen Daten sicher und selbstbestimmt zu verwalten. Die Dienste, an welche man persönliche Daten übermittelt, sind letztendlich ebenfalls an die Datenschutzgrundverordnung gebunden. Man kann nicht nur entscheiden, wem man die Daten gibt, sondern auch wie (bspw. als ZKP oder als VP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso bietet SSI mehr privacy als derzeitige Systeme?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weil wir unsere Daten nicht an Hunderte von Plattformen auslagern, sondern zentral bei uns verwalten. So wären im Idealfall beim Hack eines Dienstes keine Tausende von Userprofilen mit sensiblen Daten zu erbeuten, sondern nur wertlose peer to peer connects. Dadurch entstehen mehr Privatsphäre und Eigenverantwortung über die persönlichen Daten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allan steht: Der User kann und soll selbst entscheiden, wem er oder sie persönliche Daten zeigt und wofür. Voraussetzung dafür ist Interoperabilität und Portabilität der Identitäten. Diese Idee ist gewissermaßen der Kern von SSI. Doch die Aussage, dass ich als User die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe, wird oft missverstanden und ist in dieser Form falsch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ist SSI mit Klarnamenpflicht gleich zu setzen und verliere ich meine Anonymität?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welche Daten ein Dienst einfordert liegt beim Dienst und an den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Ist der Dienstanbieter nicht an eine Klarnamenpflicht gebunden, also nicht verpflichtet einen Klarnamen abzufragen und zu überprüfen so kann er das auch nicht vom Nutzer einfordern (nach Datenschutzgrundverordnung). Tut er dies trotzdem, muss der Benutzer zustimmen und es muss ein konkreter Grund genannt werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso hat SSI nichts mit Blockchain zu tun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI wird oft mit der Blockchain Technologie gleichgesetzt. Dadurch entsteht der Eindruck, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit Blockchain funktionieren kann. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall. Wir haben eine umfassende Erklärung hier zusammengefasst: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we released a new version of Holochain Launcher with a lot of new features. I took it for a test run and I have to say… I'm excited. It feels like something my dad could actually use! The new Launcher is much more welcoming to non-technical users. I’m going to unbox it below, but first, the Holochain release notes for this week.</p> Holochain 0.0.139: Keystore version bump, simpler link CRUD <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131, 0.0.132<br>Compatible Lair version: 0.1.3</p><p>This release is another small one, albeit with a couple meaningful changes for devs and users:</p>  The compatible Lair keystore has been bumped to version 0.1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1377">#1377</a>). This brings mostly documentation updates, but also fixes a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/all-agents-busy-please-stand-by/#holochain-00137">bug</a> involving spaces in Lair’s socket/pipe path (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">lair #91</a>) and gets more strict about the version of Lair that it intends to connect to (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/95">lair #95</a>).  The link CRUD functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now take any DHT hash that can be converted to a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/prelude/type.AnyLinkableHash.html">linkable hash</a>, rather than requiring you to convert it yourself. On the flip side, entry, header, and external hashes now have <code>Into&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> implementations to make this all possible. Surprisingly, this isn’t a breaking change, as it all happens in the HDK before getting sent to the host. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1365">#1365</a>)   Unboxing the user-friendly Launcher 0.4.4 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.132, 0.0.136</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>, it’s a user-friendly manager for running hApps. This will eventually be our end-user offering, and one of the primary ways you’ll be able to distribute web-based hApps to your users.</p><p>Version 0.4.4 is a huge jump toward the goal of user-friendliness, in a few ways:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a>, a built-in package manager that lets your users download and install hApps right from within the Launcher!  It supports multiple Holochain versions, which means that you don’t have to worry quite as much about whether your users have the right Launcher installed. It also means they also won’t have to perform any more factory resets and lose their data!  <p>Okay, let’s unbox this thing.</p> 1. First run <p>Here’s something new: When you start up Launcher 0.4.4 for the first time, there’s already a hApp running! It’s the first public preview of the new DevHub hApp. (I’ll talk more about that at the bottom of this Dev Pulse.)</p> 2. hApp Library <p>If you click on the ‘Install new app’ button, instead of getting a file dialog, you see the new App Library! It’s powered by the DevHub DNA, and it lets you download, install, and start a hApp with just a couple of clicks. Currently there’s only one hApp with a public release, called Notebooks, but it’s a fun one.</p> 3. Installing a hApp <p>As you can see, I didn’t have to hunt around for a hApp bundle file on the internet, and I didn’t have to hunt for the downloaded file on my device’s storage. The Launcher just downloaded Notebooks and showed me a simplified installation dialog. The membrane proof fields are hidden; all I have to do is change the hApp’s name if I feel like it.</p> 4. Behold, a newly installed hApp <p>Now I have two hApps, DevHub and Notebooks. They each require a different conductor version, but that’s no problem; you can see that Launcher started up 0.0136 automatically for me. Users probably won’t notice or care about this detail, but what it means for them is that It Just Works.</p> 5. Using Notebooks for the first time <p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a> is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to HackMD or Google Docs. It’s built using a framework called <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a>, created by Eric Harris-Braun and his son last year. I’d like to say more about Notebooks, but for brevity’s sake I’ll say this: I was surprised by how delightful it was to use. The real-time editing experience is smooth and snappy, just like you’d expect from a cloud app. But I’m comforted by the knowedge that all the stuff I care about is on my machine!</p><blockquote>So, now that you’ve seen the new Launcher, why not <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.4">give it a try</a>? I invite non-developers to try it out too!</blockquote> DevHub public preview <p>So the other big news that got bundled with Launcher 0.4.4 is, of course, the first public preview of the DevHub hApp. It’s not ready for prime time yet (that will likely happen after the Stable Validation milestone) but I’m still excited by the possibilities it hints at.</p><p>So what is DevHub? If you’re a developer, it’s easiest to think of it as a package manager and distributed repository for hApps, built on Holochain. You can distribute releases of your zomes, DNAs, hApps, and web-based UIs for other developers to remix, or for users to download.</p><p>If you’re a user, it’s like an open-source hApp store or library. As we’ve seen, the Launcher can talk to the DevHub DNA natively, giving it the power to search, download, install, and update hApps.</p><p>The DevHub hApp comes with a web-based GUI that attempts to serve both devs and users. In the future, it will split into two GUIs — one specifically tailored to devs, and a user-focused ‘hApp store’ experience.</p><p>This demonstrates that you don’t have to use a hApp’s default UI — you can fork it, create your own, or even build it into a desktop app, as the Launcher’s native support demonstrates. This is what happens when an app’s API is totally accessible to you on your machine. It’s all under your control!</p> Unboxing the DevHub GUI <p>Now let’s take a look at this first iteration of the DevHub GUI. It’s being redesigned at the moment, but this will give you a taste of what the DNA is meant for.</p> 1. Main page <p>When you open up the GUI, you see a listing of hApp packages, sorted by date. You can get info on a package, add your own hApp, or choose instead to look at individual DNAs and zomes if you’re interested in remixing and creating your own hApp.</p> 2. hApp info page <p>Let’s take a look at the Notebooks listing. We can see some information about the hApp — what it’s for, how fresh it is, who wrote it, etc. Below that, you can see all the individual releases of the hApp.</p> 3. Release page <p>Let’s take a look at the 0.0.1 release of Notebooks. It was published on 9 May 2022, and we can see the changelog. To the right we can see the DNAs that comprise it — `syn` and `notebooks` — and download a headless `.happ` package or a full `.webhapp` package.</p><p>That’s all for now — once I learn more about DevHub I’d like to do a more in-depth study of what it can do!</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>To the ShareRing Community,</p>



<p>It’s been a tough few days for many people and we understand that the resulting challenges may be with us for quite some time. Transparency drives the core values of ShareRing, and we aim to maintain a level of consistency in being transparent with you, our community members who have supported us through the highs and lows.</p>



<p>As a company we have always strived to maintain consistent transaction fees, in particular when it is within our control. When external protocols are required in the transaction, it becomes more challenging to do so. The average cost of Ethereum transaction fees have risen exponentially over the last few days, and as a result we are going to temporarily increase the swap out fees from SLP3 to ERC20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swap out fees will be increased from 5000 SHR to 10,000 SHR. This takes effect immediately as of the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Our team closely monitors the market costs and we are always positioned to make the necessary adjustments to reflect the trends.</p>



<p>The ShareRing Community has always been the core of our business, and we endeavour to work through the challenges together, as a whole. Short term challenges prepare us for prospective growth and we look towards the shining light at the end of the tunnel, not just as a community and company, but the industry a whole.</p>



<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jonathon, </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The need for authentication standards 
<p>In the cybersecurity industry, many new technologies–particularly those related to identity management and authentication–are constantly driving change and innovation. Yet one thing remains the same: the use of passwords continues to pose a threat to an organization’s IT security. As long as passwords continue to be used, users and organizations will remain vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, due to the development of new solutions and authentication standards, replacing passwords as the dominant form of authentication on the Internet now seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Various annual surveys demonstrate that password compromises are associated with 70-80% of data breaches. As a response to the over-reliance on passwords, the non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. With the help of the FIDO Alliance, a set of open, scalable, and interoperable specifications has been developed to replace passwords as a secure authentication method for online services. The alliance has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems.</p>
 <br>FIDO Alliance reveals its latest whitepaper 
<p>Most recently, the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group published a whitepaper in March 2022 explaining how the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials will enable FIDO technology to supplant passwords for many consumer use cases. The framework goes further by outlining two proposals for phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms:</p>
 
 Using your phone as a roaming authenticator: Essentially, this involves connecting the user's smartphone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate via Bluetooth. Since Bluetooth requires physical presence, the use of proximity-based authentication should be resistant to any phishing attacks. As a result, the smartphone becomes a sort of smart card while providing the necessary FIDO requirements to the device from which the user is trying to authenticate. 
 
 
 Multi-device FIDO credentials: To improve user experience, the second proposal encourages FIDO authenticator vendors to adapt their authenticators in the event of lost or stolen devices. As users move from device to device, FIDO credentials should be available on a user’s new device without the need of implementing a password.&nbsp; For example, a smartphone, a desktop, and a USB token could act as a mutually exchangeable FIDO authenticator. 
 
<p>The whitepaper argues that the syncing of FIDO credentials, together with the Bluetooth alternative, allows FIDO authentication to be a secure and convenient solution for existing two-factor deployments. Furthermore, the paper makes it clear that the proposal is not a change in standards, but rather a set of prescriptions for vendors to implement themselves.</p>
<p><br>However, there is one crucial point that the FIDO and WebAuthn proposals seem to ignore. So far, the whitepaper has not specified whether users will feel comfortable with a password successor where the cloud operator has access to secret keys. If users roam enterprise-issued keys via potentially insecure clouds, organizations must understand the risks that come with convenience when syncing is not end-to-end secured.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it comes down to what end users will do and only time will tell if they are willing to trust<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless"> Microsoft</a>,<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/protect-gce-vms-with-managed-fido-security-keys"> Google</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos/">Apple</a> as the ultimate confidants of their organization's credentials.</p>
<p><br>In addition, if the deprovisioning of access within applications is not properly implemented, former employees might gain access to cloud-based applications when leaving an organization and returning their physical FIDO key. By not having proper controls in place, this new level of convenience will increase the risk and reduce the level of control an organization is able to exert.<br>Therefore, KuppingerCole believes that companies and other organizations that are looking to modernize and improve authentication solutions should understand the consequences beforehand. If done right, this solution has the potential to provide a frictionless user experience while improving security at the same time. We expect to see a significant number of FIDO authenticators, vendors, servers, and compatible web apps in industry over the course of the next few years.</p>

<p>Nel corso di questi ultimi anni una serie&nbsp;di progetti innovativi, come&nbsp;l’invio digitale, certificato e sicuro, delle comunicazioni di inizio quarantena per Covid da parte dei medici di base ai propri assistiti&nbsp;o&nbsp;ancora, la raccolta del consenso informato dematerializzato dell’avvio della campagna vaccinale di inizio 2021 hanno contribuito in maniera forte alla digitalizzazione nel campo sanitario.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’obiettivo è giungere a una digitalizzazione completa di tutte le fasi dell’iter pre-intervento di un paziente per garantire ai cittadini maggiore efficienza e anche migliore qualità di comunicazione con le strutture sanitarie.”</p>Carmine Auletta, CISO di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>Negli ultimi anni la sanità è stata oggetto di numerosi&nbsp;cambiamenti, dettati prima dalla pandemia e ora dagli investimenti in ambito Pnrr. In questo contesto numerose sono state le soluzioni digitali adottate nel campo sanitario, facendo sì che ad oggi la digitalizzazione della sanità risulti essere uno dei pilastri dei recovery plan di tutta Europa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>InfoCert è da sempre protagonista della digitalizzazione nel mondo Health Care grazie soprattutto a LegalCare e ProxySign, le soluzioni Trust studiate per la digitalizzazione dei processi&nbsp;di lavoro clinici e amministrativi e già adottate da importanti Aziende Sanitarie Italiane.&nbsp;</p>

 Ionic is a framework for building mobile apps with web technologies that look and act like native apps.
Because they’re built with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), you can also deploy your Ionic apps as single-page applications.
Or, even better, as progressive web apps (PWAs) that work offline.

<p>Ionic supports the big three web frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.
Once you’ve written your app, you can deploy it to a simulator or device with <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/">Capacitor</a>.
Capacitor (pictured as the blue layer) provides the runtime for your app to communicate with the native operating system and vice versa.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Ionic’s main competitors are native apps built with Swift or Objective-C (for iOS) and Java or Kotlin (for Android).
Ionic also competes with React Native, which uses web technologies and translates them to native components.</p>
 
 
<p>The Ionic blog has a recent post that <a href="https://ionicframework.com/blog/ionic-vs-react-native-performance-comparison/">does a performance comparison between Ionic and React Native</a>.
TL;DR: Both options will give you a high-performance app with a truly native look and feel.</p>

 What the heck is JHipster? 
 
 
<p>This tutorial will show you how to use Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor to build a mobile app that talks to a Spring Boot backend. It won’t take but a few minutes, thanks to JHipster!</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an application generator that creates an Angular frontend and a Spring Boot backend based on the options you choose. It has the ability for you, as a developer, to customize what it generates with blueprints. The blueprints feature has resulted in many additional options for an app: Kotlin, Spring Native, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET Core, NestJS, and Svelte.</p>
 
 
<p>Below is a diagram of the app you’ll create in this tutorial and its authentication flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 ✨ Introducing the JHipster Ionic blueprint! 
 
 
<p>The JHipster project has supported generating an Ionic app using a <code>generator-jhipster-ionic</code> module for the past several years.
As the primary maintainer of this module, I’m proud to announce that it has been re-written as a blueprint, and it’s much easier to understand now.
The previous module relied on the Ionic CLI, the base Angular <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/starters">starter</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/ionic-jhipster-starter">Ionic JHipster starter</a>, and custom code to glue it all together.
Now, the source code is all contained in one project.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to do the conversion, and after a couple of months, I’m proud to say the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-ionic">JHipster Ionic blueprint</a> is now available!</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Ionic for <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JHipster</a> v8 is now available! There's lots to love in this release:<br><br>💙 Now available as a blueprint<br>🧪 Migrated from Protractor to Cypress<br>⭐️ <a href="https://twitter.com/auth0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Auth0</a> support<br>🅰️ Upgraded to Angular 13 and Ionic 6<br><br>✨ <a href="https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP">https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ionic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ionic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jhipster?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jhipster</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/angular?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#angular</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springboot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#springboot</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1523893356744609792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>ionic-app</code> directory alongside your JHipster app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- backend
- ionic-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Navigate into <code>ionic-app</code> using your terminal.
Install Ionic for JHipster and create a new app using <code>jhipster-ionic</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted for the location of your JHipster app, a name for your Ionic app, and then you’ll be off to the races!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also create a JHipster app and an Ionic app simultaneously by using the bundled JHipster.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir bug-tracker &amp;&amp; cd bug-tracker
jhipster-ionic jdl bug-tracker.jh
cd ../ionic4j</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will follow the same convention where the generated backend and frontend apps are side-by-side on your hard drive.</p>
 
 
<p>Then you can run both apps from your Ionic app using easy-to-remember commands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal window
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 






The JHipster Ionic blueprint currently only supports Angular.
Now that it’s a blueprint, it will be much easier to add support for Vue and React.
If you’re interested in helping out, please let me know!
Okta is a platinum sponsor of the JHipster project and enjoys assigning <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%24%24+bug-bounty+%24%24%22">bug bounties</a> for feature development.



 
 
 
 
 Build a mobile app with Ionic and Angular 
 
 
<p>To see Ionic + JHipster in action, let’s start with a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java + React app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>.
I updated the app to the latest version of JHipster (v7.8.1) and created an Ionic app with JHipster Ionic, so everything is guaranteed to work.
This Flickr clone allows you to upload photos, tag them, and organize them into albums.
First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example.git \
  jhipster-ionic --depth 1
cd jhipster-ionic/backend</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker
./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser.
Sign in with <code>admin/admin</code> credentials and rejoice when it all works.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window and enter the <code>jhipster-ionic/ionic-app</code> directory.
Install its dependencies and run <code>npm start</code> to test the Ionic client.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to sign in and add a new photo.</p>
 

  
    
    
  
  
    
    
  

 
<p>Please keep reading to learn how JHipster made all of this possible.
Or, skip ahead to <a>run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 How to integrate Ionic and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>JHipster makes it easy to create a Spring Boot API that Spring Security protects.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint generates an Ionic client that talks to your Spring Boot API and understands its auth mechanism.
I created the <code>jhipster-ionic</code> project using the following steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Install the JHipster Ionic blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster-ionic@8.0.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a parent directory to hold everything:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># take is a shortcut for mdkir &amp;&amp; cd
take jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Clone an existing JHipster Flickr example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend --depth 1</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory to hold your Ionic project, then run <code>jhipster-ionic</code> in it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take ionic-app
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Provide the path to your backend JHipster app and name your app <code>flickr2</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s it!
The blueprint will generate an Ionic client, complete with screens for editing entities, unit tests, and end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
<p>Pretty slick, don’t you think?!
😎</p>
 
 
 Run your Spring Boot API 
 
<p>You’ll need to start your backend first, so your Ionic app can talk to its API.
First, start Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker containers:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd backend
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, update <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> to allow CORS from <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100'
    allowed-methods: '*'
    allowed-headers: '*'
    exposed-headers: 'Authorization,Link,X-Total-Count,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-alert,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-error,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-params'
    allow-credentials: true
    max-age: 1800</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start the backend app using <code>./mvnw -Pprod</code>.
You should be able to log in at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> (with <code>admin/admin</code>) and add new photos using Entities &gt; Photos.
Add a few photos so you have some data to work with.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app 
 
<p>Open another terminal and navigate to the <code>ionic-app</code> folder.
Launch your Ionic client using  <code>npm start</code>.
In your default browser, the app will be opened at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in with Keycloak and see all the listed entities in your app.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>In the JHipster app’s tutorial, there’s a section where you’re instructed to remove photo fields that can be calculated.
Specifically, height, width, date taken, and date uploaded.
These values are calculated when the photos are uploaded, so there’s no reason to display them when adding a photo.</p>
 
 
<p>To add this same functionality to your Ionic app, modify <code>src/app/pages/entities/photo/photo-update.html</code> and wrap these fields with <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label position="floating"&gt;Height&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-input type="number" name="height" formControlName="height"&gt;&lt;/ion-input&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
  ...
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label&gt;Uploaded&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm" formControlName="uploaded" id="field_uploaded"&gt;&lt;/ion-datetime&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The Ionic CLI will auto-compile and reload the app in your browser when you save this file.
You can prove everything works as expected by stopping your app (with Ctrl+C) and running all the end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor 
 
 
<p>Generate a native iOS project with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic build
npx ionic capacitor add ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add your custom scheme (<code>dev.localhost.ionic</code>) to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>.
This scheme is configured in <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>; you can easily change it to something else if you like.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;dev.localhost.ionic&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings (in <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code>) to allow <code>capacitor://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app.
Deploy your Ionic app to iOS Simulator and run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Confirm you can log in and rejoice in your success!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on Android 
 
 
<p>Generate an Android project with Capacitor.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic capacitor add android</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Enable clear text traffic and add <code>dev.localhost.ionic</code> as a scheme in <code>android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;activity ... android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
  &lt;!-- You'll need to add this intent filter so redirects work --&gt;
  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt;
    &lt;data android:scheme="dev.localhost.ionic" /&gt;
    &lt;!--data android:scheme="com.okta.dev-133337" /--&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;

  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings to allow <code>http://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app and run your Ionic app on Android using the Capacitor CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 






If you get an error when running this command, make sure to use Java 11.



 
 
<p>You’ll need to run a couple of commands to allow the emulator to communicate with JHipster and Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in and edit entities, just like you can in a browser and on iOS!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Why use OpenID Connect for mobile apps? 
 
 
<p>Storing <a>API keys and secrets in mobile apps is not safe</a>.
OAuth 2.0 solves this problem by not shipping any secrets in mobile apps and instead involving the user in the process of getting an access token into the app.
These access tokens are unique per user, and they’re updated every time the user logs in.
The <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE extension</a> provides a solution for securely doing the OAuth flow on a mobile app even when there is no pre-provisioned secret.</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to access an API from a mobile app, hopefully, it supports OAuth and PKCE!
Thankfully most of the hard work of PKCE is handled by SDKs like <a href="https://appauth.io/">AppAuth</a>, so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.
If you’re working with an API like Okta, then Okta’s SDKs do PKCE automatically, so you don’t have to worry about it.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-appauth">Ionic AppAuth</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The previous sections showed you how to use Keycloak as your identity provider. If you’re deploying to production, you might not want to manage your users and authentication system. That’s where Okta and Auth0 can help!</p>
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Okta 
 
<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up for one</a> or run <code>okta register</code> after installing the Okta CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to change your JHipster app to use Okta, the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes this as easy as <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.
This command creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file you can source to override the default Keycloak settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw -Pprod</code> 
 
 
 
<p>With Keycloak, you don’t need a separate OIDC app for Ionic.
With Okta, you do.
See JHipster’s documentation to learn <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta">how to create a native app for Ionic on Okta</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>After you’ve changed the client ID in your Ionic app, run it using <code>npm start</code>.
You’ll be prompted to log in using your Okta credentials at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Auth0 
 
<p>To switch your identity provider to Auth0, you first need an <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Auth0 account</a>.
Then, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file and see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#auth0">JHipster’s Auth0 docs</a> for how to populate it.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-auth0">configure a native app for Ionic on Auth0</a>.
Once you’re finished updating your Ionic app with a new client ID and audience, you should be able to run your backend and new frontend client using the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .auth0.env
npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To see it in action on your mobile emulators, use the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run build

# iOS
npx cap run ios

# Android
npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about Ionic, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Ionic and the new Ionic blueprint for JHipster.
In my opinion, it’s pretty neat that you can rapidly prototype a mobile client for your JHipster.
It’s even better that you can use a leading-edge mobile application framework to do it.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example">@oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>



<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

  <p>SSI and Verifiable Credentials are the latest development in identity management. They offer many benefits over existing federated identity management systems. Unfortunately some proponents of SSI are mandating that companies implement decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and blockchains in order to benefit from SSI. This is not necessary. In fact the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Recommendation makes it clear that DIDs are not needed for verifiable credentials, and vice versa. DIDs and blockchains are something of a ball and chain around the legs of companies that want to benefit from SSI when leveraging their existing web based security infrastructures. This keynote talk will describe how it is possible to build standards compliant high performance, user friendly, SSI systems using the World Wide Web, Transport Layer Security, Jason Web Tokens, Web Authentication and X.509 public key certificates, allowing them to experience all the benefits of SSI without the ball and chain impediments of DIDs and blockchains. - the benefits of SSI over existing identity management systems - the downsides of DIDs and blockchains - the upsides of using existing World Wide Web infrastructure to build your SSI solution</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chadwick-implementing-ssi"></a>

  <p>&nbsp;As customer identity programs mature, they bring new opportunities and risks. In the rush to launch new customer experiences, personal data is over-exposed and over-replicated. The default is to ship all identity attributes, to all systems, on every request in order to make access decisioning easier for application developers.<br><br>This approach disperses identity information across the application stack; which increases risks of data breach, data loss, and compromised identities. As a result, consumers lose trust and new business opportunities falter; or worse, customers like the new experience, but its success creates security and compliance liabilities that expand exponentially. To remediate the risk, data teams enter a never-ending cycle of costly data analysis and audits.<br><br>Identity architects and developers need to address privacy requirements earlier - not in post-collection data management, but instead in the application development process. While Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default principles are a helpful framework, they offer little practical guidance for developers to actually build privacy-preserving applications.<br><br>We will discuss how to use identity data at run-time, in the context of the application; how to retrofit existing applications with privacy requirements; and how to easily evolve applications over time.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-upadhyaya-privacy-identity-aware"></a>

  <p>Mergers and acquisitions amongst large, globally-distributed organizations are notoriously complex, error-prone, and resource consuming. But did you know that merging smaller organizations comes with its own set of unique issues and risks? One year ago, Okta announced its acquisition of Auth0. Since then, the combined forces of their internal business systems teams have been working hard to bring the identity and compliance capabilities of the organizations together. The union of these two companies introduced some novel challenges- even for veteran practitioners with experience in IAM mergers at much larger organizations. In this talk Jon Lehtinen will take you on a guided tour of the Okta/Auth0 identity merger from a practitioner’s perspective, and share the learnings, the challenges, and the recommendations for other practitioners tasked with merging the IAM programs within smaller, high-growth companies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-lehtinen-identity-m-and-a"></a>

  <p>A practical approach to cyber security architectures: In a hybrid ecosystem we have not only to find a suitable security model for IT but also for OT like in production environments. And after all cloud services are adding another dimension of complexity. We will take a short look at the security basics, compare some outdated, updated and up-to-date security models finding suitable models for IT-security, OT-security and cloud-security. Finally we will put it all together in combined scenarios. This presentation will focus on practical security architecture rather than on formal compliance.</p>

While new forms of ID verification are most prevalent today with Financial Services as a means of performing Know-Your-Customer regulations, there is nascent adoption across other industry verticals. In this session, the speakers will demonstrate an open standard based approach to ID verification based on verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers for remote onboarding across industries. With this new approach users can verify their identity once and use their credentials with any organization. Enterprises can leverage this simpler cost-saving approach to remotely onboard employees, partners and customers compliantly while respecting the end users’ privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-patel-remote-onboarding-verifiable-credentials"></a>

  <p>Security vs experience. Platform vs best of breed. Fast vs thorough. The identity technology world forces us to make trade-offs. These difficult decisions are an endless exercise in technical and logistical nuances like developer and IT resources, product licenses, integrations, and deployment methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get ready! We are entering an era where IAM professionals can rise above those tradeoffs, and rapidly evolve from technical experts to experience artists by using solutions that customize, code, and integrate for you. This means humans can focus on what humans do best: creating amazing experiences, differentiating from competitors, reacting to market trends, leveraging innovations like decentralized identity and partnering with business owners to anticipate and exceed user expectations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-worley-human-centric-identity"></a>

  <p>We are in the mid of one of the most significant revolutions in the cloud and identity ecosystem since the last decade. With the dynamic transformation from Web2.0 to Web3.0, both the cloud as well as the identity ecosystem embrace themselves for a change in the way we perceived security. Blockchain is revolutionizing both the cloud industry as well as the financial sectors. In my talk, I will focus on the transformative impact of blockchain protocols like Filecoin and Storj which are playing a significant role in changing the way we have perceived cloud storage. Decentralized Cloud Storage will be the future for sustainable data storage in Web 3.0, in which we will move from a single service provider to create an ecosystem where anybody could be a cloud storage provider. Highly successful blockchain projects like Filecoin have been able to create such an ecosystem. But we are far away from attending the level of scale needed to reach out to every corner of the globe. Decentralized Cloud Storage poses a different set of security challenges and scalability issues. I will be presenting my research work which focuses on the new advances in tackling future security threats for decentralized cloud storage. Additionally, I will focus on discussing how to overcome scalability issues in the blockchain using the most advanced cryptographical tools knowns as zk-SNARKs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-kundu-decentralized-cloud"></a>

   The cyberssecurity approaches and strategies that works well for a multinational with a large and well funded cybersecurity department may not be as applicable for a mid sized company where the security department may be a single person. 
 
 Still if the partner company that delivers the cheese to a retailer falls to a cybersecurity attack there is simply no cheese to sell to the customers so the retailer not only looses money but also fails at their most basic task. So how do we as multinationals help our partners with implementing basic controls such as PAM in a way that works in their business reality? 
 
 In this session we will be looking at how you as a relatively cybersecurity mature company can do to help your less mature partners. It is also suitable for persons who has been asked to launch a cybersecurity or PAM program without been given the full resource to execute a full program. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-sandren-pam-for-the-people"></a>

New technologies like Privacy-ABC based on ZKP were ready to provide the user with control over how much personal data he wants to disclose, while promising, commercial solutions were neither accepted by the market nor solving the problem of reliability of transactions exhaustively. Today, the new decentralized digital identity model of Self-Sovereign Identity, utilizing verifiable credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, is giving new hope of finding sustainable solutions. This session will map out the main questions around privacy within this context:</p>
 
 What are the privacy pros and cons of a blockchain-based identity management system based on an “European Digital Identity Wallet”? 
 What are key pain points of the emerging "European Autonomous Identity Framework" (ESSIF) compatibility with GDPR? Is there “enough privacy” in eIDAS 2.0? 
 How can one trust that the entity issuing the credentials is in fact the entity that it claims to be?

  <p>David will talk aboout a new technology that allows the person owning a public key to prove that they have memorized a passphrase, from which they could at any time easily compute the private key.<br>One example use is for votexx.org elections, which are conducted remotely without polling places. The ballot-casting in such elections is done by a signature that is publicly verifiable as corresponding to a particular public key posted in advance by the election authority. The voter registration authority would require a proof that the voter knows the corresponding passphrase and hence ensures that the voter has irrevocable access to the private key corresponding to the posted public key. This lets the voter give all of their keys (in an extreme case) to a vote buyer and/or coercer – while the voter is never able to give up knowledge of the passphrase and the ability that it confers to secretly cancel any vote made with the corresponding private key. This is just one example David will feature in his presentation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chaum-credentials-privacy"></a>

The universe of  "all other identities"  is enormous, numbering in the billions and  maybe even the trillions of distinct and unique identities. In the absence of solutions and processes to actively manage and control the identities of contractors, service providers, agencies, franchisees and  all  the possible variations of people,  devices  and entities that your organization interacts with, accepting risk but not being able to  mitigate  it has been the normal course of business.

  <p>The third iteration of the Web, Web 3, aims to put more control over web content in users’ hands. It promises to be built on blockchain, eliminating all big intermediaries, including centralized governing bodies. The vision for a Web3 world is for people to control their own data and be able to bounce around from social media to email to shopping using a single personalized account, creating a public record on the blockchain of all of that activity. What does this mean from an identity management point of view? We will explore some important questions that should be addressed as the future of the internet unfolds, including the impact that limited oversight in crypto currency will have, including poor authentication; the role of decentralized identities and private key management; and finally, the privacy aspects of having transaction data on the blockchain and what that means for attackers that can potentially compile new identities or further identity theft as we know it today. Whether it is Web3 or beyond, these issues will be critical to build trust on the internet of the future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-zelazny-identity-management-web-3"></a>

   Gaia-X Federation Services is a European project that promotes innovation through data sharing and represents the next generation of the data infrastructure ecosystem. To see how we bring about an open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem, we thus share a practical example and working code of the Gaia-X for the Notarization API. 
 
 The aim of this product is to establish digital trust in disclosed data (paper or electronic) for Gaia-X participants to use in the Gaia-X ecosystem. To reach this goal, an issuance module to transform data into digital verifiable credential (VC) is needed. With this component, certification institutions such as government, lawyers, etc. are able to prove the identity and provide data of any organization that desires to be a Gaia-X participant. Thus deliver the desired verified attestation as a digital representation. 
 
 This use case on enterprise identity is an example of a contribution to the meta-platform concept: a platform that enables and fosters participant-controlled value transfer across and among other platforms and participants. An open, interoperable, portable, decentralized identity framework is thus a prime candidate for becoming such a meta-platform and for leveraging this aggregate network effect. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-stoecker-enterprise-identity-eu-gaia-x"></a>

  <p>Two decades of digital transformation and cloud migration have been slowly eroding the traditional network perimeter and with the past two years of transition to more remote work, the walls have come tumbling down. Privileged credentials from access tools (like VPN and RDP) that have been left on endpoints are a valuable target for attack. SAAS applications and Cloud access further expand the proliferation of potentially exposed identities. Once an attacker establishes initial access it becomes trivial for lateral attack movement to take control over critical systems or the entire network. The network perimeter is obsolete. Identity is the new perimeter. Organizations must discover, mitigate and protect their identity risks.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-halbartschlager-identity-perimeter"></a>

  <p>Again and again, I am asked how one can start with the topic of security in an agile project environment. What are the essential first steps, and what should you focus on at the beginning? Of course, this raises the question of suitable methodologies and tools. At the same time, the strategic orientation of the company must be included in this security strategy. We have also learned in the recent past that attacks like the “Solarwinds Hack” are becoming more and more sophisticated and that the attackers now focus on the entire value chain. What tools are there, and where should they be used? How can I start tomorrow to prepare myself for the future against the challenges of cyber attacks? And that’s exactly what you will get an answer to here.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-ruppert-solarwinds-cybersecurity"></a>

  <p>It is well known that women face various challenges when working in the IT industry. These challenges lead to the fact that only about 20% of employees in IT are women. The situation in security and identity is even worse, as some studies have shown. "Women in Identity" is a global organization whose mission is to develop solutions with diverse teams. This presentation will look at the various WID initiatives on a global and local level that support women in the industry and create solutions “for everyone built by everyone”.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-steinacker-challenges-for-women"></a>

  <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has reached the in-between stage: more than a concept, not yet fully deployed. This is where the work can get the most gruesome and exhausting, but also the most creative and rewarding. While the dedicated W3C standards are reaching maturity levels, we see regulators and government actors jump on board and asking for even more stability across specifications and standards in order to establish real world systems. In fact, we see large pilot projects and implementation programs worldwide. One promising but equally critical development is the eIDAS 2 regulation, &nbsp;promising dependable answers to questions about governance and trust frameworks that will drive adoption. This short deep dive will give you an orientation of the state of play for SSI in the context of these greater developments – and might provide an outlook for your projects as well.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-adamski-ssi-production"></a>

  <p>HTTP is an amazingly powerful protocol, and it's the lifeblood of the internet today. On the surface, it seems to be a simple protocol: send a request to a server and get back a response, and everything's structured in useful ways. HTTPS adds the TLS protocol to secure the connections between endpoints, protecting the messages with encryption and keeping them away from attacker's eyes. But what if you want to be sure the sender is the right sender, and what you see is what they sent? What if you've got a more complex deployment, with proxies and gateways in between your endpoints that mess with the contents of the message? What if you need assurances on the response as well as the request, and to tie them together? People have been trying to sign HTTP messages in various ways for a long time, but only recently has the HTTP Working Group picked up the problem. Come hear about the HTTP Message Signatures work from the draft specification's authors and see how it works, how to apply it, and talk about how it could change how we use the web.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-richer-http-message-signatures"></a>

<p>In traditional banking, to get a loan, make a deposit or speak to a banker, customers have usually traveled to a physical branch.</p>
 
<p>But today, more banking services are available digitally. As a complement to existing online banking services, innovators are building the new and improved financial experiences that consumers are looking for. These innovators may not even have a brick-and-mortar presence, but they add multiple layers of value on top of existing financial services.</p>
 
<p>The digital movement is giving customers more tools and options to build their financial lives in the way they see fit, and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is making this possible. Customers can now turn to innovators who offer niche financial services that cater to their unique needs, creating new ways for them to split dinner bills, take out a microloan, invest in crypto, track spending, saving and more.</p>
 
<p>But creating a new fintech company, app or product has not been simple. The traditional path to creating financial services was a long, hard road, from getting a banking license to building a new tech stack. Synctera is one fintech that offers an easier on-ramp to new, innovative financial products through BaaS. BaaS platforms and technology solutions provide the building blocks necessary for a fintech or neobank to quickly start creating innovative financial use cases for the modern consumer.</p>
 
<p>Synctera acts as a fintech banking platform, connecting a fintech builder with a community bank that has the requisite banking license. On the development side, Synctera provides an end-to-end toolkit, offering the critical technology services and providers that help innovators build their ideas. This includes consumer-permissioned data for account verification through Mastercard’s open banking platform, to help bring financial service ideas like quick money movement to life.</p>
 Modularizing banking solutions 
<p>All the things an entrepreneur needs in order to offer a banking service—including the ability to accept deposits, make loans and payments — BaaS service providers like Synctera encapsulate into the application programming interface (API) as modular blocks, so a fintech can tap in and build new solutions. Whether it’s issuing cards, sending ACH payments or more basic financial operations, developers can take these blocks and reassemble them to meet their needs.</p>
 
<p>The key to building with a BaaS provider is having just one API that’s simple to connect to. This reduces architecture and modeling requirements on the fintech development side. These tools allow fintechs to set up new customer accounts without delays from microdeposits, using instant verification, enabling customers to connect their external accounts and transfer funds into new financial services faster.</p>
 
<p>Another advantage of BaaS: Since multiple solutions are offered in the same API, it’s easy to make changes. If a company that’s scaling up tries an account authentication solution that’s slow and not quickly verifying that customer accounts are funded, they can replace it seamlessly with an alternate solution. That means less disruption to operations; money can keep moving.</p>
 Offering a marketplace of options 
<p>BaaS wraps all of its services, including those developed in-house and those from outside developers, into one API marketplace to make it easy for fintechs to launch everything together. Instead of trying to integrate tech from multiple financial services partners, a fintech developer can come to a BaaS provider like Synctera and build more, with less overhead and less plumbing.</p>
 
<p>Working with a BaaS provider allows fintech builders to focus more on the features of the product they’re offering to customers, like offering a virtual storefront to artists, discounted pet insurance to pet owners or easier access to small business capital. The marketplace solution means a fintech could choose a waterfall approach; if one solution fails, the system can be set up to automatically try another one.</p>
 How Mastercard fits in 
<p>Consumer-permissioned financial data can also be piped into BaaS solutions. Mastercard’s open banking platform provides secure connections to consumer-permissioned financial data from 95% of bank deposit accounts in the U.S. This data can power use cases like credit decisioning, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/digital-account-opening-report/">account opening</a> and linking. It creates more choice in <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/">payments</a> and transaction data for better financial insights.</p>
 
<p>Every fintech product needs financial data, the ability to manage consumer permission and to access those accounts. It’s one thing to have a customer knock on your door. It’s another to help them walk through the door without unnecessary obstacles blocking their way, and to make the first deposit into their new accounts happen quickly and compliantly.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data to power the tools that Synctera and other BaaS providers and innovators create. By using account verification and transaction data from Mastercard’s open banking platform, all ecosystem players can authenticate users and get them online fast, and in a compliant manner.</p>
 Fraud detection and speed are of utmost importance 
<p>Understandably, the risk, compliance and customer experience balance is delicate–efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. By adding open banking data to the BaaS platform, financial service providers can verify and access bank account data with instant account verification, helping to ensure that the person opening a new account actually owns the account they are linking to the new fintech app, before moving money.</p>
 
<p>Speed is another top concern for fintech builders. And since banks are not tech companies, many operate on pre-internet tech. COBOL, a programming language developed in 1959 that underpins many banking systems, can make it difficult to upgrade systems quickly, or to seamlessly connect with today’s technology. This can result in a speed mismatch between banking networks and the world of fintechs, who want to be able to release new products and services in a few weeks. Mastercard helps connect customer accounts quickly and speeds up the customer onboarding process.</p>
 
<p>There’s a lot of new and improved technology being created in the world of financial services, and more options for developers result in more next-gen products that help consumers on their financial journeys.</p>

 Over the past few years we’ve seen the development and standardization of the concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>. Built on blockchain technology, decentralized identity provides a strong foundation for a much-improved privacy experience for a user – and it has been&nbsp;called the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Lab’s Sudo Platform provides enterprise developers with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;capability to use for their applications and users. The platform offers both client- and service-side capabilities.</p>



 



Sudo Platform identity components.



 



<p>You can see above some of the key areas of decentralized identity development within Anonyome Labs. On the left side, we have how a user can leverage decentralized identity capabilities within the context of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identities</a>. This extends&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;of digital interactions into decentralized identity-based interactions.</p>



 



 On the right of the diagram are the current areas of decentralized identity development within the Sudo Platform: 



<p></p>



  Identity Wallet&nbsp;– A user-controlled local data store that safeguards a Sudo’s decentralized identity identifier (DID), cryptographic keys, verifiable credentials, and other artifacts for use with issuers, verifiers, public ledgers, and other third parties. The wallet supports multiple devices, cloud backup and recovery.  



  Mobile Agent&nbsp;– Usually an app that lets users interact with the Identity Wallet, as well as enabling various external activities, such as interacting with any standards-based public ledger, streamlining the login process to accounts and services, providing end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer interaction, assisting users with the request and presentation of verifiable credentials, and more.  



  DI Relay&nbsp;– The DI Relay (i.e., decentralized identity relay)&nbsp;provides mobile agents with an&nbsp;always onconnection point that facilitates user-to-user and user-to-service communications. Without an always on relay, mobile agents wouldn’t be able to communicate reliably with each other.  



  Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;– The Sudo Platform issuer service&nbsp;can create verifiable credentials. The issuer service first registers a credential definition on the blockchain which references an existing schema as well as registers the issuer service’s DID and public key.&nbsp;<br><br>Using their mobile agent, a user can request a verifiable credential from the issuer service. The new credential will be securely transmitted to the user’s mobile agent, which will secure it in the user’s identity wallet.<br><br>Additionally, via their mobile agents, users can present their verifiable credentials to a verifier, including the Sudo Platform’s verifier service. The user will be prompted to approve (or deny) presenting all of the requested verifiable credential claims, just some claims, or may even elect to only provide zero knowledge proof.<br><br>  Encrypted Messaging (end-to-end)&nbsp;– Whether used for user-to-user, user-to-service, or service-to-service communication, messages are encrypted end-to-end using peer-to-peer connections secured using the DIDComm protocol.  



 



<p>Next week, in part 4, we’ll outline the benefits to enterprises from proactively adopting decentralized identity.</p>

 A deep dive into the current state of crypto regulation, the FATF Travel Rule, and how our recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue. <p>On May 4th at 11:00 am EST, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> launched the debut edition of the Unhosted Webinar Series, with 80 attendees joining. It was presented by Shyft Network and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope’s </a>Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory and Compliance Solutions, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">Malcolm&nbsp;Wright</a>.</p><p>The webinar’s theme was the current state of crypto regulation, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">FATF Travel Rule</a>, and how Shyft Network’s recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p><p>We’ve also done a short re-cap of the key themes and challenges discussed in the&nbsp;Webinar:</p> FATF Recommendations on Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global anti money-laundering &amp; terrorism financing watchdog, has made recommendations to prevent the use of virtual assets in illicit activities. Countries are required to adopt these recommendations within a definite period of time, which will then become a guideline for the industry to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>After countries implement FATF recommendations, the global watchdog will make periodic assessments on the implementation of the guidelines. Countries that fail to receive satisfactory scores on various parameters can be penalized by FATF, which can affect their financial standing globally and impact their ability to obtain funding from external sources, such as the World Bank and the&nbsp;IMF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The Travel Rule is the most crucial recommendation on virtual assets issued, to date, by FATF. It was adopted in June 2019 when FATF issued draft guidelines. Then, during the first (June 2020) &amp; second (June 2021) assessments, FATF found that countries and industries are still not following its recommendations. Then, in October 2021, FATF issued its final guidelines on virtual assets &amp; Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, both originator and beneficiary VASPs must store and exchange certain personally identifiable information, such as the customer’s name, wallet address, location, national ID number, and DOB. They must also present the information to authorities when requested.</blockquote> Risk of Sanctions <p>Although Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and blockchain analytics are among the must-have tools that VASPs should have to ensure sanctioned parties cannot find a way around sanctions through virtual assets, they aren’t enough to mitigate the sanctions risk.</p><p>To fully comply with the FATF recommendations, it is crucial to know both parties involved in the transaction, which requires the implementation of the Travel Rule. Failing to comply with FATF recommendations can result in sanctions from authorities, which can yield devastating results.</p><p>To mitigate the risks, ensure GeoIP monitoring, proper KYC with name screening, implement blockchain analytics, and Travel Rule. Following these steps enables businesses with a significant amount of business volume outside their jurisdiction to have a solid defense against any potential sanction violation.</p> The Challenges  1. Poor Data&nbsp;Accuracy <p>Receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from the originator or beneficiary VASPs can result in significant challenges, such as increased customer support &amp; compliance costs, failed payments, and poor customer experience.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network’s Veriscope has implemented automated discovery of counterparty VASP through the token’s address to solve this problem. Also, Veriscope has automated exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) of both originator and beneficiary to ensure 100% accuracy.</blockquote> 2. Data&nbsp;Security <p>Storing PII on Travel Rule Service Provider’s (TRSP) infrastructure can result in internal and external hacking attacks, intermediaries meddling in and snooping on the data, and malicious actors exploiting the entire process to obtain counterparty PII by submitting fake transactions. There are also challenges to storing PII without user&nbsp;consent.</p><blockquote>The solution? Veriscope. It offers data security through three measures.</blockquote><blockquote>(i) User consents every time before PII is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><blockquote>(ii) PII is encrypted and off-chain to prevent malicious actors from accessing the user&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>(iii) The transmission of PII data between VASPs is through peer-to-peer mode only, which means Shyft Network does not handle PII at any point in&nbsp;time.</blockquote> 3. Know Your VASP&nbsp;(KYV) <p>Opting for just any average TRSP comes with a fair share of challenges. First, all data that a VASP relies on is collected by the TRSP; with such TRSPs, there is no option to choose a counterparty VASP. Then, there is the issue of inaccurate VASP discovery, as it may fail to capture granular data at the entity&nbsp;level.</p><blockquote>Veriscope’s design mechanism enables it to solve these complex problems swiftly. It ensures that PII data is sent to the correct VASP entity and that the network participants have undergone due diligence at internationally recognized standards. It is also highly scalable and can easily accommodate the growing needs of both legal and operational teams.</blockquote> 4. Payment Screening <p>The usual approach to obtaining beneficiary data is to collect the information from the originator. There are several issues with this approach. For instance, such data can be incomplete or inaccurate, further complicating screening efforts. It can even lead to higher exposure to sanctions risk.</p><blockquote>Veriscope has implemented a mechanism that mandates obtaining beneficiary data from the beneficiary VASP. Shyft Network’s approach ensures that the data is accurate and complete, resulting in efficient name screening. That’s not all, as it also enables VASPs to request any additional information through the RFFI&nbsp;process.</blockquote> Sunrise Problem: A Major Roadblock in Implementing the Travel Rule&nbsp;(Recap) <p>The most significant problem that VASPs face in implementing Travel Rule is the Sunrise issue. The problem is that countries have adopted or will adopt the Travel Rule into local regulations at different times. Thus, most VASPs located in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Travel Rule are unlikely to have a Travel Rule Solution and will issues for those VASPs who do have a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Recent data suggests there are over 600 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Depending on their jurisdiction, they may or may not have adopted the Travel Rule yet. That’s where the problem lies, as the countries that have adopted the Travel Rule may mandate compliance both domestically and internationally. So, a compliant VASP must obtain data from the counterparty VASP regardless of their compliance status. If the compliant VASP fails to comply with the rule, they may receive severe penalties.</p><p>Suppose a VASP based in a country that has adopted the FATF Travel Rule (VASP A) sends Requests for Information (RFI) to a VASP operating in a country yet to adopt the Travel Rule (VASP B) on day zero (April 1st, 2022). They may or may not provide the information. After all, they are not legally obligated to do so yet. But VASP B will want to respond after the country they are based in implements the regulations. Meanwhile, without the necessary information, how can VASP A be compliant? This problem is referred to as the sunrise&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So, what’s the solution here? Veriscope. Thanks to Veriscope’s Historic Look Back feature, whenever VASP B’s home country adopts the Travel Rule, they can sign up for the solution and access all the RFIs sent to them even before they were legally required to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Let’s say the VASP B joins six months after day zero (October 1st, 2022). They will see all the RFIs when they join and can respond to all of them. So, VASP A &amp; VASP B finally successfully exchanged the information required under the Travel Rule because of Shyft’s Veriscope.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shyft Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/z65MC5JkrG">Discord</a></p>

 From Start-up to Scale-Up: How Tokeny Prepared for Large-Scale Tokenization 
<p>Our solutions now become more scalable and flexible as we have our own indexer and nodes to interact with relevant data on the blockchain. This improvement eliminates any downtime for our services and enlarges our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the Product Focus newsletter April &amp; May 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability is one of our top priorities as we are working with large financial institutions with very high volumes anticipated. We regularly run intense scalability tests and a few months ago, we concluded that we should reduce our dependence on some third parties to provide faster and enterprise-grade solutions. This newsletter explains how we became more autonomous and scalable by running our own blockchain Indexer and nodes:</p>
 Blockchain data Indexer 
<p>In order to build the real-time cap table of token holders with fully accurate information, our <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> needs to&nbsp;scan and read the&nbsp;blockchain to index relevant transactions&nbsp;happening to the ERC-3643 tokens and ONCHAINIDs. Technically, it can be very challenging for complex operations, and tools like The Graph, the “Google for blockchains”, enables developers like us to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>However, in our testing, we encountered some upcoming limitations as the use of these third party tools and protocols can be slow and requires some manual procedures. Therefore,&nbsp;we decided to build our own Indexer technology, enabling automated token indexing that can be completed within minutes, without any downtime, for thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>
<p>Also, we realized that many Web3 applications were having trouble interacting with blockchain through third-party services,&nbsp; so we decided to improve this as well:</p>
 Blockchain connector (Remote Procedure Call)&nbsp; 
<p>A RPC is a set of protocols and interfaces that enables a software to&nbsp;interact with the blockchain, to read and write, similar to a website interacting with a server. In blockchain terms, a server is referred to as a node, a synced database of the blockchain. Most applications use Infura to do so; it provides RPCs and AWS-like services for nodes, so developers don’t need to build a RPC or manage their own nodes.</p>
<p>Due to Infura’s popularity, blockchain applications become less decentralized and it could become a single point of failure, such as the time it went down because of a service outage one week ago, causing many dApps, including MetaMask, to not function.</p>
<p>It became obvious to us that we had to run our own nodes and build our own RPC to provide better services for our customers. As a result, we have built a system that we can monitor, scale, and rapidly fix if needed.&nbsp;We even enabled switchable RPCs to keep the T-REX Platforms always available by monitoring the state of nodes to connect with functional nodes including our own nodes and third party nodes (e.g. Infura, Alchemy, …).</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are proud of our tech team, especially our DevOps Engineer Cyrille, Lead Core Developer José and Senior Full Stack Developer Mihalis, for their hard work to complete these improvements. We will continue pushing the limit to provide the most advanced, flexible and secure solutions for you.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: You might have heard of eIDAS before, especially if you are in the payment industry. But now in the recent years, the European Commission is working on a new version, eIDAS 2.0. We’re going to talk about that and especially from the perspective of Finland. We have a special guest who has been working in Finland. And our special guest today is Bo Harald.</p>
<p>He started his career in banking in the 1970s by promoting and building electronic banking, payments, and e-business services. He developed Nordea’s Electronic Banking and payments operation for 30 years, after which he started working with TietoEvry as the Head of Executive Advisors.</p>
<p>He has also served as the Chairman of the EU Expert Group on Electronic Invoicing, the Chairman of Mobey, Mobile Financial Services Forum, and has held and holds directorships in various companies and associations. He has been named as one of the most influential technologists of the 20th century by Institutional Investor, and has been awarded for advancing the Information Society by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>
<p>Bo currently works as an independent advisor at Findy.fi, a Senior Advisor at the Finnish Council of Regulatory Impact Analysis, a Founder and Steering Committee member at MyData.org, and with the publicly funded, Real Time Economy programme.</p>
<p>Hello, Bo.</p>
<p>Bo Harald: Hello, and thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, Bo. Thanks for joining us. And definitely, I want to hear all these very interesting things about eIDAS 2.0. So let’s start, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. We’d like to hear from your very extensive and varied background in banking and technology. Please tell us a bit more about your career journey – how everything until today working in the Finnish eIDAS 2.0 workgroups.</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, it’s a long ladder, and I want to call it a ladder. It started back in the late ’70s, when we developed the first versions of home banking, the PC banking in the very early 1980s for private customers at Union Bank of Finland, and nowadays Nordea. And also for SMEs long before internet. And the first step was obviously with payments, invoice payments, typically, bill payments. And then we moved on to put all banking services actually into e-banking before internet already. And so that was the first phase.</p>
<p>The second phase was about interconnecting bank customers, not only with payments, but also with e-identification, e-signatures, e-invoice and e-salary, for example. This was a very important step when you look at the benefits for society at large, you get the economy of trust the economic reuse, the economic repetition, the economy of scale, and all that.</p>
<p>And from here, when internet then came in the mid ’90s, we had already half a million people on e-banking in Finland. And we were the biggest bank in e-banking in the world, in absolute terms for many, many years, all the way to Nordea.</p>
<p>So from here, we established then the public-private real time economic programme, focusing very much on e-invoicing, accounting automation, real time income register for the tax authorities. And that’s what I tried to also promote when I was the Chairman for the EU Commission Expert Group.</p>
<p>The next phase, if I condense this ladder, was the MyData principles that started to grow out in 2016, putting the citizen in control of all of his or her data, naturally supported by the legal promise from GDPR in Europe. But we could see at that early stage that there was no practical way of getting this data to travel from the enterprises that had the legal obligation to send it and that’s where we started to look for a new solution in 2017 and ’18.</p>
<p>And there we could see that Self-Sovereign Identity and Trust over IP was the solution to go forward with. And we established this public-private Findy cooperative as the solution. And it was a real eye-opener and this is soon coming to eIDAS to see that we were able to solve the pressing need for being able to trade and issue non listed, unlisted shares.</p>
<p>And there you have this pretty tricky situation that you need to serve private shareholders, organisational shareholders, the issuer, the state, the trade registry, the banks, for payments, for trading, for settlement, for delivery, for keeping up the registers. But when you issued all of these parties, with the same generic wallets or fact wallets, we prefer to call them fact wallets – identity wallets is the other name for it. Then it was astonishingly easy to interconnect these parties – four coders, four months, and it worked like a dream.</p>
<p>So that’s when I got the eyes open for the eIDAS architecture needs. That’s the ladder. And actually, the ladder is important to understand that you should have all the ranks or the steps on it, you know, enabled to rise to the higher platforms in between. That was the path, my path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, very, of course, been long, long journey and super interesting all the type of projects you have been involved. And now, you are working very heavily on eIDAS, especially this new version 2.0. If you can tell us about that but also tell us for the ones who are not so familiar, what is eIDAS? And then tell us the difference between the current eIDAS 1.0 and the new one, eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0 are two entirely different things. eIDAS 1.0 failed. It was focusing on cross-border identification services with pretty stiff requirements. And there were two things missing that led to the failure – supply and demand. There is such a limited need for identifying citizens, organisations, cross-border. And in the Nordic countries, we already have extremely well-functioning identification services in place, mainly run by the banks in Finland, also teleoperators are involved, I think that may be the only country in the world where teleoperators are doing this as well. It’s good with competition.</p>
<p>But when you talk about eIDAS 2.0, it’s not a question of identification, it’s a question of identity. And that’s a totally different thing. You could say that the identity is built from credentials from all sorts of sources in the private sector, in the public sector, statements about your knowledge, your skills, your vaccinations, where you live. We’re disclosing as little as possible, thousands of different statements that build a person’s identity all the way to – you might call it a “digital twin”.</p>
<p>And, here, obviously, eIDAS 2.0 is promising that every European will get a wallet issued by qualified issuers, possibly also by the states, if needed. And these wallets are then the ones where you will get these credentials, statements, the verified data about you when you need it.</p>
<p>So that’s a big difference between eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0. And obviously eIDAS 2.0 is an absolutely enormous opportunity for the economy at large on the one hand, and for building a real single digital market on the other hand.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you have mentioned wallets, earlier you mentioned fact wallets or identity wallets, does it already exist? Just to understand that concept better, could you describe how it would be in practice? Is there anything like that today so we can have an idea?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah. There are already wallets out there, pretty many, many versions of them actually. Obviously, Europe is working on trying to establish what kind of standards such a wallet should have, be it then an application in your mobile phone, which seems to be very much in focus now, mainly serving citizens, also, perhaps smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>But obviously, these kinds of applications or wallets, ID wallets or rather fact wallets, are also needed by larger organisations. And then the mobile application is not the solution, but an application, a computer or in the cloud. But obviously, all these wallets, be they then in a mobile or in a computer or in the cloud, should be interoperable by design. That’s the whole idea here.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, understanding now the, what is this new concept of eIDAS 2.0 based on identities that you say in wallets, tell us more about the opportunities that this new framework is going to provide for the future across Europe.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, I’m very happy to see that the commission work is really embracing Self-Sovereign Identity, which is obviously the standard, and I can’t see any alternative to that. And in many, many countries already Trust Over IP stacks are the starting point like they are here in Finland, and have been already for five years.</p>
<p>And here, what will happen is that the data rights holder, you as a citizen, or you as working for a company, you are in the driver’s seat. You can go to a data source, public or private, and say, that now I have a life event of this sort, looking for a job, establishing a company, somebody has died in the near family, which is the most stressful life event, and thousands of other life events, and now I need the data from all of these, all relevant sources. And I have a wallet, and the wallet is helping me to find those sources. And then I get the data to my wallet. And then I go to a service provider of my choice, I have this data and you are specialising in this particular life event. If I need financing, it may be a bank. And could you please take care of the need.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this is these three parties, the data rights holder with the wallet, the source and the service provider do not need to be technically integrated, do not need to be technically integrated. Because in this infrastructure, the technical connection is handled in the infrastructure, which is very cheap to build, of course, it needs rulebooks. And that’s the whole beauty of it.</p>
<p>Obviously, this infrastructure, we call it the data highway here in Finland is used both by the public sector and the private sector. That’s a no brainer, like a road is open to everyone to use. And it should obviously be a non-profit organisation that handles this. That’s why we have established this in the cooperatives to do that. So that’s how it works. And it’s not that difficult to understand, actually.</p>
<p>The benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity are absolutely enormous to reducing risk and friction in the economy at large. It’s of course, improving automation. It’s protecting privacy like nothing we have seen before. It’s preventing crime and grey economy. And this book that I mentioned to you, Self-Sovereign Identity by Drummond Reed, is quoting sources saying that the cost of cybercrime is something in the region of $6 trillion. So that’s a kind of a big picture. McKinsey for its part estimates the benefits of the trust infrastructure to be 3% to 6% of GDP, depending on the maturity of a country.</p>
<p>So this is an absolutely massive step forward. Some people say that this is more important than Internet, I agree. And some people say that the fact wallet is at least as important as the internet browser was when internet started. So you can see that this is something that every state, every government should actually do everything they can, and obviously, European Union to happen as fast as possible. We have no time to lose in this world. But they cannot do it on their own. And they are– the clever governments understand that they have to do this hand-in-hand with the Self-Sovereign Identity experts and the enterprises that are working in that field, and that’s the way it works in Finland.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely the way you say it sounds like there are definitely plenty of benefits. And yeah, we hope to see these benefits in the near future definitely.</p>
<p>Bo: Oh, I mean, it’s a kind of a responsibility of any government that are looking for reducing crime and improving privacy and above all, naturally, getting the productivity in place and the benefits of data according to the MyData principles. And this is the really only practical way I can see that they could implement the MyData principles, protecting people’s data. I’ve seen during 40 years of digital work, I’ve seen a lot of important things, but this is the biggest by far.</p>
<p>And if you want to go into the wallets, which will get a lot of so-called credentials or statements, verify data, the e-receipt is something of the highest volume. And even the lines in the e-receipts, if you look at the number of lines in e-receipts and e-invoices in Finland, and both of them will in a couple of years’ time be the only kind accepted legally. In accounting, there are some 20 billion of them every year and these can– each line can be verified on its own. So it will be by far the biggest volume of credentials sitting delivered from the seller’s wallet to the buyer’s wallet, be the buyer or seller private or an organisation.</p>
<p>And the reuse of this e-receipt is a fantastic opportunity. We all know what travel expense means for all of us. We know how difficult it is to get financing in enterprises, and you have an invoice there, verified by the buyer, it’s so much easier for insurance companies. In Finland only there is a calculation saying that about 100 million can be saved when e-receipts are actually available. And obviously the insurance fraud is a big issue in any country. That’s just one example. But there are any number of them that– what is the– when you get a verified data statement, a credential that can be used in so many different places.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the e-receipts is also part of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, it’s not directly but I mean, when you have eIDAS 2.0 in the right way. And I’m a little bit worried, I have to admit, about the Commission’s, let’s say, level of understanding of the importance of this 3% to 6% of GDP. They are focusing, in my opinion, too much on the private wallets and not enough on the enterprise wallets, to get the real benefit. If you focus only on private wallets, and for example, then government-issued credentials, then you get to a point 0% or 0.1% perhaps of the benefits. But when you have a full picture then you can get 90% of the enormous, enormous benefits.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote this <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22017/open-letter-to-the-eu-commission">open letter</a>, which can be found in my LinkedIn account. Also, if somebody’s interested to the Commission, but we should understand how big this step can be if it’s done correctly, and not only looking at some sort of additional identification tool and only government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’re going to add this, I read your open letter to EU Commission. So yeah, we’re going to add it also to the show notes of this episode so people can read it, definitely. How can we centre the users’ needs while at the same time balancing organisational priorities in any new solution?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, this is a very good question and an important question, and I don’t have all of the answers here. But I have some basic answers based on my experience from banking, and so forth. I think that the, the mission and the– must always be the passion in any organisation that wants to be successful is to think hard about what the customers need tomorrow. And it’s a familiar phrase is that you should never ask the customer what he needs, because he doesn’t know, you should know before he does.</p>
<p>And in this particular time now, I think it’s time to start all the service design from the customer’s life events. Both data is needed for this live event and where does it sit? How can the data be verified and available in real time? The value of data arriving one second faster is quite different from the one that comes later. And it’s then in this particular setting, natural for many, many organisations to issue these wallets, be they in a mobile phone or in a computer. And also then include the National ID, invite the government to make the root idea, the electronic ID card into these wallets, so that it can be used for opening bank accounts and whatnot, where this is always needed according to the law, at least in the Nordics, but also other credentials from the public sector.</p>
<p>Then you can produce fantastic value for the customers, be they private customers or for SMEs who are going to take and actually charge. So that you [indiscernible] and the costs are not big, that is the fantastic feature here with open source technology and open data and open standards. So, I see that the solution will be that the role of public and private sector organisations will be, and is already, in GDPR supply data, but it should be verified data. The value of verified data is a thousand times more than just generic data. Also for machine learning and artificial intelligence, to supply that data to citizens and SME fact wallets and these are generic tools, generic tools, standardised interfaces all over the place.</p>
<p>The data rights holder as I said before here, then herself decides which service provider is best suited to use the data, to solve the need. And then in an ideal world, the public sector would not need to act as a service provider at all. They can let the enterprises do that on their own, and that will save a lot of taxpayers’ money. But of course, we have to see to it that there are no walled gardens built, that data is flowing freely, that you can always change your service provider without any lock ins, and that the competition is serving us all.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that difficult because the whole Self-Sovereign Identity is built on open standards and no wall gardens and no technology and no– it’s a kind of religion in that so that’s why I feel so comfortable in promoting it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now with your experience working in Finland in banking and several other projects until now, how can Europe – and even if we see it globally with initiatives like GAIN, the Global Assure Identity Network – how these can learn from the experiences in Finland and in the Nordics in general?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, I have to admit that I have failed miserably in one aspect. This e-identification services that GAIN is now looking at was started back in I think ’93 in Finland. And we have then taken it from here to the other Nordic countries so that the banks are actually the suppliers to the identification services. And I have been preaching this in conferences all over the world all the time, since then, and I have written any number of blogs, in the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">Finextra blog posts</a>, you can you can find it on frequently. That banks should be doing this and not only by their own will but should actually be forced into this kind of service by the government. Because they are so suited, because they are trusted, trusted institutions and the economic trust is immensely important and they are legislated into it because of the anti-money laundering legislation and all that.</p>
<p>And now GAIN is looking at it and unfortunately, it is very late. And now with the wallets, you don’t need it in the same time as– in the same way as you would have done it if you had started 20 years ago, 25 years ago as we did. But I didn’t get in my way, there has been so many different crises in banking that has taken away the attention. A little bit the same has happened also in electronic invoicing, banks woke up a little bit late. I can only look myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>But the lessons learned in Finland was that the economy of reuse and the economy of trust, using bank ID for identifying in all kinds of services was really, really important. It became a generic tool, both in your private role and in your work roles. And now, when you have this in overflow of everything – I mean, the attention span is– if it is eight seconds, still, it’s good. I mean, the goldfish has nine seconds. And everything else is overflowing except time and the value of something that you know already and trust is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>But now, I jump from there to the wallets, a generic wallet that you can use at home and at work supported by a generic public-private joint infrastructure is, of course, even more valuable, many times more valuable than the e-identification services provided by the banks. And this is something that not only the banking sector should be providing but many other sectors as well and everyone should naturally use it. So we have to live with the times and realise that people don’t have time to learn anything new if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, seeing the evolution because eIDAS 2.0 as I understand is still being cooked, let’s say, so it’s not completely finished. So how, let’s say smaller EU countries, and even individuals, who are really concerned about this or how is it going to be the standard and the standard coming can have more power to influence the commission decisions that is going to affect so many residents?</p>
<p>Bo: And this is a very critical question, an important question. And to get anything done now, the first thing to say is that even if you have the best public servants in the world, they are not Self-Sovereign Identity experts. Even if the European Commission has said that the Self-Sovereign Identity is at the core of eIDAS, they haven’t yet understood– had time to understood the full picture perhaps.</p>
<p>The remedy is that EU and any country, sit down with the public sector and say that OK, you government, you have realised that you can have 3% to 6% GDP benefits out of this Trust Infrastructure. And you do understand that your lawyers and economists and whatnot, they are not experts in building this radically new infrastructure. You have to do it together, in this public-private team, formulate the narrative. And some basic use cases like the receipts, or whatnot, so that the citizens will actually start asking for it, demanding it from their own government. That’s what you need.</p>
<p>And from Brussels, because we do understand that the Europe is the biggest economy in the world and if it becomes one single market, the benefit for everyone will be absolutely massive. And this is real – this trust infrastructure is a bigger step than Internet. And the fact wallet is the new browser. So we have to get people to understand how big this is.</p>
<p>And then the countries, once you have done it in your home country, then you join forces with others, like we now do with Sweden, Norway, and Germany, Holland, and so forth, and influence Brussels so that it is not overregulated, which will make it too expensive for small players, and actually just help large organisations to protect their positions. They have money enough to do this, even if it’s very regulated. So it’s important to see to it that the competition from the smaller guys is possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: So yeah, it’s important to, as you say, join forces, right, with the countries that have already– countries and organisations that are already active in… yeah, quite knowledgeable and active today.</p>
<p>Bo: Exactly. And that’s what they are doing now. Very happy to see that our neighbour Sweden has been quite keen to work together with the other countries also.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when is it expected to be ready, eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, we’ve had a very tight timetable when it was launched. And we were of course quite happy about that last summer, it was announced and this was exactly what we had been hoping for, and even more. So that was good. But then it has now taken a lot of time and gone into overregulation aspects, which we fear and not enough understanding for the need for organisational wallets and of course or for wallets for things and bets and whatnot to get the full benefit.</p>
<p>So I’m, let’s say, prepared to wait half a year more if these aspects get into the drawings so that you can get the benefits out of it. The economic benefits and privacy benefits and single market benefits. So we must work hard to avoid, let’s say, minimal mobile application for citizens only. I don’t know how long it will take but probably not much will be seen how in way of use cases this year, next year should be a breakthrough year.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. In 2023, we’ll see some of the fruits at least will be available for people to use and as you say organisations as well, all together.</p>
<p>Bo: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla Excellent. Final question for you, Bo. For all business leaders listening to us now what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, this is of course a very challenging question. But if I choose from a long list of experiences from the past in electronic banking, electronic invoicing, e-identification services and all and how they come together and form the ladder. And when this ladder was– when they started to raise this ladder, we were happy enough to have hundreds and hundreds of bank branches that could do the selling on a personal basis to the individuals. Now, we are not really that many bank branches left anymore so it’s a new, it’s a new game, you have to do it without much personal selling.</p>
<p>So my simple line would be to say that, for God’s sake, do not serve your customer, to have a life event, with the fact wallets for all needed verified data into the wallet, and you have to do it closely together with the public sector. And they should also help with the financing because so much of the benefits will be for the society at large and only a small part for the enterprises and such. But this is the joint effort, the biggest one I’ve seen ever.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, thank you very much, Bo, for this very interesting conversation and shedding light about eIDAS 2.0 and everything that is, yeah, behind that. I definitely learned a lot from this conversation. I’m sure our audience had fun and also super interesting. If someone would like to hear more about you, or get in touch with you, or follow you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, I have such an unusual name so it’s easy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-harald-4768b51/">find me on LinkedIn</a> and please feel free to contact me. I have <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">written blogs for at least 10 years on Finextra</a>. So there, most of the material that I have myself produced can be found there in a fairly condensed form, not too long texts. So please feel free to use as much as you like.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. Again, thanks a lot, Bo, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Bo: Thank you very much.</p>

				 Internet Identity Workshop IIWXXXIV <p>The 34th Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California was a major success. Our Trinsic team, sporting our Trinsic-blue Vans, gathered with hundreds of other buzzing minds to discuss the disruptive technologies and principles that are shaping the internet movements around us. The conference covered a wide array of topics with over 80 sessions held in the span of a few days. While we can’t begin to do a comprehensive overview of all of IIW, below are some key insights our team gained from this latest IIW.</p> &nbsp;  Building in Under 30 Minutes <p>IIW is the perfect staging ground for testing out ideas and experimenting with emerging technology. Keeping in tradition with other IIW conferences, our Trinsic team talked with new innovators this spring about building an SSI proof of concept in under 30 minutes. This year’s group taught us the following in regards to building and testing SSI proof of concepts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You truly can build a proof of concept in under an hour. The feasibility of building and testing a concept is not only thrilling but it also means we can make advancements in digital identity quicker. If testing is easier, more ideas can be brought to light which enables us to sift through and make headway in building better identity products for everyone. If you’re someone with an idea but have been hesitant about where to begin building and testing, <a href="https://trinsic.notion.site/Build-an-SSI-Proof-of-Concept-dae9d6e565eb4770be41b61d55e090cb">this is an excellent place to begin working within minutes</a>.  We build better products when we openly collaborate with each other. If you’re looking to build a new ecosystem, seek feedback from community members who have been through the process or are building a product that could complement yours. At the end of the day, we’ll only be successful if all our identity products are interoperable. Yet that won’t ever happen if we aren’t talking with one another and following the same standards. <a href="https://slackcommunity.com/">Trinsic’s developer slack community</a> is a great place to start meeting and speaking with fellow builders.  The best SSI proof of concepts are built by teams with great chemistry. We’ve worked with a lot of companies, and those that are the most successful are successful because of their team. Having the right resources in terms of talent often outweighs the importance of other capital resources. This spring’s IIW conference showcased a growing community of talented companies, with a rapidly growing need to hire. It seems we’re all hiring, which means we can each expect to put a lot more effort into attracting top talent.   &nbsp;  The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>Verifiable credentials and adoption were among the hottest topics of IIW. The unique value of a verifiable credential is the fact that it is an interoperable standard–that is, one credential can be accepted and verified across multiple institutions. However, the value of a standard is less obvious before being widely adopted. Thus, we find ourselves with a chicken-and-egg problem: how do we get people to use verifiable credentials while the main value is the fact that other people are using the standard? The key is to focus on solving business problems today for a single ecosystem. That’s why Trinsic created Trinsic Ecosystems, a product focused on enabling adoption among issuers and verifiers. If you’re building an SSI ecosystem, reach out for a demo.</p> &nbsp;  Decentralized Identity Has Great People <p>IIW once more established that this industry has some of the best people.

  <p>Portable, verifiable and, most importantly, reusable representations of personal data can enable high-touch, high-trust and low-cost engagement between customers and networks of complementary service providers. The EU is already adjusting to the opportunities of Self-Sovereign Identity, but the private sector needs to demonstrate more high-value use cases in order to force beneficiary regulations and an enabling environment for the technology. The tools and techniques of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), including the no-code capabilities provided by ProofSpace, can be used to create trust networks within an organization’s existing technical infrastructure in order, for example, to verify that a credential shared by a customer was issued by a trusted partner. A valuable use case for this is re-usable Know Your Customer verification. Other high-value use cases for SSI trust networks include: networks of affiliated hospitality services referring and on-boarding customers; networks of educational institutions verifying academic credentials; networks of employers verifying employment histories; and web 3.0 and DAO communities verifying member reputation and voting rights for management and governance purposes. A brilliant case study for this is ProofSpace’s work with the pro-democracy opposition of Belarus, where Self-Sovereign Identity enables a decentralized and secure “virtual country”, offering private and public services to unite, serve and empower the pro-democracy community.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-mason-identity-ecosystems"></a>

The technology that has no limits in its application across sectors is equally welcome in centralised and decentralised worlds. Meet, self-sovereign identity (SSI).<br> <br> How do you quantify the impact of a paradigm which will completely transform how we interact with identity and more broadly, authentic or trusted data? Our estimates say its market size is $550b / $0.55Tr. <br> <br> We’ll give a brief rundown of SSI applications across Finance, NFT, Banking, Crypto and many more.</p>

  <p>Most OAuth deployments today use bearer tokens – tokens that can be used by anyone in possession of a copy of them, with no way to distinguish between legitimate uses of them and those that stole them and used them for nefarious purposes. The solution to this is proof-of-possession tokens, where the legitimate client supplies cryptographic material to the issuer that is bound to the token, enabling it to cryptographically prove that the token belongs to it – something attackers cannot do because they don’t possess the proof-of-possession cryptographic material.<br> <br> The OAuth DPoP (Demonstration of Proof of Possession) specification defines a simple-to-implement means of applying proof of possession to OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens. We will describe real attacks occurring every day against bearer tokens and how they are mitigated by DPoP, providing defense in depth and making real deployed systems substantially more secure with minimal implementation and complexity costs.<br> <br> These attacks and mitigations are particularly relevant to high-value enterprise deployments, such as in the financial, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and government sectors.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-jones-oauth-dpop"></a>

  <p>During this best practice session we will present you with hands-on experience from one of our financial services industry customers.</p>
<p>The company used a handcrafted xml signature mechanism to authenticate their business partners when initiating machine-to-machine communication to exchange data between data centers. When the customer decided to migrate to REST APIs in a cloud native setup, the existing mechanism was no longer fit for purpose. Together, we designed a solution to keep the benefits of certificate based authentication while establishing an interaction model conforming to the OpenID Connect standard. We implemented the mechanism based on the open source software Keycloak, successfully passed an external penetration test and have to this point authenticated hundres of thousands of sessions. After our session, attendees will</p>
 
 be familiar with standard conforming approaches to use OpenID Connect with certificates for authentication 
 be able to assess which parts of their authentication flow will benefit from using certificates 
 know relevant open source technologies and technical approaches to use in their own implementations 
 understand common pitfalls and relevant considerations when implementing the standards in a real-world, cloud based scenario

  <p>Identity Fabrics as a concept has established itself as a common paradigm for defining and implementing the identity services needed by organizations to provide seamless, yet secure and controlled access of everyone and everything to every type of service, regardless whether its legacy or shiny &amp; bright SaaS, and regardless of where it runs. Identity Fabrics support the shift-left in IAM thinking from only managing applications to providing a consistent set of identity services for the developers of digital services. Identity Fabrics deliver the integration and control plane required for a modern IAM.</p>
<p>In this panel, the panelists will discuss where Identity Fabrics stand today, how they are implemented in practice, and what to consider for prioritizing services, for picking the right technologies, and for operations, as well as for building an Identity API layer and integrating back to the legacy.</p>
<p>They also will look at whether and where specific variants are needed, such as Consumer Identity Fabrics looking at the CIAM and CDP (Customer Data Platform) use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-identity-fabrics"></a>

  <p>Continued advances in authentication technology have made the "identity" part of "identity and access management" more manageable over the years. Access management on the other hand, is still very much a "wild-west" landscape. As enterprises move to a zero-trust network access model, access management is the only way in which attackers can be prevented from gaining unwarranted access to enterprise data. Attackers can include both malicious insiders and those using compromised identities. Numerous organizations have suffered significant financial damage as a result of such unwarranted access from legitimately identified users.</p>
<p>Authorization rules in an enterprise can apply to many types of assets: files on a network drive, cloud resources such as virtual machines and storage buckets and enterprise applications and actions within them. Managing authorization across all these assets is complex in and of itself. Most enterprises also use third-party “Software as a Service '' platforms that maintain their own permissions, further complicating enterprises’ efforts to effectively manage authorization.</p>
<p>This talk identifies common causes of "privilege sprawl" in enterprises, and discusses management techniques that can result in "least privilege" permissions to personnel while ensuring no business disruption</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-tulshibagwale-enterprise-authorization"></a>

In this session, leaders in digital identity from the ToIP Steering Committee will outline the impact this missing layer has had on digitization of trusted interactions, why technology alone won’t solve this and how the ToIP stack is designed to tackle both technology and human governance to bring open and interoperable standards at each layer of the trust architecture. This interactive panel will be moderated by ToIP’s Director of Strategic Engagement and will explore the views of its member organizations for a lively and engaging debate on how we finally establish trust in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-stack"></a>

  <p>As digital business pushes organizations towards an accelerated multi-cloud adoption, CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) emerges as a strong enabler for securing access and entitlements across an increasingly distributed cloud environment. Traditional PAM and IGA tools aren't natively designed to manage cloud infrastructure entitlements and therefore can't be easily re-purposed to discover and remediate excessive cloud permissions across multiple IaaS and PaaS platforms. The confusion arising from un-identically structured CSPs and misaligned cloud terminology is further aggravated by the quest of IAM, PAM and Cloud Security providers to enter CIEM space and capture market share.</p>
<p>In this session, we will focus on how the CIEM market has been evolving over the last few years to manage the critical cloud security gaps left unaddressed by CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) and CWP (Cloud Workload Protection) tools, and how CIEM complements these tools to offer a wholistic cloud security advantage. We will also discuss how CIEM addresses some of the most critical security tenets of your organization's cloud adoption program and future planning.</p>
<p>As for the key takeaways of this session, you will be able to understand and articulate:</p>
 
 When and where does CIEM fit in your overall cloud security and access governance strategy? 
 What are the critical capabilities of CIEM to help evaluate the right CIEM product for your multi-cloud environment? 
 What are industry best practices for implementing and operationalizing CIEM for your cloud security and achieving faster ROI?

  <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tectonic consequences for citizens and businesses across the world. An expectation of normalcy post the pandemic has been replaced with fears of increased gas prices and supply chain disruptions. Attackers are expected to leverage the context to carry out advanced cybercrime intrusions, leaving businesses susceptible to attacks that could have potential&nbsp;second and third-order effects on their operations.&nbsp;A cyber problem immediately becomes a business problem that requires effective business continuity contingency plans built around defensible, risk-informed choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this panel session, you’ll hear from security leaders who will provide a pragmatic assessment of organizational dependencies to improve your odds of identifying and mitigating cyber attacks, while addressing the increasingly challenging risk environment&nbsp;organizations find themselves in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-cybersecurity-impact-russian-invasion-ukraine"></a>

  <p>The presentation to be made by Stéphane Mouy (SGM Consulting - France) and Michael Adams (Quali-Sign - UK) will focus on the forthcoming eIDAS 2.0 digital identity wallets (DIWs) and the payment use case. DIWs will allow users to share high LoA identity and status credentials to various relying parties, including financial institutions, as well as meet applicable strong customer authentication requirements for payments.<br>The payment use case is of critical importance to eIDAS 2.0 digital identity wallets and promises to be transformational for EU payment service providers as it offers a level-playing field for payment means, whether account-to-account or card based. DIWs are also likely to play a key role for the deployment of CBDCs supporting offline interactions with embedded AML/CFT verifications.<br>The presentation will draw on the work of the eWallet Network presented in the Developing a digital identity solution for use by the financial sector based around eIDAS trust services report published by the EU commission in October 2021 and authored by Stéphane Mouy. It will include a live presentation of an eIDAS 2.0/ISO 23220-1 digital identity wallet offering online/offline connectivity that can be used in a variety of contexts, including for payment authorisation purposes.<br>The session should be of interest to anyone interested in eIDAS 2.0 developments for digital identities as well as its regulatory implications for the financial sector but also to digital payment experts. A specific focus will be made on the offline connectivity requirement for DIWs that has clear technology implications.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-mouy-adams-payment-authorizing"></a>

  <p>The world of modern urban mobility is full of - unused - opportunities. To get to their destination, people can use public transportation, take a cab or rent an e-scooter. But many options also means many providers. Anyone who uses more than one of the aforementioned forms of transportation to get from A to B will inevitably be confronted with a fragmentation of their journey. This is anything but smooth and user-friendly. A simple example makes this particularly clear: If Erika Mustermann has to go to London for a business meeting, she first takes the suburban train to the airport, then gets on a plane, and then has a cab take her to the hotel. That's three different booking processes with three different mobility providers. Decentralized technologies, on the other hand, enable a new kind of efficiency and effectiveness in the back-end networking of different providers. But how can such a seamless customer journey be implemented so that both mobility service providers and customers benefit equally? Sophia Rödiger, CEO of bloXmove, is happy to tackle this challenge in a talk on IT Trans. In doing so, she explores the question of how, for example, the individual players in local public transport can cooperate with each other while remaining independent and what role blockchain technology plays in this. She also explains how providers can save resources through the decentralized concept while gaining more customers. In addition, she puts a special focus on how the cooperation between the public and private sectors can be changed by the approach in the long term.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-roediger-decentralized-tech-collaboration"></a>

  <p>This session is a continuation of the opening keynote by Martin Kuppinger on the future Composable Enterprise. Together we take a look at what powers the composable enterprise and which concepts and technologies can contribute to building a composable enterprise.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole proposes an engine that powers composable enterprises, made up of composable services, identities, and data. Since this journey towards becoming composable is intensely individual based on business goals and requirements, there countless ways of cultivating this modular trifecta. Therefore, this session identifies some of the building blocks that organizations use to cultivate interchangeability and agility to achieve their continually shifting business goals. These building blocks are modular themselves, allowing organizations to exercise different aspects to power composability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bailey-composable-enterprise"></a>

  <p>The “zero trust” approach to cybersecurity has been gaining momentum in recent years, as&nbsp;both corporations&nbsp;and&nbsp;government agencies&nbsp;have struggled with how to&nbsp;enhance security given&nbsp;the de-emphasis on the network perimeter. For the most part, the zero trust movement has remained rooted in network principals. However, in the last two years, much of the world was forced to interact exclusively online, creating a sense of urgency around zero trust security and the “never trust, always verify” philosophy behind it reached a new level of importance.</p>
<p>In this panel, you’ll hear from security leaders who have approached and implemented zero trust with an identity-first philosophy, considering it a transformative way of reducing friction for users, while addressing the increasingly challenging risk environment. They believe a&nbsp;true&nbsp;zero trust environment&nbsp;requires&nbsp;a strong identity and access management framework.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-zero-trust"></a>

  <p>Zero-trust security relies heavily on the ability for independently owned and operated services to dynamically adjust users’ account and access parameters. These adjustments are based on related changes at other network services, such as identity providers, device management services or others. A set of standards from the OpenID Foundation enable independent services to provide and obtain such dynamic information in order to better protect organizations that rely on zero-trust network access. These standards are being used today in some of the largest cloud-based services from Microsoft and Google to dynamically adjust users’ account and access properties.</p>
<p>This talk gets into the details of the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework, which is the foundational standard for secure webhooks. We also explain two standards based on the SSE Framework: The Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), which provides dynamic session information, and the Risk Information and Account Compromise (RISC) Profile, which provides account compromise information</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-tulshibagwale-cappalli-standards-zero-trust-security"></a>

<p>Drone operations are estimated to bring €10bn/yr to the EU economy by 2035. A critical e-Government issue is the ability to fly drones in regulated airspace around airports. Unauthorised drone operations in the flightpath of passenger aircraft can endanger lives and cause huge financial loss for airport operators. Heathrow Airport has invested &gt;£10M in security systems to track and destroy unauthorised drones. Digitising the entire drone flight approvals process will involve many steps, but the major one we are addressing is verifying pilot training credentials. SSI could radically improve this currently cumbersome and low-trust process. In an Innovate-UK grant funded project (Fly2Plan), we developed an SSI PoC for a drone pilot training company to issue training certificates as verifiable credentials to drone pilots, which can be verified by Heathrow Airport. In this talk we present our learnings and future work.</p>

She recommends having a clear reason for saying no, being able to communicate that reason, and standing behind your decision. Davis ends with how to decline while avoiding burning bridges and saying no without regrets. She emphasizes thinking of the benefits of saying no: more time to focus on another project, more time with your family or doing something for yourself, reminding us that these are great reasons to say no and are favourable to our lives.<p></p>

<p>I wanted to share this video because it meshes well with a blog that Darrell wrote in 2018, “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/say-no-with-grace/">Say No With Grace</a>.” Darrell gives a lot of great examples for start up’s on when to say no and the best ways to approach this most awkward encounter. Tessa dives a little deeper with a clear action plan to master the art of saying no that you can apply anywhere in your life. If you feel overwhelmed with requests or are always taking on too much, this video is for you. Check it out!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Although there are some differences, in many ways the business IT and cybersecurity requirements of government are very similar to those of private sector organizations, and therefore public sector initiatives can often offer insights on tackling common challenges.</p>
<p>Public and private organizations both have to ensure the services are agile and innovative to remain cost effective and provide good user experiences, both have to ensure privacy for users of their services, both have to manage user access based on identity, and both have to face similar cyber security threats against business IT and operational technology (OT).</p>
<p>In tackling the associated challenges, public sector organizations often take the lead, providing good refence material for private sector organizations on best practices to adopt, and indeed what to avoid from lessons learned by public sector organizations.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that public sector organizations often lead the way is the fact that they tend to be early adopters of new and emerging technologies such as distributed deception platforms, fraud intelligence platforms, consumer identity and access management platforms, and machine monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Governments also tend to be leaders in the areas of digital identity, digital transformation, and cybersecurity, which is reflected in KuppingerCole Analysts research and events. Although this happening at different paces in European countries, with some countries lagging others, we are seeing that change. We expect to see more initiatives in the public sector, with those countries that have previously lagged picking up the pace.</p>
<p>Private sector organizations should therefore pay attention to what their public sector counterparts are doing to solve the challenges that they have in common. These public sector initiatives can be valuable in indicating future trends and best practice, and therefore should always be on the radar of private sector organizations to learn as much as they can. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we understand the importance of ­­­­­­­­keeping up with technology trends, and because we are committed to helping your business succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>This includes live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place this week in Berlin and online.</p>
<p>The agenda features a host of sessions looking at technology initiatives by governments around the world, including today’s keynote presentations entitled:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5116">Future Government: Transforming Public Services to Be More Agile and Innovative</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5042">Journey to the North: Canadian Perspectives and Progress on Digital Identity</a> 
 
<p>Tomorrow’s sessions focusing on government technology initiatives include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5004/1">From A to B - How Decentralized Technologies Are Changing Collaboration Between the Public and Private Sector</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5005/3">A Learning Agenda for Federal Identity</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5016/1">Denmark's 2022 brand new eID solution</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5015/2">Cardea: verifiable credentials for health information go open source</a> 
 
<p>The focus on public sector IT projects continues on Thursday, with presentations entitled:<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055"></a></p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055">Digital Identity in Travel (and Beyond), a Public- Private Affair</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5074/1">Kubernetes and Crossplane at Deutsche Bahn</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5085/3">Quo Vadis, SSI? – Self-sovereign Identity on route to production</a> 
 
<p>Also on Thursday, there are perspectives on digital identity from around the world:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/1">The future of Digital ID in South Africa</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/3">Progress and lessons on the establishment of Digital Identity in UK</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/2">Shaping the future of India by verified credentials for labour workforce</a> 
 
 Tech Investment 
<p>As mentioned above, public sector organizations tend to be among early adopters of technologies. Learn more about the technology market segments that public sector organizations are investing by looking at these Leadership Compass reports on:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80340/distributed-deception-platforms-ddps">Distributed Deception Platforms (DDPs)</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80488/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms">Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80040/ciam-platforms">CIAM Platforms</a> 
 
<p>Identity is of the areas where public sector organizations are the most active. Have a look at this Market Compass on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Providers of Verified Identity</a>, which can aid in an organization’s digital transformation, as well make significant progress towards better privacy and user-centric identity management.</p>
<p>This Market Compass on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud">European Hosted Hybrid IaaS Cloud</a> provides an assessment of the capabilities provided by these services including those for the tenant to ensure their secure and compliant use of the services. The report refences Gaia-X which is a project supported by the German government to build a competitive, secure, and trustworthy data infrastructure for Europe in the cloud.</p>
<p>Organizations looking to invest in technologies being adopted by the public sector, can have a look at some of the relevant technology solutions that we have evaluated:&nbsp;</p>

 Advisories 
<p>Looking at other countries' regulations can help you proactively prepare for upcoming regulations in your own. Therefore, have a look this Advisory Note on US <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81109/federal-regulations-on-cybersecurity">Federal Regulations on Cybersecurity</a>, which &nbsp;compares Executive Order 14028, the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, and IT Security Act (IT-SIG) 2.0 to demonstrate the relationship between these national regulations and future developments in cybersecurity.</p>
 Leadership Brief 
<p>The Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN) proposes an identity network that would allow any global organization to utilize verified identity attributes. This work both calls for and lays the groundwork for global interoperability, and this Leadership Brief entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN Explained</a> is designed to help you understand what GAIN is, what use cases it serves, and who may be interested.&nbsp;</p>
 Audio/video  
<p>Cybersecurity is another important area where public sector organizations are showing leadership. Listen to this Analyst Chat for a discussion on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/new_cybersecurity_drivers">The Need For New Drivers to Improve Cybersecurity</a> and the potential role of governments.</p>
<p>Staying with cybersecurity, have a look at this presentation from EIC 2021 entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-alling-national-danish-cybersecurity-council">How Denmark is Building the Cyberprotection Bridge Between the Private and Public Sectors: The National Danish Cybersecurity Council</a>.</p>
<p>To explore explore governmental reform and understand stakeholder expectations behind the rollout of digital identity projects in the post-COVID era, have a look at this Frontier Talk on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/frontier-talk-podcast-8-reinventing-government">Reinventing Government with Technology</a> with Sebastian Manhart, Technical Advisor on Digital Identity for the German Chancellery.</p>
<p>For further discussion on this topic with Sebastian Manhart to find out how some governments are implementing user-centric, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity with the goal of providing a holistic identity solution citizens can use everywhere and across borders, have a look at this presentation from a past KC Live event entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enterprise-blockchain-day-2021-10-13-manhart">Decentralized Identity and Governments - Can It Work?</a></p>
<p>Continuing the theme of identity, have a look at this panel discussion on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-global-identity-layer">Comparing the Different Approaches to a Global Identity Layer for Commerce, E-Health, Finance &amp; E-Government</a> and this presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-ihalainen-national-eid">Future proofing national eID</a>.</p>
 Blogs 
<p>As mentioned above, government implementations can also serve to highlight potential pitfalls, as illustrated by this blog post in response to the German Federal Government’s announcement of its Blockchain Strategy entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/blockchain-its-not-about-technology-it-is-about-use-cases">Blockchain: It’s not About Technology, It Is About Use Cases</a>.</p>
 Webinars 
<p>Governments world-wide are increasingly worried about the social unrest that could result from a cybersecurity compromise of critical infrastructure. This has highlighted the fact that the underlying operational technology (OT) is often inadequately protected. For a discussion about the cyber threats to OT, the need to address the issue of industrial cybersecurity, the benefits of OT security, and how to approach compliance with legislation aimed at controlling critical infrastructure, have a look at this webinar entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2022/04/machine-monitoring">The Machine Monitoring Mandate</a>.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is increasingly affecting all types of organisations including Governments. In order to encourage citizens to adopt digital services, the least expensive channel for governments, it is necessary to support modern connection methodologies and provide user-focussed services. To find out more about the challenges facing government, and the opportunity digital transformation affords, have a look at this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital_transformation_in_government">Digital Transformation in Government</a>.</p>
<p>Password-based authentication is no longer fit for purpose. Passwords are costly and difficult to manage, they result in poor user experiences, and they are easily compromised. This has been widely recognized for some time, but going passwordless is also challenging and continues to be elusive for many organizations, although some governments are already on board. To find out more, have a look at this webinar entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/passwordless-implementation"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/passwordless-implementation">The Path to Going Passwordless.</a></p>
 Whitepapers 
<p>Organizations are facing a brave new world in which governments are taking a proactive role in constraining cybersecurity risks. Companies with operational infrastructure that is deemed ‘critical’ to social stability can expect legislation to ensure they are adequately protecting their OT infrastructure, and monitoring and responding to cyber-threats and compromise events. To find out more on this topic, have a look at this Whitepaper entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80938/claroty-visibility-into-vulnerability">Claroty – Visibility into Vulnerability</a>.</p>
<p>Moving to the cloud sets new challenges for managing access to critical IT environments for small and medium-size businesses (SMBs). SMBs may work within the defense or government sector in which case the data protection requirements are likely to be far more stringent than a small engineering firm. For more on this topic, have a look at this Whitepaper entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80137/fast-access-management-in-the-hybrid-cloud-for-smbs">Fast Access Management in the Hybrid Cloud for SMBs</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Industry 4.0 is the fourth revolution in manufacturing. I won't bore you with the details of the prior iteration or versions and how we got where we are today, only that Industry 4.0 promises to take the interconnectedness of devices and machines to a new level. Smart or intelligent computing and autonomous systems using analytics and AI/ML techniques supported by big data are integral parts of the industry 4.0 paradigm. Industry 4.0, in short, is a significant change and will impact a manufacturing organization's digital transformation.<br><br>A Bow Wave of Devices and Machines<br>Since the start of Industry 4.0, there has been a bow wave in the number and types of device types to account for. Beyond the basic desktop, laptop, and tablets, other device types making their appearance are industrial mobile devices, mixed reality (VR) headsets/smart glasses (e.g., Oculus, HoloLens), industrial internet of things (IIoT), smart cameras, beacons, and the list goes on. And sure, there was some robotics back in the industry 3.0 timeframe, such as stationary Articulated Robotic Arms. Today, there is a broader range of robotic types in manufacturing like Autonomous Mobile Robots and Inventory Robots, Automated Guided Carts and Forklifts, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, etc.<br><br>IIoT, Data and AI<br>Since the inception of the Internet of Things (IoT), the use of IoT devices has steadily grown. IoT devices at their core collect data via sensors and perform actions using actuators. IoT sensors and actuators can be applied to many different business sectors, which account for the wide range of IoT use cases. A more recent trend is the convergence of OT and IT networks, systems, and sharing of data that Industrial IoT devices collect, allowing both businesses and operations to utilize and benefit from information sharing. With the wealth of data becoming available, AI/ML and predictive analytics can provide insights that can be of value. Also, because of the sheer amount of data generated, the trend is clearly moving towards edge computing in closer proximity to a manufacturing facility that utilizes AI/ML processing, as well as other services.<br><br>Communication is Key<br>With the number of machines and devices throughout today's industry 4.0 manufacturing environment, and the need for orchestration and automation, communication to and from machines and devices is key. The networks used in these environments include the ethernet, mesh networks, wireless, and, more recently, public and private 5G networks. The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 and 5G networks is driven by the need for faster / lower latency communications to/from machines and devices and data throughput. The communication protocols have also increased to include ZigBee, LoRa, NB-IoT, Z-Wave, Sigfox, LTE, and Bluetooth Smart, as some examples.<br><br>So, Where Does IAM Fit In?<br>I’ve talked a bit about what has changed, but what hasn’t changed or remains the same? Within the Industry 4.0 environment, each machine and device on the network still needs to be identified, and each connection across the systems-of-systems still needs to be authenticated. Access to digital resources continues to require authorization and controlled by digital policies. This is where Identity and Access<br><br>Management (IAM) fits in. An extension of IAM that can help with the management of devices is a Unified Endpoint Management solution which can track, perform device health assessments, and patch devices on an ongoing basis. An IoT Device Management platform can manage the lifecycle of IoT devices, as well as the monitoring, protecting, and visualization of IoT device status and health and the control of its data. Other cyber security solutions can also be added, but at the core, IAM will continue to be needed in the industry 4.0 digital transformation.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) Conference<br>Because we understand the importance of protecting critical assets, and because we are committed to helping your organization succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br><br>The agenda includes keynote presentations and panel discussions on Assessing the Business Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, Reinventing Government with Technology, Future Government: Transforming Public Services to Be More Agile and Innovative, Zero Trust Best Practices, and The Changing Cyber Threat Landscape, as well as other cyber security-related presentations including:</p>

				  The completion of the Indy DID Method by Indicio paves the way toward a network of networks. Verifiable credentials issued on multiple networks can now be verified by any agent that supports did:indy, affirming Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries as the most advanced framework for interoperable, decentralized identity  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Network interoperability has taken a major leap forward with the release of the Indy DID Method for Hyperledger Indy-based networks. With this new upgrade, completed by Indicio, verifiable credentials issued on a specific Hyperledger Indy network can now be resolved by any agent supporting the did:indy method regardless of which Hyperledger Indy network the verifying agent might use to anchor its issuing DIDs, schemas, or credential definitions. The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a “network-of-networks” effect.</p>
<p>The Indy DID Method was also needed to bring Hyperledger Indy—the most popular open-source codebase for creating robust distributed ledger networks for identity—into sync with the more recent World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Specification</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">Indy DID Method</a> originally began as a community development effort within <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Earlier this year, the government of British Columbia, Canada, announced a “Code with Us” challenge, to push the effort to completion. The challenge was won by Indicio and, thanks to the hard work of our talented engineers, the Indy DID Method is now available to the entire Indy community.</p>
<p>It’s hard to understate why this is a really important step forward for decentralized identity adoption. It means adding the potential of scale to every deployment, which is something we and all our customers want. With interest in verifiable credential technology increasing every day, the timing could not be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize that this is the kind of the rapid innovation that can be achieved in open source technology when a nonprofit-led community, a government, and an enterprise collaborate. We are enormously grateful to the government of British Columbia for sponsoring this “Code with Us” challenge.&nbsp; We also applaud it: This is a model for open source infrastructural innovation that governments everywhere should learn from and follow.</p>
<p>The next step is for networks and agent frameworks to incorporate did:indy&nbsp; into production software stacks. This community adoption will increase the viability of the Indy and Aries project stack and position it to be the globally dominant way to issue and share verifiable credentials in a multi-ledger world.</p>

<p>The Indicio team would like to thank BC Gov for funding this work and Dominic Wörner, another contributor to the Code With Us challenge, for his work on Indy VDR.</p>

   Privacy is one of the most challenging aspects to protect in identity solutions. 
 The entities that stand to gain the most from surveilling users can use convenience as a bargaining chip. Users understand and appreciate convenience, but they often don't appreciate the costs of loss of privacy, as the consequences often play out well after the violation occurred.

  <p>Privacy is one of the most challenging aspects to protect in identity solutions.</p>
<p>The entities that stand to gain the most from surveilling users can use convenience as a bargaining chip. Users understand and appreciate convenience, but they often don't appreciate the costs of loss of privacy, as the consequences often play out well after the violation occurred.</p>
<p>Identity practitioners often take the need to preserve privacy for granted, and in so doing fail to help users and solution designers understand the concrete impact privacy violations can have on the lives of users. This session will arm you with the concrete scenarios you need to instill in customers and colleagues a new awareness of the real costs privacy violations can have.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bertocci-privacy-cost"></a>

AI-driven, automated, everything delivered on-demand, providing the best possible user experience, and all that at an unprecedented pace that keeps us ahead of the ever-increasing speed of change: The composable enterprise.</p>
<p>But wait – less than a third of businesses that we at KuppingerCole have asked recently, say that they have processes, staff, structures, skills, and cybersecurity implemented in a way that they feel adequately prepared for what analysts may soon call the age of the composable enterprise. In this CISO panel session, we will try to look into the future of Cybersecurity, without losing sight of today´s threats and ways to continue building cyber resilience in a time of so many unknowns. Welcome to the EIC 2022 CISO Plenary Panel.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-ciso-panel"></a>

  <p>As the pace of digitalization gathers momentum, organizations are witnessing a dramatic increase in the number of digital identities. These identities interact with systems and applications relentlessly to perform day-to-day IT tasks. Nevertheless, maintaining the privacy of this data is a daunting task. Enterprise data is hosted in multi-tenant cloud, managed service providers and distributed data center environments. How an organization can maintain data privacy in this evolving IT access control use-cases depends on the level of preparedness to protect and monitor those digital identities. An identity and access management solution provides adequate safeguards to enforce IT practices necessary to maintain data privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bhandari-digital-identity-privacy"></a>
