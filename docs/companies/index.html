  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Deepfakes and Disinformation in Cyberspace</p>
<p>Cyberspace greatly enhances an actor's ability to engage in activities that can yield geopolitical and economic gains without resorting to the use of force. With the advent of cyberspace, various actors, including both state and non-state entities, have taken advantage of its vast interconnectedness to partake in a wide range of activities, including malicious behavior.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals and state-sponsored adversaries are always looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and use new tools to target individuals and organizations. For example, in recent years, there has been an increase in the use of deepfake technology to boost the execution of advanced disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>The manipulation of visual media is enabled by the availability of sophisticated image and video editing applications and automated manipulation algorithms that create content that can be difficult to distinguish from real footage. While deepfake technology can be used for fun or for artistic value, some actors could use it for malicious purposes, such as spreading propaganda or disinformation.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns are one of the most sophisticated and persistent cybersecurity threats. Disinformation is defined as the dissemination of false, erroneous, or misleading information designed to deliberately cause public harm. The integration of deepfake technology in these campaigns allows adversaries to target the very fabric of society.</p>
<p>Future trends and challenges</p>
<p>(Geo)political objectives constitute the primary driving force behind disinformation campaigns that utilize deepfakes, frequently carried out by state actors and other politically motivated groups. While governments and intelligence agencies have historically used deception and media manipulation, the accessibility to create realistic images, videos, or audio has now extended to almost any actor.</p>
<p>Deepfakes require a wide dataset containing images, videos, or voice recordings of the targeted person. The data is fed into a program that learns the victim's key features and uses the learned information to modify an existing photo or video. Essentially, deepfake technology can create a synthetic video or image that realistically represents anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Deepfakes can be used to create false content of political figures, candidates, or public figures engaging in controversial or damaging behavior. As a result, this can lead to the spread of false information, conspiracy theories, or sensationalized stories that undermine trust, sow division, and evade accountability.</p>
<p>In addition, advanced disinformation campaigns can use deepfakes to rewrite history or manipulate cultural narratives. For example, tampering with historical footage or altering famous speeches can distort the public's understanding of significant events, leading to confusion, denial, or the promotion of alternative narratives.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns can also use deepfakes to create sophisticated financial scams or fraud schemes. Fraudsters and cyber criminals could use voice manipulation techniques to impersonate someone in a phone call, tricking individuals or organizations into providing sensitive information or authorizing financial transactions.</p>
<p>How to move forward?</p>
<p>Detecting and countering deepfakes, along with promoting media literacy and critical thinking, are essential to mitigating the impact of advanced disinformation tactics. Countermeasures against deepfakes have been developed to help identify and alleviate their impact. Here are some common approaches:</p>
 
 Advanced detection technology: Implementing sophisticated detection algorithms and AI-driven tools can help identify altered content. 
 Source verification: Encouraging users to verify the sources of information they share and promoting credible news outlets can help reduce the spread of false information. 
 Digital watermarking: Embedding digital watermarks in original content can enhance traceability and accountability. 
 Public awareness and education: Promoting media literacy and critical thinking skills among the public can empower individuals to question the authenticity of information they encounter. 
 Collaboration with social media platforms: Establishing trust between tech companies and the public sector is essential to combat deepfakes and disinformation campaigns. 
 Government Regulations: Creating new regulations and legal frameworks can act as a deterrent and provide consequences for malicious actors. 
 
<p>As rogue nations continue to foster an environment for cybercriminals to thrive, individuals and organizations need to be prepared and build a strong cybersecurity foundation. It's important to note that the field of deepfakes is evolving rapidly, and countermeasures need to continually adapt to new techniques and advancements. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach that combines technical solutions, user education, and policy development is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Deepfakes and disinformation campaigns are in the focus of KuppingerCole’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a>&nbsp;event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November which will look at tackling future cybersecurity threats. Presentations will focus on a range of topics, including how AI enables cyber attackers and defenders, securing the autonomous world and the cloud, advancements in quantum computing, detecting deepfakes, securing IoT devices, securing business communication channels and supply chains, protecting digital identities, and the security challenges of Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

   Like anything, AI can be used maliciously. But when used for good, AI can be a game changer. 
	
<p>In May of this year, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) agreed to adopt a blanket ban on the use of remote biometric identification (facial recognition) in public spaces along with predictive policing tools as part of the EU's <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">AI Act</a>. The ban is a departure from the original proposal and the position backed in Council by EU member countries.</p>

<p>I believe the ban is a mistake that's being fueled by fears about AI.</p>

<p>Government and industry must work together to educate the public about the benefits of AI and its ability to detect and fend off threats in cybersecurity and beyond. People's distrust in AI underscores the need for education, not halting the use of AI. At ForgeRock, we believe that AI is a powerful tool in fraud prevention and the protection of sensitive data. But we also believe that people deserve to know how AI works, and that starts with transparency – made possible through explainable AI.</p>

<p>Explainable AI provides citizens and consumers with the reasons why the AI made a particular choice and enables organizations to understand AI decisioning and make corrections as needed.</p>

 AI's role in cybersecurity 

<p>In an increasingly digital world, AI can help companies combat <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/enterprises-are-getting-better-breach-prevention-attackers-are-getting-better-too">cybercrime</a>. In our industry, identity and access management (IAM), AI is especially valuable, because it can help to prevent identity-based attacks, which are the leading cause of data breaches.</p>

<p>With AI's ability to analyze large quantities of data and recognize patterns, it can quickly and automatically block known threats and bot activity. AI can be used to monitor user behavior and make real-time decisions about whether to grant access or add step-up authentication if there is anything anomalous about the request (such as a login from an unusual timezone).</p>

<p>This application of AI is known as risk decisioning, and it's what fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> threat protection product. Autonomous Access takes in a range of signals about who is trying to do what, and then determines what they can or cannot do next. If it detects a threat or anomalous behavior, its dashboard explains the decision in human-readable form. Admins get a detailed view of access events along with an explanation of the risky authentication attempt – this makes it easier to explain to legitimate users why they were asked for further proof of their identity. Perhaps they got a new device or were connecting from an unfamiliar network.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>
	
 The benefits of AI in cybersecurity 
	
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can boost the speed and effectiveness of cybersecurity.</p>

  Recognizing suspicious activity: AI excels in pattern recognition and can quickly analyze access attempts and user activity to identify suspicious behavior and potentially malicious activity. Plus, it continuously gets smarter at identifying the difference between normal behaviors and emerging threat patterns. 
   Speed and scalability: AI can process and analyze large sets of data far more quickly than humans. 
   Managing digital identity: The use of AI can help with managing digital identities and access permissions more efficiently, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">restricting access to systems and files</a> based on a user's role, behavior, or risk score, along with the sensitivity of the data being accessed. 
   Assisting analytics efforts: By analyzing historical data, AI can help to predict future cybersecurity threats. It can also analyze user behavior to identify unusual activity that humans could miss. 
   Improving authentication options: By analyzing contextual factors, such as location, device, and behavior, AI can calculate the risk level of an action or request and issue the appropriate authentication response. Trusted users can sail through authentication with choices like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, while suspicious or high-risk requests are prompted for further authentication or stopped and held for remediation. 
  Attackers are using AI. We should, too. 

<p>The fear of AI is understandable – its future is unknown and its potential for misuse is high. It also raises serious privacy concerns when facial recognition technology is involved, which undoubtedly led to the EU's recent ban.</p>

<p>But it's important to remember that AI is already playing an essential role in keeping us safe from sophisticated attacks, including those that are themselves fueled by AI. The advent of generative AI makes it far easier to impersonate others, and there's been an increase in attackers exploiting AI to develop new malware, create synthetic identities, and generate more targeted and authentic-looking phishing campaigns. Organizations that resist the use of AI in cybersecurity will be hamstrung in their efforts to defend against these attacks.</p>

<p>After the inaugural <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands Conference</a> we considered ways to keep the conversation going between events. We wanted to continue engaging with our existing Discord community and decided on a monthly Discord Stage chat that we could turn into a podcast.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">Causal Islands Podcast</a> will feature thought-provoking interviews with leading experts in distributed systems, AI, computing, local-first software, and more. We'll explore the intricate connections between tech + society and how these emerging technologies will profoundly shape our future.</p><p>For our first episode, we invited several speakers from the 2023 conference to chat about their takeaways from the event.</p>     EP01: Causal Islands 2023 Recap  0:00 /56:51 1×   <p>You'll hear:</p>  How our speakers felt about the unconventional conference, and why it's important to have more holistic conversations about emerging technologies  The talks that inspired them the most and what they learned  How we're thinking about next year's conference, including ways to make the hybrid aspect more engaging, and where we should consider hosting it  The new projects that our speakers are working on today &nbsp;  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:39] Chia introduced herself as an Internet Artist and Product Designer at Figma. Chia's talk explored authorship, identity, power, and our role as mythmakers and technologists.  [3:38] Envisioning the future of computing involves looking at the political, cultural, and social implications of it. This isn't discussed at many tech conferences, but at Causal Islands, it was at the forefront.  [6:24] &nbsp;Michael R. Bernstein is a marketing, sales, and business strategy consultant for high-tech startups. He's an engineer turned marketer, and his experience serves him well as co-founder of Reify, a tech marketing agency.  [9:04] Michael used his art background to approach the problem of communicating technical ideas clearly to less technical audiences.  [11:20] One of the goals of Causal Islands is movement-building. It's a long game, and you must educate first and then sell.  [12:09] Michael tackles the adoption of new technologies by not pretending to be something you're not, adapting quickly based on feedback, and focusing on how the product solves the problem.   [13:54] Quinn is an Applied Researcher at Fission. She's building Rhizome, a decentralized database. Her Causal Islands talk was about the philosophy underpinning Rhizome. In it, she explored local-first and individual computing in contrast to a model that takes globally collapsed context and understanding into one least common denominator.   [15:07] Before we can give folks these new tools, we need to explain why thinking about computing in this way is valuable and why the tradeoffs that come with building systems in that way make more sense than they may appear at first glance.   [17:20] The talks at the conference pushed back against colonial narratives of computing and explored how technology and ideology go hand-in-hand. This made Quinn feel more comfortable going deeper into these ideas in her talk.  [23:52] Quinn felt that there was a current of optimism and our ability to build a better world using technology as long as we're thoughtful and careful about how we're building it and its implications.  [27:00] Chia walked away from the conference with a reinforced belief that to realize the future, we need to look at the layer of people, relationships, governance, ownership, and decision-making. We can't just look at infrastructure, data, or protocols. This is often missed when building autonomous and pluriversal decentralized worlds.  [27:48] Jon Corbett's talk on Indigenous Computing Theory offers so many excellent ideas and a framework that we can use to help achieve this.  [32:20] There is a consensus that we would like to host the next conference in a place that is accessible and maybe a bit off the traditional path (vs going to SoCal for a tech conference). We should consider the conference in the context of the place that we're in, and we should endeavor to bring in an audience that isn't already entrenched in the technical space - for example, community organizers and nonprofit organizations.  [39:10] We might do remote watch parties in the future. We're exploring ways to provide a better hybrid conference experience.  [43:19] Causal Islands can be like a CRDT, where we can split off and work on our projects and then meet up at a larger event. This is the blueprint that Papers We Love used.  [46:47] What's next for our speakers? Chia's involved in a remote residency - Welcome to My Homepage - at the Museum of Human Achievement. She is exploring the question, "If a website is a world, how will we attend to it as we do land?" She's also working at the Phillippine Internet Archive, documenting Filipino internet culture.  [49:40] Michael is working with clients and, in particular, exploring working with AI and safe AI attribution.  [50:22} Quinn continues to work on Rhizome. She'll also be giving a talk at CodeBEAM Europe called The Tamagotchi in my Hands: Anarcho-transhumanist Biohacking with Nerves, where she'll explore expanding her own agency by building tech that is designed only for her purposes.  [53:03] The last Strange Loop conference is coming up, and Zeeshan's Papers We Love will curate a track with eight speakers.  [54:32] Boris helped organize TrainJam, a trip from Seattle to St. Louis on the Empire AMTRAK train. for folks traveling to Strange Loop. The day after StrangeLoop is a Local-First Software Unconference, that Fission is co-hosting with Ink + Switch. Tickets for the Unconference are still available.  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guest: Chia Amisola - Product Designer at <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a></p>  Chia’s Causal Islands 2023 Talk: <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/chia-amisola">The Creation Myths of Computing</a>  Chia’s Residency at the <a href="https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/">Museum of Human Achievement</a>  <a href="https://philippineinternetarchive.com/">Philippine Internet Archive</a>  <p>Guest: Michael R.

<p></p> 
<p>In today’s online world, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. Cyber threats continue to evolve, and organizations, both public and private, face a constant battle to protect sensitive data from malicious actors. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/07/18/readout-of-white-house-multifactor-authentication-modernization-symposium/">a significant event</a>, the Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium, was jointly hosted by the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the National Cyber Director, the National Security Council, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This symposium brought together industry and government leaders to discuss the urgent need for advancing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant authentication</a>. As organizations contemplate how to best protect their organization, the symposium's insights serve as a powerful driving factor to adopt passwordless MFA now.</p> 
 The Time for Modern Authentication Is Now  
<p>Federal Chief Information Officer Clare Martorana captured the essence of the symposium's purpose — to deliver a positive, intuitive and trusted digital experience for users. Modernizing authentication methods is a key aspect of achieving this goal. The traditional reliance on passwords has proven inadequate in deterring cyber threats. Cybercriminals have become adept at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">exploiting password vulnerabilities</a> through phishing attacks, social engineering, and data breaches. As a result, adopting passwordless MFA is crucial in creating a resilient cybersecurity framework.</p> 
 Simplicity and Security Should Not Be Mutually Exclusive  
<p>Federal CISO and Deputy National Cyber Director Chris DeRusha highlighted that security doesn’t have to be complex to be effective. In fact, passwordless MFA, including passkeys, offers a simple yet strong methodology to protect organizations. By requiring multiple factors for user verification, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless MFA</a> significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
<p>Implementing MFA not only strengthens security but also aligns with the President's Executive Order on cybersecurity. This alignment reinforces the notion that securing the authentication process, data and systems is a collective responsibility that extends to both public and private sectors.</p> 
 Collaborative Technology Strategies  
<p>The symposium showcased the importance of collaboration between public and private sectors to develop an interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystem. By combining efforts, organizations can learn from each other's best practices and collectively address shared security goals. Doing so enables in-depth discussions about contemporary MFA technologies and their potential impact.</p> 
 The Vision for a Safer Future  
<p>Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger called for identifying and addressing barriers to MFA adoption indicates the government's determination to support organizations in their quest for enhanced cybersecurity. As organizations embrace MFA, they not only protect their interests but also contribute to the nation's overall cyber defense strategy.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>In light of the recent Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium and the resounding calls for embracing MFA, the time is now for organizations to adopt passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA. The prevailing cyber threats demand a shift away from reliance on passwords and towards stronger, multi-factor authentication methods. As the public and private sectors collaborate to develop interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystems, organizations can better safeguard their digital assets and provide users with a seamless and secure online experience.</p> 
<p>By aligning their technology strategies with <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">contemporary MFA technologies</a> and policies, organizations contribute not only to their own security but also to the overall cybersecurity landscape of the nation. Through collective efforts, we can build a more resilient and secure digital future.</p>

<p>It’s tough to recap my experience of DWeb Camp 2023. It was an intense, invigorating, and innovative event, as was the work leading up to it. Maybe the best thing I can do is try to tell the story of the Emergence app and provide my perspective on Holochain’s involvement and learning throughout this process. So, here goes:</p> Intent <p>In March 2023 Holochain began conversations with DWeb Camp about sponsorship and offered to create a simple application for note taking and community connection (via a tag cloud and shared space for documentation). This was intended to increase the collective intelligence of the camp and to help document the conference sessions. As a local-first, peer-to-peer application it would run directly on participants' laptops and connect over the mesh network LAN that the wonderful DWeb network team sets up each year, thus not needing to connect to central servers or the rest of the internet. </p><p>At the 2022 DWeb Camp many of us experienced challenges with the scheduling app Sched. Because everyone at camp was connecting to their servers over the same low bandwidth connection, camp participants had ongoing issues loading and accessing the schedule. These conditions are exactly where distributed applications shine, and we saw this as an opportunity to give people a strong experience of a local-first application.</p> Tomorrow <p>After some conversations with DWeb’s organizing team, this initial idea grew into a plan to have our app act as a decentralized Sched and to actually facilitate a day of “open-space” style sessions, coordinating the schedule as an emergent process amongst all of the camp participants. This day became known as “Tomorrow” — a day for stepping into and embodying the technologies and social patterns that the distributed web is building towards. On that day, access to the wider Internet would be shut off so as to give all of us distributed web tool builders a real opportunity to put our tools where our mouths are! Furthermore, to double down on decentralization, during this day all the participants would be using our app for proposing sessions and coordinating in which spaces they would go.</p><p>This felt like a really exciting opportunity that we couldn’t pass up, but it came with some significant challenges. The main one being that the app would have to work on cell phones because it just wasn’t going to be feasible to have 400 people toting their laptops around the forests of Camp Navaro just to add in their sessions and browse the schedule. But therein lay the rub: Holochain is not yet cell phone ready. So, to do this, we would actually need to either get it ready for phones, or come up with a work-around that was more like Holo-hosting, where cell phone users could just use a browser to access a Holochain instance through a proxy. But of course we couldn’t use actual Holo-hosting itself because this was all supposed to work on a day where access to the wider internet was off!</p>Introducing Tomorrow. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. The Plan <p>We decided to go for both options: As Plan A, we would move forward on our “zero-arc” solution for running Holochain on cell phones directly. This solution disables gossip (and thus gets around the cell phone OS penchant of killing apps that use too much CPU/Memory/Networking), but still allows each person’s source-chain to live on the phone. As a backup, in case we couldn’t get plan A to work in time (we only had a few months), we would also develop a multiplexer, a kind of “Holo-hosting-light,” that would allow browser access to a pool of Holochain conductors that we would run on a cluster of small boxes on-site. The irony was not lost on us that to get things working in this setting we would have to do a kind of micro-re-centralization of a fully distributed tool, but this is still a useful configuration of the tech to explore!</p><p>So, I did some project planning, initial app prototyping, and smoke testing for our Plan B just to make sure that Holochain could handle the load of 500 people creating sessions and doing all kinds of activities on the 3 conductors in the multiplexer which we thought would be sufficient for our little cluster. The results looked great, no load problems. We also had a nice project plan with the various aspects of all the work and our participation in the conference, spreading out the labor and ensuring buy-in across all the stakeholders, and so we gave the green light to go ahead.</p><p>The fantastic <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starpause/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Jordan Gray</a> took the initial design requirements and created the basic UX layout for the app. From Jordan’s designs, I built out the DNA for the app and Svelte-based single-page-app front-end. We then invested significant time in building this into a reasonably polished user experience with many, many rounds of UX/UI testing and improvements so that the app would really work well for the event and provide a powerful experience both of a distributed app, but also of the distributed coordination of a conference event. We really wanted to deliver on the ethos of the D in DWeb both at the technical and social levels.</p>Emergence app sessions page with example data. The Details <p>But it turns out that there are also a couple of other challenging Ds: those of the Devil in the Details.</p><p>For a number of complex reasons, we realized about six weeks before the event that Plan A for mobile wasn’t going to land in time for DWeb. There were too many development steps with too much risk to be able to be sure it would work. Though we had the conductor compiling and working on iOS and Android, some aspects of networking were being blocked, and we realized that there just wasn’t enough time to test, debug, and get the app through the Apple/Google App/Play-Store deployment process. So we switched completely to Plan B which appeared to be working very well. I was able to build the multiplexer in a weekend, which was what we expected because it's a fairly low complexity solution. It’s just a simple Node web app sitting behind a reverse-proxy which does 3 things: 1) installs app instances using people’s keys and passwords as a seed for generating their key-pair, 2) creates a UI credential that gets stored in people’s browser as a cookie, and 3) accepts zome calls from the UI signed using that credential and forwards it to the appropriate conductor.</p><p>But then things started to get hairy: as we ran our testing sessions with more and more people, we started to get zome-call timeouts and other symptoms that looked like conductor overload. This was quite surprising as it was happening at levels of interaction well below those we subjected the conductor to in our initial smoke-testing. We soon discovered that this was because users were often just reloading their web-browsers which was dropping in-progress websocket connections to the conductor. Holochain was designed under the assumption of a single user connecting over a few websockets to a local conductor, here we were creating hundreds of unexpected websocket connections. To fix this, we added web-socket connection multiplexing into our multiplexer setup! This improved things, but still, after a while, things stopped working again. Grrrr. </p><p>So then, as we continued to debug these issues, we really started seeing the rise of additional contextual complexity. Example: our plan for deploying to our cluster using our internal nix infrastructure (based on hydra), was implemented, but incomplete because we discovered that we wouldn’t be able to serve our multiplexer service over plain http because cell phone browsers get grumpy about that and basically require https for decent user experience. So we had to include adding and provisioning ssl certificates to reverse-proxy web-servers. And well, it just snowballed from there…</p> What Happened Tomorrow Browser based key registration for the Emergence app at DWeb Camp 2023<p>At this point I’m going to stop the blow-by-blow of all of the failure modes we encountered in processes, like converting and uploading data from Sched (which we wanted to do so people could take notes on the sessions all week long), or our development machines mysteriously taking forever to deploy data to the cluster because they were actually connected to a very slow Wifi when the Ubuntu UI showed that they were on the Ethernet, etc. Each one of these issues was fixable. Each one took minutes or hours to address. Time and again, we had successful test-runs followed by complete failures.</p><p>When we got to DWeb Camp it looked like the app was finally ready, but then this saga continued all throughout the build days, and even into the two days leading up to Saturday’s Tomorrow day of emergent sessions. We did, finally, get it working. Bugs at all levels, from the UI to the network configurations, to Holochain itself, were squashed. However, by this point, the DWeb conference team had already made the call to use the backup analog process for conference scheduling (which was a more than reasonable decision given the challenges up to that point), but we were still going to use the app for its initial purpose of note-taking and sensemaking. So, there we are with the whole cluster provisioned and hundreds of people starting to use the app when suddenly the power went out to the whole valley. This meant that though peoples’ phones were operating, there was no local LAN to connect to because the Wifi access points were down. It was a perfect example of an unending series of cascading failure modes, and an ideal embodiment of exactly what the Tomorrow day was supposed to be a test of: how fully decentralized can our tech stack be? Not just as we talk about it, but in actual practice, in the middle of a camp in the redwood forest.</p><p>On the flip-side, this led to a beautiful experience in further emergence. We had planned to do a get-your-hands-on-it session for people to experience running various Holochan apps. Well, that actually worked! Because even though the Wifi access points were down, we had the idea of turning on a cell-phone’s hot-spot functionality which, even without cell service, made it an ad-hoc Wifi router for Holochain nodes on laptops to connect in the middle of the woods with no power! This felt like a significant real-life demo of the power of local-first distributed computing architecture.</p> Lessons in Complexity and Teamwork Just a few of the Holochain team at DWeb Camp 2023. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>.<p>So in the end, what did we learn? Well, there were many lessons, small and large, which we are integrating back into our work, process, and code. Part of the difficulty of expanding contextual complexity comes precisely from the fact that it is invisible at the outset, even when you account for invisible additional complexity, which we did. We certainly detected and fixed a bunch of subtle performance bugs in Holochain. And we greatly increased our in-house capacity to build out apps with decent user-experience.</p><p>One of the most powerful lessons for me, however, was the lived experience of what an amazing team we have assembled. As each one of the problems we encountered arose, someone jumped forward to help figure it out, or work on it until we moved through to the next challenge. I find that our team’s collaboration isn’t just about solving the problem, but the grace and joy of working together in doing so. </p><p>I also want to personally (and on behalf of Holochain), thank the DWeb community and especially the on-site network team. Your tireless work was inspirational as well as being essential to everything we did. It was a pleasure to work with you. </p><p>The invitation of DWeb’s “Tomorrow” to take risks and bring technologies to use rather then just talking about them was answered by Holochain and others. It served as a forcing function to put our tooling and teamwork to the test in a setting where the contextual complexity was quite high. With Holochain in beta, this experience allowed us to squash some very difficult to find bugs. We will continue to prioritize partnerships and projects that put Holochain to the test. And if anybody is interested in using a very cool app for helping run open-space/unconference style gatherings, please get in touch with us!</p><p>Special thanks to Eric Bear (process design, testing, holding the relationship with DWeb), Jordan Gray (initial spec), Aaron Brodeur (UX/UI), David Braden (multiplexer &amp; app stress testing, tooling, and Holochain debugging), Jost Schulte (testing across all levels), Stefan Junker (network infrastructure and nix deployment), Gregory Jensen (Holochain testing and debugging), and the many others who put time and labor into this project. Similarly, thank you to everyone in the Holochain team and community who showed up to the repeated test sessions both before and at DWeb Camp.</p>

<p>When businesses need industry-leading performance scalability and reliability for their SAP ERP landscape, they turn to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/power">IBM® Power®</a> for their compute infrastructure. I can pull a list of benchmarks that highlight why over 4,500 customers run SAP HANA on Power—highest SAP-certified memory scalability, leadership in SAPS performance benchmarks, ranked most reliable among SAP-certified infrastructure platforms, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/power-virtual-server">IBM Power Virtual Server</a> delivers that platform experience in a multi-tenant environment with access to IBM Cloud services. We are focused on accelerating the cloud move for Power deployments by automating the Day 1 and Day 2 operations in Power Virtual Server. Automation can shrink SAP deployment from weeks to hours and help avoid error and configuration variance. The time taken by various automated components is detailed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/automate-sap-deployments-on-ibm-cloud/">Mike Moore’s blog post</a>.</p>



 Deployable architectures 



<p>Automation in IBM Cloud is delivered as a “deployable architecture.” We GA’ed the deployable architecture (DA) for SAP S/4HANA which is based on the best practices from both IBM and SAP. Let’s dive into the details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To access DAs,&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=Power%20label%3Areference_architecture#search_results">click here</a>&nbsp;or go to&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog">IBM Cloud catalog</a>&nbsp;and select Deployable architectures from the filters on left side of the page.</p>



Figure 1. Deployable architecture catalog.&nbsp;



<p>You’ll find the below tiles, along with other DAs.</p>



 
 Power Virtual Server with VPC Landing Zone 



 Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA&nbsp; 
 



 Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone 



<p>Clients moving from on-premises to Power Virtual Server may not be familiar with network connectivity, storage configurations and the best practices to deploy cloud infrastructure. Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone&nbsp;helps to get the instances up and running quickly, securely and with minimal manual intervention. It automates the deployment of the following components:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Provisions three VPCs with one VSI in each VPC:&nbsp;  One management (jump/bastion) VSI    One inet-svs VSI configured as squid proxy server  
 
 One private-svs VSI configured as NFS, NTP, DNS server 
 
 



 Installs and configures the Squid Proxy, DNS Forwarder, NTP forwarder and NFS on hosts, and sets the host as the server for the NTP, NFS, and DNS services by using Ansible roles. 
 



<p>A PowerVS workspace instance with the following network topology. Creates two private networks: a management network and a backup network. Creates one or two IBM Cloud connections. Attaches the IBM Cloud connections to a transit gateway. Attaches the private networks to the IBM Cloud connections. Creates an SSH key.</p>



Figure 2. Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone architecture.



 Power Virtual Server&nbsp;for SAP HANA 



<p>This DA is designed to assist you in deploying SAP S/4HANA software landscapes into the IBM Power Virtual Server infrastructure. This is the second step in the deployment process to prepare SAP-certified Power Virtual Server instances for SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver workloads. After the deployment is complete, you may (depending on the&nbsp;framework&nbsp;you chose) begin installing SAP on the configured instances or login to your newly created SAP instances directly.</p>



<p>The Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA architecture automates the deployment of the following tasks, all based on best practices:</p>



 
 Creates and configures one Power Virtual Server instance for SAP HANA. 



 Creates and configures multiple Power Virtual Server instances for SAP NetWeaver. 



 Creates and configures one optional Power Virtual Server instance that can be used for sharing SAP files between other system instances. 



 Connects all created Power Virtual Server instances to a proxy server that is specified by IP address or hostname. 



 Optionally connects all created Power Virtual Server instances to an NTP server and DNS forwarder that are specified by IP address or hostname. 



 Optionally configures a shared NFS directory on all created Power Virtual Server instances. 
 



Figure 3. Power Virtual Server for SAP HANA architecture.



 Get started 



<p>These deployable architectures not only help automate the deployment of the infrastructure for SAP provisioning but can also be used for AIX, IBM i, or Linux deployment on Power Virtual Server. You can further connect it to x86-based workloads running on IBM Cloud, enabling you to take advantage of workload-optimized infrastructure across Power and x86.&nbsp;</p>

 DIVE — Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy&nbsp;System <p>We are happy to announce that KILT will provide the infrastructure for decentralized digital identities for the project DIVE — Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System by the German Energy Agency (dena). This follow up project to the “Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL)” is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.KILT is delighted to contribute to the transformation of the energy sector and to continue to work alongside dena the German Energy Agency, enterprises, and ecosystem projects using identities “Built on&nbsp;KILT”.</p><p>DIVE ​​- Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System is set to evaluate the benefit of decentralized identities in the energy sector by using them in real-world use cases, i.e., proof of origin, the participation of micro-plants in flexibility markets, and rapid supplier switching at e-charging stations. All steps up to a broad implementation will be outlined in a transformation path, so that it enables building up an ecosystem and the subsequent rolling out of further applications.</p><blockquote>Following the successful Proof of Concept (BMIL Project) last year, we move towards the production phase together with dena and our other partners. We are happy and proud to see KILT as part of the essential infrastructure of this German Energy Transition project, which already sparked great interest beyond German and even European borders. With KILT’s integration to different use cases happening this year I am pleased to see that blockchain is starting to become commodity infrastructure for real world industrial applications. — Ingo Rübe, Founder KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p><a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/dive-en/">Text from dena&nbsp;website</a></p><p>The energy system is undergoing the greatest upheaval in decades: In order to achieve climate neutrality, renewable energies in Germany must be expanded massively. Instead of a few large power plants as in the past, electricity will increasingly be generated by wind turbines, solar parks and also small roof and balcony solar systems. Specifically, this means that there will be more and more decentralized systems with a relatively low capacity of power generation. On the consumer side, charging stations for electric vehicles, heat pumps or home storage must also be integrated into the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Owners of small power generation plants consume the electricity themselves or feed it into the grid. Therefore, the devices are available for various applications (e.g. self-consumption and grid feed-in). In terms of an efficient energy system, the change between these applications has to be automated: If a feed-in is to take place to maintain grid stability, it is automatically determined whether the decentral plant is available or not. A manual change is error-prone, expensive and does not offer the necessary flexibility and speed. Applied to the millions of small plants in our energy system, a digital solution is required.</p> The DIVE&nbsp;Project <p>For this automatic change, however, trust and certainty that a plant actually exists and can feed in a certain amount of electricity at a time are needed. This is where the project Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System (DIVE) comes into play: The project investigates how systems or devices in the energy system can be equipped with secure digital identities. It will also clarify which structures are required for the associated identity management.</p> Digital Identities <p>A digital identity is comparable to an analog identity (e.g. ID card). It also consists of a unique number (e.g. identity card number, ID) and further properties (e.g. name, place of residence), with the difference that it exists and is managed digitally. As with an analog identity, a digital identity has recognized authorities that can issue and revoke the identity or certain associated attributes (e.g. driver’s license). The aim is that the verification of an identity and the associated properties (does the system actually exist? Are the specified properties such as the power and the location true? Is the system actually available?) can be automated in the energy system of the future. This ensures, for example, that the system is not scheduled for two applications at the same time and enables switching between different use cases almost in real time. For customers in particular, this can mean significant cost savings, for example if excess electricity in the grid is absorbed by their own home storage system or the PV roof system feeds in during bottlenecks.</p><p>The DIVE project builds on the previous <a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/blockchain-machine-identity-ledger/">Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL) project</a>, in which the technical feasibility of connecting a decentral plant to a decentralized identity registry was&nbsp;shown.</p> Project goal <p>The aim of the DIVE project is to build on the knowledge gained and to test decentralized identity management using application-oriented scenarios. Specific use cases that are tested in the project are proof of origin, the participation of small systems in flexibility markets and the rapid change of suppliers at e-charging stations. In addition, all steps up to a broad implementation are presented in a transformation path, so that it is possible to build an ecosystem and roll out further applications.</p><p>The project will run from June 2023 to December&nbsp;2024.</p> Project Partner <p>Forschungsstelle für Energiewirtschaft e.V., Energy Web, Oli Systems, BOTLabs GmbH, fieldfisher, Fraunhofer FIT</p> Associated Partner <p>CHARGING RADAR, EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, Equigy, Numbat, TenneT TSO, TH Ulm, TransnetBW GmbH, 50Hertz Transmission GmbH</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/dive-digital-identities-as-trust-anchors-in-the-energy-system-3c5011b5ed92">DIVE — Digital Identities as trust anchors in the energy system</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Companies can save an average of $2.66 million by testing their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cybersecurity incident</a> response plan, but many choose not to. Whether this is out of necessity or negligence, it may cost businesses their reputation and revenue in the long run. Failing to keep up with cybersecurity can have compounding effects.</p>

<p>However, overcomplicating security can be just as damaging. Security fatigue is a major risk for businesses. Find out how to mitigate it in your organization to protect your digital assets.</p>
	
 What is security fatigue? 
	
<p>Security fatigue describes the feeling of exhaustion users experience when they are inundated with too many security measures. Particularly in the workplace, staff can become overwhelmed with security warnings, IT alerts, cybersecurity policy documents, password change requests, or even media consumption of stories about data breaches at other companies.</p>

<p>Overworked admins, who may be managing many thousands of identities and privileges, are often forced to give blanket permissions, which can lead to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/rise-self-driving-identity-governance">over-privileged or unauthorized access</a> – an enormous risk in any organization.</p>
	
 Symptoms of security fatigue 
	
<p>To combat security fatigue, you must understand how it presents itself – in yourself and your employees. These so-called symptoms of security fatigue are signs that you should rethink the way you handle cybersecurity for your company. Look out for:</p>

  Reduced attention during security training or processes 
   Frequent password reset requests from the user 
   Unsafe password practices, such as weak passwords or sharing them with coworkers, family, or friends 
   A sense of frustration with security measures 
   Ignoring software updates 
   Bypassing security by connecting to your server without a VPN or on public Wi-Fi 
   Demonstrating risky online behavior 
 <p>Risky online behavior in the context of security fatigue doesn't necessarily include gambling or anything nefarious or inappropriate for the workplace. However, it can be just as damaging in different ways. When users are faced with cybersecurity fatigue, they tend to forgo the recommended security measures and may not be as vigilant about avoiding online threats.</p>

<p>If you notice employees opening, responding to, or clicking through links in suspicious emails, it's a clear sign that they aren't as engaged in cybersecurity best practices as they should be. You can test this by sending out planned phishing emails and tracking users who click through, and use that information to adjust or expand your cybersecurity training.</p>
	
 MFA prompt bombing complacency 
	
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a common cybersecurity measure taken by companies, but it can also reveal a security fatigue issue. Bad actors are well aware that organizations use MFA and are actively trying to fight their way through these security walls. One of these ways is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>If employees aren't careful, they can fall for this social engineering tactic. Typical MFA includes an authentication request sent to a user's device, such as a phone or tablet, after which the user taps the screen to "accept" that the authentication is legitimate. Attackers are, in turn, sending out fake MFA notifications, sometimes multiple times, to trick a frustrated or fatigued user into "accepting" the notification simply to make it go away. Once accepted, the attacker can gain unbridled access to user accounts.</p>
	
 The impact of security fatigue 
	
<p>Cybersecurity fatigue has clear negative impacts on businesses. Employees become tired of security measures and complacent, allowing these same measures to even work against the company's security. This cybersecurity-prompted syndrome has far-reaching risks that can't be ignored.</p>
	
 The financial risk 
	
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">According to IBM</a>, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is $9.44 million.</p>

<p>The financial risks of overwhelming employees — and consumers — with cybersecurity measures are palpable. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/customer-targeted-cybercrime-rises-traditional-digital-identity-fails">Customer-targeted cybercrime is on the rise</a> as security measures become more commonplace and attackers become more aware of how to bypass them. Data breaches due to security fatigue can result in:</p>

  Resources spent identifying and thwarting the attack 
   Legal fees and penalties for improper security 
   <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/26/how-consumers-feel-about-retail-data-breaches/">Loss of revenue due to damaged reputation and loss of trust</a> 
   Allocation of budget to increase identity theft protection 
 <p>Expending resources to identify and mitigate cyberattacks inevitably leads organizations to see decreases in productivity. IT and security teams are forced to spend less time on business operations that can improve the user experience and give the company a competitive edge.</p>
	
 The security risk 
	
<p>Many people get tired of logging into a VPN only to have a slow connection or one that drops frequently. So they connect directly to apps and data – sometimes using unsecured networks.</p>

<p>But these practices can leave your organization open to attack. Protecting your digital assets has become an ever-present need in modern businesses. Particularly during a business breakup, digital assets – like financial data, internal documents, and intellectual property – require tight security controls that prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
	
 The compliance risk 
	
<p>Security fatigue can lead to significant fines and penalties due to regulatory noncompliance and violations of industrial regulations. In addition, such violations can result in legal problems and damage to an organization's reputation. Harvard Business Review studied employees over a 10-day period and found that about 67% of <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/research-why-employees-violate-cybersecurity-policies">staff violated cybersecurity policies</a> at least once during the study period. In most cases, the employees were simply trying to get something done and security would have slowed them down. That is a clear case of security fatigue.</p>
	
 Managing security fatigue 
	
<p>Businesses can help reduce or eliminate security fatigue in several ways:</p>

  Implementing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication methods</a> to improve security and simplify the user experience 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Streamlining identity governance</a> and access controls 
   Managing the business's <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity on secure platforms</a> 
   Setting up alerts for suspicious activities 
   Using <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven tools to identify potentially fraudulent access</a>, requiring additional authorization when user behavior is unusual 
 <p>Above all, make it clear to employees and customers that cybersecurity must be a priority, for their protection and that of the business, but it can't be too onerous. That's because user experience is also a priority for acquiring and retaining customers and to avoid security fatigue amongst employees. Be transparent about your efforts to enhance security without causing fatigue, and ask for feedback directly from staff about how to improve processes. Keep an eye on employee data and track symptoms of security fatigue to ensure your mitigation efforts are working. You can't afford not to.</p>

<p>Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took the uncommon step of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-allows-imports-of-china-made-chemotherapy-to-ease-u-s-shortage-8ee88e7e?mod=mhp">allowing temporary imports</a> of a chemotherapy drug to ease a shortage in the United States of America. The drug – cisplatin – is made by a Chinese lab and will be imported without receiving formal USFDA approval. With <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/07/health/cancer-center-chemo-drugs/index.html">more than 90% of major cancer centers</a> across the country reporting experiencing the shortage, there is clearly an urgent problem to address.&nbsp;</p>
 Background on US FDA and China NMPA approaches to drug regulation 
<p>Food and drug regulation in the United States (US) and China differ in several key aspects, including regulatory frameworks, approval processes, and post-marketing surveillance. It is important to approach this topic in an apolitical way to focus on objective differences rather than any subjective biases.</p>
<p>In the US, the FDA oversees the regulation of food and drugs. The FDA has a robust regulatory framework that ensures the safety, efficacy, and quality of products. The agency conducts rigorous pre-market evaluations for drugs, assessing their safety and effectiveness through clinical trials before granting approval. This process aims to protect public health by minimizing the risks associated with the use of drugs.</p>
<p>Similarly, the FDA regulates food products in the US. It establishes and enforces standards for food safety, labeling, and ingredient requirements. The agency conducts inspections of food facilities, monitors food imports, and investigates outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. The FDA also requires pre-market approval for certain food products, such as additives and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), to ensure they meet safety standards.</p>
<p>In China, drugs and medical devices are regulated by the <a href="http://english.nmpa.gov.cn/aboutNMPA.html">National Medical Products Administration </a>(NMPA), formerly the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. China’s drug regulatory framework has evolved in recent years to align with international standards. The approval process for drugs in China involves three stages: preclinical research, clinical trials, and market approval. However, the timelines and requirements may differ from those in the US. China has also implemented a fast-track approval process for certain urgently needed drugs.</p>
 Post-market surveillance of drugs in the US and China 
<p>Both the US and China have post-market surveillance systems to monitor the safety and quality of products. In the US, the FDA employs methods like adverse event reporting, inspections, and product sampling to identify and address any potential issues. The FDA can also initiate product recalls if safety concerns arise.</p>
<p>In China, the NMPA has implemented similar measures for post-market surveillance. They monitor adverse events, conduct inspections, and enforce regulations to ensure product safety. China has also established a system for reporting adverse drug reactions and foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that regulatory systems can vary over time due to evolving scientific understanding, changes in public health priorities, and international harmonization efforts. Additionally, political, cultural, and economic factors may influence the implementation and enforcement of regulations in both countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While regulatory activities in the US and China follow similar paths procedurally there are reasons for concern regarding oversight of manufacturing processes. The possibility of substandard or even falsified drugs entering the US distribution system is therefore a real and pressing concern.</p>
 How ARTiFACTS Verify can help confirm the safety of drugs entering the US market 
<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> is a platform that tracks chain-of-custody throughout the entire drug supply chain. Here’s a quick summary of how it works:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The system covers data processing from in-field collection and quality screening to confirmation assessment and reporting to stakeholders. 
 Data about samples’ lifecycle, task results, and participants performing drug tests are recorded in blockchain to create an immutable record and chain of custody vital to drug verification. 
 The platform is integrated with the <a href="https://padproject.nd.edu/partners/">Paper Analytical Device</a> (PAD) reader&nbsp; and allows users to add data from assays (HPLC and LC/MS), screening and other common tests (MINILAB test, near infrared test). Shortly, pharmacopoeial monograph tests and root cause analyses will be added to the system. 
 Each sample type is analyzed following procedures used by scientists and research specialists which are implemented into the operating system. 
 
<p>In conclusion, while the US and China share the common goal of protecting public health through drug regulation, there are notable differences in their regulatory frameworks, approval processes, and post-market surveillance. Understanding these differences can help stakeholders navigate the complexities of bringing products to market and ensuring their safety and quality. And in parallel, ARTiFACTS Verify provides a robust tool for studying pharmaceutical quality across the pharmaceutical supply chain.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Zero-Trust practices offer many benefits to the organizations that adopt them; in this piece we will explore how they work, why they are gaining in popularity, and how DIDComm can help enable them for you.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>What is Zero Trust?</p>
<p>Zero Trust is an approach to cybersecurity that holds that you should never assume that someone or something has the proper credentials to access what they are trying to do, even if they are already inside your organization or system.</p>
<p>Picture this real-world example: When shopping at stores such as Costco, a membership card must be presented to gain entry. Therefore, it could be assumed that anyone who has made it into the store is a member, and is able to purchase goods. Costco does not make this assumption. It requires another check of the Costco club card at checkout, because the company knows that its system of checking at the door is not 100% secure. In other words, don’t trust the perimeter defense, always verify those who are inside it, which is a principle of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>Zero Trust evolved to deal with the painful and costly reality that in the digital age, perimeter defenses were easily defeated, not least by people faking or using stolen digital identities.</p>
<p>What is DIDComm?</p>
<p>Let’s shift gears now to Decentralized Identifier Communication (DIDComm) which is a method for creating a direct, encrypted line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>
<p>DIDs are a recent W3C standard and can be thought of as global digital addresses for identity, though they are more than that. If someone, something, or some organization has a DID, they have an identity and can be contacted. The key point about DIDs is that they are decentralized — unlike the identifiers we presently use in the form of emails or user accounts with logins and passwords. These are centralized forms of identity, meaning your data is stored and managed by a third party from whom you “lease” an identity like a user account. You don’t actually own your email address. By contrast, you do own and fully control your DID; you can create any number of them; they are permanent for as long as you wish, and they can refer to organizations and things as well as people. And, as noted, you can use the communications protocol in a DID — DIDComm to directly connect to other DIDs.</p>
<p>How do DIDComm and Zero Trust work together?</p>
<p>There are two aspects of DIDComm that enable Zero-Trust principles by design.</p>
<p>The first is what we will refer to as “feature discovery:” either party in the connection can disclose what kind of protocols they are willing to accept. For example, you can share that you are open to sending / receiving messages and your name, while withholding your age, location, and other personal information. What is interesting and important is that you can withhold that you are able to share certain information. Say you are religious and you don’t wish to share that fact with the other party: they will not even know that that was an option for you to potentially share.</p>
<p>Feature discovery can happen at any time, though it often happens at the beginning of a connection with another DID; but as the owner of that DID wants to have more interaction and access more of your data, you can grant additional access — or decline in real time, which is similar to the double checking in Zero Trust.</p>
<p>The second aspect is being able to process a message from another party based on your willingness to trust that entity. By making the decision to engage in a protocol on a per relationship basis, you limit the access another party has to your interactions.</p>
<p>Policy vs architecture</p>
<p>DIDComm’s architecture enables Zero-Trust policies. That’s not the same thing as Zero Trust itself, but it is a good start for those interested in adopting Zero-Trust practices.</p>
<p>Another visualization might be helpful here. Picture you have two levers on a wall and you can only allow employees to pull a specific one. A policy solution might state that only the right lever may be pulled, and anyone who pulls the left lever will be subject to a fine of $500; an architectural solution would be to remove the unwanted lever.</p>
<p>Similarly, your company most likely has data protection policies in place, and everyone likely has had training to know to double check access rights; but as long as the “lever” is available there is a chance for something to go wrong. Having architectural solutions such as DIDComm provide an extra layer of security and confidence that no data will be shared that wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about DIDComm, or have specific questions on how you might be able to get started, we encourage you to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">talk to our team of experts.</a></p>

<p>This blog post is part of the “All You Need to Know About Red Teaming” series by the IBM Security Randori team. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/randori-recon/add-ons/attack-target?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=RANWW&amp;utm_term=30AT3&amp;utm_id=IBM-blog">Randori platform</a> combines attack surface management (ASM) and continuous automated red teaming (CART) to improve your security posture.</p>



<p>“No battle plan survives contact with the enemy,” wrote military theorist, Helmuth von Moltke, who believed in developing a series of options for battle instead of a single plan. Today, cybersecurity teams continue to learn this lesson the hard way. According to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM Security X-Force study</a>, the time to execute ransomware attacks dropped by 94% over the last few years—with attackers moving faster. What previously took them months to achieve, now takes mere days.</p>



<p>To shut down vulnerabilities and improve resiliency, organizations need to test their security operations before threat actors do. Red team operations are arguably one of the best ways to do so.</p>



 <a></a>What is red teaming? 



<p>Red teaming can be defined as the process of testing your cybersecurity effectiveness through the removal of defender bias by applying an adversarial lens to your organization.</p>



<p>Red teaming occurs when ethical hackers are authorized by your organization to emulate real attackers’ tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) against your own systems.</p>



<p>It is a security risk assessment service that your organization can use to proactively identify and remediate IT security gaps and weaknesses.</p>



<p>A red team leverages attack simulation methodology. They simulate the actions of sophisticated attackers (or advanced persistent threats) to determine how well your organization’s people, processes and technologies could resist an attack that aims to achieve a specific objective.</p>



<p>Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are two other security testing services designed to look into all known vulnerabilities within your network and test for ways to exploit them. In short, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are useful for identifying technical flaws, while red team exercises provide actionable insights into the state of your overall IT security posture.</p>



 <a></a>The importance of red teaming 



<p>By conducting red-teaming exercises, your organization can see how well your defenses would withstand a real-world cyberattack.</p>



<p>As Eric McIntyre, VP of Product and Hacker Operations Center for IBM Security Randori, explains: “When you have a red team activity, you get to see the feedback loop of how far an attacker is going to get in your network before it starts triggering some of your defenses. Or where attackers find holes in your defenses and where you can improve the defenses that you have.”</p>



 <a></a>Benefits of red teaming 



<p>An effective way to figure out what is and is not working when it comes to controls, solutions and even personnel is to pit them against a dedicated adversary.</p>



<p>Red teaming offers a powerful way to assess your organization’s overall cybersecurity performance. It gives you and other security leaders a true-to-life assessment of how secure your organization is. Red teaming can help your business do the following:</p>



 
 Identify and assess vulnerabilities 



 Evaluate security investments 



 Test threat detection and response capabilities 



 Encourage a culture of continuous improvement 



 Prepare for unknown security risks 



 Stay one step ahead of attackers 
 



 <a></a>Penetration testing vs. red teaming 



<p>Red teaming and penetration testing (often called pen testing) are terms that are often used interchangeably but are completely different. <a></a></p>



<p>The main objective of penetration tests is to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and gain access to a system. On the other hand, in a red-team exercise, the goal is to access specific systems or data by emulating a real-world adversary and using tactics and techniques throughout the attack chain, including privilege escalation and exfiltration.</p>



<p>The following table marks other functional differences between pen testing and red teaming:</p>



&nbsp;Penetration testingRed teamingObjectiveIdentify exploitable vulnerabilities and gain access to a system.Access specific systems or data by emulating a real-world adversary.TimeframeShort: One day to a few weeks.Longer: Several weeks to more than a month.ToolsetCommercially available pen-testing tools.Wide variety of tools, tactics and techniques, including custom tools and previously unknown exploits.AwarenessDefenders know a pen test is taking place.Defenders are unaware a red team exercise is underway.VulnerabilitiesKnown vulnerabilities.Known and unknown vulnerabilities.ScopeTest targets are narrow and pre-defined, such as whether a firewall configuration is effective or not.Test targets can cross multiple domains, such as exfiltrating sensitive data.TestingSecurity system is tested independently in a pen test.Systems targeted simultaneously in a red team exercise.Post-breach activityPen testers don’t engage in post-breach activity.Red teamers engage in post-breach activity.GoalCompromise an organization’s environment.Act like real attackers and exfiltrate data to launch further attacks.ResultsIdentify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide technical recommendations.Evaluate overall cybersecurity posture and provide recommendations for improvement. Scroll to view full table  



 Difference between red teams, blue teams and purple teams 



<p>Red teams are offensive security professionals that test an organization’s security by mimicking the tools and techniques used by real-world attackers. The red team attempts to bypass the blue team’s defenses while avoiding detection.</p>



<p>Blue teams are internal IT security teams that defend an organization from attackers, including red teamers, and are constantly working to improve their organization’s cybersecurity. Their everyday tasks include monitoring systems for signs of intrusion, investigating alerts and responding to incidents.</p>



<p>Purple teams are not actually teams at all, but rather a cooperative mindset that exists between red teamers and blue teamers. While both red team and blue team members work to improve their organization’s security, they don’t always share their insights with one another. The role of the purple team is to encourage efficient communication and collaboration between the two teams to allow for the continuous improvement of both teams and the organization’s cybersecurity.</p>



 <a></a>Tools and techniques in red-teaming engagements 



<p>Red teams will try to use the same tools and techniques employed by real-world attackers. However, unlike cybercriminals, red teamers don’t cause actual damage. Instead, they expose cracks in an organization’s security measures.</p>



<p>Some common red-teaming tools and techniques include the following:</p>



 
 Social engineering: Uses tactics like phishing, smishing and vishing to obtain sensitive information or gain access to corporate systems from unsuspecting employees. 



 Physical security testing: Tests an organization’s physical security controls, including surveillance systems and alarms. 



 Application penetration testing: Tests web apps to find security issues arising from coding errors like SQL injection vulnerabilities. 



 Network sniffing: Monitors network traffic for information about an environment, like configuration details and user credentials. 



 Tainting shared content: Adds content to a network drive or another shared storage location that contains malware programs or exploits code. When opened by an unsuspecting user, the malicious part of the content executes, potentially allowing the attacker to move laterally. 



 Brute forcing credentials: Systematically guesses passwords, for example, by trying credentials from breach dumps or lists of commonly used passwords. 
 



 Continuous automated red teaming (CART) is a game changer 



<p>Red teaming is a core driver of resilience, but it can also pose serious challenges to security teams. Two of the biggest challenges are the cost and length of time it takes to conduct a red-team exercise. This means that, at a typical organization, red-team engagements tend to happen periodically at best, which only provides insight into your organization’s cybersecurity at one point in time. The problem is that your security posture might be strong at the time of testing, but it may not remain that way.</p>



<p>Conducting continuous, automated testing in real-time is the only way to truly understand your organization from an attacker’s perspective.</p>

<p>The exponential leap in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a> is already transforming many industries: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/exploring-generative-ai-to-maximize-experiences-decision-making-and-business-value/">optimizing workflows</a>, helping human teams focus on value added tasks and accelerating time to market. Life sciences industry is beginning to take notice and aims to leapfrog the technological advances. Life sciences industry has—for decades now—moved from the traditional discovery-based drug development to target market-based drug development paradigm. Yet, it is burdened by long R&amp;D cycles and labor-intensive clinical, manufacturing and compliancy regimens. </p>



<p>The industry is under tremendous pressure to accelerate drug development at an optimal cost, automate time- and labor-intensive tasks like document or report creation to preserve employee morale, and accelerate delivery. With BioPharma and Medical Device organizations increasingly adopting digital transformation and engagement strategies—combined with the paradigm shift brought about by the Covid19 pandemic—the industry is experiencing an explosion of digital data being created in the commercial, supply chain, clinical and pharmacovigilance areas of the value chain, and as well as in other enterprise business functions. </p>



<p>This digital data is coming at the industry in various formats, like unstructured text, images, PDFs and emails. The explosion in digital data—in combination with declining availability of skilled and willing human resources to ingest and process the digital data in a compliant manner—is forcing life sciences organizations to explore AI, machine learning and now generative AI technologies. Some examples of potential use cases for generative AI in life sciences include but are not limited to:</p>



 
 AI for Medical Legal Review (MLR): Increasing globalization and exponential growth in digital marketing techniques has been putting strain on the already complex, time consuming and challenging process. generative AI has the potential to process digital content at scale and produce an effective MLR output, which can then be leveraged by the human marketing team, accelerating and simplifying the process. 



 AI for generating Clinical Study reports (CSR): Generative AI has the potential to create a “first attempt” report, which can offset 80% of human effort, accelerating the process, bringing in consistency and freeing up valuable bandwidth for other high value tasks. 



 Adverse Event (AE) Narrative generation: This highly regulated, time-consuming task of generating an adverse event narrative requires highly regulated business functions and highly skilled roles within life sciences organizations and require coordination of manual, sometimes tedious, tasks that can produce potentially inaccurate or inconsistent results. Leveraging generative AI to augment human team capabilities presents an opportunity for Clients to reduce costs by 30%-50%, while accelerating time to market related to this process by at least 50% and improving scalability, quality, and consistency of generated reports. 



 Accelerate mRNA medicines design: Moderna, which has been leveraging machine learning and AI to advance the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) to create a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities, is <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-04-20-Moderna-and-IBM-to-Explore-Quantum-Computing-and-Generative-AI-for-mRNA-Science">partnering with IBM</a> to leverage generative AI to design mRNA medicines with optimal safety and performance. 
 



<p>Other use cases where generative AI models can help life sciences organizations unleash competitive advantage are:</p>



 
 Summarization: call center interactions, documents such as financial reports, analyst articles, emails, news, media trends and more. 



 Conversational Knowledge: Reviews, knowledge base, product descriptions and more. 



 Content creation: Personas, user stories, synthetic data, generating images, personalized UI, marketing copy, email and social responses and more. 



 Code creation: Code co-pilot, code conversion, create technical documentation, test cases and more. 



 Research &amp; Development: Drug discovery &amp; development, quality content creation and review, quality and regulatory intelligence, AE Narrative Generation, intelligent submissions, synthetic data generation. 



 Commercial: Marketing content creation, patient experience, rep onboarding &amp; training sales enablement and knowledge hub. 



 Human Resources: Create cob descriptions, skill requirements, create interview questions from a job description, assess candidates against a job spec, learning &amp; teaching assistant, quiz creation, content creation and more. 



 Manufacturing: Quality control and inspection, operator / lab tech training conversational search through SOP’s, content creation and more. 



 Supply Chain: Demand forecasting, supply chain optimization, risk assessment and mitigation. 
 



<p>We believe that leveraging generative AI-Automation can drive benefits in life sciences—including in regulated domains—and reduce cycle times for creating AE Narratives by at least 50%, based on work being done by IBM Consulting and the Pharmacovigilance group at a global BioPharma company.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we will showcase how IBM Consulting is partnering with AWS and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), on IBM Consulting’s generative AI-Automation platform (ATOM), to create industry-aware, life sciences domain-trained foundation models to generate first drafts of the narrative documents, with an aim to assist human teams.</p>



 Why IBM Consulting for generative AI on AWS? 



<p>For more than a decade, IBM Consulting has helped clients drive value through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/artificial-intelligence">machine learning</a> and automation solutions to optimize business process and IT operations across industries. More recently, IBM Consulting has been partnering with enterprises to deploy foundation models to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/exploring-generative-ai-to-maximize-experiences-decision-making-and-business-value/">reimagine core workflows and realize value</a>—reducing costs, turnaround time, and improving productivity and is committed to helping enterprises navigate and unlock value from the seismic changes driven by AI. With that in mind, IBM Consulting recently announced a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-consulting-unveils-center-of-excellence-for-generative-ai/">generative AI Center of Excellence</a> with 1000+ consultants skilled in generative AI and accelerator toolkits purpose-built for foundation models and LLMs; through this, IBM Consulting is helping enterprises develop and deploy production-grade generative AI models.</p>



<p>IBM is a Premier Consulting Partner for AWS with 20K+ AWS certified professionals across the globe, 16 service validations and 16 AWS competencies, becoming the fastest Global GSI to secure more AWS competencies and certifications among top-16 AWS Premier GSI’s within 18 months. At re:Invent 2022, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-the-2022-regional-and-global-aws-partners-of-the-year/">IBM Consulting was awarded</a> the Global Innovation Partner of the Year and the GSI Partner of the Year for Latin America, cementing client and AWS trust in IBM Consulting as a partner of choice when it comes to AWS.</p>



<p>In the AI domain, IBM has 21K+ data Scientists, AI Engineers, and consultants and has executed 40K+ AI and analytics engagements. But with great power comes great responsibility, and this is especially true for generative AI. IBM Consulting has been driving a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-consulting-brings-a-valuable-and-responsible-approach-to-ai/">responsible and ethical approach</a> to AI for more than five years now, mainly focused on these five basic principles:</p>



 
 Explainability: How an AI model arrives at a decision should be able to be understood, with human-in-the-loop systems adding more credibility and help mitigating compliance risks. 



 Fairness: AI models should treat all groups equitably. 



 Robustness: AI systems should be able to withstand attacks to the training data. 



 Transparency: All relevant aspects of an AI system should be available to the public for evaluation. 



 Privacy: The data used in AI systems should be secure, and when that data belongs to an individual, the individual should understand how it is being used. 
 



<p>IBM is helping several life sciences entities deploy AI in a responsible and trustworthy manner across several functions. IBM has been partnering with Johnson &amp; Johnson to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/services/2021/10/01/building-a-future-ready-workforce-with-data-and-ai/">fundamentally rethink their talent strategy</a> using AI-based skills inferencing in a responsible fashion, and delivering <a href="https://youtu.be/EUVRbAplJS8?t=2802">transformation at scale for application observability using AIOPs</a>.</p>



<p>To help life sciences organizations follow GxP guidelines and regulations when developing or manufacturing drugs and medical devices, IBM Consulting leverages its vast GxP experience and AWS best practices around <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gxp-part-11-annex-11/">GxP</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA</a> and other <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/">compliance programs</a> to deliver compliant, regulated, validated and secure solutions.</p>



 How to build a generative AI pipeline in AWS for narrative generation? 



<p>Currently, creating narratives for adverse events is an intensive manual process in healthcare. When an adverse event is reported, clinical and safety teams manually read and process several details—patient current and historical health and medical information, the event data and more—and manually write a detailed report, as is needed by the regulatory authorities. With the advent of generative AI, we believe these processes can be augmented to free up capacity for clinical and safety teams to shift to higher value tasks such as reviewing the narratives as well as enabling the teams to focus on more complex tasks.</p>



<p>We explored multiple options for the task of generating adverse event narratives using generative AI. Ultimately, one of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/hugging-face/">HuggingFace</a> Large Language Models on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html">Amazon Sagemaker JumpStart</a> was selected to build the Adverse event narratives for multiple reasons: it has a permissive license that allows commercial usage, clear model/data cards for the source model that can explain its data lineage, the ability to fine-tune the model within Sagemaker Jumpstart, and robust capability to generate adverse event narrative text with minimal amount of fine-tuning.</p>



<p>The high-level pipeline for this process is shown in Figure 1. We started with prepping the proprietary structured data to clean and make it ready in a format to be able to pass within prompts for fine-tuning and inferencing. The Large Language Model was then fine-tuned in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon Sagemaker</a> on a training dataset of 500+ records that describes patient health information, adverse events and medical information, using the pipeline shown below. Amazon Sagemaker is an optimal platform for generative AI owing to several in built functionalities (ability to select models from a catalog, no code approach to train models, functionalities to set up additional pipelines and monitor.) Once fine tuned, the deployed model was used to inference on a test data to create the AE narratives (see Figure 2 for a sample). Additionally, the team of Safety and Clinical Subject Matter Experts validated the narrative generation using ground truth documents and manually analyzed them to ensure that the generative AI-Automation pipeline was reliable and not subject to hallucinations.</p>

Figure 2. An AI generated sample narrative of adverse events



<p>In addition to this, IBM Consulting recently launched <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a> on AWS, an open, hybrid, governed data store to help enterprises scale analytics and AI. IBM Consulting is also partnering with AWS to integrate the upcoming <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Amazon Bedrock</a>, a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, into ATOM, to help clients build and scale generative AI use cases, while <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/strengthening-cybersecurity-in-life-sciences-with-ibm-and-aws/">strengthening cybersecurity</a> and compliance.</p>



 Business Value 



<p>As per <a href="https://fis.fda.gov/sense/app/95239e26-e0be-42d9-a960-9a5f7f1c25ee/sheet/7a47a261-d58b-4203-a8aa-6d3021737452/state/analysis">FAERS database</a>, the number of reported AEs has grown 2.5x in 10 years, from 2012 to 2022. Regardless of volumes, companies must report these events rapidly to regulators and act quickly on safety signals. The burden from growing event volumes is reflected in budgets that are expected to grow from an estimated USD 4 billion in 2017 to over 6 billion by 2020.</p>



<p>According to a top 10 major US based life sciences client that IBM consulting is currently working with, leveraging generative AI in a compliant and responsible fashion has the potential to reduce the manual labor for creating AE reports by 50%. Combining that with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke2OEjo4nPw">AI driven, human in the loop, language translation solution</a>, can further optimize operation costs and free up valuable human teams to focus on value added tasks.</p>



<p>In a nod to the growing usage of Machine learning in life sciences, FDA has now <a href="https://healthexec.com/topics/artificial-intelligence/fda-has-now-cleared-more-500-healthcare-ai-algorithms">cleared more than 500 medical algorithms</a> that are commercially available in the United States. More than half of algorithms on the U.S. market were cleared between 2019 to 2022, with more than 300 apps in just four years. In October 2022 alone, the FDA approved 178 new AI/ML systems, a number expected to grow rapidly into the future.</p>



<p>This momentum creates an enormous business value for life sciences clients looking to innovate across the value chain, leveraging cutting edge technologies like generative AI.</p>

  <p>As announced on June 7, 2023, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> is now generally available, and with it a set of new capabilities to empower businesses in their pursuit of streamlined access management. If you’re running your organization’s&nbsp; program, your primary job responsibility is linked to the business goal of ensuring that the right people have access to the right resources for the right amount of time. If you’re running your organization’s&nbsp; program, then identity governance – the ability to know who has access to what, when, and why – is foundational to Zero Trust. Regardless of the business objective driving your identity governance and administration (IGA) initiative, you shared with us the importance of implementing and monitoring IGA rollout in a way that demonstrates the effectiveness of IGA controls to your business stakeholders. We heard you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we created a new Microsoft Entra ID Governance dashboard that pulls information, giving you an at-a-glance view of your current state of Identity Governance, a launch-pad for IGA features, and quick access to compliance reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that implementing Identity Governance is a journey, and you may be in different stages of this journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If you are just getting started, use the dashboard to assess the complexity of your IT landscape. Identify the number of users and guests in your tenant. Discover business apps and privileged roles in your tenant and review capabilities provided by Entra ID Governance to create an implementation plan that addresses your security and compliance needs. 
 If you’ve already deployed certain governance capabilities, use the dashboard to understand the coverage of your governance automations and find and close implementation gaps. For example, maybe you have automated birthright access using <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2210375">entitlement management</a>, but you have not set up periodic <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2211313">access reviews</a>. Use the call-to-action links in the dashboard to further improve your identity governance posture.<br> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we plan to evolve the ID Governance dashboard to further align the experience with your security and compliance needs while making it even easier for you to get started by reducing setup and configuration requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use the Microsoft Entra ID Governance dashboard&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access it, sign into the Microsoft Entra admin center and select the “Dashboard” blade under “Identity Governance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard experience is made up of the following main components:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Glanceable cards: These cards provide high-level insights into what’s happening in your tenant from the perspective of employee, guest, privileged identities, and application access governance. The navigation links in the glanceable cards point to ID Governance quick start guides and tutorials. 
 ID Governance status: This visual shows your identity landscape in terms of number of employees, guests, business apps, groups, and privileged roles. It then highlights the various Microsoft Entra ID Governance feature sets configured to better govern these entities. If a feature is not configured, you can use the “Configure Now” option to open the configuration landing blade for that feature. 
 Tutorials: This section contains tutorials of popular ID Governance use cases for quick access. 
 Highlights: Use the content in this section to stay informed about the latest ID Governance features and learn how customers are using ID Governance to improve their security and compliance posture.<br>

<p>Whether placing an order, requesting a product exchange or asking about a billing concern, today’s customer demands an exceptional experience that includes quick, thorough answers to their inquiries. They also expect service to be delivered 24/7 across multiple channels.</p>



<p>While traditional AI approaches provide customers with quick service, they have their limitations. Currently chat bots are relying on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning algorithms (or models) to automate tasks and provide predefined responses to customer inquiries.</p>



<p>Generative AI has the potential to significantly disrupt customer care, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques designed to understand complex inquiries and offer to generate more human-like conversational responses. Enterprise organizations (many of whom have already embarked on their AI journeys) are eager to harness the power of generative AI for customer service. Generative AI&nbsp;models understand context, generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, and handle customer inquiries and scenarios more effectively. They can comprehend complex customer queries, including nuanced intent, sentiment and context, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. Generative AI can also leverage customer data to provide personalized answers and recommendations and offer tailored suggestions and solutions to enhance the customer experience.</p>



 How generative AI is disrupting customer service 



<p>Generative AI represents a powerful opportunity for businesses to increase productivity, improve personalized support and encourage growth. Here are five exciting use cases where generative AI is changing the game in customer service:</p>



 
 Conversational search: Customers can find the answers they’re looking for quickly, with human-like responses that are generated from finely tuned language models based on company knowledge bases. What’s different is that generative AI can provide relevant information for the search query in the users’ language of choice, minimizing effort for translation services. 



 Agent assistance – search and summarization: Customer support agents can use generative AI to improve productivity, empowering them to immediately answer customer questions with automatically generated responses in the users’ channel of choice based on the conversation. Generative AI auto-summarization creates summaries that employees can easily refer to and use in their conversations to provide product, service or recommendations (and it can also categorize and track trends). 



 Build assistance: Employees who create chatbots and other customer service tools can use generative AI for content creation and build assistance to support service requests, getting generated responses and suggestions based on existing company and customer data. 



 Call center operational and data optimization: Generative AI enhances the feedback loop, as it can summarize and analyze complaints, customer journeys, agent performance and more, converting a costly call center into a revenue generator by evaluating performance improvements for enhanced services. 



 Personalized recommendations: Generative AI considers the history of a customer’s interaction with the brand across platforms and support services to provide them with information that is specific to them (and delivered in their preferred tone and format). 
 



 Transforming the contact center with AI 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting™</a>&nbsp;can help you harness the power of generative AI for customer service with a suite of AI solutions from IBM. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/bradesco">businesses can automate customer service answers with a high degree of accuracy</a> with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">Watson Assistant</a>, a conversational AI platform designed to help companies overcome the friction of traditional support in order to deliver exceptional customer care. Combined with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-orchestrate#:~:text=Watson%20Orchestrate%20is%20one%20in,IBM%20Watson%C2%AE%20Assistant">Watson Orchestrate™</a>, which automates and streamlines workflows, Watson Assistant helps manage and solve customer questions while integrating call center tech to create seamless help experiences.</p>



<p>With the recent launch of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx,</a> IBM’s next-generation AI and data platform, AI is being taken to the next level with three powerful components: watsonx.ai, watsonx.data and watsonx.governance. Watsonx.ai is a studio to train, validate, tune and deploy machine learning (ML) and foundation models for Generative AI. Watsonx.data allows scaling of AI workloads using customer data. Watsonx.governance is providing an end-to-end solution to enable responsible, transparent and explainable AI workflows.</p>



<p>To deliver the best generative AI solutions for contact centers, IBM Consulting works closely with ecosystem partners including Salesforce, Amazon, Genesys, Five9 and NICE to help ensure clients benefit from open source and other technologies.</p>



 Generative AI for customer service in action 



<p>As part of a multi-phase engagement, Bouygues Telecom has been working with IBM Consulting to transform its call center operations with enterprise-ready generative AI capabilities. Prior to this phase, the European telco <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/bouygues-telecom">engaged with IBM</a> to scale its first four cloud-native AI apps across <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/aws">Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud</a>, an IBM ecosystem partner.</p>



<p>Despite having 8 million customer-agent conversations full of insights, the telco’s human agents could only capture part of the information in customer relationship management (CRM) systems. What’s more, they did not have time to fully read automatic transcriptions from previous calls. IBM Consulting used foundation models to accomplish automatic call summarization and topic extraction and update the CRM with instant, accurate and actionable insights. This innovation has resulted in over $5 million saved in operational improvements and a 30% reduction in pre- and post-call operations.</p>



<p>In another instance, Lloyds Banking Group was struggling to meet customer needs with their existing web and mobile application. Within weeks, the IBM team of data scientists, UX consultants and strategy consultants <a href="https://www.mca.org.uk/consulting-case-studies/ibm-consulting-with-lloyds-banking-group">built a proof of concept (POC)</a> to prove that LLMs radically improved the virtual assistant &nbsp;experience by reducing unsuccessful searches, improving virtual assistant performance and personalizing search performance for its customers. The LLM solution has resulted in an 80% reduction in manual effort and in 90% accuracy of automated tasks.</p>



 Navigating the challenges of generative AI 



<p>In a 2023 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/c-suite-study/ceo">study conducted by the IBM Institute of Business Value</a>, 75% of CEOs surveyed believe the organization with the most advanced generative AI will have a competitive advantage. However, executives are also concerned about navigating risks such as bias, ethics and security.</p>



<p>To help clients succeed with their generative AI implementation, IBM Consulting recently launched its Center of Excellence (CoE) for generative AI. It stands alongside IBM Consulting’s existing global AI and automation practice, which includes 21,000 skilled data and AI consultants who have completed over 40,000 enterprise engagements and specialize in helping organizations across every industry adopt and scale AI safely, detect and mitigate risks, and provide education and guidance.</p>



<p>No matter where you are in your journey of customer service transformation, IBM Consulting is uniquely positioned to help you harness generative AI’s potential in a trusted, open and targeted way built for business.</p>

<p><a href="http://Suomi.fi">Suomi.fi</a> e-Identification is a Finnish public service identity system. Using Suomi.fi, users can authenticate to any public administration service, and move seamlessly between the services that use it for authentication. It was introduced in 2015, and it now supports more than 200 million identifications each year. There are currently around 245 public and private sector <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/instructions-and-support/e-authorizations/what-is-suomifi-e-authorizations/services-using-suomifi-e-authorizations">services</a> relying on Suomi.fi for identification.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.suomi.fi/instructions-and-support/e-authorizations/what-is-suomifi-e-authorizations/services-using-suomifi-e-authorizations">Suomi.fi e-Authorizations</a> was introduced in 2016. It can be used to digitally authorise other individuals and organisations to take care of tasks on your behalf, whilst being legally binding. The system enables a wide range of scenarios, including allowing the registration of mandates in complex legal entity forms, including for public administration bodies, clubs and associations, churches, investment funds, deceased estates, bankrupt or liquidated entities and organisations with foreign officials. Mandates can either be granted to the assignee or you can conveniently proactively request a mandate through the service. This reduces the actions required to get a mandate, when the assignor is less familiar with the service and may be reluctant to initiate the process.</p>
<p>Offering a centralised platform for identification and authorisation streamlines the implementation and adoption of new online services. The efficiencies that this has enabled are quite incredible. The number of services connected, and the number of transactions, have shown strong growth since Suomi.fi’s inception.</p>
 Why was Suomi.fi created? 
<p>The Suomi.fi platform was born out of the National Architecture for Digital Services Programme, which ran from 2014 to 2017. Work and scope of the programme have continued since then and the platform is a core part of Finland’s digital e-government strategy.</p>
<p>Prior to Suomi.fi e-Identification, there were two widely used strong authentication services in the public sector: Tunnistus.fi and VETUMA. VETUMA included the ability to integrate payments-as- a-service. Consolidation and harmonisation of the services into Suomi.fi proved to increase adoption both by online services and by the general public.</p>
<p>Prior to Suomi.fi e-Authorizations, the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="KATSO platform">KATSO platform</a> served Finland for 15 years from 2006 to 2021. To ease the transition to Suomi.fi, mappings were made between KATSO roles and the new Suomi.fi e-Authorization Mandate Themes. In 2020, KATSO had 32 relying organisations and around 170 roles. Comparatively, today Suomi.fi e-Authorizations has over 200 relying organisations and over 400 mandate themes.</p>
<p>Detailed history of the Suomi.fi services, including e-Identification and e-Authorizations can be found at <a href="https://dvv.fi/en/suomifi-history">https://dvv.fi/en/suomifi-history</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, 196.6 million logins were made via the Suomi.fi service to government services or private sector service providers fulfilling a government mandate. This was slightly less than the peak annual 200.5 million login events achieved in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
 How does Suomi.fi e-Identification work? 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification is closely tied to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/finnish-trust-network-ftn/" title="Finnish Trust Network">Finnish Trust Network</a> (FTN) – a framework which allows application providers to enter into a single contract, with a single integration, to make use of multiple identity providers. Suomi.fi uses Finnish Trust Network actors to provide the strong authentication brokering and authentication for citizen login.</p>
<p>This means that a user accessing a service via Suomi.fi can be authenticated via a number of identity providers (IdP) – including all of the FTN IdPs that are brokered to the service, all using one integration and contract as enabled by the FTN. These are predominantly bank IdPs (see screenshot below for options), giving users choice over which strongly authenticated pre-existing identity they use to access public services with Suomi.fi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The identity brokering part of the Suomi.fi service is contracted by the Digital and Population Data Services Agency from third-parties, and subject to the public procurement process. This was first done in 2017, again in 2018, and most recently in December 2020. This streamlines the system management significantly and enables cost savings. Like most major government service procurement contracts, the contract is put to tender at regular intervals. Thanks largely to the tightly specified Finnish Trust Network requirements, this part of the service can be defined so precisely that the only criterion for selection is the lowest price. The next procurement round has been announced for Autumn 2023.</p>
 How do Suomi.fi e-Authorizations work? 
<p>Using the authentication services provided by Suomi.fi e-Identification, Suomi.fi e-Authorizations provides the powerful ability to allow one party to act on another party’s behalf. This removes the need for paper-based power of attorneys or letters of consent!</p>
<p>Suomi.fi e-Authorizations provides very high-level authorisation using the concept of <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/e-authorizations/mandate-themes">mandate themes</a>. For example, the theme “Representation at the General Meeting” gives another person your rights at shareholder meetings.</p>
  
<p>The scope of the authorisation can be further tightened using the ID of the company in question. In this example, Jane Doe can represent someone at the General Meetings for company ID 123456-7 only:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even non-Finnish individuals and organisations can use the electronic authorisation service, thanks to a Finnish Authenticator app launched in 2020.</p>
<p>The system gives clear information on what mandates have been given or received and how long they are valid for. It’s also easy to change or revoke a mandate.</p>
 Limitations of the e-Authorizations service 
<p>One limitation is that for mandates requested from or given to individuals, you need to know the social security number of the assignor. Some people may be reluctant to provide this for fear of misuse.</p>
<p>Further, the mandate themes approach gives an all-or-nothing approach to access within the defined theme. For example, the use of Suomi.fi by all Finnish pharmacies. For the theme “Use of pharmacy services”, the assignee of the mandate can carry out a wide range of activities:</p>
 
 pick up medication from the pharmacy on behalf of the assignor 
 request that the assignor’s prescription is renewed by the pharmacy 
 request the pharmacy to check the benefit data related to the assignor’s prescriptions and medicines and to give information on them to the assignee 
 give their consent for the invalidation of the assignor’s prescription at the pharmacy 
 ask for a summary of the assignor’s prescriptions 
 
<p>Rather than only being able to grant authorisation to complete one of these tasks, the mandate themes approach grants authorisation for all tasks in one go. Therefore, in this example, you can’t allow someone to only pick up a specific prescription medicine on your behalf. If you give them this mandate theme, they can pick up any medicine and even get access to a summary of all of your prescriptions.</p>
<p>The scope of some types of mandates can be limited by using a specifier – for example, entry of a property ID may be used to limit the mandate to a certain property, or entering a company ID to limit a mandate to matters related to a certain company (as seen earlier).</p>
<p>For use cases where permission to do something on another’s behalf needs to be limited beyond the standard capabilities of the system, for example access to specific documents or projects, additional access right management systems are required. Ubisecure provides software solutions that allow Suomi.fi to provide federated user authentication and can be integrated with Suomi.fi e-Authorizations for coarse-grain access control. On top of this, fine-grained access control can then be managed within the Ubisecure Identity and Access Management platform. This is available as an on-premises deployment, as a managed software-as-a-service solution or a hybrid cloud/on-premises approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/demo/" title="Get in touch for a demo">Get in touch for a demo</a>.</p>
 What’s next for Suomi.fi? 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification and e-Authorizations are the backbone of eGovernment services in Finland. They have built on the success of prior services in a comprehensive, easy-to-use, and well documented shared service. Its success is no doubt also due to the funding model – individual government services and departments can use the platform without charge, and the Ministry of Finance funds the service for the public good.</p>
<p>Suomi.fi e-Authorizations is under constant, active development – including additional reporting, improved usability and finer-grain administrative user rights controls. The <a href="https://dvv.fi/documents/16079645/20878327/Suomi.fi+julkiset+tiekartat+06-2023.pdf/d8e513ec-1c97-a7c9-9959-1ae2ca486f71/Suomi.fi+julkiset+tiekartat+06-2023.pdf?t=1687435081595">public roadmap</a> shows themes such as continued development for stability, reliability, availability and usability, making it easier for foreigners to do business in Finland, and exploring opportunities and coordination with the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/european-digital-identity-framework/" title="European identity wallet">European identity wallet</a>, looking at the integration of foreign trade registers. Another big focus is on investigating the handling of complex cases around authorisation involved in legal guardianship and lasting power of attorneys.</p>
<p>You can follow the growth and development of Suomi.fi via monthly updates provided by the team at the Digital and Population Services Agency (DVV), which is available (in Finnish) at <a href="https://dvv.fi/suomi.fi-infot">https://dvv.fi/suomi.fi-infot</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also positive to see third-party, commercial, non-governmental organisations starting to streamline their processes by adopting the central Suomi.fi service. For example, business management software for entrepreneurs that perform tax reporting and declarations on behalf of small-business owners; or shareholder registry and management platforms that allow representatives of shareholders to participate in shareholder meetings.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification and e-Authorization are integral cornerstones of the Finnish digital society. Without these critical services, online interaction with all levels of government would come to a standstill. The design, both logical and technical, has proven the test of time – it is a reliable and easy to use service with enormous proven benefits for citizens, businesses, and public officials alike.</p>

			 The partnership provides financial institutions with a cutting-edge tokenization platform handling ERC3643-based tokenized securities atop an integrated non-custodial wallet infrastructure to abstract away blockchain complexity while ensuring compliance and security.&nbsp; 
<p>Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading real-world asset tokenization platform, has joined forces with <a href="http://dfns.co">Dfns</a>, the leading multi-party computation (MPC) wallet infrastructure and security firm, to provide a comprehensive tokenization solution for financial institutions. This new collaboration offers Tokeny’s enterprise-grade tokenization platform along with Dfns’ embedded non-custodial wallet infrastructure, enabling institutions to seamlessly issue, manage, and distribute ERC3643-based tokenized assets through a fully compliant suite of tools built for user experience and security.</p>
<p>Tokenization is poised to revolutionize finance, with blockchain networks playing a pivotal role as the shared financial infrastructure to eliminate data reconciliation and enable programmable securities to improve efficiency and asset liquidity. With the projected valuation of tokenized illiquid assets reaching $16 trillion by 2030 by BCG, it is crucial for institutions to embrace innovative solutions that cater to evolving market demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the industry has evolved in recent years, use cases developed have leveraged market proven and audited permissioned token standard ERC3643, ensuring that only eligible investors can transfer digital securities and issuers are always in control. This open-source protocol brings compliance and control on the blockchain. However, the end users, such as issuers, agents, and investors, must adopt wallets to sign their blockchain operations. In some jurisdictions, issuers face some regulatory restrictions when offering wallet solutions to investors to facilitate their user journey.</p>
<p>The bundled Tokeny/Dfns solution brings financial institutions a turnkey platform where the blockchain complexity disappears. Users get automatically generated wallets and perform transactions directly on the GUI or via API integrations. The signatures of these transactions are on the blockchain, the user is in full control of the wallet and the process is similar to any web banking experience. By incorporating this solution into their operations, institutions can enhance operating efficiency and deliver innovative features to their customers without needing to face any blockchain complexity.</p>
<p>Key features of the Tokeny/Dfns solution include:</p>
 
 An intuitive dashboard and powerful APIs allows users to navigate and manage tokenization projects effortlessly using ERC3643 standard. The solution streamlines the entire process, from issuance to lifecycle management, and provides all the required white-labeled tools for tokenization projects, including investor onboarding tools, permissions management tools, an investor portal, a marketplace, and secondary market solutions. 
 The platform is multi-chain, multi-assets, and multi-jurisdiction.&nbsp; 
 The ERC3643-based permissioned tokens incorporate compliance rules relying on on-chain identities to guarantee the ownership, which enables recovery functions, support for multiple wallets per investor, and more. 
 A comprehensive dashboard provides the ability to track on-chain ownership and establish comprehensive cap tables that include investor data, aggregating on-chain identity addresses and off-chain relevant data relating to the identity.&nbsp; 
 Unique programmability and granularity of actions due to the exposure of permissions, controls and policies at the API-level which enables automations and complex multi-step flows involving several approvers/stakeholders and other decision-making variables. 
 The dashboard and API have embedded MPC wallets, enhancing the decentralization of the keys, reducing the surface of trust, and enabling cryptographic controls over asset movements by the custodian and/or final owners. 
 Hardened TEE-based security measures and ensured compliance with all regulations can be guaranteed due to Dfns’s mastery of secure enclaves and composable key deployment schemes across multiple clouds, HSMs and availability regions. 
 Non-custodial MPC wallet infrastructures provide financial institutions, who are bound by local regulations, with the opportunity to promote their services internationally, expanding their reach to include investors from other countries. 
 Streamlined pricing model offers scalability and cost efficiency, providing financial institutions with a competitive advantage. 
 

		 
	 
    This collaboration is a game changer because tokenized securities are now manageable with a great user experience, combined with the security and automation needed by large financial players. It makes it simple for institutions to harness cutting-edge technology to improve their operations and offer tokenized capabilities to their clients. As barriers to entry are lowered and compliance features meet institutional standards, we'll experience the full benefits of this transformative technology. Tokenization is not the future of finance anymore, it’s happening today.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Dfns’ unique MPC implementation powers Tokeny’s platform with issuer wallets and enables issuers to generate wallets for their investors as well. This partnership enhances the UX for investors who do not need to interact with any private key and related blockchain complexity. One should think of it as an Apple-Pay-like experience for investors who want to access their tokenized securities instantly. It also enables end-to-end automations where the issuer can determine the compliance workflows they need. We are very excited about this new offer and wish to push out new features together in the coming months.  Clarisse HagègeCEO of DFNS

Een belangrijke vraag is dus: zouden consumenten hun bank data willen delen?<br><br>We deden een onderzoek onder 310 consumenten om hier antwoord op te krijgen. In dit artikel delen we de resultaten van ons onderzoek. Ook bespreken we waarom het vertrouwen van de consument de sleutel is tot de potentie van open banking, waarbij we dieper ingaan op de verantwoordelijkheid van de sector om dit vertrouwen te stimuleren.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Elizabeth Garber and Mark Haine, co-editors of the Global Assured Identity Network paper. 
<p>In episode 95, Elizabeth Garber and Mark Haine, who were editors on the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) paper, join Oscar to share the latest updates for GAIN, including recapping what GAIN is, the challenges that have been faced, alongside successful case studies and what developments we can expect to see for the future of GAIN.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s all interconnected with standards development and has a really big impact on how identity systems will work, interoperable, in years to come.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You’ll remember Elizabeth Garber, who was one of the lead editors of the GAIN paper – we interviewed her in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="episode 52">episode 52</a> (back in October 2021).</p>
<p>Elizabeth has a long background in Customer Strategy and Product Management. She has also led the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance and co-chairs the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN technical proof-of-concept, which strives to create globally interoperable networks for exchanging high-assurance identity information. Since we last interviewed her, she co-founded IDPartner, a venture-backed startup that puts people in control of their digital identities.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, everyone. You will remember Elizabeth Garber, who was one of the lead editors of the GAIN paper. We interviewed her in episode 52, late in 2021. Elizabeth has a long background in customer strategy and product management. She has also led the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance, and she co-chairs the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN technical proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>Since we last interviewed her, she co-founded IDPartner, a venture backed Start-Up that puts people in control of their digital identities. This will be a key player in any global assure identity network, as interoperable networks are beginning to flourish.</p>
<p>We have a second guest. Our second guest today is Mark Haine. He is an engineer and entrepreneur who has focussed his career on building solutions that enable business and mitigate the risk in financial services through Considrd.Consulting Ltd. Mark and his team are providing strategic security consultancy to a range of clients. He has also taken on a leadership role on the OpenID Foundation as co-chair of the eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group and is co-author of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance Specification. Mark also is a board member of the Open Identity Exchange.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and Mark recently published a draft paper for the OpenID Foundation called Human-Centric Identity: a primer for government officials, which is all about how to design identity systems to sustain and promote human rights. As we speak, it’s open for public comment. You can find it on the OpenID Foundation website – <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a>. So, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Hello, Elizabeth. Hello, Mark.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garber: Hi.</p>
<p>Mark Haine: Hi.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s very nice having you. Welcome back, Elizabeth, and welcome for the first time Mark. So, we’ll hear more about GAIN, this initiative that was launched a bit less than two years ago. And we really want to hear the news about that. But to get started, we always want to hear about our guests.</p>
<p>So, for all of you, please tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Okay, I’ll go first. For me, the journey really started in identity when I was working at a bank. We had introduced a new vendor into our identity and access management program. I won’t say who because it didn’t really go very well at first. But I was brought in as kind of fresh eyes to lead a root cause analysis exercise and make some quick changes and fixes. And that led to two things.</p>
<p>First, I ended up taking a digital products role on that team and having more and more to do with identity. And second, I was absolutely hooked on the industry. So, there were just so many interconnected challenges and opportunities. The stakes were really, really high. So, I started to form partnerships outside the bank, and most notably with the person who would become my good friend and my Start-Up co-founder Rod Boothby. So, he brought me into the Open Digital Trust Initiative with all the world’s leading banks, the IRS, and also the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>And that, of course, led to the GAIN paper where I quickly raised my hand to help out and Mark my colleague here and the other co-editors. I then still co-chair the proof-of-concept along with Mark and authored the follow up paper, which will be out by the time this podcast airs, I think.</p>
<p>Mark and I then wrote the paper you just referenced, which is addressing how government identity systems can sustain and promote human rights. All of those papers can be found on the OpenID website, by the way, openid.net.</p>
<p>Since we last talked, I co-founded my company IDPartner, which is really in the spirit of GAIN and is seeking to help banks and other parties connect into such a global network. So yeah, I’m still relatively new to this industry of being a few years in now, but it’s pretty much consumed the majority of my waking moments for the last three to four years.</p>
<p>Mark: So, we’re in some ways similar to Elizabeth, but in other ways slightly different. My background is also from financial services. I have had a number of operational roles and then design and architecture roles in primarily UK banks. I’ve had a rich array of roles. I’m taking on some really interesting challenges along the way. It started out with operational I.T., moved into networks and security design and after some time and lots of rich experiences.</p>
<p>I ended up in the Identity and Access Management team at a large UK bank having done a bunch of work on future architectures for that organisation and innovation team. And around that time the UK was starting to move towards open banking. I managed to switch over to become a core member of the Open Banking UK implementation Entity Security Team, where I was involved in designing various aspects of the open banking architecture and the protocols involved. And that led me to interact with a bunch of people from the OpenID Foundation, who recruited me to come and help on the open standards side of things more actively, after I moved on from open banking to do other things.</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve been working on new draft specifications, and writing a number of white papers, including the GAIN white paper and the one that Elizabeth and I have been working on together about human rights in the context of government digital identity. And here we are today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Thanks both of you for sharing your story. Before starting to hear the newer things that happened for GAIN, I hope you can give us an overview. So, what is the Global Assure Identity Network?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Well, so back in 2021 when we last spoke, GAIN was just a paper. It was – we used to say it was no logos and pro-bono. It was 156 individuals, identity and industry experts who signed as individuals because it contained so much that they could all agree on. And primarily that was that we wanted to build a globally interoperable network for high assurance identity.</p>
<p>We wanted to connect the islands of trust that exist out there today, the different ecosystems where you can be trusted. And we want to create new ones and connect those too. We want to make it possible for somebody in the US, like me to transact with somebody in Finland confident that you could trust who it was on the other end of that digital session.</p>
<p>And we wanted to do that in a really – privacy preserving way. So, no new databases being introduced of PII, full customer consent for sharing and really the minimal amount of information required. All of that was the stuff that the original authors could agree on. At the time we wrote it addressing financial institutions. We didn’t think any such network were going to be inclusively or exclusively led by banks.</p>
<p>But we did argue the banks were really well-placed to catalyse such a movement as they had done in Sweden, Norway and other places. And also, open banking was a growing enabler and there were lots of benefits to them, their customers and others. If they took a lead and did so with a sense of urgency. What we have seen in the intervening years though, is that while that’s still true and still would be a great catalyst, but other corners of the market are moving very, very quickly. We’re having broader conversations now in relation to GAIN, including with the European Union and those designing mobile driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>It’s all interconnected with standards development and has a really big impact on how identity systems will work, interoperable, in years to come. Sorry, that was a summary and a movement into the present day.</p>
<p>Mark: There was a couple of things I would raise from the original paper, that holds true today as well, I think. And those are that we felt back in 2021 that there wasn’t a need for any particularly new or ground-breaking technology to enable this. And probably the most critical thing to allow such a scheme or system to emerge was a way for the three key classes of entity involved, all to find benefits from the services provided.</p>
<p>So, the identity provider, the relying party and the end user, who is subject to all of us, all needed to have their own benefits arising from this for such a thing to become viable. And I think that was something that really hadn’t been voiced quite so directly before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, well, no surprise of course. From a paper to the implementation for a proof-of-concept that nowadays you, and some of your allies, are working on. So, I think it’s time to hear more deeply, what are the main updates in advancement that GAIN has had since then?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Okay, so after we launched the paper, we had five organisations initially, who had signed a MOU, a memorandum of understanding. It was legally not binding, but it meant that they would loosely collaborate and align efforts to further the GAIN vision of interoperability. So, I share those organisations now and you can go learn more about what they’re doing in the space. So that’s the OpenID Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the Cloud Signature Consortium, the Institute for International Finance. And since then, we’ve had one more organisation formally sign up, and that’s the Secure Identity Alliance.</p>
<p>Each of those organisations does work that’s relevant to GAIN and feeds, whether it’s standards or requirements maybe from the financial sector. They feed into the work that is done at the moment through two major communities that we should drill into what both of these communities have been doing. So, we have the technical proof-of-concept of the OpenID Foundation, which is where Mark and I co-chair a community group, and we really have built a prototype that interconnects multiple trust networks.</p>
<p>And then there’s the policy work at the Open Identity Exchange, OIX. It’s called the Global Interoperability Working Group, and they’re really looking at more of a semantic interoperability; how two different policies interact, how do the policies in one trust framework translate into another and what enables that. Mark, do you want to give an update on the technical proof-of-concept that we’ve been running?</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah. So, to GAIN proof-of-concept within the community group in the OpenID Foundation, has been taking a number of steps to dispel any suggestion that this stuff can’t be done with the technology we have today. One could argue not terribly ground-breaking work because it’s showing that stuff can be done using existing protocols. But at the same time, we’ve been doing it in a way which demonstrates quite significant Cross Domain Examples.</p>
<p>So, our first little proof-of-concept was simply allowing existing identity providers from multiple different countries to provide digital identity data to a relying party. And it was existing trust networks of various different types. It wasn’t terribly complex. In some ways. That’s kind of the beauty of it. A relatively simple OpenID Connect implementation with a relatively simple layering of eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group specs as well on top, to allow us to be explicit about the assurance level for the individual.</p>
<p>We’ve then moved on from that Federation example to addressing the question of trust between the entities involved. So, allowing the identity provider and the relying party to be more confident in each other, that they are dealing with an entity that is another member of the network. And the big realisation we had when we were doing that was that we shouldn’t try and have every party register to a GAIN instance. There’s plenty of identity networks out there already and we shouldn’t expect their members to have to reregister for something else. That’s not a terribly scalable way at a global level. So, our decision at that point was to build an instance of a network of networks so that we could keep the implementation impact as low as possible for each member and at the same time enable that global reach.</p>
<p>So, we did some work using a protocol called OpenID Federation to allow communication of trust to some of the technical details like; how to verify cryptographic keys across networks. And we ended up building a really nice little demo whereby the end user arrives in a Japanese airport and is able to present their identity from a German network to the local telephony company, so that they could then pick up a new eSIM as they entered the country. It sounds simple. There were a few challenges along the way, but we managed to overcome them and have a little demo which we could share at some point with any interested party.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So, the two main concepts that we’ve been testing there have been – we often break it down as the data plan in the control plan. So, the first piece that Mark was talking about where we tested the OpenID Connect for identity assurance standard, that’s how does the data move between one party to another. And then the second, which we spent a lot more time on, was the control plane, how do we enable one party in one network to trust another party in another? So how does a relying party in Japan trust an identity provider in Germany? And that’s where OpenID Federation came in, as a really scalable way of delivering that kind of trust.</p>
<p>Mark: Yes, it avoids having to build direct 1 to 1 relationship between every entity, which clearly on an international level, it’s not going to be possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: How many countries have you – mentioned two countries in this example – but how many countries so far have you managed to connect?</p>
<p>Mark: We’ve got members from quite a range of countries, actually. Our initial proof-of-concept involved contributors from UK, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, USA and Japan. I think there may have been more. My memory isn’t the best on these things. And then the second one, again, we had Italy, Japan, UK, Germany, the US. Any others Elizabeth?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Not off the top of my head. But what I think is really cool about the prototype that we have operating right now is that you’ve got three different trust networks, in three different countries, in I guess four different verticals operating. So, we have the German bank based, yes.com Federation. Then you have that connected, both at a data level and a control level, to an open banking system in Japan and the relying party is in telecommunications. And then you have all of that connected, both at a data level and a controlled trust level, all that connected to what is essentially an Italian government implementation. So, we’ve got lots of different types of systems, different types of architecture.</p>
<p>And in that early prototype that we did it with just the data passage, was that we interconnected with wallet-based ecosystems as well there, and we’re looking to bring that back into this larger multilayer proof-of-concept that we have going on right now. So that’s our next stage. But that’s a preview.</p>
<p>I want to make sure we don’t move on before we talk about the work that OIX is doing. Their emphasis has been on mapping different policy frameworks. They looked at how well policies relate to one another and how bilateral agreements can enable one trust framework to trust another, and then ultimately landing on the idea that bilateral agreements are not actually scalable the world over. And so, what they’re looking at now is something that Nick is calling, this as Nick Mothershaw, a ‘smart wallet’. So how can an agent or something –</p>
<p>Mark: Global Interoperability Working Group has been focusing in a couple of areas. One has been to discuss how we might communicate assurance levels between different jurisdictions. One of the challenges we have is that there are different standards for identity assurance in different countries. And as part of that, there’s been a bunch of analysis work going on in partnership with the Fraunhofer Institute to do a comparative review of the different assurance standards and see whether they’re readily mapped or not.</p>
<p>And there will be a report coming out from the Open Identity Exchange in the space sometime in the next few months. Then net-net is that it’s unfortunately not terribly easy to do a mapping and there may be a need to take it to a lower level and map the underlying data points to each other rather than to map to the abstract assurance level.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So, they’re looking at, how can an agent work on behalf of a user to help translate those policies from one framework to another. To how can an agent or a wallet understand what credentials are inside it that meet the needs presented by a verifier? And does a new credential need to actually be issued? They’re looking at how can we know what wallets can be trusted in an ecosystem? How can it dynamically understand what policy requirements need to be met, what credentials qualify? Is there a common format that can be agreed upon for these policy decisions? And all this is underway at OIX.</p>
<p>Mark: In terms of analysis there as well. They’re looking at the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, the European digital identity eIDAS assurance levels, the US NIST standards in the space and at the trust framework that exists in Canada and Sweden are on the list as well. Although I don’t think all of the analysis is in. So, a fairly broad reaching comparative review of assurance levels and the new policy framework around them.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds definitely, definitely really good. I haven’t heard of this. I want to hear more information about this.</p>
<p>Mark: The best way to find out more about this analysis would be to join an OpenID Exchange and come and attend something that, some of the working group calls that happen. The report I don’t know whether it’s going to be publicly available or a ‘members of’ report at this stage. There might be a summary report available for non-members. So that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. If you see as a retrospective have there been any main challenges or barriers that you had to overcome in this nearly two years?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I would say one of the biggest challenges is really an exciting one, is how quickly the market moves. When you’re talking about global interoperability, you’re talking any kind of shift around the world has an impact on the interoperability aspect. So, I think we do a really good job as a group, both at the technical proof-of-concept level of the Open Identity Exchange and as the GAIN six non-profit, we do a really good job keeping connected to a lot of those moving pieces around the world.</p>
<p>Proud to say that we have close relationships both inside Europe and the European Union, those leading mobile driver’s license efforts, or I should say, North American mobile driver’s license efforts. You know, sometimes this stuff means that actually new concepts, new standards are embraced. And we need to make sure that our prototypes move and shift to ensure that we’re still keeping up to date with the standards that are being embraced and matured by regulations and others around the world.</p>
<p>This is a really exciting problem to have to see things develop and mature. I guess the connected challenge to that is just making sure that we’re aware of all of that’s going on. We recently got in touch with a group working out of the UN on a similar challenge of; how do you enable one entity to build trust with an entity in a different trust network. And they’re really, you know, we’re all working on similar things and exploring. Once we know; what have been your lessons learned, what have been ours and cross-pollinated ideas about how we can achieve these things together and maybe work together. So yeah, a big challenge is knowing what is going on everywhere.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, I completely agree Elizabeth Yeah, I completely agree Elizabeth. A couple of other names to drop as well, I know that the OpenID Foundation has been working quite hard to establish and develop relationships in various parts of the world. And I would say the engagement with the European digital identity project has been really good. We had some nice sessions in Berlin around the European identity conference earlier this year. The engagement with the NIST guys in the US around what they’re doing, and their update to their digital identity guidelines has been really positive.</p>
<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation has also been reaching out quite successfully into a project called ID for Africa, and trying to bridge that global north, the global south part of the problem space. And I would also say that interoperability, I think, is probably one of the biggest challenges that spans across technology, data and policy. And it’s really good to see the OECD call that out explicitly in their drafts digital identity guidelines that are open for review at the moment and coming out, I think later this year, now.</p>
<p>There’s an awful lot happening in this space. It’s really dynamic. And echoing Elizabeth’s point, the biggest challenge is keeping up with all of the activity that’s going on.</p>
<p>One thing I would say that we’ve been doing in our GAIN groups, has been to try and make sure that we’re relevant to all sorts of different technical architectures. So, this is something that can interoperate across technology difference, at least. Ultimately, the technology should be there to serve the people of various sorts, you know, people who represent organisations and the people who are trying to access services. So, a particular protocol should not necessarily the boundary for interoperability.</p>
<p>To that end, although our first couple of proof of concepts have been OpenID Connect focused. The one we’re working on now is to extend that proof-of-concepts to delve more into the W3C quality-based architecture. We’re doing that in part with people involved in the European digital identity wallet, as well. So, there’s a lot going on. And I think, a lot of real dynamism and action in the marketplace at the moment as well.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: And the more we do in this proof-of-concept is – the more that we do to really test the specifications of these standards, the more we learn, and the more those standards mature. So really benefits from having a lot of participation. Because the both the Federation spec and the IDA spec, I think have been improved as a result of people trying to build it coming together trying to align it, make sure that both parties understand the same things that are using the same configurations. It just, it makes all the specifications better and more mature.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, excellent. You mentioned already a few examples, but if you have any other success stories in particular that you would like to tell us more.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I think our big success story is the one that we raised connecting the German banking network, a Japanese banking network with coms roaming and Federation’s run by the Italian government, both at the data level and the trust level. Can I trust the relying party and an IDP in two different networks? The big proof of GAIN, there’s always going to come when private companies or other entities actually bring it out there into the public domain, and people are actively using it to create their eSIM in another country. And I think that’s the next big hurdle is to see something out there in the wild. And I’m hopeful that you’re going to hear some more about that in the coming year.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, likewise. I mean, ultimately what we’re driving towards is something that gets implemented. But I do think that the debates that the white paper originally provoked and the groups that have been acting, following on from that have surfaced a few difficulties along the way. And these were difficulties that needed to be surfaced in order that a solution could be built.</p>
<p>I’m not yet certain that all of the challenges have been addressed fully. In fact, I’m fairly certain they haven’t all been addressed fully yet. But we’re working through them as they emerge and prioritising our efforts as best the way we can. I would say a lot of this work is being done either by companies who are contributing their staff’s time to working groups or even individuals contributing their time to these working groups.</p>
<p>So, you know, if anybody out there thinks that they may have the ability to devote some time or even some implementation efforts, that would be, I think, a valuable thing to do, either whether that’s in the policy domain or the data domain with the Open Identity Exchange or in the technical protocol domain with the OpenID Foundation. The only way these things are moved forward is by people contributing the time.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, they need more contributors, absolutely.</p>
<p>Mark: Just to drive one particular point home. In particular, at the moment, the OpenID Foundation, GAIN POC community group is looking for digital wallet implementers, particularly at the moment, and secondarily, issuers of digital identity credentials as well verifiable credentials. So, if anybody listening to the podcast is willing, able and has some expertise in that area, they would be very, very welcome. Indeed.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Yeah, based on your observations when I asked you the hurdles, or what you find on your way – you find a lot of things moving on projects that have similar goals, let’s say. But now looking at the future, what is coming in the near future, if you focus on the near future. So, what would be the main potential future developments that you think is going to happen in the next, let’s say, one or two years?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I would say three things.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials, as Mark was just saying, we need to be interoperating, with wallet-based ecosystems. And our technical proof-of-concept in the short term, in the next few months, needs to be extended to incorporate those issuers and those wallet providers.</p>
<p>I think the OIX work on smart interoperability that takes us beyond the next few months, but into you know, the next year or so I think that that work will take shape a bit more. And we will hear more about how interoperability can be enabled, semantically through such systems. I think that work is really, really exciting.</p>
<p>And then the next thing I think you’re going to start to see is more commercial implementations of this use case, of cross border, high trust identity.</p>
<p>Mark: Clearly, the European digital identity project is going to march forward dramatically over the next couple of years as well. And I think that will produce a number of successes and identify a number of challenges along the journey as well. At the moment, the topic of international interoperability is a really interesting one to me. And I think the European Union has certainly within its power, the ability to solve that between the member states. But I think there will be challenges to do with interoperability to other nations.</p>
<p>I also think that there will be quite an interesting series of events around who wins in terms of wallet provider. Clearly, the big tech have wallets already embedded into a lot of consumer devices. But it’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out. Particularly in the context of the European Union project, as they have quite a different perspective on how a wallet should be governed more than anything else. So that’s going to be a really interesting thing to watch over the next couple of years, and I’m sure will produce some great and informative outcomes. It’s an extremely interesting experiment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s sounds great.</p>
<p>Mark: And I think some of the members of our groups are active in that space as well. And indeed, the OpenID Foundation has been contributing quite strongly to that project with a couple of the key protocols in and out of the wallet being selected for the first round of proof-of-concept work in the European digital identity programme. And there’s definitely conversations going on around trust of issuers and wallets. In the context of the OpenID Federation spec as well. I know that some of the Italian contingent are quite keen to promote the use of that protocol in the European digital identity wallet space for organisation-to-organisation trust effectively.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So final question for both of you. So, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Mark: I’m going to say that they should be considering how they integrate reusable digital identity into their business processes at some point in the future. A lot of what has been done before has been very organisationally with focussed and very transactional. So, us poor end users have to go through identity verification processes quite frequently. And I think going forward it would be better for end users and better for organisations to be able to reuse those assured identities.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I totally agree. So, I’ll take a different angle on the question. I would address, rather than business leaders, namely standards bodies, regulators and yes, potential ID providers, including government providers, even banks. There’s a lot going on in this industry as we’ve talked about so many exciting movements forward. So many standards reaching points of maturity. And we’re really, really excited by the developments that we’ve seen over the last few years. As we put in our paper that we’ve written for government officials, no single solution or standard or architecture is going to be a panacea.</p>
<p>No one thing is going to solve all the world’s problems. So, we would all really benefit from, if not slowing down, then at least taking the time to speak to each other. Make sure that we understand how we’re going to establish multi-party trust, checks and balances in the systems, mitigate the risks of fraud while protecting privacy. I would love to see more, even more open, transparent communications, public private partnerships forming in this space. So that’s what I’d put on your agenda.</p>
<p>Oscar: Both sounds very good. Well, I’m very happy to have had this conversation with you and hear this very good news, the progress that GAIN and all the partners have had. So, congratulations and well done for you, Elizabeth, Mark and everybody has been involved and is involved.</p>
<p>So, a final piece, just let us know how people can find more information about this project or get in touch with any of you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah. So, I think the fastest way is probably – there is the OIX Global Interoperability Working Group. The fastest way might be the <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a>, there’s a GAIN, community group there. Either way that will get you to where you need to be. You can also obviously reach out to Mark and myself. We are available on LinkedIn. So yeah, please get in touch.</p>
<p>Mark: Let me just reiterate then <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a> and there’s a search box there. Please put in GAIN. You’ll find a number of items there that may be informative.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, it was a pleasure talking with both of you, Elizabeth and Mark and all the best.</p>
<p>Mark: Thanks Oscar.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Thank you.</p>

			 Can’t Beat Tokeny’s Team Retreat 
<p>Happy July from the entire Tokeny team! We hope you are enjoying your summer or winter wherever you are in the world.</p>
<p>Can you believe we are already past the halfway point of the year?! Time flies when you are having fun and we at Tokeny know a thing or two about having fun… well if you call the growth and success of our team fun then yes, a ton of fun over here.</p>
<p>We know how much you love discussing tokenization topics each month, but we figured it’s equally as important for our readers to get to know us a bit more on a personal level.</p>
<p>Just as blockchain thrives on a decentralized network, we believe that our team’s dispersed nature isn’t a hindrance but a strength that enables us to tap into global talent and diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>In fact, the Tokeny team covers 20 nationalities, which allows us to ideate and analyze from a myriad of perspectives on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Indeed, while a decentralized workforce offers various benefits, it can sometimes inhibit the natural human connection that typically thrives in in-person settings. Recognizing this, we decided to arrange a gathering for all our team members over the past two years.</p>
<p>Specifically, we gathered in Sitges, a charming beach town near Barcelona, known for its beautiful beaches, stunning sights, and lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>You could feel the positive, anticipatory energy in the air on the first day as everyone arrived, for the veterans to reconnect and for the newcomers who haven’t met everyone in person yet, the stage was set for an incredible trip.</p>
<p>For the next 3 days, we came together for an incredible journey that was all about rejoicing, rejuvenation, and reigniting our team spirit.</p>
<p>We all joined together for team dinners, water competitions, and of course, we made some time to be productive and get work done face-to-face, which was nice for a change.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Final Thoughts 
<p>The excitement we had in seeing each other was truly remarkable. As our company grows in stature, so do we grow in numbers. We could all feel the communal sense that we know our company and products are very unique, and as we continue to push forward, we will achieve our goals and overcome any obstacles in our way.</p>
<p>Spending a short, yet packed three days with the Tokeny family was a real pleasure. The bonds and camaraderie among us have grown significantly, and this will surely reflect in the work we produce.</p>
<p>Also, a special thank you to Ivie Satijn, Denisa Kutschera and Radka Tocikova for their incredible work in preparing this event, it’s never easy to plan an event for dozens of people from all over the world. Finally, thank you to our customers and partners for the trust you put in our team.</p>
<p>See you next month where we will be back to our regularly scheduled programming!</p>

<p>It's no secret that more organizations around the world are undergoing some form of digital transformation.

<p>No matter the size and scope of your organization, a digital transformation doesn’t happen overnight. It could be the case you are apprehensive about deploying a brand-new IAM solution while in the midst of a digital transformation or cloud migration. Or, perhaps you still rely on on-premise systems and need to find a flexible IAM deployment option to account for your legacy network.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
With the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/solutions.html">PingOne Cloud platform</a>, you can take advantage of flexible IAM deployment options that work in any environment, including on-prem, cloud-native, cloud-based, and hybrid.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we explore the practical implementation of utilizing Terraform on IBM Cloud to create and manage secrets by seamlessly integrating your <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a> with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/secrets-manager">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a>.</p>



<p>Previously, this functionality to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets">manage TLS and non-TLS certificates and secrets</a> was primarily accessed through the CLI using the namespace <code>ibmcloud ks ingress secret</code>. This API enables users to create an “Ingress secret” resource by passing Secrets Manager secret CRNs to the API to establish a managed corresponding secret in their Kubernetes cluster. Notably, any updates made to the secrets within the Secrets Manager instance are automatically reflected within the associated Kubernetes cluster, ensuring synchronization between the two environments.</p>



 Architecture and behavior 



<p>The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service reconciles the created Ingress secrets in the following way:</p>







 
 The user has an existing <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> instance and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a> instance. 



 The user registers the Secrets Manager instance to ensure its secret CRNs will be synchronized between the Secrets Manager secret and corresponding Ingress secret(s). 



 The user then creates an IBM Cloud Kubernetes <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets">Ingress secret</a> that can either be an Opaque or TLS secret with a Secrets Manager CRN (ID). This creates a backing resource in the cloud that correlates the secret CRN to the ClusterID/SecretName/SecretNamespace. 



 IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service fetches the Secrets Manager secret via the CRN. 



 IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service creates a Kubernetes secret in the cluster with the values of the CRN(s). 



 IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service ensures that the secrets values stay in sync with the corresponding Secrets Manager secret CRN. 
 



 Benefits 



<p>By utilizing the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr">integration</a> with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and IBM Cloud Secrets Manager, you can leverage the following benefits:</p>



 
 Seamlessly create and manage Secrets Manager secrets with built-in autorotation for enhanced security. 



 Effortlessly provision Kubernetes secrets using the secret CRN of any Secrets Manager instance you own, ensuring consistent and reliable secret management. 



 Automatically synchronize and persist your secrets within your Kubernetes cluster on a regular basis, eliminating the need for manual updates and reducing the risk of outdated secrets. 



 Easily track and monitor the expiration dates of your secrets directly from the IBM Cloud console, ensuring timely rotation and preventing potential security vulnerabilities. 



 Maintain control over access to your secrets by creating secret groups, allowing you to grant permissions only to approved users and enhancing the overall security of your applications. 
 



 Hands-on example 



<p>The below example shows an integration of IBM Cloud Kubernetes and IBM Cloud Secrets Manager via a Terraform script. To follow along in the full sample, go to this <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/tree/master/ingress-secrets-manager">example</a>. You will provision an <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> instance, register it to an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, and create managed <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Ingress secrets</a> backed by Secrets Manager secrets.</p>



 Prerequisites 



<p>To follow this example, you will require the following:</p>



 
 An <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/registration">IBM Cloud account</a> 



 A generated <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey">IBM Cloud IAM API Key</a> 



 Follow along in this full <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/tree/master/ingress-secrets-manager">sample</a> 
 



 Walking through the Terraform script 



 1. Create an IBM Cloud Secrets Manager instance 



<p>Create an IBM Cloud Secrets Manager instance and secret group to host your secrets. Learn more about <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance">Creating a Secrets Manager service instance</a>:</p>



 <code>resource "ibm_resource_instance" "sm_instance" {
  name     = var.sm_instance_name
  service  = "secrets-manager"
  plan     = var.sm_instance_plan
  location = var.sm_instance_region
  timeouts {
    create = "60m"
    delete = "2h"
  }

}

resource "ibm_sm_secret_group" "sm_secret_group" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.location
  name          = var.sm_secret_group_name
  description   = var.sm_secret_group_description
}</code> 



 2. Set up service-to-service authorization through IAM 



<p>See more about what configurations are needed to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr#secrets-mgr_setup_s2s">enable service-to-service communication</a>:</p>



 <code>resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "sm_auth" {
  source_service_name = "containers-kubernetes"
  target_service_name = "secrets-manager"
  roles               = ["Manager"]
}</code> 



 3. Register the Secrets Manager instance to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster 



<p>When you <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr#secrets-mgr_setup_register">register a Secrets Manager instance to your cluster</a> as the default, all new Ingress subdomain certificates are stored in that instance:</p>



 <code>resource "ibm_container_ingress_instance" "instance" {
  cluster         = var.cluster_name_or_id
  secret_group_id = ibm_sm_secret_group.sm_secret_group.secret_group_id
  instance_crn    = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.id
  is_default      = true
}</code> 



 4. Create secrets in Secrets Manager and enable automatic rotation 



<p>Create an arbitrary and username credential secret in Secrets Manager. Learn more about different <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret">secret types</a>:</p>



 <code>resource "ibm_sm_arbitrary_secret" "sm_arbitrary_secret" {
  instance_id      = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region           = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.location
  endpoint_type    = var.sm_endpoint_type
  name 		    = var.sm_arbitrary_secret_name
  description      = var.sm_arbitrary_secret_description
  expiration_date  = var.sm_arbitrary_secret_expiration_date
  labels           = var.sm_arbitrary_secret_labels
  secret_group_id  = ibm_sm_secret_group.sm_secret_group.secret_group_id
  payload          = var.sm_arbitrary_secret_payload
}

resource "ibm_sm_username_password_secret" "sm_username_password_secret" {
  instance_id      = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region           = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.location
  endpoint_type    = var.sm_endpoint_type
  name 		    = var.sm_username_password_secret_name
  description      = var.sm_username_password_secret_description
  expiration_date  = var.sm_username_password_secret_expiration_date
  labels           = var.sm_username_password_secret_labels
  secret_group_id  = ibm_sm_secret_group.sm_secret_group.secret_group_id
  rotation {
    auto_rotate    = true
    interval       = 1
    unit           = "day"
  }

  username         = var.sm_username_password_secret_username
  password         = var.sm_username_password_secret_password
}</code> 



 5. In the cluster, create a persistent Opaque secret that is backed by the CRN of the secrets in Secrets Manager 



<p>Create an <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets">Ingress Opaque secret</a> in the cluster. Now, anytime the secrets in Secrets Manager are updated, the corresponding Kubernetes Opaque secret will be updated once a day. The persistence field ensures that if a user inadvertently deletes the secret from the cluster, it will be recreated:</p>



 <code>resource "ibm_container_ingress_secret_opaque" "secret_opaque" {
    cluster          = var.cluster_name_or_id
    secret_name      = var.opaque_secret_name
    secret_namespace = var.opaque_secret_namespace
    persistence      = true
    fields {
        crn          = ibm_sm_arbitrary_secret.sm_arbitrary_secret.crn
    }
    fields {
        crn          = ibm_sm_username_password_secret.sm_username_password_secret.crn
    }
}</code> 



 Creating the infrastructure 



<p>Now that you’ve gone through what each block of the Terraform script will be doing, let’s create the infrastructure.</p>



 
 Run <code>terraform init</code> in your directory. 



 Copy the <code>main.tf</code> and <code>output.tf</code> files from the example repo. 



 Create a <code>.tfvars</code> file and fill in the corresponding variables needed. You can learn more about what variables are needed in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/ingress-secrets-manager/variables.tf">variables.tf file</a>. 



 Run <code>terraform plan -var-file=&lt;file_name&gt;</code>. 



 Create the resources with <code>terraform apply -var-file=&lt;file_name&gt;</code>. 
 



 Verifying created resources 



<p>Now that these resources are created, go into the IBM Cloud Dashboard to view the created resources under <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/resources">Resource list</a>:</p>



<p>Navigate to the created IBM Cloud Secrets Manager instance and view the created secrets:</p>







<p>Navigate to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, click on Ingress, then select the Secrets tab to view the Opaque secret:</p>

<p>There's a new way to organize and store files online and in distributed systems. Here, we dive into what content addressing is, how it works, and some of its benefits and challenges.</p> What is Content Addressing? <p>Location-based addressing, what we're all used to, uses soft links (URLs) to point to where the file is located. </p><p>Content addressing, on the other hand, uses cryptographic hashing to generate a unique identifier (CID) from the data that describe itself. The CID acts as a hard link that points to a specific version of a file. </p><p>Say your friend recommends a book to you. They tell you the book is in the local library in the third row on the right, fifth bookcase, second shelf, third book from the left. So you follow their directions, hoping to find the book. The book might be there, or another book might have replaced it. On the other hand, if your friend gave you the ISBN, you could use that to find the correct book. The first example is how location addressing works today, and the second is how content addressing works. </p> How Content Addressing Works <p>Let's dive a bit deeper. </p><p>The first step is to generate a content identifier. As previously mentioned, CIDs are hashes. To generate a hash for a piece of data, we use a hash function. </p><p>Hash functions take an input (for example, a file in binary format) and produce a fixed-size string of characters, typically a sequence of numbers and letters. The output is called the "hash value" or "hash code.</p><p>Next, we want to associate the content identifier with the content. This involves choosing a storage medium and linking the content identifier to the stored content. If we choose to store a file on IPFS, for example, there are four steps: </p>  Chunking: IPFS breaks down the file into smaller fixed-size chunks.  Content Addressing: IPFS calculates the cryptographic hash of each chunk using a secure hash function. This hash value uniquely represents the content of that specific chunk.  MerkleDag: IPFS constructs a MerkleDag that organizes the chunks and their relationships. Each chunk is represented as a node in the graph, and the edges between nodes represent the relationships between chunks.  Root CID: The root of the MerkleDag is computed by hashing the hash values of its children and generating a unique hash value. This hash value is the final Content Identifier (CID) for the file.  <p>The final step is retrieving content using the content identifier. This is a 2-step process: 1. Locating the content based on the content identifier 2. Verifying content integrity using the identifier.</p><p>To continue with the IPFS example, you can either connect to IPFS using the CLI or use the Brave browser's IPFS gateway and enter the CID. This will fetch your file. If you want to verify that this particular version of the file is the one you're looking for, you can compare its hash or recalculate it. If they match, it's the same data. IPFS's MerkleDag structure means you can also traverse that to trace back your file. </p><p>CIDs are immutable hard links, so if even one byte of data is altered, a new CID will be generated during the hashing process. This helps ensure content authenticity in a decentralized and trustless environment.</p> Benefits of Content Addressing <p>There are several benefits to using content addressing. As previously mentioned, data cannot be tampered with without it being immediately obvious since any change to a file will generate a new hash for that file. </p><p>This also opens the door to immutable data storage because when we use content-addressed links, we create persistent data structures. This is especially necessary for archives, blockchains, and version control systems. &nbsp;</p><p>Data deduplication is another advantage. With the location-addressed Internet we have today, the same file can be stored an unlimited amount of times because there is nothing to tell the storage system it's redundant. It just creates a new variation of the file name and moves on (EX: File.jpg, File(1).jpg, File(2).jpg, etc.). But with content addressing, if Jack stores a picture of a volcano on IPFS and Jill stores the same file, they will each have the same hash. That file is only stored once. This reduces storage costs by eliminating duplicate content and also improves data retrieval speed in distributed systems.</p><p>There are numerous other benefits, including secure sharing with encrypted hashes, efficient distribution, and more. </p> Challenges of Content Addressing <p>While content addressing makes the links to files immutable, it does not persist the data on the distributed network. If the file is no longer available (deleted or garbage collected), it won't be retrievable using the CID. Therefore, to ensure a file remains accessible, it's important to save it to your own node or pin it using a storage service.</p><p>Discoverability is another challenge. Since CIDs are hashes, they're difficult to remember. Users can link their CIDs to a human-readable name using DNS Link, but it's an extra step.</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, content addressing is helping to fix some of the problems that have formed due to traditional location-based addressing, such as duplicate or unreliable files. It also forms the basis of persistent data structures, enabling immutable storage solutions and version control within file systems (like <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">Fission's WNFS</a>!). </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about content addressing, Protocol Labs' <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing">ProtoSchool tutorial</a> is clear and easy to understand and acts as a jumping-off point for more detailed technical topics.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer networks are the foundation of the decentralized web. Today we dive into what P2P networks are, how they differ from the popular client-server model, and the advantages of decentralized file sharing in P2P networks.</p> The Client-Server Model <p>Today the predominant type of distributed application architecture is the client-server model. In this model, the client is the service requestor, and the server is the provider of the resource or service. The client usually doesn't provide any resources to the network. Some well-known examples of the client-server model are network printing, email, and the World Wide Web.</p> What is a Peer-to-Peer Network? <p>A peer-to-peer network, on the other hand, is a distributed application architecture where each participant (peer) acts as a node. All nodes are equal, and all contribute some processing power, bandwidth, or disk space to the network. A node can make requests as well as provide a resource or service. A well-known example of a peer-to-peer network is Napster, a digital audio file-sharing system. </p> Decentralized File Sharing <p>If there is no central intermediary receiving requests and returning resources, how does peer-to-peer file sharing work? In a client-server model, servers host files, and clients download the files from those central servers. In a P2P system, peers request and share files directly. This is commonly done through a DHT or Distributed Hash Table. Information like file names, hashes, and locations are all stored in the DHT. The hashes represent keys and act as unique identifiers that help identify a specific piece of data within the DHT. </p><p>When users want to share a file, they break it down into smaller blocks and distribute those blocks across nodes in the network. Then, when users want to download the file, they query the network with the help of the DHT to find the nodes that have stored these blocks. When they find the nodes, they connect to them directly and download the file. </p> Advantages of Peer-to-Peer Networks <p>The decentralized DHT structure makes P2P networks more scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant. </p><p>Scalable: As the number of network participants and requests increases, so does the ability to handle those requests. </p><p>Secure: The network is less susceptible to malicious attacks because there is no central server hosting the data. </p><p>Fault-Tolerant: Multiple copies of data spread across many nodes in the network means that even if a few nodes go down, there will be others to take on the responsibilities of those fallen nodes and maintain data availability.</p> Peer-to-Peer Networks Today <p>Today, P2P networks are gaining in popularity.</p><p>IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer network and hypermedia protocol. When a file is stored on the network, it's split into smaller chunks, hashed, and given a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/content-addressing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">CID or content identifier</a>. When users request that file, they use the CID to locate it. Users can store graphics, audio, video, plain text, and hyperlinks on IPFS.</p><p>Blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, are also P2P networks. They use a distributed ledger to track transactions in a network without a central authority. The blockchain is tamper-proof and immutable, with many use cases - from storing ownership records to distributing cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>In conclusion, peer-to-peer networks are a resilient and decentralized way to share and distribute files, collaborate with other users, and distribute compute power and resources. </p><p>Interested in learning more about the decentralized web?

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 5th July to 17th&nbsp;July <p>Welcome to Veriscope, our biweekly global crypto regulatory update, providing you with the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency regulation. In this edition, we are zeroing in on key regulatory updates that are shaping the global crypto landscape.</p><p>From the US, where a renewed push for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is on the cards, to South Korea, where virtual asset legislation is evolving. South Africa is also making headlines by requiring crypto exchanges to be licensed, while Singapore’s Monetary Authority aims to enforce stricter rules for Digital Payment Tokens (DPT) providers.</p><p>So, let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Reforms Gain Momentum Amid Market Volatility <p>World Overview&nbsp;🌍</p><p>USA: Crypto regulation takes center stage as US lawmakers Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand gear up to reintroduce the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. Originally brought forward during a crypto market crash in 2022, the act aims to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>South Korea: Meanwhile, South Korea strengthens its grip on virtual asset legislation with the initiation of its second phase. The Financial Services Commission plans to delve into issues related to crypto asset issuance and distribution, building on the foundation of user protection laid by the recently passed “Virtual Asset Protection Act.”</p><p>South Africa: Down south, the South African Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) requires all crypto exchanges to obtain licenses by the end of the year. This mandate marks a significant move in tightening the regulatory reigns within the crypto industry in Africa, with punitive measures planned for non-compliant entities.</p><p>Singapore: On a similar note, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working on firming up rules for providers handling Digital Payment Tokens (DPT). By the end of the year, MAS plans to ensure customer assets are securely held under statutory trust and intends to curb digital currency lending and staking activities.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into two of these significant developments and analyze their impact on the broader ecosystem.</p> Reviving a Regulatory Initiative: A Significant Shift or Innovation Stifle for the US&nbsp;Market? <p>A renewed push for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act has been initiated by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. The aim? To offer a clear regulatory roadmap for digital assets, casting a bipartisan light on a topic that has often been cloaked in uncertainty.</p><p>First introduced in 2022 amid a crypto market downturn, the Act’s resurrection is set against a backdrop of renewed demand for clarity and&nbsp;control.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1680321593178832898?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>One of the main features is the proposed alterations to the US tax code, which would empower the industry to fund its own oversight. In practical terms, this means that the costs associated with regulation, audit, and security would be borne by the digital asset&nbsp;firms.</p><p>As part of its comprehensive approach, the proposed regulation also includes measures to preclude events like the FTX crisis, putting consumer protection at the forefront to address existing apprehensions regarding digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The draft calls for the regulation of stablecoins, a direct response to the TerraUSD (UST) crash that sent ripples through the crypto industry. It also proposes that only depository institutions issue stablecoins, which, while providing an extra layer of security, could potentially stifle innovation.</p><p>It also demands that crypto exchanges must register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p> Potential Implications <p>On the bright side, the clarity provided by the Act could potentially attract mainstream and institutional investors, fostering trust in regulated exchanges. Also, the proposed customer protection measures that the Act proposes could minimize fraud and market manipulation, thereby creating a safer investment climate.</p><p>Despite several upsides, there are more than a few downsides as well. For instance, over-regulation could suppress innovation, given that the decentralized nature of crypto is its lifeline. Moreover, permitting only depository institutions to issue stablecoins could result in power concentration, straying from crypto’s core principle of decentralization.</p><p>In essence, the reintroduction of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a signal of crypto’s growing legitimacy. As the Act undergoes legislative scrutiny, the crypto industry watches in anticipation.</p><p>The balance between innovation and regulation is a delicate one. The outcome will have significant implications for the future trajectory of the crypto industry.</p> South Africa Rush for Licenses: Crypto Exchanges Dodging the FSCA Crack&nbsp;Down <p>South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has drawn the line: crypto exchanges must obtain a license by the end of the year or face penalties.</p><p>This clear mandate by Commissioner Unathi Kamlana is backed by approximately 20 applications already on the table and the anticipation of more as the November 30 deadline approaches.</p><p>As observed in many other countries, the reasoning behind this decisive step is to shield consumers from potential financial risks inherent in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>And no matter the size of operations, all exchanges serving South Africans will have to comply. While the directive is stern, Commissioner Kamlana assures a period of time will be dedicated to examining the outcome of these measures.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">Crypto Regulations in the United Kingdom: A Comprehensive Analysis</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1679929054286454784">How Shyft Veriscope Solves Travel Compliance Woes?</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>With Microsoft Entra ID Governance, you can effectively manage your organization’s security and identity governance needs and boost employee productivity by implementing appropriate processes and enhancing visibility. The Microsoft Entra platform empowers you with the ability to guarantee that the right people have the right access to the right resources.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce the general availability of a set of capabilities in Entitlement Management available through Microsoft Entra ID Governance to help you strengthen your identity governance posture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Extending the access lifecycle with your organization-specific processes and business logic&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/run-custom-workflows-in-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466938">announced the public preview of entitlement management custom extensions</a>, allowing you to extend the access lifecycle with your organization-specific processes and business logic when access is requested or about to expire. With it you can create tickets for manual access provisioning in disconnected systems, send custom notifications to additional stakeholders, or automate additional access-related configuration in your business applications such as assigning the correct sales region in Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/whats-new">refreshed the public preview</a> to enable introducing external governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) checks into the entitlement management processes. This preview refreshed enabled you to configure that an extension could pause or stop the access request and surface additional information to approvers users in My Access. Today, I’m happy to announce this capability is now generally available.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Automate additional compliance checks as part of the access request with custom extensions&nbsp;</p>
<p>You allow your resellers to purchase goods through your reseller purchasing portal. Before someone gets access to the portal, your internal sales organization must approve and ensure that a reseller contract is in place. Until now, an approver in the sales department had to validate the contract in the contract database, what has been a manual and time-consuming process can now be automated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom extension creation&nbsp;</p>
<p>You, as an admin, can now make a custom extension available to the sales department which will validate if a reseller contract is in place. During the creation, you can specify that the extension is intended to be used during the access request workflow and that the access request should be paused until a response is received from the corresponding Logic App which will perform the contract validation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><br>Linking the contract validation to the access package of the reseller portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sales department can now extend the policy of the reseller portal access package to perform the contract validation at several stages of the access request process. In this case, the sales department opts for the validation to happen right after the access request is submitted so it’s enriched with the contract status once the request makes it to the sales representative for approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>Approver empowered with contract status information&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, when the sales representative receives an access request for the purchasing portal, the request details will be enriched with the contract information so they can quickly make a decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The external process could have stopped the request completely if needed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about embedding your custom processes into entitlement management, see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-logic-apps-integration">Trigger Logic Apps with custom extensions in entitlement management.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Assigning access automatically to access packages instead of requiring users to request access&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/dynamic-automated-access-with-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466937">announced the public preview of dynamic automated access with entitlement management </a>to automate your processes for access lifecycle management by assigning access to users based on their attributes without the need of access requests or administrative interaction. Today, I’m happy to announce that this capability is now generally available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Automatically assign people to Sales Team access package based on user’s department</p>
<p>You want employees in the Sales department to be automatically assigned to the Sales Team access package which contains sales-related projects’ resources. For that, you add a new auto-assignment policy to the Sales Team access package, that checks if the user is in the internal organization’s Sales department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this policy, you specify a rule for how entitlement management will select the users who need assignments. The rule is based on the attributes of the user, such as department, that typically come from your organization’s HR system, where many people with the same value of the attribute need the same access. As you want employees only (not guests) you create a rule as follows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-package-auto-assignment-policy">Configure an automatic assignment policy for an access package in entitlement management</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Configuring Verified ID checks in entitlement management&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Spring 2023, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/entra-identity-governance-with-entra-verified-id-higher-fidelity/ba-p/2466934">announced the public preview of an integration with the Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a> service. This integration allows you to incorporate Verified ID checks into the access request management workflow, saving you valuable time and effort, and enhancing security by removing human errors and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to your feedback, we’ve expanded the integration to include Logic App support. With this you can ensure that the Verified ID presented by the user corresponds to the same user who is currently logged into their account and submitting the access request. This powerful combination guarantees an additional layer of confidence and accuracy in the verification process, reinforcing the integrity of your access controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I’m happy to announce that these capabilities are now generally available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Require independently verified credentials to automate approvals&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are working with an external design agency on a project for a new customer. You require consultants to complete a Verified Vendor certification before they can be onboarded to new projects. Previously, consultants had to email a notarized copy of their certificate for manual review and approval by someone in your organization to onboard. Now, you can configure access packages with Verified ID requirements, setting a new standard for streamlined onboarding processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a consultant goes to request access to the access package from the My Access portal, they will be able to select from one of two policies. Policy 1 requires approval whereas Policy 2 auto-approves the request if the user presents the required Verified ID. When the consultant selects Policy 2, all they need to do is scan the QR code on the screen. This will allow them to present the credentials from their digital wallet, and since the access package does not require approval, the consultant will receive automatic access after their credentials have been verified by the issuing agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-verified-id-settings">How to configure your access package with a verified ID requirement</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Entitlement Management support in Conditional Access&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entitlement Management service is now targetable in the conditional access policy for inclusion or exclusion of applications. By enabling the inclusion or exclusion of Entitlement Management and/or My Access in conditional access policies, your organization is better set up for self-service onboarding and conditional access policy exception management scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about conditional access see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/">Azure AD Conditional Access documentation</a>. To target the Entitlement Management service, select “Azure AD Identity Governance - Entitlement Management” in the cloud apps picker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. My Access search improvements&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dedicated as we are to expanding Microsoft Entra’s end-to-end capabilities for admins, we’re equally committed to ensuring secure access remains a breeze for your valued end users. As part of our commitment to making the end-user experience as smooth and effortless as possible, we’ve made significant improvements to the My Access search functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable users to find access packages more effectively, we’ve added a Resources column that shows users the resources that are part of the access package. In addition, users can now search for access packages using additional criteria, such as the access package name, description, and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a try 
<p>We’re excited about these new capabilities, and we'd love for you to try them out! Current Microsoft Entra ID Premium customers have two ways to use the new capabilities:&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/governments-and-citizens-want-simple-smooth-and-secure-interactions/">A recent Entrust survey</a> revealed that governments around the world are embracing eGov service enablement and delivery to revolutionize their interactions with citizens, but in varying degrees. Here we will explore why governments need to modernize citizen service delivery, and the benefits they will gain by doing so. And we’ll look at how differences in demographics can illuminate ways that governments can enable simple, seamless, and secure interactions with their citizens.</p>
<p>When governments prioritize enhancing digital infrastructure, policies, and processes, they can streamline operations, save time, reduce errors, and lower costs associated with citizen interactions. The result is increased citizen engagement and improved transparency, which promotes trust. The key to keeping that trust is ensuring that personal information is protected – and there’s room for improvement here.</p>
<p>A recent study by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/americans-views-of-government-decades-of-distrust-enduring-support-for-its-role/">Pew Research Center</a> revealed that trust in government remains low among U.S. citizens, finding that one in five Americans say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right “most of the time” (19%), and just 2% trust the government to do what’s right “just about always.”</p>
<p>Across all countries surveyed by Entrust, most respondents put their trust in the government’s ability to secure their personal information somewhere in the middle of a 1-10 scale. There were significant differences, however, in who gave government high marks (9 or 10 on a 1-10 scale) for trust, ranging from a high of 38.4% in the United States to a low of just 26.5% in Australia.</p>
<p>Governments are lagging in their efforts to improve their mobile app delivery in government-to-citizen interactions. As they strive to embrace digital transformation, building and maintaining citizens’ trust is crucial.</p>
<p>Countries vary widely in how much citizens trust their government and how they interact.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Australia Commits to Digital Transformation</p>
<p>The Australian government recognizes the importance of government-to-citizen engagement in the digital age, and, according to <a href="https://www.govtechreview.com.au/content/gov-digital/article/ensuring-digital-transformation-success-in-government-472786136">Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency’s Digital Transformation Strategy 2018-2025</a>, aspires to be a leading digital government globally. Australia’s strategy sets a target to bring all federal services online by 2025.</p>
<p>Australia now has a double-digit lead in high marks for service delivery via mobile app use over the other countries in the Entrust study. Most other countries rely on web portals as their preferred digital option.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Australian government is expected to release its final Data and Digital Government Strategy, along with an implementation plan, by the end of 2023. These documents will outline the initiatives for the government’s vision of a digitally empowered nation.</p>
<p>Germany Recognizes the Need for Change</p>
<p>The European Commission’s Digital Economy and Society Index <a href="https://cepa.org/article/deutsche-katastrophe-germany-fights-digital-backwardness/">(DESI)</a> in 2022 ranked Germany 13th among European Union member states in terms of digital performance. This ranking highlights the disparity between Germany and its counterparts.</p>
 
 50% of Germans possess basic digital skills, compared to 80% of Finns 
 Fewer than 40% of German households have access to fixed broadband connections, versus 70% of Spaniards who enjoy that convenience. 
 
<p>With few digital options today, German citizens have the lowest usage of eGov service delivery options across all the countries surveyed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is about to change. <a href="https://cepa.org/article/deutsche-katastrophe-germany-fights-digital-backwardness/">The German government</a> recognizes the need for comprehensive digital transformation and acknowledges the importance of embracing digital advancements. While Germany does have a strong economy, the country faces challenges such as inconsistent internet connections, outdated technology in classrooms, low citizen trust, and government offices heavily reliant on traditional methods. This lack of digital adoption and integration could adversely affect Germany’s growth in industrial and public sectors.</p>
<p>Different Age Groups See Things Differently, and the Same</p>
<p></p>
<p>The table above shows how different age groups in the study, regardless of geography, prefer to interact with government. There are some interesting similarities and differences:</p>
 
 Government web portals are the preferred method of interaction across age groups. 
 Gen Z preferences are almost evenly split between the web and phone with the use of all other means of interaction (other than mail) preferred over mobile apps. 
 Gen Z prefers to use the phone more than baby boomers. 
 Baby Boomers prefer web portals 52% more than their Gen Z counterparts. 
 Everybody, regardless of age or geography, dislikes mail. The lowest scores in our survey were reserved for in-person interactions, and interactions by mail. While governments will continue to provide these services to meet the needs of all of their citizens, this speaks to the critical need to embrace digital services. 
 
<p>Advice to Governments Everywhere</p>
<p>Embracing digital technologies will help drive simpler, more seamless and secure citizen services, resulting in engaged citizens, streamlined processes, and strengthened trust in government.</p>
<p>Governments should collaborate with technology vendors to provide seamless, secure citizen journeys for eGov service enablement and delivery with the goal of creating a modern and inclusive framework that adapts to the needs of our rapidly evolving digital age.</p>
<p>Entrust enables trusted citizen identities for eGovernment service enablement and delivery. Our <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/secure-digital-citizen-interactions">solutions</a> let government departments and agencies seamlessly and securely enroll and onboard citizens, issue and verify citizen credentials, and accelerate the delivery of citizen services resulting in:</p>

<p></p>



<p>Workplaces are transforming at a fast pace. Emerging technologies like AI (artificial intelligence), ML (machine learning), big data, and blockchain are turning physical workspaces into digital ones. The COVID pandemic has already given a further boost to this process. Currently, employers are hiring globally as work from anywhere gathers pace. However, as the workplace transformation progresses rapidly, it raises the risk of fraudulent activities. Given that credential of candidates plays a critical role in making the hiring process successful, enterprises globally are looking at ways of vetting the entire process. Similarly, genuine professionals are trying to cross check the veracity of claims made by employers before entering into a job contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironically, digitalisation of both these processes remains at a low level.This problem further aggravates in a huge country like India with its 1.4 billion population. With more than 40% of India’s population below 25 years, the country has a working class population of 540 million. Every year, around 6.5 million students graduate from colleges. No wonder, such vastness creates its own set of problems with instances of job scams, fraud candidates, and imposters becoming frequent. During the pandemic years, such a trend has touched menacing proportions. Against this backdrop, digital resumes with the help of blockchain technology can mitigate such risks to a great extent. In a country like India, its relevance is beyond discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Leveraging blockchain technology for secure &amp; efficient HR recruitment: 



<p>HR (human resources) technology has evolved a lot over the years with increasing automation playing a bigger role. The advent of ChatGPT kind of generative AI tools has added a new dimension to this space. Despite such transformation, most of the data about candidates and professionals is stored in an unorganised manner. These remain paper-based or digital-based records without any central access system. Moreover, there is no way to track the veracity of the credentials of candidates, nor any way to check the tampering. In this context, blockchain technology can be very useful for its unique features.&nbsp; A blockchain is a form of decentralised ledger technology that enables the secure storage and transmission of data. Here, each transaction is recorded across each node on the network. Therefore, no record can be changed without altering subsequent blocks in the chain. This makes the whole system tamper-proof. In the HR space, this feature will help in checking unintended changes to the resume. Secondly, blockchain creates a depository of digital resumes with the entire history of academic and professional history stored in one place. Such depository can be shared by several employers in the same field for checking the veracity of candidates for higher education or employment. Moreover, decentralisation of data recording provides security and stability to the information stored. As educational institutions and corporates have seen cybersecurity attacks mounted by nefarious elements on a regular frequency, blockchain-powered solutions can provide much-needed security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Digital resume leveraging blockchain: 



<p>Globally, corporates are in pursuit of hiring the right talent for manning operations. Post globalisation, India has emerged as a talent hub for the world. The technology industry alone has employed more than 5.4 million people with most Fortune 500 companies having their presence in the country. The country has also emerged as the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. As China Plus One plays out across the world, India is also seeing traction in the manufacturing sector. With the growth of the Indian economy, employment opportunities are also on the rise. It requires the right selection of talent for ensuring efficiency. In this context, blockchain technology can be a great enabler.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Making selection process better &amp; faster:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>During 2020-22 period, most businesses have opted for an online recruitment process. This was accompanied by scams and frauds as many potential candidates used fake resumes and experience letters to get jobs. These instances were caught during the background check process. Many companies including Accenture, Infosys, Cognizant had laid off staffers owing to fraudulent activities. Such concerns can be easily addressed by building digital resumes of candidates, leveraging blockchain technology. With the use of this technology, individuals and organisations can generate a secure and unalterable digital record of their academic achievements, professional experience, and competencies. This will make the process easier for employers to verify the authenticity of a candidate’s qualifications. Such records will do away with the manual process of background checking as all the databases will be available in one place. Moreover, many processes can be automated, leading to a lot of cost savings for organisations and enterprises. For instance, organisations are currently employing a team of HR professionals for conducting recruitment and taking the help of external agencies for a background check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain will not only enable organisations to hire effectively, it will also empower individuals in getting the right job. Given the huge working population, job scams in India are very frequent. Recently, a massive job fraud duping 50,000 candidates was unearthed by Odisha police. Such scams can be thwarted to a large extent if blockchain-powered solutions are used to create digital profiles of organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Boosting jobs: 



<p>Blockchain can not only be used in the white-collar job space. Even blue-collar jobs will get a leg up from this technology. India has seen an increasing formalisation of blue-collar jobs by multiple ecommerce and related startups. Even the government is trying to promote skill-based job recruitment to boost employment. Blockchain technology can be leveraged to create digital resumes of skilled workers for employment in various sectors. Such a common depository of resumes can be accessed by several employers and individuals for various services. Digital records of skilled individuals will increase job opportunities in the blue-collar job space.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Right technology partner: 



<p>Many global technology firms have started deploying blockchain technology in the human resources space. Last year, an online resume-validating network run by Velocity Network Foundation garnered support from than a dozen board members from companies including Aon, Oracle, SAP, UKG, and ZipRecruiter to reduce the time and cost of vetting job candidates. Many blockchain-focussed specialised firms in India such as Dhiway Networks have come up with solutions that can help enterprises to create digital resumes of candidates. India houses the largest number of young people in the world, which is likely to continue for the next three decades. Therefore, it becomes important for organisations to collaborate with the right technology partner for leveraging blockchain technology to the fullest. This can not only save cost but also improve return on investment by hiring the right talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advent of technology has changed the face of the education sector globally. Rapid penetration of the internet has facilitated the push towards online education. This has gained further momentum during the COVID pandemic as online education became the norm. Leveraging emerging technologies such as AI, ML, and big data among others has increased both access and reach of educational institutions manifold. However, it has ushered in a growing wave of privacy concerns and challenges to the authenticity of the documents and credentials shared on the webspace. According to Forbes magazine, there is an old, but fast-growing degree mill industry doing business for an estimated $7 billion a year worldwide from fraudulent diplomas, degrees, and transcripts. In India, these concerns are no lesser with instances of fake certificates, job scams, and related aspects cropping up frequently. Against this backdrop, blockchain as a technology can be a game-changer in ensuring the genuineness of degrees by maintaining a digital record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Enforcement Directorate of India has recently filed a charge sheet under the anti-money laundering law against Himachal Pradesh-based Manav Bharti University and its promoters in a case linked to the alleged sale of fake degrees. The university has allegedly issued 36,000 fake degrees over 11 years for prices ranging between Rs 100,000 to Rs 300,000 (US$1,362-4,085). In March this year, Odisha police unearthed a fake certificate scam and arrested 19 people relating to the case. More recently, 700 Indian students, hailing from Punjab, are under the scrutiny of the Canadian government after being duped by unscrupulous education consultants back home, who had handed over ‘fraudulent college admission letters’ to enter Canada. So, the problems are real that are affecting the lives of hundreds of students with cross-border ramifications. No wonder, the Trends in Education Frauds in India report for 2020 says that fake degree submissions constituted nearly 28 per cent of education discrepancies in India. Universities issuing counterfeit degrees and job aspirants submitting fake academic and experience credentials are not only confined to India. It is rather a global phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Blockchain in education: 



<p>Apart from fake certificates, blockchain technology can also be leveraged for knowing the validity of different credentials. For instance, records, certificates, and credentials which we acquire have different longevities. Some, like ID cards, are valid for a specific period; others, like skilling certificates, require constant renewal. Also, there are records like certificates that have validity across the lifetime of the data subject. Regardless of the longevities, the documents need to be embedded with a high degree of assurance, enabling trustworthy interactions when exchanged. And this is possible due to the distinct features of blockchain. Firstly, it ensures a decentralized, transparent, and secure system. Each transaction (data) is recorded on multiple nodes, creating a distributed network that is difficult to hack or manipulate. Secondly, it creates a digital and decentralized platform for issuing and storing credentials. Such a feature allows the formation of a repository of digital records. Blockchain technology also enhances data privacy and ownership, by providing individuals control over their data through the use of self-sovereign identities. The stakeholders can choose who can access their data. Given the complexity of data privacy regulations, educational institutions can comply with norms by leveraging blockchain technology. Therefore, it has plenty of scope in the education sector for trust, security, and credentialing of educational records.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Digital records &amp; credentialing: 



<p>Educational institutions across the world work in silos with very less centralization of data. Centralisation is only seen in a specific sector without any information sharing within sectors. No central authority in a vast country like India has access to all the students’ credentials for studying in different educational institutions. In this scenario, blockchain can be leveraged to create a repository of digital certificates. Such a repository can be used by various stakeholders including government agencies, enterprises, staffing firms, and educational institutions for authenticating the genuineness of certificates. It can streamline the credentialing process by providing a digital and decentralized platform for issuing and storing credentials. Such blockchain-based digital certificates can also help students access and share their credentials easily with employers, other institutions, and third-party verification services, eliminating cumbersome paperwork, which demands time and resources. Currently, the University Grants Commission (UGC) is planning to set up a National Academic Depository that will centralise all records of students under one platform.<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Data privacy &amp; IP protection:&nbsp; 



<p>While institutions can utilize blockchain technology to create a decentralized and immutable ledger of credentials and make the verification process easy, these credentials can be anchored on the blockchains securely, preventing the chances of tampering. It will establish trust among all the stakeholders. For instance, the U.S. Congress enacted the Family Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in 1974 to protect the privacy of students attending government schools. This act allows parents access to their children’s educational records and give them rights to request record amendments and control the disclosure of personally identifiable information. Similarly, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) of Europe puts the onus of data privacy of students on educational institutions. The National Education Policy of India is also considering similar norms concerning data privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, educational institutions store vast amounts of sensitive data including records, financial information, and research information. Blockchain technology protects the data from unauthorized access, duplication, manipulation, and sharing..&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Fillip to edtechs &amp; cost savings: 



<p>Edtechs has emerged as one of the important pillars of the education system globally. In India, this segment plays a critical role in upskilling human resources, increasing the reach of quality education in rural areas apart from enhancing the usage of technology. However, the rapid adoption of such technology platforms has also given rise to instances of fraud. Such frauds can be regulated with the help of blockchain technology. Moreover, blockchain can transform data recording, storage, and sharing process from paper to digital ones. Currently, many educational institutions face issues like verifying the authenticity of academic credentials such as degrees, diplomas, certificates, and examination mark sheets as it is time-consuming and vulnerable to errors owing to its paper-based approach. Leveraging blockchain, these processes can be automated, reducing dependence on manpower and paper-based processes.<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Collaborate with technology partner:&nbsp; 



<p>Deploying blockchain by educational institutions, however, needs the necessary infrastructure, training of staff, and ensuring interoperability across systems. These challenges can be dealt with by hiring technology providers who maintain global standards. Players such as Dhiway Networks, a blockchain technology company based out of Bangalore, can make the process easy for educational institutions. The company offers digital solutions such as #MARKs against fake certification. In addition to verifiability, this tool gives the issuing authorities the capability to track and trace any educational certificate digitally, making remote validation a reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be it schools or universities, educational institutions, irrespective of their scale and size, can deal with challenges like verification of credentials, preventing fraud, and ensuring data privacy by using blockchain technology. Collaboration with the right technology partner can ease this process to a great extent.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Preparing for future cybersecurity threats can be daunting, but it really doesn’t have to be the case if cyber security leaders recognize the true nature of the challenge. An analysis of past cyber-attacks reveals that they tend to be cyclic and lack any real innovation.</p>
<p>Most "sophisticated" attacks are just different combinations of well-known attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) applied to new technologies. Therefore, the key to success lies in focusing on new technologies, protecting data within them, and automating processes to keep up with the pace of change.</p>
 Assess risk 
<p>A risk-based, data- and identity-centric approach to security is invaluable. Data is the lifeblood of any organization and the main target of cyber-attacks. Identity plays a crucial role in access control and is frequently exploited through various TTPs. Risk assessments should pay particular attention to data and identity, ensuring thorough analysis and mitigation before implementing new technologies.</p>
 Focus on technology 
<p>There are several developments in the business IT landscape that require attention, starting with artificial intelligence (AI), which can be used both by attackers and defenders, enabling attacks, such as phishing using deepfake impersonations. Quantum computing poses a threat to encryption, and organizations must plan for quantum-proof encryption. Internet-enabled devices (IoT) are vulnerable and can be exploited to access wider networks. Cloud-based services, while offering advantages, require diligent risk assessments and strong security measures.</p>
<p>The trend of remote work introduces new cybersecurity risks, especially with the rise of shadow IT. Virtual environments, such as the metaverse, offer new opportunities for engaging customers but require careful consideration of privacy and security. Web3.0, with its open-source and blockchain foundations, may improve data control but also provides new attack vectors. 5G networks offers enhanced capabilities but require understanding and planning for the associated cybersecurity risks. &nbsp;Lastly, organizations must address the security risks associated with the IT supply chain, as compromises can lead to further cyber-attacks.</p>
 Challenges and opportunities 
<p>Digitalization brings both benefits and challenges. Organizations must prioritize security while embracing change to ensure the success of their operations.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity in an AI powered digital world is the focus of KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November that will look at tackling future cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Presentations will focus on a range of topics, including how AI enables cyber attackers and defenders, securing the autonomous world and the cloud, advancements in quantum computing, detecting deepfakes, securing IoT devices, securing business communication channels and supply chains, protecting digital identities, and the security challenges of Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

   In a previous blog, It's Time to Hang Up on Phone Transports for Authentication, I wrote about the vulnerabilities of multifactor authentication (MFA) mechanisms such as SMS and voice.

  <p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">It's Time to Hang Up on Phone Transports for Authentication</a>, I wrote about the vulnerabilities of multifactor authentication (MFA) mechanisms such as SMS and voice. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00945.pdf">A recent MFA research study</a> from Microsoft concludes that SMS is 40% less effective in stopping bad actors compared to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/authenticator">Microsoft Authenticator</a> app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've also continued to bolster our Authenticator offering by <a href="http://aka.ms/authapplevelup">upleveling security</a>. But, despite the clear advantages to moving away from phone-based authentication, we still see around 44% of MFA traffic through SMS and voice phone calls. Bad actors continue to exploit MFA based on phone methods. Together, we can use stronger authentication methods to protect our users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I am excited to share that we’re taking steps to help you do just that. First, we’re helping you get your users registered with better methods by improving the strong authentication registration campaign capabilities. Then, to make the use of flagship capabilities like FIDO2 more accessible in more environments, we’re releasing FIDO2 support on iOS and macOS browsers in general availability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern strong authentication registration campaign&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/new-microsoft-authenticator-security-features-are-now-available/ba-p/2464386">In November 2021, we released registration campaigns</a>, a feature that allows enterprises to drive adoption of modern authentication methods, starting with Microsoft Authenticator. Since its release, we’ve had thousands of enterprises depend on this feature to drive adoption of modern authentication methods, helping over 1.3 million users configure and start using Microsoft Authenticator as their primary authentication method. However, we’ve heard from customers that they need more control over a user’s registration for modern strong authentication – so we’re adding new features to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration campaign sign-in prompt&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we’re introducing a maximum prompt skip limit. With our latest updates, users will be able to postpone their registration up to three times. This will give them enough time to plan and prepare for the change, while increasing the effectiveness of your campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for organizations set as Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature automatically for users that are fully dependent on SMS or voice for MFA. Beginning this month (July 2023), we’ll initiate a phased rollout of this change. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a> where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their organization specifically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 FIDO2 support on iOS and macOS browsers in general availability 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also excited to announce that you can now use FIDO2 security keys to sign into Microsoft Entra ID federated applications on iOS and macOS web browsers. FIDO2 security keys provide strong, phishing-resistant authentication protected by a biometric factor (fingerprint) or PIN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be especially useful for highly regulated organizations that have strict compliance requirements, such as US Government agencies who need to comply with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, that require phishing-resistant authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key">this page</a> to enable passwordless sign-in with FIDO2 security keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about supported browser scenarios at <a href="https://aka.ms/FIDOMatrix">https://aka.ms/FIDOMatrix</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together we believe that these changes will make a real difference and propel millions of users to a better way of MFA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At VeramoLabs, we’ve been thinking recently about how technologies like Decentralized Identities (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials can be used with modern AI chat-bots (or other Machine Learning agents) to reduce some of the risks these powerful tools present and increase interoperability between them and other systems. The risk we are most concerned with is the introduction of powerful yet opaque systems that reinforce inequality because they are trained on biased data (for more on this, you might want to check out the book Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil). On the other hand, a lack of interoperability increases switching costs, reduces ease of access, and (to a degree) impedes the development of interesting composable solutions that chain together ML&nbsp;models.</p><p>Adding a type of provenance to data generated by AI can enable us to provide auditability that should both improve the AI models and protect the systems and people they affect. By defining a common standard for verifiably interacting with AI models, we can start to fill the “moats” that less-open AI projects are trying to dig around their&nbsp;models.</p><p>As a demonstration, we’ll a simple application that shows how a user might interact with an AI chatbot in a way that provides more security throughout the process. At a high level, we’ll show how to build a protocol within <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a> (an open standard for end-to-end-encrypted communication between <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/basics/identifiers#decentralized-identifier">DIDs</a>) that lets us communicate with an AI agent and receive generated data as a <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/basics/verifiable_data#w3c-verifiable-credential">Verifiable Credential</a>.</p><p>This certainly isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s a helpful exercise for exploring the intersection of AI, Identity and the Veramo framework. Since Veramo is a multiplatform and modular javascript framework for decentralized identity, verifiable data and communication, we can use it to prototype an SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) solution for verifiably communicating with AI models in just a few minutes. We’ll use Veramo to build both a cloud agent that wraps an AI model and the front-end user interface for sending secure messages to that&nbsp;agent.</p><p>For this demo use case, we’ll be using an LLM named “Starchat” found on <a href="https://huggingface.co/">huggingface.co</a>, a platform for open-source AI. Huggingface allows us to interact with ML models via their API and also provides metadata about the model, such as the dataset the model was trained on or any associated research&nbsp;paper.</p><p>We’ll start by defining a “sub-protocol” for DIDComm. The base DIDComm standard defines the minimal message format and the cryptographic processes required for encrypted communication. The specification also details how “sub-protocols” can be layered on top of DIDComm to support interoperability between common use cases. You can find existing “sub-protocols” on the <a href="https://didcomm.org/search/?page=1">DIDComm&nbsp;site</a>.</p><p>If you prefer watching videos to reading, you can watch a tutorial that covers the rest of this article on our&nbsp;youtube:</p><p>Our protocol will be very simple, so all we really need to do is define 2 message types: one for the question a user will be sending to the AI agent and one for the AI agent’s response. We’ll use dummy URLs for the types, although if this protocol were used in a production environment, it would be preferable to use URLs that point to the protocol definition. Most of our work will be contained in a plugin for Veramo, published as an NPM&nbsp;package.</p><p>For outbound queries from a user to an AI agent, we’ll create a message with type = <a href="https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question`.">https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question.</a> In the body object, we’ll include a prompt string (the question the user is asking the AI), and the message should include a thid (thread ID) so that successive queries could be linked together in a UI, although we won’t be implementing that aspect in this proof-of-concept. We’ll also include a return_route since we expect a response right away, as well as all the standard DIDComm message fields: from, to,&nbsp;id.</p><p>This means an outbound message will look like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  type:"https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question",<br>  from: "did:fake:sender",<br>  to: "did:fake:ai-text-generation-model",<br>  id: "abc-123",<br>  thid: "def-456",<br>  body: {<br>    prompt: "What are the bones in your arm called?"<br>  },<br>  return_route: "all"<br>} <p>We can create a simple helper function in our Veramo plugin to help us easily create these messages:</p> export const ML_TEXT_GENERATION_QUESTION_MESSAGE_TYPE = 'https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question'<br><br>export function createMLTextGenerationPromptMessage(prompt: string, senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, thid: string, returnRoute: boolean): IDIDCommMessage {<br>  return {<br>    type: ML_TEXT_GENERATION_PROMPT_MESSAGE_TYPE,<br>    from: senderDidUrl,<br>    to: recipientDidUrl,<br>    id: v4(),<br>    thid,<br>    body: {<br>      prompt<br>    },<br>    return_route: returnRoute ? 'all' : 'none'<br>  }<br>}<br> <p>When an agent receives this type of message, it performs the query by sending a request to the Startchat API. This requires a bit of hacky code due to a quirk of the Text Generation model API. There’s probably a better approach, but for this proof-of-concept the hacky solution is&nbsp;fine:</p> async function query(data: any, token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {<br>  const response = await fetch(<br>    "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>    {<br>      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, 'Content-Type': "application/json" },<br>      method: "POST",<br>      body: JSON.stringify(data),<br>    }<br>  );<br>  const result = await response.blob();<br>  return result;<br>}<br><br>export async function getAnswer(queryInput: string, token: string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {<br>  const modQuery = queryInput + "&lt;|end|&gt;\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\n"<br>  const res = await query({"inputs": modQuery}, token)<br>  const text = await res.text()<br>  let generatedText: string = JSON.parse(text)[0].generated_text<br>  let iterations = 0<br>  let answer = generatedText.substring(modQuery.length)<br><br>  while (!answer.includes('&lt;|end|&gt;') &amp;&amp; iterations &lt; 20) {<br>    const r = await query({"inputs": modQuery + answer }, token)<br>    const generatedText2 = JSON.parse(await r.text())[0].generated_text<br>    answer = generatedText2.substring(modQuery.length)<br>    iterations++<br>  }<br>  const end = answer.indexOf('&lt;|end|&gt;')<br>  let finalAnswer = answer<br>  if (end &gt; 0) {<br>    finalAnswer = answer.substring(0, end)<br>  }<br>  return finalAnswer<br>} <p>Then we create a verifiable credential that contains the response to the query along with a few pieces of metadata that can aid in auditability and user education. Such a credential might look like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  issuer: { id: "did:fake:ai-text-generation-model"},<br>  '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],<br>  type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'TextGenerationAnswer'],<br>  issuanceDate: new Date().toISOString(),<br>  credentialSubject: {<br>    id: "did:fake:sender",<br>    prompt: "What are the bones in your arm called?"<br>    answer,<br>    model: "HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>    license: "bigcode-openrail-m",<br>    linkedPapers: ["arxiv:1911.02150", "arxiv:2205.14135"]<br>  }<br>} <p>To create this credential using Veramo, we create another small function:</p> function createCredential(context: IAgentContext&lt;ICredentialPlugin&gt;, response: string, prompt: string, from: string, to: string): Promise&lt;VerifiableCredential&gt; {<br>  return context.agent.createVerifiableCredential({<br>    credential: {<br>      issuer: { id: to },<br>      '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],<br>      type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'TextGenerationResponse'],<br>      issuanceDate: new Date().toISOString(),<br>      credentialSubject: {<br>        id: from,<br>        prompt,<br>        response,<br>        model: "HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>        license: "bigcode-openrail-m",<br>        linkedPapers: ["arxiv:1911.02150", "arxiv:2205.14135"]<br>      }<br>    },<br>    proofFormat: 'jwt'<br>  })<br>} <p>The AI agent then sends a DIDComm message with type = <a href="https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response">https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response</a> that contains this credential back to the original sender, utilizing the connection that delivered the first message if possible (as requested by the return_route parameter).</p><p>Another helper function in our plugin will let us easily create these response messages:</p> export const ML_TEXT_GENERATION_RESPONSE_MESSAGE_TYPE = ‘https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response'export function createMLTextGenerationResponse(senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, questionId: string, questionThid: string, credential: VerifiableCredential): IDIDCommMessage {<br><br>export function createMLTextGenerationResponse(senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, questionId: string, questionThid: string, credential: VerifiableCredential): IDIDCommMessage {<br>  return {<br>    type: ML_TEXT_GENERATION_RESPONSE_MESSAGE_TYPE,<br>    from: senderDidUrl,<br>    to: recipientDidUrl,<br>    id: `${questionId}-response`,<br>    thid: questionThid,<br>    body: credential<br>  }<br>} <p>We can put this all together in a relatively small Message&nbsp;Handler:</p> <br>/**<br> * A plugin for the {@link @veramo/message-handler#MessageHandler} that handles Starchat messages.<br> * @beta This API may change without a BREAKING CHANGE notice.<br> */<br>export class MLTextGenerationPromptMessageHandler extends AbstractMessageHandler {<br>  private hfToken: string<br>  constructor(hfToken: string) {<br>    super()<br>    this.hfToken = hfToken<br>  }<br><br>  /**<br>   * Handles a Star Chat Message<br>   * https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#trust-ping-protocol-10<br>   */<br>  public async handle(message: Message, context: IContext): Promise&lt;Message&gt;

<p>¿Que está pasando con Hollywood y la AI o Inteligencia Artificial?</p>
<p>La industria del entretenimiento de Hollywood se enfrenta a un conflicto creciente en relación con el avance de la inteligencia artificial (IA) y las preocupaciones sobre la impersonalización de los actores. La reciente huelga de actores ha resaltado la necesidad de proteger la autenticidad en la industria del cine y la televisión. En este contexto, el uso de un sistema de Identidad Auto-Soberana descentralizada (SSI) puede desempeñar un papel fundamental en la verificación de datos e identidades, y en la prevención de estafas y impersonalizaciones.</p>
<p>El actual conflicto y la importancia de la autenticidad: Hollywood y la AI</p>
<p>En la industria de Hollywood, la autenticidad de los actores y su capacidad para transmitir emociones genuinas han sido fundamentales para el éxito de las películas y programas de televisión. Sin embargo, el surgimiento de la inteligencia artificial ha planteado desafíos significativos en cuanto a la impersonalización y la creación de contenido falso. <a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/fran-drescher-discurso-huelga-de-actores-dig-showbiz/">La huelga de actores</a> actual es un reflejo de la preocupación generalizada por la pérdida de autenticidad y el riesgo de que los actores sean reemplazados por tecnología.</p>
<p>La Identidad Auto-Soberana (SSI) y la verificación de datos</p>
<p>La Identidad Auto-Soberana (SSI) es un sistema que permite a las personas tener el control total sobre su identidad digital y los datos asociados a ella. A través de la SSI, los actores y otras personas pueden establecer identidades digitales verificables que respalden su autenticidad en la industria del entretenimiento. Este sistema utiliza tecnologías criptográficas y blockchain para garantizar la seguridad y la verificación de los datos, evitando así la manipulación y la falsificación.</p>
<p>Protegiendo la autenticidad y evitando estafas e impersonalizaciones</p>
<p>Implementar un sistema de SSI en Hollywood podría ser una solución efectiva para validar las identidades de las personas y evitar estafas e impersonalizaciones. Este sistema permitiría generar credenciales digitales verificables que demostrarían la participación real de los actores en proyectos específicos. Estas credenciales podrían ser utilizadas por los estudios de producción y el público para validar la autenticidad de los contenidos, generando confianza y evitando engaños.</p>
<p>Reflexiones finales: proteger la autenticidad en la era de la IA</p>
<p>En una era en la que la tecnología avanza rápidamente, es fundamental abordar los desafíos que enfrenta la industria del entretenimiento en términos de autenticidad y veracidad. ¿Qué impacto crees que tienen los deepfakes y las impersonalizaciones en la industria del entretenimiento? ¿Cómo crees que la verificación de identidades y datos puede contribuir a solucionar estos problemas? ¿Qué medidas adicionales crees que se deberían implementar para proteger la privacidad y los derechos de los actores?</p>
<p>¿Qué podemos hacer al respecto?</p>
<p>Es hora de proteger la autenticidad de las identidades y, en el caso de Hollywood, preservar la esencia de la actuación humana en la era digital. La implementación de un sistema de Identidad Auto-Soberana puede marcar la diferencia al garantizar la verificación confiable de datos e identidades.</p>
<p>Con SSI, evitaríamos las impersonalizaciónes y los usos negativos de la IA como las estafas y los robos de identidad.</p>

  <p>As announced on June 7, 2023, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> is now generally available, and with it a set of new capabilities to empower businesses in their pursuit of streamlined access management. This includes machine learning (ML) powered access review recommendations and user inactivity access review scoping. These additions leverage advanced technologies to enhance access reviews, granting reviewers intelligent recommendations and simplifying security management by regularly reviewing and removing inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's explore how these features assist organizations in making informed decisions and safeguarding critical resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Machine Learning-based recommendations for reviewers&nbsp; 
<p>Access reviews play a crucial role in ensuring the right users have the appropriate access privileges within an organization. However, the decision-making process can be challenging and time-consuming for reviewers. This is where machine learning-based recommendations for reviewers come into play. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and the organization's reporting structure, this feature provides insightful recommendations to reviewers, enabling them to make well-informed decisions swiftly. Nevertheless, it’s worth emphasizing that while this recommendation is significant, it’s merely the first step towards unlocking the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: You want reviewers to make the review process easier so that reviewers can make quicker and more accurate decisions&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want your reviewers to be efficient during your access certification campaigns. When creating the access review, you select ‘User-to-Group Affiliation’ as part of enabling reviewer decision helpers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user-to-group affiliation recommendation analyzes users' relative affiliation with other users in the group, while also considering the organization's reporting structure. By utilizing a machine-learning-based scoring mechanism, the system identifies users who are at a significant distance from other users in the group, indicating "low affiliation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviewer now will see the recommendation in My Access when going through the access review. These insights help flag potential candidates for closer scrutiny before a decision is made to accept or deny access, thereby helping reviewers increase review efficiency, reduce attestation fatigue, and ensure the sensitive resources are secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviewer can now take immediate action. They have the option to accept the recommendations by clicking on “Accept Recommendations,” enabling swift, efficient decision-making. Alternatively, reviewers can manually review the recommendations and exercise their judgment to accept or deny access accordingly. This feature empowers reviewers to make well-informed decisions while reducing the time and effort required to complete an access review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/review-recommendations-access-reviews#user-to-group-affiliation-preview">Review recommendations for Access reviews</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unleashing the power of inactive user scoping&nbsp; 
<p>Managing inactive user accounts is a significant challenge for organizations, as dormant accounts can pose potential security risks. ID Governance tackles this challenge head-on with the introduction of inactive user scoping. This feature allows administrators to review and address stale accounts that haven’t been active for a specified period. By encompassing both interactive and non-interactive sign-in activities, inactive user scoping provides a comprehensive view of user activity. Administrators can set a specific duration, such as 30, 60 or 90 days, to determine inactive accounts. As part of the review process, stale accounts can automatically be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: You want to set up a recurring review of inactive users in a critical group&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to set up a recurrent review of the audit team group, who have not signed into any application in Azure AD (both interactively and non-interactively) in the last 30 days. For that you create a new access review, you choose the group, all users in the group and choose the new option for inactive users, with a threshold of 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing inactive user accounts improves an organization's security posture by reducing the attack surface and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. By regularly reviewing and removing stale accounts, organizations can ensure that access privileges align with business requirements and maintain a lean, secure user environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity-related security is paramount in our modern threat landscape, touching on almost any form of vulnerability related to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>What Is Identity Lifecycle Management? Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) is the collection of technologies, processes, and policies governing digital identity creation, management, and deletion.</p>
 What Is Identity Lifecycle Management? 
<p>The Identity Lifecycle is a continuous cycle of managing users’ identities within a system or network, typically in an organization. It involves several stages that ensure the secure and efficient handling of user identities and access controls. The steps of this lifecycle usually include the following:</p>
 
 Provisioning (Onboarding): In this stage, user accounts are created, often when a new employee joins the organization. Each user’s relevant access privileges are defined based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Access Governance: This is a continuous process where policies are established and enforced to govern the identity and access management system. 
 Authentication: At this point, the ILM system includes controls to prevent unauthorized access by requiring login credentials, typically associated with multi-factor authentication. 
 Authorization: After authentication, authorization rules and controls function as the gatekeeper of access to system resources based on the user’s role, the type of resource in question, and other factors like user location, device, or behavior. 
 Management: This ongoing process involves managing users’ identities, maintaining their access rights and roles, and keeping track of any changes. This includes changes to the user’s role, changes in their privileges, or removing their access rights. 
 De-Provisioning (Offboarding): When a user account is no longer required, the ILM process must account for removing the user and their access rights to prevent backdoor access or insider threats. 
 Reporting: Regular reports and audits are conducted to ensure the identity and access management system functions correctly and securely. This includes checking for any signs of suspicious activity or potential security breaches. 
 
 How Does Identity Lifecycle Management Work? 
<p>It’s an essential component of an organization’s security strategy, ensuring that individual users only have access to the resources they must and that their interactions with resources are readily observable and documented.</p>
<p>There are various components of any Identity Lifecycle Management, including:</p>
 
 Onboarding and Offboarding: When a new user is added to or removed from the system, users get (or lose) unique credentials and identifiers denoting roles and responsibilities. 
 Identity and Access Management: This ongoing process involves managing users’ identities, including their access rights and roles. It may include controlling the user’s credentials, setting up multi-factor authentication, managing access to different resources, and other related tasks. 
 Auditing: Regular reviews and audits ensure access rights and roles are still appropriate for each user. This could involve reviewing logs and reports, conducting access certification campaigns, and other activities to verify that the system functions correctly and securely. 
 Compliance Reporting: Many organizations need to demonstrate compliance with various regulations or standards related to identity and access management. This can involve generating reports, documenting processes and procedures, and other activities to demonstrate compliance. 
 
<p>ILM provides a structured approach to managing and securing digital identities to improve security and accountability throughout the organization.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between ILM and Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/privileged-access-management/">Privileged Access Management</a> (PAM) overlap in their more generic definitions. However, both are critical to an organization’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/identity-management/what-is-iam">Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) efforts.</p>
<p>The differences between the two include:</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management covers the management of identities for all users within an organization throughout their lifecycle. This includes everything from the initial onboarding of new users (creating accounts, assigning initial roles and permissions), through changes in roles or responsibilities (which may require changes to access rights), to eventual offboarding (disabling or deleting accounts when users leave the organization). 
 Privileged Access Management, on the other hand, focuses explicitly on managing accounts with elevated privileges. The risks associated with these accounts are significantly higher, so they require additional controls. These include strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>, session monitoring and recording, detailed logging and auditing, and even advanced features like ‘just-in-time’ access, where the privileged rights are only granted when needed and automatically revoked afterward. 
 
<p>Effective security requires both ILM to manage the broad population of users, and PAM, to provide additional controls for the smaller number of high-risk privileged accounts.</p>
 Why Is Identity Lifecycle Management So Important? 
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) ensures the security and integrity of an organization’s systems and data. Here are several reasons why ILM is so important:</p>
 
 Security: ILM provides a centralized and understandable way to address security based on user resource access. This, in turn, provides more control over these security issues. 
 Compliance: Many industries are subject to regulations that require them to manage and protect digital identities in specific ways. By providing a structured approach to managing these identities, ILM helps organizations to comply with these regulations and avoid potential penalties. 
 Cost Reduction: Automation and centralization (mainly through <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/idaas/">IDaaS</a> systems) can reduce costs related to the maintenance of identity systems in terms of money spent on software and work hours dedicated to related tasks. 
 Auditability: ILM provides a clear record of who has access to what resources and when making it easier to audit access and identify any potential issues. This is important for organizations that need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations. 
 Risk Mitigation: ILM helps prevent internal threats by ensuring that access rights are granted based on the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">principle of least privilege</a>, giving users the minimum levels of access they need to perform their jobs. Also, when employees leave or change roles, ILM ensures their access rights are updated promptly to prevent potential security risks. 
 
<p>By managing the entire lifecycle of digital identities within an organization, from creation to termination, ILM provides a comprehensive approach to identity and access management. This helps ensure that the right people have access at the right time, improving security, efficiency, and compliance.</p>

<p>As part of Coinfirm’s investigative and analytic efforts, we continually improve our understanding of the complex workings of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>transactions, especially those related to high-profile hacking events. Today, we present a deep dive into the Parity hack, one of the most notorious events in blockchain history.</p>



<p>6 Years ago, on the 18th of July 2017, the Parity multisig library was compromised, resulting in the theft of 153,037 ETH from three wallets. Thanks to the swift response of white-hat hackers, who secured funds from a total of 596 vulnerable wallets, the damage could be somewhat mitigated. Nonetheless, the breach represented a significant event in the blockchain world and highlighted the importance of robust security mechanisms.</p>



Parity hack and further dissipation of funds



<p>After the initial breach, the hackers began moving their illicit gains. Our team at Coinfirm traced seven transactions totaling 70,000 ETH moving out of the hackers’ wallet, leaving behind an unspent amount of 83,037 ETH.</p>



<p>Further tracking led us to a series of transactions involving Tornado.Cash, a renowned Ethereum mixing service. Our analysis showed that a total of 10,290 ETH was deposited into Tornado.cash, complicating the tracking process as this service is designed to obscure the origins of its transactions.</p>



Deposits to Tornado.cash



<p>Despite this obstacle, we identified 13 addresses that received the withdrawals from the Tornado.Cash 100 ETH and 10 ETH pool, corresponding to the previously deposited 10,290 ETH (minus the network and mixer fees). The analysis of these transactions can be found in the table below:</p>



Withdrawal AddressesFirst Tornado.cash Withdrawal (UTC)Last Tornado.cash Withdrawal (UTC)Number of WithdrawalsTornado.cash<br>PoolAmount Received<br>(in ETH)Address 12022-05-062022-05-069100896Address 22022-05-072022-05-079100896Address 32022-05-072022-05-079100896Address 42022-05-092022-05-109100896Address 52022-05-102022-05-109100896Address 62022-05-112022-05-119100896Address 72022-05-122022-04-129100895Address 82022-05-122022-05-139100896Address 92022-05-142022-05-149100896Address 102022-05-172022-05-179100896Address 112022-05-172022-05-189100895Address 122022-05-092022-05-103100298Address 132022-06-152022-06-1591089Total10,241<a>[1]</a>



<p>Identified Tornado.cash withdrawals</p>



<p>Upon further analysis, we observed that the withdrawn ETH was then converted into RenBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin token on the Ethereum blockchain, across two different decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



Withdrawals from Tornado.cash, Swap and deposit to RenBridge



<p>Subsequently, these RenBTC tokens were transferred via the RenBridge, a decentralized application enabling the conversion and transfer of digital assets between blockchains.</p>

<p>RenBridge cross-chain transfers</p>



<p>At this point, the cryptocurrency had been swapped back into its original form – Bitcoin, and a total of 668 BTC were withdrawn. The remaining 31 BTC was moved to an unidentified wallet, making further tracking challenging. The summary of these transactions can be seen in the table below:</p>



Withdrawals from RenBridge



<p>In conclusion, our investigation into the Parity hack provides crucial insights into the techniques employed by hackers to launder stolen funds. Our findings underscore the importance of blockchain analytics in tracing illicit funds and reinforcing the security mechanisms of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>







<p>Coinfirm is committed to providing robust blockchain analytics and pioneering investigative efforts, enabling a safer and more transparent blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is contingent on an AI strategy that takes into account the following considerations:</p>



 
 Open: It’s based on the best open technologies available 



 Trusted: It’s responsible and governed 



 Targeted: It’s designed for the enterprise and targeted for business domains 



 Empowering: It’s designed for value creators, not just users 
 



<p>Designed with these elements in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> is a new AI and data platform that empowers enterprises to scale and accelerate the impact of AI across the business by leveraging data wherever it resides. IBM software products are embedding watsonx capabilities across digital labor, IT automation, security, sustainability, and application modernization to help unlock new levels of business value for clients.</p>



<p>The watsonx&nbsp;platform has three components:&nbsp;watsonx.ai (now available), watsonx.data (now available)&nbsp;and&nbsp;watsonx.governance (expected availability in November). In this blog, I will cover:</p>



 
 What is watsonx.ai? 



 What capabilities are included in watsonx.ai? 



 What is watsonx.data? 



 What capabilities are included in watsonx.data? 



 How can you get started today? 
 



 What is watsonx.ai? 



<p>IBM watsonx.ai is our&nbsp;enterprise-ready next-generation studio for AI builders, bringing together traditional <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) and new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a> capabilities powered by <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models">foundation models</a>. With watsonx.ai, businesses can effectively train, validate, tune and deploy AI models with confidence and at scale across their enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



IBM watsonx.ai: enterprise-ready next-generation studio bringing together traditional machine learning (ML) and new generative AI capabilities powered by foundation models.



<p>By supporting open-source frameworks and tools for code-based, automated and visual data science capabilities — all in a secure, trusted studio environment — we’re already seeing excitement from companies ready to use both foundation models and machine learning to accomplish key tasks.</p>



<blockquote>

“IBM’s launch of watsonx was an awakening, and it has inspired us to deliver unprecedented innovations for our clients.”
Sean Im, CEO, Samsung SDS America
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
“In the field of generative AI and foundation models, watsonx is a platform that will enable us to meet our customers’ requirements in terms of optimization and security, while allowing them to benefit from the dynamism and innovations of the open-source community.”
Romain Gaborit, CTO, Eviden, an ATOS business</blockquote>



<blockquote>
“We’re looking at the potential usage of Large Language Models. There are huge possibilities including connecting your controls to your internal policies.”
Marc Sabino Head of Innovation, MD Citi Internal Audit</blockquote>



 What capabilities are included in watsonx.ai?&nbsp; 



<p>To help our clients take advantage of AI,&nbsp;we built a family of foundation models of different sizes and architectures, and carefully selected open-source&nbsp;generative AI&nbsp;models.&nbsp;Each IBM-trained foundation model brings together cutting-edge innovations from IBM Research and the open research community. These models have been trained on IBM curated datasets that have been mined to remove hateful, abusing and profane text (HAP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>With multiple families in plan,&nbsp;the&nbsp;first release is the Slate family of models, which represent an encoder-only architecture. These encoder-only architecture models are fast and effective for many enterprise NLP tasks, such as classifying customer feedback and extracting information from large documents. While they require task-specific labeled data for fine tuning, they also offer clients&nbsp;the best cost performance trade-off for non-generative use cases.&nbsp;These Slate models are fine-tuned via Jupyter notebooks and APIs.</p>



<p>To bridge the tuning gap, watsonx.ai offers a Prompt Lab,&nbsp;where users can&nbsp;interact with different prompts using prompt engineering on&nbsp;generative AI models for both zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting. This allows users to accomplish different Natural Language Processing (NLP) functional tasks and take advantage of IBM vetted pre-trained open-source foundation models. Encoder-decoder and decoder-only large language models are available in the Prompt Lab today.</p>



 Capabilities within the Prompt Lab include:&nbsp; 



 
 Summarize:&nbsp;Transform text with domain-specific content into personalized overviews and capture&nbsp;key points (e.g., sales conversation summaries, insurance coverage, meeting transcripts, contract information) 



 Generate:&nbsp;Generate text content for a specific purpose, such as&nbsp;marketing campaigns, job descriptions, blogs or articles, and email drafting support. 



 Extract:&nbsp;Analyze existing unstructured text content to surface insights in specialized domain areas, such as&nbsp;audit acceleration, SEC 10K fact extraction and user research findings. 



 Classify:&nbsp;Read and classify written input with as few as zero examples, such as&nbsp;sorting of customer complaints, threat and vulnerability classification, sentiment analysis, and customer segmentation. 



 Question &amp; Answering: Based on a set of documents or dynamic content, create a question-answering feature grounded on&nbsp;product&nbsp;specific content, such as&nbsp;building a Q&amp;A resource from a broad knowledge base to provide customer service assistance. 
 



<p>Our viewpoint is that a single foundation model will not be the best fit for the wide range of enterprise use cases. That’s why we’re&nbsp;initially releasing five&nbsp;open-source models as part of the Prompt Lab sourced from Hugging Face, which can also be authored by third parties. </p>



 The models being released in the Prompt Lab include:&nbsp; 



 
 mpt-instruct2 (7b – decoder only) — Supports Q&amp;A and Generate tasks 



 flan-t5-xxl (11b – encoder/decoder) — Supports Q&amp;A, Generate, Summarize, Classify tasks 



 mt0-xxl (13b – encoder/decoder) — Supports Q&amp;A, Generate, Extract, Summarize, Classify tasks 



 flan-ul2 (20b – encoder/decoder) — supports Q&amp;A, Generate, Extract, Summarize, Classify tasks 



 gpt-neox (20b – decoder only) — Supports Q&amp;A and Generate tasks 
 



Select a foundation model that best fits your needs in watsonx.ai.



<p>Subsequent watsonx.ai releases will include capabilities for prompt tuning and fine-tuning models as part of our Tuning Studio, as well as access to a greater variety of IBM-trained proprietary foundation models for efficient domain and task specialization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within watsonx.ai, users can take advantage of open-source frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow and scikit-learn alongside IBM’s entire machine learning and data science toolkit and its ecosystem tools for code-based and visual data science capabilities.&nbsp;Data scientists, data engineers, and developers can work with Jupyter notebooks and CLIs in programming languages they are familiar with, such as Python and R, to deploy the pre-trained machine learning model for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) use cases, including&nbsp;complaint analysis using tone or emotion classification, entity extraction on financial complaints, and sentiment model analysis.</p>



 Additional capabilities of our ML and data science toolkit include:&nbsp; 



 
 MLOps pipelines:&nbsp;Offers a collaborative studio for data scientists to build, train and deploy machine learning models with advanced features like automated machine learning and model monitoring. Allows users to manage their models throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. 



 Decision optimization:&nbsp;Provides the industry-leading solution engines for mathematical programming and constraint programming to solve your optimization use cases with a choice of notebook or visual programming interfaces. 



 Visual modeling:&nbsp;Delivers easy-to-use workflows for data scientists to build data preparation and predictive machine learning pipelines that include text analytics, visualizations and a variety of modeling methods. 



 Automated development:&nbsp;Automates data preparation, model development, feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization using AutoAI. 
 



 What is watsonx.data? 



<p>IBM watsonx.data is a fit-for-purpose data store built on an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lakehouse">open lakehouse architecture</a>. It is supported by querying, governance, and open data formats to access and share data across the hybrid cloud. Through workload optimization across multiple query engines and storage tiers, organizations can reduce data warehouse costs by up to 50 percent.1 Watsonx.data offers built-in governance and automation to get to trusted insights within minutes, and integrations with existing databases and tools to simplify setup and user experience. Later this year, it will leverage watsonx.ai foundation models to help users discover, augment, and enrich data with natural language.</p>



Watsonx.data is built on 3 core integrated components: multiple query engines, a catalog that keeps track of metadata, and storage and relational data sources which the query engines directly access.



<p>Whether optimizing data warehouse workloads with multi-engine support or modernizing data lakes with high performance, governance and security, we are already seeing excitement from customers using watsonx.data as a new data foundation to accelerate their AI and analytics initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMC Networks is excited by the opportunity to capitalize on the value of all of their data to improve viewer experiences.</p>



<blockquote>
“Watsonx.data could allow us to easily access and analyze our expansive, distributed data to help extract actionable insights.”
Vitaly Tsivin, EVP Business Intelligence at AMC Networks.</blockquote>



<p>STL Digital (STLD), the strategic IT partner of the Vedanta group, a global natural resources company, sees the potential of watsonx in driving the organization’s digital transformation:</p>



<blockquote>
“The power of watsonx.ai models, combined with the ability to leverage governed data in watsonx.data, enables our teams to build, train, tune, and deploy custom models at scale.”
Raman Venkatraman, CEO of STL Digital</blockquote>



<p>Watsonx.data is truly open and interoperable. It uses not just open-source technologies, but those with open governance and broad and diverse communities of users and contributors, like Apache Iceberg and Presto which is hosted by the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;Watsonx.data is also engineered to use Intel’s built-in accelerators on Intel’s new 4th Gen Xeon Scalable Processors, and uses multiple open-source query engines such as Presto and Spark. This provides for a breadth of workload coverage ranging from data exploration and transformation to analytics, BI and AI model training and tuning.</p>



<blockquote>
“We look forward to partnering with IBM to optimize the watsonx.data stack and contributing to the open-source community.”
Das Kamhout, VP and Senior Principal Engineer of the Cloud and Enterprise Solutions Group at Intel</blockquote>



<p>Watsonx.data supports our customers’ increasing needs around hybrid cloud deployments&nbsp;and is&nbsp;available on premises and across multiple cloud providers, including IBM Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Integrations between watsonx.data and AWS solutions include Amazon S3, EMR Spark, and later this year AWS Glue, as well as many more to come.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
“Making watsonx.data available as a service in AWS Marketplace supports our customers’ increasing needs around hybrid cloud.”
Soo Lee, Worldwide Strategic Alliances Director at AWS</blockquote>



<p>Integration with watsonx.data also enables existing IBM Db2 Warehouse and Netezza customers to achieve a unified view of their analytics and AI estate. The next generation of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/introducing-the-next-generation-of-db2-warehouse-built-for-always-on-mission-critical-workloads">Db2 Warehouse SaaS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-announces-availability-of-the-high-performance-cloud-native-netezza-performance-server-as-a-service-on-aws">Netezza SaaS on AWS</a> fully support open formats such as Parquet and Iceberg table format, enabling the seamless combination and sharing of data in watsonx.data without the need for duplication or additional ETL.&nbsp;Watsonx.data allows customers to augment data warehouses such as Db2 Warehouse and Netezza and optimize workloads for performance and cost. Moreover, watsonx.data simplifies the process of combining new data from various sources with existing mission-critical data residing in on-premises and cloud repositories to power new insights.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
“Building on our already existing Netezza workloads… we’re excited to see how watsonx can help us drive predictive analytics, identify fraud and optimize our marketing.”
Bahaa’ Awartany, Chief Data Officer, Capital Bank of Jordan</blockquote>



<p>We are primarily seeing customer adoption of watsonx.data across 4 key use cases:</p>



 
 AI/ML at scale:&nbsp;Build, train, tune, deploy, and monitor trusted AI/ML models for mission critical workloads with governed data in watsonx.data and ensure compliance with lineage and reproducibility of data used for AI.&nbsp; 



 Real-time analytics and BI:&nbsp;Combine data from existing sources with new data to unlock new, faster insights without the cost and complexity of duplicating and moving data across different environments.&nbsp; 



 Streamline data engineering:&nbsp;Reduce data pipelines, simplify data transformation, and enrich data for consumption using SQL, Python, or an AI infused conversational interface.&nbsp; 



 Responsible data sharing:&nbsp;Enable self-service access for more users to more data while ensuring security and compliance through centralized governance and local automated policy enforcement. 
 



 What capabilities are included in watsonx.data?&nbsp; 



<p>Our approach to an open data lakehouse architecture combines the best of IBM with the best of open source. Capabilities within watsonx.data include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Multi-cloud, hybrid cloud availability:&nbsp;Supporting both SaaS and self-managed software deployment models, or a combination of both, providing another dimension of cost optimization. 



 Presto engine:&nbsp;Incorporates the latest performance enhancements to the <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a> query engine. Presto is an open-source, fast, reliable, and highly scalable SQL query engine and is contributed to by some of the biggest companies in the world including Meta, Uber, Intel, and more. 



 Multi-engine integration: Eliminate the need to keep multiple copies of data for various workloads or across database and data lake repositories for analytics and AI use cases. Presto, Apache Spark, Db2, and Netezza engines are fully integrated with shared metadata and data storage and work off Iceberg table format to&nbsp;access and query&nbsp;a single copy of data across the multiple engines.&nbsp; 



 Open data and table format support:&nbsp;Store vast amounts of data in vendor-agnostic open formats, such as Parquet, Avro, and Apache ORC, while leveraging Apache Iceberg table format to share&nbsp;large volumes of data through an open table format built for high performance analytics. 



 Enterprise compliance and security:&nbsp;Protect data, manage compliance, and maintain trust with built in-governance, automation, and enterprise security capabilities, and fit seamlessly into a data fabric architecture with the Cloud Pak for Data and IBM Knowledge Catalog integration.  
 



Enable centralized governance and local automated policy enforcement through integration with IBM Knowledge Catalog. Here, sensitive data is automatically masked.



 
 Easy to use, integrated data console:&nbsp;Bring your own data and stay in control of your data. In a few clicks, users can connect to existing analytics environments and start deploying fit-for-purpose query engines with integrated metadata and storage through a single point of entry. Seamlessly connect watsonx.data with various object storage such as AWS S3 or IBM Cloud object storage and registered databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. 



 IBM Ecosystem&nbsp;integrations:&nbsp;Providing robust integration with IBM’s ecosystem to allow users to seamlessly realize the benefits of existing IBM investments and streamline the flow of data and information between products with seamless integration for IBM Db2 Warehouse, Netezza Performance Server, IBM zSystems, and Cognos Analytics, with DataStage, IBM Knowledge Catalog, Databand.ai, and Watson Studio integrations coming later this year. 



 Insights powered by generative AI: Later this year, users will be able to use natural language to explore, augment, and enrich data from a conversational user interface.

I'm thrilled to share more about the rich set of capabilities in LCW, including enhancements and improvements we’ve made since public preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User identity lifecycle is a critical part of an organization’s security posture, and when managed correctly, can have a positive impact on their users’ productivity for Joiners, Movers, and Leavers (JML). The ongoing digital transformation is accelerating the need for good identity lifecycle management. However, IT and security teams face enormous challenges managing the complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual processes necessary to execute the required onboarding and offboarding tasks for hundreds of employees at once. This is an ever present and complex issue IT admins continue to face with digital transformation across security, governance, and compliance. Taking a closer look at the identity lifecycle challenges we can see that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 It’s common that every employee in the organization needs access and the number of apps and the volume of data being managed has increased significantly. This is in addition to the constant increase of regulatory requirements. To keep up pace IT admins have had to rely on scripts to complete the JML processes, and troubleshooting problems is complex and time-consuming. 
 Onboarding new users involves many moving parts so reducing manual repetitive tasks to gain the right access and ensure productivity of employees on day one can be crucial to decreasing costs and securing talent in a competitive job market. 
 With cyber-crime intensifying, organizations are exposed to more security threats if accounts and access are not removed in a timely manner when employees leave or move within the organization. IT spends too much time on manual processes to add and remove resource access resulting in delays and errors which can cause compliance issues.<br><br> 
 
<p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the public preview of <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fgovernance%2Fwhat-are-lifecycle-workflows&amp;data=05%7C01%7CAlexander.Filipin%40microsoft.com%7Caacd9111cae64910c22108db3bd58e3b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638169560682825355%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=1AwFcGTh%2FvKu1NCGG2D10AwVTNOV67WONrfH7cNDIVc%3D&amp;reserved=0">Lifecycle Workflows</a>, which adds automated, enterprise-grade user lifecycle management capabilities for organizations to modernize their identity lifecycle management and help IT admins address these challenges. Since then, hundreds of organizations across the globe have tried the feature and provided feedback. We’ve updated LCW to help IT pros save even more time, reduce errors, and avoid costly delays using a simple, intuitive experience. Now they can automate and streamline repetitive joiner, mover, and leaver tasks to help new employees and those with role changes to be productive immediately. They can also ensure access is removed as soon as employees leave the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how LCW helps IT Pros automate repetitive tasks in the user lifecycle management process, saving time, reducing risks, and allowing employees to be productive faster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scenario 1: Automate the onboarding process of a new employee to be productive on their first day&nbsp; 
<p>Normally, onboarding new employees requires the manual generation of several tickets for IT to process and a set of disconnected steps that IT must complete. Often, the result is that the new employee is missing required access to apps, Microsoft Teams group memberships, initial sign-in credentials, and so on. Processing the service tickets, and potentially tracking down erroneous or missing steps, takes significant time and effort for IT admins, while also negatively impacting user productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the IT admin, you are responsible for managing this process. Using Lifecycle Workflows, you can create a custom workflow in just a few steps that, based on the employee start date, enables the user account, sends a welcome e-mail to the new employee, adds the employee to the marketing group, and creates a ServiceNow ticket using our built-in Logic Apps extensibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to make this happen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Configure a custom workflow using an out-of-the-box workflow template that fits your scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Woodgrove admin, Lisa, goes to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/overview">Entra Identity Governance -&gt; Lifecycle Workflows</a> and clicks on Create workflow to choose a built-in workflow template that fits her scenario. In this case, she chooses the Onboard new hire employee workflow template for this Joiner scenario. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select a built-in workflow template with Microsoft Entra ID Governance Lifecycle Workflows to match the right scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Basics tab, Lisa customizes the workflow name and sees the trigger event details are already configured to trigger based on the employeeHireDate attribute. With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, if desired, she could have chosen to trigger based on the user creation date instead. Trigger event details can now be customized for up to 180 days, but for this new hire onboarding scenario, the template value is configured to run on the new hire’s first day of work, so no additional changes are needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa can optionally customize the workflow further by scoping the workflow to target a subset of users in the Configure Scope tab using the collection of supported Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user properties, including OnPremises extension attributes and directory extension attributes. This allows Lisa to configure different workflows for users located in the US and Europe, if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Customize the tasks to run for the new employee on Day 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because each of the workflow templates have pre-defined tasks for the scenarios, no additional tasks are required. Admins can choose to further customize the workflow by adding additional tasks from the collection of built-in tasks for the appropriate scenario. Admins can also leverage the built-in custom task extension task that enables the extensibility to perform additional actions in Logic Apps, Microsoft’s powerful low code solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, you can now make access package assignments requests and create customized emails with your own branding including company logo and domain, custom subject, body and language as well as add additional recipients on CC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check off all the items on Woodgrove new employee checklist, Lisa adds a task to create a Service Now ticket to request a laptop delivery leveraging an existing Logic App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa can now customize the welcome email to be sent with the Woodgrove company logo, add a link to the Woodgrove new employee portal, and CC employee onboarding team members for awareness so employees know the email came from Woodgrove.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customize the welcome email for newly onboarded employees with matching company logo and accompanying details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa clicks on the Review + Create tab to review all the changes, then clicks the Enable Schedule checkbox and clicks Create to save the workflow. The workflow will automatically run based on the tenant schedule and only for the users that were auto-detected to meet the execution conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Monitor the workflow status&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every action taken by Lifecycle Workflows, including creation, updates, and processing events, are stored in the audit logs reports. Additionally, Lifecycle Workflows provides the Workflow History feature, a more granular reporting feature that allows you to quickly see what ran for who and whether it was successful. Lisa can navigate to the Workflow History of the selected workflow to check the processing status of a workflow across the user, runs, and task views for troubleshooting and compliance purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workflow History to review status of a workflow across any user for troubleshooting and compliance standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scenario 2: Automate the employee offboarding process to remove access in a timely manner&nbsp; 
<p>Another important identity lifecycle scenario is employee offboarding. There can be many different reasons why an employee needs to be offboarded e.g., retirement, separation, or leaving to join a competitor. Regardless of the offboarding reason, it’s important for IT admins to ensure these accounts are no longer active and all resource access is removed from the former employee in a timely manner to reduce security risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether the offboarding process is planned weeks in advanced, needs to happen in real-time, or is part of access clean up after the employee leaves, Lifecycle Workflows provides flexible options to automate the process with built-in leaver workflow templates for processing the separation in the timeframe that fits your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance, an IT admin for Tailspinonline, is responsible for managing the offboarding processes. Using built-in leaver templates in Lifecycle Workflows, he can save time by pre-configuring pre-offboarding, real-time separation, and post-offboarding workflows, based on his company's policies. In this case, Vance needs to quickly offboard an employee who is leaving for a competitor, so he will immediately block the employee’s access by disabling the user account and remove them from all Azure AD groups and Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to make this happen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Configure a custom workflow using an out-of-the-box workflow template that fits your scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance goes to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/overview">Entra Identity Governance -&gt; Lifecycle Workflows</a> and clicks on Create workflow to choose a built-in workflow template that fits the scenario. In this case, he chooses the Real-time employee termination workflow template for this Leaver scenario. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lifecycle Workflows includes multiple Leaver scenario templates such as Real-time employee termination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Basics tab, Vance customizes the workflow name and sees the trigger event details are already configured to trigger on demand, so no changes needed. This template offers the IT admins like Vance, the flexibility of choosing to run the workflow immediately, for the users they select or configure it now and run it later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For other offboarding scenarios, he can choose from other pre-defined workflow templates to trigger based on the employeeLeaveDateTime attribute, populated from HR systems and treated with sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Customize the tasks to run for the employee in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because each of the workflow templates have pre-defined tasks for the scenarios, no additional tasks are required. However, admins can choose to customize the list of tasks to fit their needs. In this case, Vance sees that template already has pre-defined tasks to remove the user from all groups and Teams and delete the user account. Per the company policy, the account will be deleted later as part of the post-offboarding process, so he can quickly remove the delete user account task. Then, he adds a task to disable the user account to ensure the employee is blocked from signing in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This template offers IT admins like Vance, the flexibility of choosing to select users now and run the workflow immediately or create it now and select users to run it later. From the Select users tab, Vance selects the user and clicks on the Review + Create tab to review all the changes, then clicks Create to save the workflow. The workflow will immediately start processing the users that Vance selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select multiple users, if needed, in Real-time employee termination workflows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Monitor the workflow status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance can now navigate to the Workflow History of the selected workflow to monitor the progress and see that the separation is already being processed. He can optionally choose to drill in further on the status of the individual tasks to check for issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leveraging the Real-time employee offboarding templates ensures access is automatically removed upon an employee’s departure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the real-time leaver template, Vance automated the offboarding process so that access is removed upon an employee’s departure, reviewed the history of the workflow so that he can ensure that each task in the offboarding process was completed successfully, and helped the organization safeguard its critical data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, we’ve made updates and improvements for more granular workflow execution auditing, and at any time, you can navigate to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/auditlogs">Lifecycle Workflows Audit Logs</a> or <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ERM/DashboardBlade/~/Audit%20logs">Entra Identity Governance Audit Logs</a> and check the workflow execution info and other workflow management activities.</p>

 What customers are saying&nbsp; 
<p>We got some great feedback from customers and partners like you during the previews:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“With Lifecycle workflows, Microsoft’s Entra platform adds a so far missing core Identity Governance component, to solve client’s requirement around automated JML (Joiner, Mover and Leaver) use cases. This will be a significant step forward to use Entra as the central Identity system within a client’s estate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Erik Siebler (IAM Lead, DXC)&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We were able to see the product vision of Lifecycle workflow and how this could help us to move our current Join, Move, Leave workflows from our current legacy IAM platform to Cloud native IAM solution. We already have moved a few of our workflows to Lifecycle Workflows for onboarding of our store and back office employees that include O365 licenses, SMS and Email notification to managers."&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Maqsood Ali Bhatti (IAM Lead, Elkjøp Nordic AS) </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With Lifecycle Workflows we finally can support the business of ourselves and our customers with an automated joiner and leaver process. This powerful and amazing feature helps us and our customers stay in control of the lifecycle of accounts in Azure AD and makes sure accounts are provisioned and deprovisioned automatically."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Pim Jacobs (Principal Consultant, InSpark) </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every customer is struggling with identity next management, we use logic apps, we use automation for hybrid workers and it's really cool that Lifecycle Workflows integrates perfectly with many different Azure services, and that's the very positive thing that you're already familiar with them even if you haven't used them before. And at every customer there is a massive mess with user accounts and with Lifecycle Workflows you can easily start building your identity workflows since there's definitely a lot less steps than ordering a third party identity and access management solution. This feature can be very important for us in the future."&nbsp;</p>

				  Digital Wallet Interoperability: Overcoming Challenges &amp; Embracing Ecosystem-Level Collaboration  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Let’s start by acknowledging a fundamental truth – most digital identity wallets lack interoperability. While there is some degree of interoperability in specific circumstances, the full potential of digital wallet interoperability is yet to be realized. The road ahead may be long, but understanding ecosystem-level interoperability can guide us on this journey.

				  Understanding Ecosystem-Level Interoperability 
<p>Interoperability is the seamless ability of systems to work together. In the context of digital wallets, it means users can choose any wallet to perform desired transactions. While universal interoperability may seem ideal, we should focus on enabling effective communication between digital wallets within ecosystems. This involves adhering to specific technologies, protocols, and standards unique to each ecosystem.</p>
 Different Ecosystems, Different Need for Digital Wallet Interoperability 
<p>Before addressing the challenges of achieving interoperability, it’s crucial to recognize that different ecosystems have distinct requirements and priorities. Universal interoperability across all digital wallets is simply not feasible. Instead, we should embrace ecosystem-level interoperability, allowing wallet providers to cater to specific user needs and comply with local regulations by leveraging their own technologies, protocols, and standards.</p>
 Challenges to Interoperability 
<p>While interoperability holds great potential, several challenges impede its realization. Some key obstacles that require addressing:</p>
 
 Local Variation: A significant hurdle to interoperability arises from the local variation within different ecosystems. Even within the same document type, attribute names, data formats, and other specifications can differ significantly. These inconsistencies across ecosystems impede seamless communication and interoperability. 
 Security and Trust Considerations: Digital wallets handle sensitive user information, necessitating robust security measures and the maintenance of user trust. Interoperability introduces additional complexities and potential security vulnerabilities, requiring careful coordination and standardization of security protocols to ensure the integrity of transactions and protect user data. 
 Competitive Landscape: Providers may perceive interoperability as a potential risk to their competitive advantage. Wallet providers often maintain closed ecosystems to retain customer loyalty and capitalize on their unique features or services. Achieving the right balance between collaboration and competition is crucial for fostering innovation while embracing interoperability. 
 
 The Role of Trust Registries 
<p>Trust registries will play a crucial role in enabling interoperability between digital wallets. They serve as central authorities for validating identities and credentials, and facilitating secure transactions, promoting seamless communication and trust within the ecosystem. By establishing a trusted network, organizations can leverage trust registries to verify wallet providers’ trustworthiness and adherence to security and regulatory standards.</p>
 Embracing a Connected Future through Digital Wallet Interoperability 
<p>Achieving interoperability among digital wallets requires collaborative efforts, shared standards, and technological advancements. We must recognize that while we have made significant progress, there is still work to accomplish. We can pave the way towards enhanced interoperability by establishing trust relationships through deliberate partnerships, adhering to standardized protocols, and leveraging technological advancements like Trust Registries.</p>
<p>Interoperability remains a critical goal for the digital wallet industry. Although challenges exist, we must persevere in fostering ecosystem-level interoperability. By embracing collaboration, standardization, and innovation, we can unlock the full potential of digital wallets and create a connected future that benefits users and providers alike.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In a prior episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/thinking-beyond-client-server-architectures-with-daniel-hardman/">#53</a>), Daniel Hardman and I discussed the implications of choosing different architectural models for digital identity implementations. We explored the trade-offs involved in these decisions, particularly focusing on client-server architectures. In this particular discussion with Sam Curren and Darrell O’Donnell, we planned to delve deeper into this topic, examining real-world examples and discussing specific technologies and implementations, such as DIDComm and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC)</a>.</p>
<p>Our conversation starts around a key concept: the distinction between session-based and non-session-based activities in common computing tasks. Session-based activities, such as logging into a website or participating in a video conference, involve a server establishing a session with your device. This session allows the server to remember you as you navigate from page to page or interact with other participants. On the other hand, non-session-based activities, like sending and receiving emails or downloading files, don’t involve a lasting session. Your device sends a request, the server responds, and then the connection ends.</p>
<p>We’ve been witnessing growing adoption of verifiable credentials for both session-based and non-session-based scenarios. While session-based activities typically involve you (a consumer) presenting credentials to a verifier, non-session-based activities could allow you to play different roles in the verifiable credential trust triangle. For instance, you could be a holder of credentials, but you may also wish to be a verifier, to check the integrity of an email or a file, for example. This framing is one input that can be handy when trying to determine what digital credential exchange protocol is best suited for a specific context.</p>
<p>We then delved into both identity and non-identity use cases surrounding verifiable credentials. This exploration helped us distinguish where certain specifications, such as OpenID4VC can truly shine and offer significant benefits. For example, OpenID for verifiable credentials is particularly well-suited for identity-centric use cases. It allows users to log into websites and applications using verifiable credentials, similar to how they would log in with a username and password – this makes it a natural fit for identity-centric use cases and helps eliminate passwords, something we can all agree is needed. But in non-identity-centric use cases, such as issuing a product passport from an enterprise resource planning system or manufacturing management system, something like OpenID4VC would make less sense, and we may look at DIDComm-based protocols as enablers.</p>
<p>We also noted that verifiable credentials are just one tool in our arsenal to achieve digital trust. There are other types of trust tasks that you might want to use alongside verifiable credential interactions to build trust (e.g., secure messaging, asking a trust registry). This is an important distinction. For those aiming to provide digital trust infrastructure as a public good to citizens or consumers, it’s crucial to consider tools that foster digital trust beyond a specific identity system architecture. This also means thinking about protocols that offer the flexibility to go beyond digital credential exchanges. These protocols should provide additional foundational elements of digital trust that empower citizens or consumers in interactions that extend beyond the traditional client-server model prevalent in today’s digital world.</p>
<p>An interesting point that emerged during our discussion was the comparison between DIDComm and OpenID4VC. While it might seem like comparing apples and oranges, just as you can enjoy both fruits in one snack, you can also leverage both OpenID4VC and DIDComm in the same products. OpenID4VC can be a great mechanism to obtain identity credentials, which could then help bootstrap other downstream interactions using a protocol like DIDComm.</p>
 
<blockquote><p>DIDComm and OpenID can work together. If a DID with a DIDComm endpoint is passed during an OpenID for VC interaction, it can bootstrap into something more later. Also, if there’s an existing DIDComm interaction, it can tie the context together with the interactions happening in the OpenID4VC protocols.</p></blockquote>
<p>We concluded our conversation on a note of agreement that the most important thing is meeting the customers where they’re at. This means using technologies and protocols that the customer is already familiar with and comfortable using. Since many customers are already familiar with the process of logging into websites and applications using OpenID, it may make sense to use OpenID for verifiable credentials as well. This approach can help to reduce friction and increase adoption of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick soundbite from the conversation:</p>

<p><br>Looking ahead, I’m certain that there will be more thinking, collaboration, and convergence between different credential exchange protocols like DIDComm and OpenID4VC, and I eagerly look forward to it. I hope you find this conversation as interesting and engaging as I did.</p>

We’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please!</p>  First place ($2500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xa98e504040b68e6a281fd489fcd1658df9703a91  Second place ($1500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xca27c95f0eea6a0645dd7dddac46dfa893099fd6  Third place ($1000 in OCEAN) goes to 0x9cb9a72299f715cbd58bcdf8b7fdc1107631114e  <p>In this round, we were “full anon” so people don’t have to submit their names. That’s why you see addresses (who sent the txs), and that’s&nbsp;all.</p><p>Winners will be airdropped OCEAN into their addresses on Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p> From Predict-ETH to&nbsp;_X_ <p>For months, we’ve been quietly working to morph monthly Predict-ETH competitions into something more frequent and more automated. Therefore this is the last Predict-ETH competition. Stay tuned for an announcement in the next couple weeks about what this morphs into. And keep your prediction skills&nbsp;sharp:)</p> About Predict-ETH Competition <p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p> Predict-ETH Round 7&nbsp;Setup <p>Predict-ETH Round 6 was <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predict-eth-round-7-data-challenge-is-live-9be6d7faa4a1">announced</a> in early June, 2023. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/main7.md">Round 7 README</a> guided contestants how to make their submissions.</p><p>The submission deadline was Wed Jul 5, 2023 at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions at times: Thu Jul 6, 2023 at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total).</p><p>If an address submits &gt;1 entry: the youngest is kept, and rest get nmse&nbsp;1.0.</p> Predict-ETH Round 7 Evaluation <p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must produce the outcomes that the README guides. This includes:</p><p>✅ Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT</p><p>✅ On the data NFT, set a value correctly: correct field label, correct # predictions, prediction values following correct formatting, predictions encrypted with proper encoding on judges’ public&nbsp;key</p><p>✅ Transferred data NFT to Ocean judges before the submission deadline</p><p>✅ All on Mumbai network, not another&nbsp;network</p> Predict-ETH Round 6 Statistics <p>The following table shows the NMSEs for the 25 (of 252) submissions having the lowest NMSE. If an address submitted &gt;1 entry: the youngest was kept, and rest got nmse&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>This round had some new contestant behavior. It appears that at least one contestant submitted &gt;&gt;1 entries across &gt;&gt;1 addresses. We discuss the implications below; let’s review numbers&nbsp;first.</p><p>Q: What is the number of submissions in previous rounds and&nbsp;now?</p>  Round 6 had 22 submissions; prior rounds had&nbsp;similar.  Round 7 (this round) had 252 submissions, about 10x&nbsp;higher.  <p>Q: How many unique addresses made submissions?</p>  In Round 6, 15 unique addresses had submissions. Two addresses had &gt;1 submission: one with two submissions and one with five submissions.  In Round 7, 83 unique addresses had submissions. 46 addresses had &gt;1 submission, each with 2–6 submissions.  <p>Q: how many contestants (unique humans) made these unique addresses? We can’t know for sure! But we can look for similar patterns of behavior across addresses. And we found several addresses clustering into similar behavior. For example, 15 addresses made submissions at 6 specific times: 14:56, 19:53, 18:04, 23:21, 23:52, and 23:56. Here are two such addresses:</p><p>Of the 252 submissions and 83 unique addresses, it appears that at least one contestant had &gt;&gt;1 submissions across &gt;&gt;1 addresses.</p><p>As submissions are anon-only, we don’t have a way to enforce just one submission per contestant (Sybil behavior). Correspondingly, the rules explicitly don’t forbid this. We’d been wondering when this would happen! It happened. And that’s ok. People probably wrote scripts to submit &gt;&gt;1 entries across &gt;&gt;1 addresses, ie basic automation.</p><p>This is good — we want the Ocean community to be thinking of how do automation in a prediction setting, because it’s a stepping stone to automation in trading, or automated defi protocols. And it jives with our own plans on automation in prediction and trading, including the future of Predict-ETH:)</p> Conclusion &amp; Next&nbsp;Steps <p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task — better yet, it can be monetized immediately!</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners and kudos to all participants for their&nbsp;entries.</p><p>The Predict-ETH competition is about to morph into something more frequent and automated, which we’ll announce it in the next couple weeks.

<p>The decentralized web, or Web3, has several key characteristics that differentiate it from Web2. We are moving beyond centralized platforms and walled gardens that hold users and their data hostage and are instead transitioning to a web that grants users agency - making them active participants in everything from data storage to access to distribution.</p><p>Here are seven core principles that define the decentralized web and their associated benefits: </p> 1) Decentralization <p>The obvious principle to start with is decentralization! In the decentralized web, users don't utilize a central authority to publish content or share files. Instead, they harness the power of the distributed web. </p><p>The distributed web refers to the underlying infrastructure that powers Web3, such as P2P networks, protocols like IPFS and Activity Pub, cryptography, and blockchain technologies. Utilizing decentralized tools and computing empowers users to decide how, when, and where to participate online, increasing their autonomy. It encourages user-owned identities, data, and digital assets, enabling individuals to manage and control their online presence without relying on third-party intermediaries.</p> 2) Privacy and Security  <p>Privacy is a closely-held value in the DWeb space. Users have been burned by centralized companies over and over again. From the onslaught of data breaches to the training of machine learning algorithms, users are tired of feeling violated. </p><p>The decentralized web attempts to curb this through minimal data collection, explicit and informed consent, end-to-end encryption, and cryptography. Furthermore, since there is no central server to attack in a system of interconnected nodes, it reduces the risk of single points of failure and makes it harder for malicious actors to compromise the system.</p> 3) Openness and Interoperability <p>The decentralized web promotes openness and interoperability. Open standards, protocols (like <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>), and APIs foster secure and seamless information sharing across services and apps. As a result, the Web3 user experience continues to improve and even exceed that of Web2 in some instances, and users face fewer locked doors than ever before.</p> 4) Data Ownership and Control <p>The decentralized web promotes the idea that individuals should have ownership rights over their data, allowing them to decide how and where their information is stored, accessed, and shared. Ensuring users have a <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit">credible exit</a> is vital. Distributed control and self-governance mean the decision-making power is spread across multiple participants (not one central authority), promoting a more democratic and open system. </p><p>For example, Fediverse social networks like Mastodon have individual servers run by community members. If at any time a user disagrees with the way a server is being managed, they can move their account to another Mastodon instance. </p> 5) Censorship Resistance <p>The decentralized web seeks to mitigate censorship and promote freedom of expression. By distributing content across multiple nodes, it becomes more challenging for any central authority to censor or restrict access to information. </p><p>In some countries, access to social media or information-sharing sites get blocked during political demonstrations. The intent is to stop the flow of communication and keep people in the dark, attempting to extinguish dissent. The decentralized web works against that, ensuring access remains as long as the information is available on at least one node.</p> 6) Trust and Transparency <p>Trust is a vital aspect of the decentralized web. The DWeb aims to establish trust through transparency by leveraging decentralized consensus mechanisms such as blockchain technology and <a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81">self-certifying protocols</a> like cryptographic user identifiers and content-addressed data. Furthermore, persistent data structures, like IPFS's MerkleDag structure and CRDTs, mean users can always traverse the data to get to the root of the data. &nbsp;</p><p>By making transactions and actions publicly auditable, the decentralized web fosters an environment where trust can be built without relying on central authorities.</p> 7) Collaboration and Community <p>The decentralized web encourages collaboration and community-driven initiatives. Since there is often a crossover between the DWeb and open source, it's not uncommon to see users and developers banning together to build new features and solutions. For example, Fission is leading an effort to bring <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission/contribute/ipfs-media-support-for-mastodon-48315">IPFS support for media files on Mastodon</a> on Open Collective. </p> <p>In conclusion, the development of the decentralized web seeks not to commodify its users but rather to work in concert with them, thereby fostering a more equitable balance of power and superior user experience.</p>

<p>In short, yes. When we talk about data integrity, we’re referring to the overarching completeness, accuracy, consistency, accessibility, and security of an organization’s data. Together, these factors determine the reliability of the organization’s data. Data quality uses those criteria to measure the level of data integrity and, in turn, its reliability and applicability for its intended use. Data quality and integrity are vital to a data-driven organization that employs analytics for business decisions, offers self-service data access for internal stakeholders and provides data offerings to customers.</p>



 Data integrity 



<p>To achieve a high level of data integrity, an organization implements processes, rules and standards that govern how data is collected, stored, accessed, edited and used. These processes, rules and standards work in tandem to:</p>



 
 Validate data and input 



 Remove duplicate data 



 Provide data backups and ensure business continuity 



 Safeguard data via access controls 



 Maintain an audit trail for accountability and compliance 
 



<p>An organization can use any number of tools and private or public cloud environments throughout the data lifecycle to maintain data integrity through something known as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a>. This is the practice of creating, updating and consistently enforcing the processes, rules and standards that prevent errors, data loss, data corruption, mishandling of sensitive or regulated data, and data breaches.</p>



 The benefits of data integrity 



<p>An organization with a high level of data integrity can:</p>



 
 Increase the likelihood and speed of data recoverability in the event of a breach or unplanned downtime 



 Protect against unauthorized access and data modification 



 Achieve and maintain compliance more effectively 
 



<p>Good data integrity can also improve business decision outcomes by increasing the accuracy of an organization’s analytics. The more complete, accurate and consistent a dataset is, the more informed business intelligence and business processes become. As a result, leaders are better equipped to set and achieve goals that benefit their organization and drive employee and consumer confidence.</p>



<p>Data science tasks such as machine learning also greatly benefit from good data integrity. When an underlying machine learning model is being trained on data records that are trustworthy and accurate, the better that model will be at making business predictions or automating tasks.</p>



 The different types of data integrity 



<p>There are two main categories of data integrity: Physical data integrity and logical data integrity.</p>



<p>Physical data integrity is the protection of data wholeness (meaning the data isn’t missing important information), accessibility and accuracy while data is stored or in transit. Natural disasters, power outages, human error and cyberattacks pose risks to the physical integrity of data.</p>



<p>Logical data integrity refers to the protection of data consistency and completeness while it’s being accessed by different stakeholders and applications across departments, disciplines, and locations. Logical data integrity is achieved by:</p>



 
 Preventing duplication (entity integrity) 



 Dictating how data is stored and used (referential integrity) 



 Preserving data in an acceptable format (domain integrity) 



 Ensuring data meets an organization’s unique or industry-specific needs (user-defined integrity) 
 



 How data integrity differs from data security 



<p>Data security is a subcomponent of data integrity and refers to the measures taken to prevent unauthorized data access or manipulation. Effective data security protocols and tools contribute to strong data integrity. In other words, data security is the means while data integrity is the goal. Data recoverability — in the event of a breach, attack, power outage or service interruption — falls under the realm of data security.</p>



 The consequences of poor data integrity 



<p>Human errors, transfer errors, malicious acts, insufficient security and hardware malfunctions all contribute to “bad data,” which negatively impacts an organization’s data integrity. An organization contending with one or more of these issues risks experiencing:</p>



 Poor data quality 



<p>Low-quality data leads to poor decision-making because of inaccurate and uninformed analytics. Reduced data quality can result in productivity losses, revenue decline and reputational damage.</p>



 Insufficient data security 



<p>Data that isn’t properly secured is at an increased risk of a data breach or being lost to a natural disaster or other unplanned event. And without proper insight and control over data security, an organization can more easily fall out of compliance with local, regional, and global regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>



 Data quality 



<p>Data quality is essentially the measure of data integrity. A dataset’s accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, and timeliness are the data quality measures organizations employ to determine the data’s usefulness and effectiveness for a given business use case.</p>



 How to determine data quality 



<p>Data quality analysts will assess a dataset using dimensions listed above and assign an overall score. When data ranks high across every dimension, it is considered high-quality data that is reliable and trustworthy for the intended use case or application. To measure and maintain high-quality data, organizations use data quality rules, also known as data validation rules, to ensure datasets meet criteria as defined by the organization.</p>



 The benefits of good data quality 



 Improved efficiency 



<p>Business users and data scientists don’t have to waste time locating or formatting data across disparate systems. Instead, they can readily access and analyze datasets with greater confidence. Additional time is saved that would have otherwise been wasted on acting on incomplete or inaccurate data.</p>



 Increased data value 



<p>Because data is formatted consistently and contextualized for the user or application, organizations can derive value from data that may have otherwise been discarded or ignored.</p>



 Improved collaboration and better decision-making 



<p>High-quality data eliminates incongruency across systems and departments and ensures consistent data across processes and procedures. Collaboration and decision-making among stakeholders are improved because they all rely on the same data.</p>



 Reduced costs and improved regulatory compliance 



<p>High-quality data is easy to locate and access. Because there is no need to re-create or track down datasets, labor costs are reduced, and manual data entry errors become less likely. And because high-quality data is easy to store in the correct environment as well as collect and compile in mandatory reports, an organization can better ensure compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.</p>



 Improved employee and customer experiences 



<p>High-quality data provides more accurate, in-depth insights an organization can use to provide a more personalized and impactful experience for employees and customers.</p>



 The six dimensions of data quality 



<p>To determine data quality and assign an overall score, analysts evaluate a dataset using these six dimensions, also known as data characteristics:</p>



 
 Accuracy: Is the data provably correct and does it reflect real-world knowledge? 



 Completeness: Does the data comprise all relevant and available information? Are there missing data elements or blank fields? 



 Consistency: Do corresponding data values match across locations and environments? 



 Validity: Is data being collected in the correct format for its intended use? 



 Uniqueness: Is data duplicated or overlapping with other data? 



 Timeliness: Is data up to date and readily available when needed? 
 



<p>The higher a dataset scores in each of these dimensions, the greater its overall score. A high overall score indicates that a dataset is reliable, easily accessible, and relevant.</p>



 How to improve data quality 



<p>Some common methods and initiatives organizations use to improve data quality include:</p>



 Data profiling 



<p>Data profiling, also known as data quality assessment, is the process of auditing an organization’s data in its current state. This is done to uncover errors, inaccuracies, gaps, inconsistent data, duplications, and accessibility barriers. Any number of data quality tools can be used to profile datasets and detect data anomalies that need correction.</p>



 Data cleansing 



<p>Data cleansing is the process of remediating the data quality issues and inconsistencies discovered during data profiling. This includes the deduplication of datasets, so that multiple data entries don’t unintentionally exist in multiple locations.</p>



 Data standardization 



<p>This is the process of conforming disparate data assets and unstructured big data into a consistent format that ensures data is complete and ready for use, regardless of data source. To standardize data, business rules are applied to ensure datasets conform to an organization’s standards and needs.</p>



 Geocoding 



<p>Geocoding is the process of adding location metadata to an organization’s datasets. By tagging data with geographical coordinates to track where it originated from, where it has been and where it resides, an organization can ensure national and global geographic data standards are being met. For example, geographic metadata can help an organization ensure that its management of customer data stays compliant with GDPR.</p>



 Matching or linking 



<p>This is the method of identifying, merging, and resolving duplicate or redundant data.</p>



 Data quality monitoring 



<p>Maintaining good data quality requires continuous data quality management. Data quality monitoring is the practice of revisiting previously scored datasets and reevaluating them based on the six dimensions of data quality. Many data analysts use a data quality dashboard to visualize and track data quality KPIs.</p>



 Batch and real-time validation 



<p>This is the deployment of data validation rules across all applications and data types at scale to ensure all datasets adhere to specific standards. This can be done periodically as a batch process, or continuously in real time through processes like change data capture.</p>



 Master data management 



<p>Master data management (MDM) is the act of creating and maintaining an organization-wide centralized data registry where all data is cataloged and tracked. This gives the organization a single location to quickly view and assess its datasets regardless of where that data resides or its type. For example, customer data, supply chain information and marketing data would all reside in an MDM environment.</p>



 Data integrity, data quality and IBM 



<p>IBM offers a wide range of integrated data quality and governance capabilities including data profiling, data cleansing, data monitoring, data matching and data enrichment to ensure data consumers have access to trusted, high-quality data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data/governance">IBM’s data governance solution</a> helps organizations establish an automated, metadata-driven foundation that assigns data quality scores to assets and improves curation via out-of-the-box automation rules to simplify data quality management.<br><br>With data observability capabilities, IBM can help organizations detect and resolve issues within data pipelines faster.

<p>The advent of virtual assets has brought forth considerable challenges to the financial and regulatory landscape. A pivotal analysis conducted by MONEYVAL, the Council of Europe’s anti-money laundering body, reveals that its member nations grapple with the complexity of these challenges. As indicated by the report, approximately 80% of assessed members are only partially or not compliant with the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/financial-action-task-force-fatf/"> Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </a>Recommendation 15. This recommendation is an international standard designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, specifically in the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) sector.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, Coinfirm’s <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/blog/vasp-registrations-global-analysis/">latest VASPs analysis</a> provides a unique perspective on how MONEYVAL member jurisdictions are adapting to this new digital world. Among the MONEYVAL members, Estonia and Lithuania significantly stand out in terms of VASP registrations.</p>



<p>Estonia, a member of MONEYVAL, leads the global pack with an 11.4% share in VASP registrations, according to Coinfirm, whereas Lithuania holds a 7.2% share. This notable presence in the VASP industry indicates a robust<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset </a>sector in these countries and could potentially reflect their strides in implementing effective regulations, thereby shaping the trajectory of the digital asset industry globally.</p>



<p>However, the MONEYVAL report starkly uncovers the reality that a majority of its members are still struggling to fully implement the FATF Recommendation 15. The challenges primarily revolve around accurately determining the materiality of the VASP sector and the effective implementation of licensing, registration, and regulation.</p>



<p>The Coinfirm analysis also reveals a potentially troubling misinterpretation within the VASP landscape – less reputable firms often use VASP registration as a stamp of legitimacy, misleading customers who rarely understand the distinction between registration and actual regulation. This calls for stringent oversight and comprehensive public communication in managing the industry.</p>



<p>Detecting unlicensed/unregistered VASPs has also surfaced as a key concern in the MONEYVAL report, implying an underlying gap in the system that could be capitalized on by malevolent actors. Moreover, the oversight of cross-border transactions remains a complex issue, indicating a profound need for bolstered international collaboration and data sharing.</p>



<p>The MONEYVAL report also draws attention to the underwhelming number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) received from VASPs. This finding underscores the importance of stringent regulation and supervision in heightening STR reporting awareness and volumes.</p>



<p>Technological tools for <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/blockchain-investigations/">blockchain investigations</a> play a crucial role in risk identification and assessment, with more advanced jurisdictions employing <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/coinfirm-analytics/">blockchain risk evaluation tools</a>. However, the MONEYVAL report emphasizes that reliance on these tools should not replace human analysis and expertise. The sophistication of these tools is even more critical when considering the prevalence of fraud and child sexual exploitation as underlying offences identified by VASPs.</p>



 <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report.pdf">MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report</a><a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report.pdf">Download</a> 



<p>In conclusion, understanding the interplay between regulatory landscapes and VASP registrations is essential to decipher the intricacies of the digital asset sector. The insights from both the MONEYVAL report and Coinfirm’s analysis offer invaluable direction for jurisdictions, emphasizing the need for robust regulation, increased public education, and continual development of technological tools and expertise. As the sector continues to evolve, continuous dialogue and collaboration between the industry, regulators, and law enforcement agencies will be instrumental in fostering a sustainable and secure future for virtual assets.</p>

  How Web5 is going to redefine authentication

<p></p><p>With the emergence of Web5 comes the exciting possibilities for individuals seeking more control over their online identities, data and content. With Web5, traditional authentication methods are no longer the sole means of verifying identity and ownership. Instead, users can leverage <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> to establish their digital presence while retaining full control over their data. Let's explore how this revolutionizes authentication and content ownership as we know it. </p><p>Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs, lie at the heart of Web5's identity management. DIDs provide individuals with unique and globally resolvable identifiers that are persistent and always under their control. By using a DID, users establish their online presence, similar to a username. This paradigm shift empowers individuals to manage and control their personal information, granting them the freedom to partake in various online platforms all while owning the content and data they share.</p><p>Web5 applications eliminate the need for centralized authorities to authenticate us through methods such as two-factor authentication or username/password combinations. Instead, DIDs become the foundation of trust. When users interact with Web5 applications, they present their DIDs as proof of identity. These applications can verify the authenticity of the user's DID without the need for traditional username/password authentication.</p> How It Works<a title="Direct link to How It Works">​</a> <p>Let's delve into the technical aspects of this. When you acquire a DID, it comes with a public-private key pair. Your DID can be resolved by anyone into a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#what-is-it">DID document</a>, containing your public key, similar to a username that can be copied and pasted into a login screen. </p><p>However, to prove that you are the rightful owner of the DID and it is indeed you logging in, your private key becomes crucial. Your private key should never be shared, and it allows you to generate a digital signature. Whenever you encrypt a message, it automatically carries a digital signature. To decrypt the same message, it requires either the public or private key. For example, when logging into example.com, sending a message and successfully encrypting it, the online platform will utilize your public key for decryption. If the decryption process is successful, they can confirm that you are the rightful owner of the given DID, without ever needing your private key.</p><p>With Web5 authentication, you can effortlessly create an account, free from the hassle of coming up with a new handle or hoping your existing usernames are available. Instead, you can embrace the simplicity of using your DID. Your DID becomes a personalized "username" that you can use to log into any supporting app's login screen.</p><p>Your DID serves as a URI (Unique Resource Identifier) that leads to your DID document, acting as a special hub providing a glimpse into your digital identity. Within your DID document, the application utilizes the URIs as guideposts, leading them to your <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">DWNs (Decentralized Web Nodes)</a> which store your content and data.</p><p>This user-friendly approach relieves you from the burdens of creating new content or manually downloading from one platform to upload on another. All the content to which you have granted the application access to will be readily available for the application to read/write to, simply by logging in with your DID.</p> Benefits of Authentication with Web5<a title="Direct link to Benefits of Authentication with Web5">​</a> <p>One of the biggest benefits of this is the shift in content ownership. In traditional web applications, content is often stored on centralized servers, placing it under the control of the service provider you've created an account with or you're logged into. However, in Web5, individuals maintain ownership and control over their content. When users create and publish content within a Web5 application, their DIDs are linked to that content, establishing a clear link between the creator and their work. The user's content is stored in their own datastore, a DWN, as opposed to stored on the platform they’ve logged into. This ownership grants users greater autonomy and enables them to decide how their content is shared, used, and monetized.</p><p>Another benefit is the enhanced security this type of content ownership and authentication provides. With traditional web applications, data breaches and unauthorized access are a common problem that pose a significant risk to the user and the company that holds this data. In Web5, the distributed nature of the infrastructure gives the users full ownership over their data/content that is stored and protected in their DWN. By reducing the reliance on centralized servers, where multiple people have access to a user’s data the impact of potential security breaches is lower. Empowering users to have more confidence in their online interactions.</p><p>Web5 represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of the web, redefining its landscape as we know it.

  <p>Today we announced <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraMomentSecurityblog">significant milestones for identity and network access</a>, including the news that Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is becoming Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to simplify secure access experiences for everyone, the rebranding of Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID is designed to make it easier for you to use and navigate the unified and expanded Microsoft Entra portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to assure you that your work protecting your organization, customers, partners, and the investments you’ve made in deploying Azure AD will continue uninterrupted. All configurations and integrations will continue to work as they do today, without any action needed from you. You’ll see the new name start appearing in Microsoft product experiences In August 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No action is needed from you&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can continue to rely on familiar Azure AD capabilities accessed through the Azure portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, and the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Only the name is changing&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless for you and your organization, there are no changes to any Azure AD capabilities, APIs, login URLs, PowerShell cmdlets, Microsoft authentication library (MSAL), developer experiences, or tooling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All licensing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">plans and pricing for Azure AD</a> and Microsoft 365 plans that include Azure AD remain the same, with only the display names for the licensing plans changing. The summary below provides easy mapping from our current Azure AD SKU names to the new SKU names under Microsoft Entra ID.  Service plan display names will change on October 1, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Premium P1 and P2 offers are becoming Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2, also included in Microsoft 365 E3 and E5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the new name rolls out, all Azure AD features will also move under the new name. For example, Azure AD Conditional Access will become Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, Azure AD MFA will become Microsoft Entra MFA, Azure AD single sign-on will become Microsoft Entra single sign-on, and so on. If you are a content creator, developer, or partner who needs detailed renaming guidance, please read the Microsoft Learn article “<a href="https://aka.ms/aadrebrandFAQ">New name for Azure Active Directory</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Timeline for the Azure AD name change&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s announcement kicks off a month of informing all Azure AD customers about the upcoming change. You’ll see the news on Tech Community, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Learn, and other communication channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2023, the Microsoft Entra ID name will&nbsp;start replacing the Azure AD name across Microsoft product experiences including <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">the newly upgraded Microsoft Entra admin center</a>, Azure portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, and other Microsoft commercial products, documentation, learning content, and websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect the name change from Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID to be complete across most product experiences by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why we’re changing Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been a year since we introduced Microsoft Entra as a new product family for all our identity and access products, bringing to life our expanded vision for secure access. At the time, the Microsoft Entra product family included Azure AD plus two new products—Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, a cloud infrastructure entitlement management product, and Microsoft Entra Verified ID, a decentralized identity solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added several new products into the Microsoft Entra family—Microsoft Entra ID Governance, Microsoft Entra Workload ID, and the new products we introduced today, <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FEntraMomentSecurityblog&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C041ee42008a6480fec1608db6c361992%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638222751861869262%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=yqCK2jJHQgpJKTrWV3GcRDqYuReXyuKnfMWtESxPFBA%3D&amp;reserved=0">Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. All to advance our promise to deliver a complete repertoire of solutions that provide secure access for any identity to any resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers have embraced new Microsoft Entra products while continuing to rely on our hero cloud identity product, Azure AD, that currently protects over 720,000 organizations worldwide. We see that most customers, just like <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1478082375112165122-avanade-partner-professional-services-verifiable-credentials">Avanade</a> and <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1508854534910834689-condatis-partner-professional-services-entra-verified-id">Condatis</a>, successfully deploy our new products alongside Azure AD, bringing to life our vision for unified secure access with Microsoft Entra.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unifying all identity and access capabilities under the Microsoft Entra name will make it easier to navigate and use all products and capabilities in our expanded portfolio, ensuring that you have the strongest protections for any access point.&nbsp;We’re also standardizing the use of the term “ID” for all our identity products: Microsoft Entra ID, ID Protection, ID Governance, External ID, Workload ID and Verified ID. The visual below represents the future state of Microsoft Entra portfolio once we finalize the new name roll-out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You’re an important part of this journey&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you have been with us on this journey since the earliest days of identity and access management, starting with Windows Active Directory, then embracing digital transformation and adopting our cloud identity—Azure AD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your feedback and insights guided the evolution of identity security beyond directory-based identity management to a connected global fabric of people, devices, apps, and digital workloads—all needing secure access to anyone, anywhere, at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’d like your help spreading the word about the name change and implementing it in your own experiences. If you’re a content creator, author of internal documentation for IT or identity security admins, developer of Azure AD–enabled apps, independent software vendor, or Microsoft partner, we hope you’ll use the <a href="https://aka.ms/aadrebrandFAQ">naming guidance in Microsoft Learn</a> to make the change to Microsoft Entra ID by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful for your continued partnership in building a safer world for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">recent survey</a>, we collected feedback from 1,000 consumers in the United States. The resulting report gives an extensive overview on the state of the American consumer regarding payment methods and how they prefer to interact with their financial institution.</p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>
 
 Consumers trust credentials they can control and are able to access across channels. 
 Digital card controls increase lift across physical and digital credentials. 
 
<p>We discovered that if a financial institution offers their cardholders in-app card and transaction controls, like for example the ability to set a threshold for payments or the ability to disable a card, the card is more likely to sit “top of wallet” and to become the preferred payment for e-commerce transactions.</p>
<p>More specifically, 85% of respondents said card controls in the payment app would make them more likely to choose that card as their preferred payment method. App-based card and transaction controls help cardholders take control and manage their digital and physical cards without bank staff intervention. This self-service model brings tremendous value to cardholders in terms of convenience and efficiency across card formats and, in turn, drives lift for banks.</p>
<p>With card and transaction controls, cardholders have more control over:</p>
 
 Their card: The cardholder can block and/or unblock their card. 
 Their transactions: The cardholder can allow or disable different types of transactions, like contactless, e-commerce, or magstripe payments. They also get more control over their transactions thanks to threshold alerts that they can set, and they will be notified if the limit has been reached. 
 
<p>Card and transaction controls are a unique opportunity for banks, as well. They allow them to:</p>
 
 Ensure their top-of-wallet status, both for physical and digital payment cards. 
 Differentiate themselves from the competition by giving more power and self-service capability to the cardholder. 
 
<p>Additionally, for an extra level of security, card and transaction controls allow cardholders to deactivate lost or stolen cards via the bank’s application quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>We recommend banks offer card and transaction controls that allow the cardholder to manage their card(s) on their own, via their bank app. In addition to enabling top-of-wallet status for the bank, these offerings also enhance the value proposition of the bank app itself. By enhancing the bank app with these digital card features, the app becomes the center of the relationship between the bank and the cardholder.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to share the public preview of <a href="https://aka.ms/restrictedmanagementaus">restricted management administrative units</a>, a new role-based access control (RBAC) feature in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What you can do with restricted management administrative units&nbsp; 
<p>With restricted management administrative units, you can now designate specific users, security groups, or devices in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant that you want to protect from modification by tenant-level administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some situations in which this is useful:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You want to protect sensitive user accounts, such as C-level executives, from being able to have their password or multifactor authentication settings changed by regular helpdesk administrators.&nbsp; 
 
 
 You want to ensure that certain user accounts, security groups, or devices from a specific country can only be modified by designated administrators from that country. 
 
 
 You have specific security groups granting access to sensitive data and you want to restrict who can modify the membership only to a small set of administrators. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By placing your sensitive objects in a restricted management administrative unit, your tenant-level administrators will not be able to modify them.&nbsp; Only the administrators you explicitly assign to the scope of the administrative unit itself will be able to make changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant-scoped and other admin unit-scoped administrators are blocked from resetting executives' account passwords.&nbsp; Only the explicitly designated Executive admin can manage these accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a much easier way to protect your sensitive objects than having to identify and scope every single role assignment in the tenant just to your non-sensitive objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use restricted management administrative units in your tenant&nbsp; 
<p>Here’s a quick example of how restricted management administrative units make it a breeze to secure a few sensitive user accounts in your tenant:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Under Roles &amp; admins, select Admin units and click Add to create a new administrative unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Set the Restricted management administrative unit setting to “Yes” and click Next: Assign Roles&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add the designated administrator(s) who should be the helpdesk administrators for these sensitive accounts (these are the people who you do want to manage the accounts) and finish creating the administrative unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Now, you can go ahead and add the sensitive user accounts to the restricted management administrative unit you just created (just like you would for any other administrative unit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s it!&nbsp; Now the sensitive user accounts can only be modified by the users you designated, regardless of how many other administrative roles may be assigned in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 represents a substantial shift in UK’s crypto regulation, establishing comprehensive oversight and defining the range of digital&nbsp;assets.  The Act successfully strikes a balance between security and innovation, emphasizing clarity, consumer protection, and consistent growth in the rapidly expanding UK crypto&nbsp;market.  On the flip side, the Act could also potentially stifle innovation and present compliance challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.  <p>On June 29, 2023, a key event for UK’s cryptocurrency sector took place. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/enacted">Financial Services and Markets Act 2023</a>, or FSMA 2023 for short, was officially approved by King&nbsp;Charles.</p><p>This momentous event signified a dramatic shift in the status of crypto trading, moving it from the fringes into the mainstream as a regulated financial activity in the UK. This monumental change was akin to the dawn of a new era, officially placing crypto trading under the UK’s regulatory oversight.</p><p>Why is this such a big deal? Well, it’s because this Act isn’t just another piece of legislation. It’s a whole lot more. It’s a comprehensive blueprint charting out the future course for the crypto industry in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p><p>And the real cherry on top, according to local crypto experts, is the establishment of new objectives for the heavyweight regulatory bodies — the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).</p><p>With the stage set on the importance of FSMA 2023, let’s shift our focus toward the scale of the UK’s crypto industry. By grasping the size and potential of this burgeoning sector, we can better comprehend why this Act stands to have such a profound&nbsp;impact.</p> The UK Crypto Industry: A Cursory Health&nbsp;Check <p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/uk-growing-crypto-industry-top-markets/">Reports</a> published in April 2023 predict the global crypto market to gross nearly US$38 billion in revenue in 2023. If achieved, it will be a 105% growth year-over-year.</p><p>The United Kingdom is the fastest-growing among the top five markets in the crypto space, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and&nbsp;Canada.</p><p>Studies suggest that the United Kingdom’s crypto market grew by more than 450% between 2021 and 2023. The jump in market size exceeds the United States or Switzerland by significant margins. The United States crypto market grew by 120% during the same period, while Switzerland registered a growth of&nbsp;80%.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2023, the United Kingdom’s crypto market size grew from US$0.84 billion to US$1.89 billion, a growth of more than 125%. When it comes to the volume of individual users, the number is more than 3&nbsp;million.</p><p>From all possible perspectives, cryptocurrencies occupy a significant part of the United Kingdom’s financial market landscape. And therefore, any change or shift in the regulatory provisions is met with sincere analysis, both from the providers and consumers.</p> Rules and Regulations Governing the Crypto Market in the United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The most crucial piece of regulation that would have a decisive bearing on the entire crypto market in the United Kingdom is the Financial Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The implications of this groundbreaking initiative are poised to fundamentally reshape the UK’s financial landscape, promising to redefine not only the country’s macroeconomic scene and business environment but also its interplay with the global financial order. And for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry, the implications could be profound.</p><p>A crucial part of this initiative will be restructuring the retained EU law (REUL), creating a new, comprehensive framework. This could potentially include digital asset regulations, which would directly impact the operation of cryptocurrencies in the UK, bringing about a regulatory paradigm&nbsp;shift.</p><p>The Act also seeks to recalibrate the UK’s legislative structure, particularly the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), using insights gathered from the HM Treasury’s Wholesale Markets Review. In the dynamic world of digital currencies, such a recasting of rules might prove pivotal. It isn’t just about creating rules but about crafting an efficient, responsive system that truly aligns with the nation’s financial needs, including those of the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Moreover, it will establish a robust framework for identifying and designating critical third parties. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this might involve regulatory considerations for crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and more, which are crucial to secure and facilitate transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>A key component of this transformation is the comprehensive reform of the financial promotion regime. This reform could influence how cryptocurrency products and services are marketed and offered to the public, possibly creating a more conducive environment for crypto-based innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>What’s potentially even more compelling for the crypto industry is the new mandate set for the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority). With new objectives outlined, these regulatory bodies may have an expanded role in overseeing the evolving crypto market, ensuring it operates transparently, fairly, and in the best interests of investors.</p><p>The scope of this regulation is indeed vast, with each facet potentially impacting the cryptocurrency industry. This represents a bold stride towards a comprehensive and updated financial landscape in the&nbsp;UK.</p> FSMA 2023 Implications for Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The FSMA brought in stablecoins or <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1079348/Stablecoin_FMISAR_Consultation.pdf">digital settlement assets</a>, as referred to them in the bill, within the regulatory scope and initiated them for use as a recognized payment&nbsp;means.</p><p>Notably, the bill achieved two significant things. While it proposed regulating crypto assets, it also promoted&nbsp;them.</p> The Proposed Regulation of Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK’s HM Treasury is pursuing four well-defined policy objectives in its mission to regulate crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>First, it aims to foster growth, innovation, and competition in the domestic market. Second, it aspires to enable consumers to make well-informed decisions by comprehending the associated risks. Third, the initiative seeks to safeguard the financial stability of the UK market. And finally, it’s dedicated to protecting the integrity of the UK&nbsp;market.</p><p>In pursuit of these goals, the UK government plans to keep a vigilant eye on the evolving technologies, assessing potential risks on a case-by-case basis. They are committed to ensuring the regulations do not stifle the industry’s innovative potential, preferring to intervene where the risks and opportunities are most pronounced.</p><p>Evolving Framework and Phased Implementation</p><p>Recognizing the dynamic nature of digital assets, the UK government intends to create a regulatory framework that can accommodate the rapidly developing crypto market. The process of regulating crypto assets will be phased, with the first stage already in effect since January 2022 under the AML/CFT registration regime.</p><p>This regime, aligning with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations (MLR) 2017, applies to providers offering crypto asset exchange and custody wallet services in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Expanded Regulatory Coverage</p><p>Under the new law, the government plans to extend regulatory oversight to crypto asset activities.</p><p>The FCA will ensure that promotions relating to crypto assets are clear, fair, and not misleading. Further, the government plans to regulate fiat-backed stablecoins for payments.</p><p>The second phase will introduce a broader regulatory regime encompassing trading, investment, and other high-risk areas.</p><p>Defining Crypto Assets and Compliance</p><p>The FSM Act provides a comprehensive definition of crypto assets, facilitating legal recognition and regulatory compliance. It encompasses a broad spectrum of digital assets, including exchange tokens, utility tokens, NFTs, stablecoins, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Following the FSMA’s introduction, crypto asset firms are now expected to adhere to the same financial crime standards applicable to traditional financial service activities such as&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Issuance, Trading, and Promotion</p><p>The UK government also plans to establish an issuance and disclosure regime for crypto assets and plans to treat the public offers of crypto assets <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">akin to security offerings</a> in principle. And trading platforms for crypto assets will be subject to consumer protection, operational resilience, and data reporting requirements.</p><p>Promotions of crypto assets will be tightly controlled, too. Only an authorized person can communicate the promotion or approve it if communicated by an unauthorized person. Additional promotional aspects include risk warning statements, cooling-off periods for first-time investors, and record-keeping requirements.</p><p>In essence, the FSMA serves as a comprehensive regulatory mechanism to ensure the crypto asset landscape in the UK is secure and efficient and promotes innovation.</p> The UK Regulations from a Global Perspective <p>Given their timing and nature of enforcement, it is quite natural to draw parallels between the FSMA and MiCA in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>With the European Parliament’s approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, the European Union countries are set to introduce structural governance practices to crypto firms. MiCA, apart from looking at crypto assets from AML/CFT perspectives, also aims to prevent panic selling of crypto assets that could lead to sharp falls in prices and a potential domino effect on other&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Recognizing the need for similar measures, the UK’s FSMA is also striving to carve out a clear and comprehensive regulatory landscape in the realm of crypto assets. Like the MiCA, the FSMA fosters a sense of clarity and transparency.</p><p>Both frameworks understand the increasing importance of stablecoins in the digital asset universe and aim to bring them under regulatory oversight.</p><p>Moreover, the areas of regulation don’t stop at stablecoins for either of these frameworks. Both the FSMA and the MiCA have set their sights on a wider array of crypto activities. This includes the regulation of exchange tokens and utility tokens, as well as custody activities, trading venue operations, and issuance and intermediation services.</p><p>Also, akin to the HM Treasury, the EU aims to set up a clearly defined authorization route for firms to safeguard them from AML/CFT activities.</p><p>However, there are areas of divergence between the two regulatory frameworks. The MiCA, for instance, is more comprehensive than the FSMA, as its purview extends to non-fiat-backed stablecoins, broadening the regulatory net and allowing for more comprehensive crypto market oversight.</p><p>Another distinct difference lies in the domains of advice and portfolio management. While the MiCA has sought to regulate these areas, the UK’s legislative approach, at present, has not ventured into these territories.</p><p>Both MiCA and FSMA are at nascent stages in their life cycle. Therefore, it would be premature to comment on the impact they would have on the crypto market. However, legislations often adopt best practices from each other, and the same is expected to happen in the cases of the MiCA in the EU and FSMA in the UK. Crypto regulations in the UK will likely learn from similar use cases around the world and enrich themselves with available results.</p><p>As the world of crypto-assets continues to evolve and mature, regulatory frameworks such as the FSMA and the MiCA will play a crucial role in shaping the sector’s trajectory. Their shared ambitions and unique divergences hint at an exciting, dynamic future for crypto asset regulation.</p> Conclusion Thoughts <p>As the digital frontier continues to expand, the United Kingdom is taking a decisive step into the future with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. With its bold vision, the Act reshapes the landscape of the crypto industry, nurturing an environment of transparency, innovation, and security.</p><p>While setting a new benchmark for global regulatory practices, it also opens the door to boundless opportunities. By placing the sector under regulatory oversight, the Act invites trust and stability, strengthening the relationship between investors and the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>However, it’s not a unilateral growth story. With this regulation, the UK has also taken on the mammoth task of constantly evolving with an industry known for its development speed. The Act’s success will greatly rely on the regulators’ ability to stay one step ahead, protecting investors while fostering innovation.</p><p>The interplay between the UK’s FSMA 2023 and the EU’s MiCA regulation is also a space to watch, potentially offering fascinating insights into harmonizing regulatory frameworks in a global context. As the ripple effects of the FSMA 2023 start to surface, stakeholders worldwide will be keenly watching the UK for lessons and precedents.</p><p>This legislation indeed signifies a new era, not only for the UK but for global crypto regulations as well. With it, the UK has boldly stepped into unchartered territory, setting the stage for what could be the dawn of a new epoch in the crypto universe. The world watches as the UK shapes its crypto destiny, wielding the double-edged sword of opportunity and responsibility.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Enterprises are often defined by how they deal with events that are out of their control. For example, how you react to a disruptive technology or cope with a sudden change in the markets can be the difference between success and failure.</p>



<p>Contingency planning is the art of preparing for the unexpected. But where do you start and how do you separate the threats that could do real harm to your business from the ones that aren’t as critical?</p>



<p>Here are some important definitions, best practices and strong examples to help you build contingency plans for whatever your business faces.</p>



 What is a contingency plan? 



<p>Business contingency plans, also known as “business continuity plans” or “emergency response plans” are action plans to help organizations resume normal business operations after an unintended interruption. Organizations build contingency plans to help them face a variety of threats, including natural disasters, mergers of rival companies, data loss, network breaches and sudden shifts in customer demand.</p>



<p>A good place to start is with a series of “what if” questions that propose various worst-case scenarios you’ll need to have a plan for. For example:</p>



 
 What if a fire broke out in the warehouse where you keep confidential customer records? 



 What if your top three engineers all quit at the same time? 



 What if the country where your microprocessors are built was suddenly invaded? 
 



<p>Good contingency plans prioritize the risks an organization faces, delegate responsibility to members of the response teams and increase the likelihood that the company will make a full recovery after a negative event.</p>



 Five steps to build a strong contingency plan 



 1. Make a list of risks and prioritize them according to likelihood and severity. 



<p>In the first stage of the contingency planning process, stakeholders brainstorm a list of potential risks the company faces and conduct risk analysis on each one. Team members discuss possible risks, analyze the risk impact of each one and propose courses of action to increase their overall preparedness. You don’t need to create a risk management plan for every threat your company faces, just the ones your decision-makers assess as both highly likely and with a potential impact on normal business processes.</p>



 2. Create a business impact analysis (BIA) report 



<p>Business impact analysis (BIA) is a crucial step in understanding how the different business functions of an enterprise will respond to unexpected events. One way to do this is to look at how much company revenue is being generated by the business unit at risk. If the BIA indicates that it’s a high percentage, the company will most likely want to prioritize creating a contingency plan for this business risk.</p>



 3. Make a plan 



<p>For each potential threat your company faces that has both a high likelihood of occurring and a high potential impact on business operations, you can follow these three simple steps to create a plan:</p>



 
 Identify triggers that will set a plan into action: For example, if a hurricane is approaching, when does the storm trigger your course of action? When it’s 50 miles away? 100 miles? Your teams will need clear guidance so they will know when to start executing the actions they’ve been assigned. 



 Design an appropriate response: The threat your organization prepared for has arrived and teams are springing into action. Everyone involved will need clear, accessible instructions, protocols that are easy to follow and a way to communicate with other stakeholders. 



 Delegate responsibility clearly and fairly: Like any other initiative, contingency planning requires effective project management to succeed. One proven way to address this is to create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/raci-matrix/">RACI chart</a>. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted and informed, and it is widely used in crisis management to help teams and individuals delegate responsibility and react to crises in real time. 
 



 4. Get buy-in from the entire organization—and be realistic about cost 



<p>Sometimes it can be hard to justify the importance of putting resources into preparing for something that might never happen. But if the events of these past few years have taught us anything, it’s that having strong contingency plans is invaluable.</p>



<p>Think of the supply chain problems and critical shortages wreaked by the pandemic or the chaos to global supply chains brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. When it comes to convincing business leaders of the value of having a strong Plan B in place, it’s important to look at the big picture—not just the cost of the plan but the potential costs incurred if no plan is put in place.</p>



 5. Test and reassess your plans regularly 



<p>Markets and industries are constantly shifting, so the reality that a contingency plan faces when it is triggered might be very different than the one it was created for. Plans should be tested at least once annually, and new risk assessments performed.</p>



 Contingency plan examples 



<p>Here are some model scenarios that demonstrate how different kinds of businesses would prepare to face risks. The three-step process outlined here can be used to create contingency plans templates for whatever threats your organization faces.</p>



 A network provider facing a massive outage 



<p>What if your core business was so critical to your customers that downtime of even just a few hours could result in millions of dollars in lost revenue? Many internet and cellular networks face this challenge every year. Here’s an example of a contingency plan that would help them prepare to face this problem:</p>



 
 Assess the severity and likelihood of the risk: A recent study by <a href="https://vmblog.com/archive/2023/06/20/new-research-only-9-of-global-organizations-avoid-network-outages-in-an-average-quarter.aspx">Open Gear</a> showed that only 9% of global organizations avoid network outages in an average quarter. Coupled with what is known about these attacks—that they can cause millions of dollars in damage and&nbsp;take an immeasurable toll on business reputation—this risk would have to be considered both highly likely and highly severe in terms of the potential damage it could do to the company. 



 Identify the trigger that will set your plan in action: In this example, what signs should decision-makers have watched for to know when a likely outage was beginning? These might include security breaches, looming natural disasters or any other event that has preceded outages in the past. 



 Create the right response: The organization’s leaders will want to determine a reasonable <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO)</a> for each service and data category their company faces. RTO is usually measured with a simple time metric, such as days, hours or minutes. RPO is a bit more complicated as it involves determining the minimum/maximum age of files that can be recovered quickly from backup systems in order to restore the network to normal operations. &nbsp; 
 



 A food distribution company coping with an unexpected shortage 



<p>If your core business has complex supply chains that run through different regions and countries, monitoring geopolitical conditions in those places will be critical to maintaining the health of your business operations. In this example, we’ll look at a food distributor preparing to face a shortage of a much-needed ingredient due to volatility in a region that’s critical to its supply chain:</p>



 
 Assess the severity and likelihood of the risk: The company’s leaders have been following the news in the region where they source the ingredient and are concerned about the possibility of political unrest. Since they need this ingredient to make one of their best-selling products, both the likelihood and potential severity of this risk are rated as high. 



 Identify the trigger that will set your plan in action: War breaks out in the region, shutting down all ports of entry/exit and severely restricting transport within the country via air, roads and railroads. Transportation of their ingredient will be impossible until stability returns to the region. 



 Create the right response: The company’s business leaders create a two-pronged contingency plan to help them face this problem. First, they proactively search for alternate suppliers of this ingredient in regions that aren’t so prone to volatility. These suppliers may cost more and take time to switch to, but when the overall cost of a general production disruption that would come about in the event of war is factored in, the cost is worth it. Second, they look for an alternative to this ingredient that they can use in their product. 
 



 A social network experiencing a customer data breach 



<p>The managers of a large social network know of a cybersecurity risk in their app that they are working to fix. In the event that they’re hacked before they fix it, they are likely to lose confidential customer data:</p>



 
 Assess the severity and likelihood of risk: They rate the likelihood of this event as high, since, as a social network, they are a frequent target of attacks. They also rate the potential severity of damage to the company as high since any loss of confidential customer data will expose them to lawsuits. 



 Identify the trigger that will set your plan in action: Engineers make the social network’s leadership aware that an attack has been detected and that their customer’s confidential information has been compromised. 



 Create the right response: The network contracts with a special response team to come to their aid in the event of an attack and help them secure their information systems and restore app functionality. They also change their IT infrastructure to make customer data more secure. Lastly, they work with a reputable PR firm to prepare a plan for outreach and messaging to reassure customers in the event that their personal information is compromised. 
 



 The value of contingency planning&nbsp; 



<p>When business operations are disrupted by a negative event, good contingency planning gives an organization’s response structure and discipline. During a crisis, decision-makers and employees often feel overwhelmed by the pile-up of events beyond their control, and having a thorough backup plan helps reestablish confidence and return operations to normal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few benefits organizations can expect from strong contingency plans:</p>



 
 Improved recovery times: Businesses with good plans in place recover faster from a disruptive event than companies that haven’t prepared. &nbsp; 



 Reduced costs—financial and reputational: Good contingency plans minimize both financial and reputational damage to a company. For example, while a data breach at a social network that compromises customer information could result in lawsuits, it could also cause long-term damage if customers decide to leave the network because they no longer trust the company to keep their personal information safe. 



 Greater confidence and morale: Many organizations use contingency plans to show employees, shareholders and customers that they’ve thought through every possible eventuality that might befall their company, giving them confidence that the company has their interests in mind.

<p>Breakdowns, equipment failure, outages and other shop floor disruptions can result in big losses for an organization. Production managers are tasked with ensuring that factories and other production lines are getting the most value out of their equipment and systems.</p>



<p>Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and total effective equipment performance (TEEP) are two related KPIs that are used in manufacturing and production environments to help prevent losses by measuring and improving the performance of equipment and production lines.</p>



 What is overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)? 



<p>OEE is a metric used to measure the effectiveness and performance of manufacturing processes or any individual piece of equipment. It provides insights into how well equipment is utilized and how efficiently it operates in producing goods or delivering services.</p>



<p>OEE measures the equipment efficiency and effectiveness based on three factors. The <a href="https://www.oee.com/calculating-oee/">OEE calculation</a> is simple: availability x performance x quality.</p>



 What is total effective equipment performance (TEEP)? 



<p>TEEP is also a metric used in manufacturing and production environments to measure the overall efficiency and effectiveness of equipment or a production line. It includes all the potential production time, including planned and unplanned downtime.</p>



<p>TEEP is <a href="https://www.oee.com/teep/#:~:text=TEEP%20is%20calculated%20by%20multiplying,Time%20that%20is%20truly%20productive.">calculated by multiplying four factors</a>: availability x performance x quality x utilization.</p>



 How are OEE and TEEP different? 



<p>The main difference between these two metrics is that while OEE measures the percentage of planned production time that is productive, TEEP measures the percentage of all time that is productive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important when making these calculations of time to use the right terminology. Here are a few common ways to measure time within a production context:</p>



 
 Unscheduled time: Time when production is not scheduled to produce anything (as opposed to “scheduled time”). 



 Calendar time: The amount of time spent on a job order up to its completion. 



 Total operations time: The total amount of time that a machine is available to manufacture products. 



 Ideal cycle time: The theoretical fastest possible time to manufacture one unit. 



 Run time: The time when the manufacturing process is scheduled for production and running. 
 



<p>OEE primarily focuses on the utilization of available time and identifies losses due to availability, performance and quality issues. It helps identify areas for improvement and efficiency optimization.</p>



<p>TEEP, on the other hand, provides a broader perspective by considering all potential production time, including planned downtime for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-preventive-maintenance">preventive maintenance</a> or changeovers. It aims to measure the maximum potential of the equipment or production line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OEE is typically used to measure the performance of a specific piece of equipment or a machine. It helps you understand how effectively equipment is being utilized during actual production time. OEE is commonly used as a benchmarking tool to track and improve equipment performance over time. It helps identify bottlenecks, areas for optimization and improvement initiatives.</p>



<p>TEEP is used to measure the overall performance of an entire production line or multiple pieces of equipment working together. It provides a holistic view of the effectiveness of the entire system. If you are interested in understanding the maximum potential performance of your production line, including planned downtime for maintenance, changeovers or other scheduled events, TEEP is the performance metric to use. TEEP can be helpful in production capacity planning and determining the capabilities of your equipment or production line.</p>



 How can OEE and TEEP be used together? 



 
 Start with OEE analysis: Begin by calculating the OEE for individual machines or equipment within your production line. OEE analysis helps pinpoint the causes of losses and inefficiencies at the equipment level. A digital asset management platform can provide real-time data to help with this calculation. 



 Identify bottlenecks: Use OEE data to identify bottlenecks or areas where equipment performance is suboptimal. Look for machines with lower OEE scores and investigate the underlying issues. This can help you prioritize improvement efforts and target specific machines or processes that have the most significant impact on overall performance. 



 Evaluate TEEP for the entire line: Once you have assessed the OEE for individual machines, calculate the TEEP for your entire production line. TEEP takes into account all potential operating time—including planned and unplanned downtime—providing a broader perspective on the overall performance of the line. 



 Compare OEE and TEEP: Compare the OEE and TEEP data to gain insights into the gap between actual performance and the maximum potential performance of the production line. Identify the factors contributing to the difference between the two metrics, such as scheduled maintenance, changeovers or other planned downtime. This comparison can help you understand the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the production line. 



 Address common issues: Analyze common issues identified through OEE and TEEP analysis and devise strategies to address them. This may involve improving machine reliability, procuring new equipment, integrating continuous improvement methodologies, reducing setup or changeover times, enhancing product quality or optimizing maintenance management. Implementing targeted improvement initiatives can help bridge the performance gap and maximize the overall equipment performance. 



 Track progress over time: Continuously monitor and track both OEE and TEEP metrics over time to assess the effectiveness of your improvement efforts. Regularly evaluating these metrics allows you to measure the impact of implemented changes and identify new areas for optimization. 
 



<p>By combining OEE and TEEP, you can conduct a comprehensive analysis of current equipment performance at both the individual-machine and production-line levels. This integrated approach provides a deeper understanding of performance factors, helps prioritize improvement efforts, and maximizes the overall effectiveness and efficiency of your manufacturing operations, allowing production managers to achieve higher throughput and maximum uptime.</p>

 Re:Permissioning the City — Unlocking cities’ growing underutilised spatial assets for an emergent civic&nbsp;economy <p>In recent years, various macro-level shifts, including public health crises, demographic changes, and climate risks, have had cascading effects that compelled us to reconsider how we govern, plan, and operate our cities. These changes have prompted us to question the prevailing notion of space as a mere real estate asset defined by ownership and rental agreements, urging us to explore alternative perspectives on urban&nbsp;space.</p>  What if we could foster reciprocal, stewardship-based agreements and perceive space as a foundational ‘civic’ asset capable of generating positive outcomes for the entire&nbsp;city?  How might we harness the capabilities of citizens to shape our urban environments and create opportunities for emergent uses that have the potential to revitalise our&nbsp;cities?  <p>In this article, we attempt to explore these questions of urban governance and planning as we outline our work on “Re:Permissioning the City”. This experiment in urban spatial governance is something that we have been developing in the past two years, in collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City in South Korea, along with other collaborators around the&nbsp;world.</p>  Part 1 — Context: In this part, we describe the broader context of the experiment and attempt to locate the significance of Re:Permissioning the City as a resident-led urban governance system  In Part 2 — Proposal: In part 2, we dig deeper into the different layers of the proposal, elaborating on what we call a “protocols-driven permissions system”  In Part 3 — Pilot: In the last part, we close with our plans for a pilot project in Daegu, and an open invitation to cities and organisations around the world to develop this new type of civic infrastructure with&nbsp;us   PART 1 — Context  City as an emergent ecosystem <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">Jane Jacobs (1961)</a> believed cities should function like ecosystems, prioritising diversity as a core value for urban planners. She advocated for multiple choices, opportunities, and encounters that would allow people to satisfy their diverse desires and interests. More than half a century later, in Tokyo, Japan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Tokyo-Patterns-Spontaneous-Micro-Urbanism/dp/1951541324">Jorge Almazán and Studiolab (2022)</a> explored the concept of a ‘human-scale urban ecosystem’, which emphasises light-touch urban planning that allows spontaneous and emergent spaces to&nbsp;develop.</p>Mixed-use neighbourhoods in&nbsp;Tokyo<p>Situated in the interstices of top-down modernist grids and corporate-led urbanism of the 1980s, Tokyo’s emergent spaces (located in alleyways and underneath overground train tracks) represent a dynamic urban environment of order and functionality built from the bottom-up. The conditions for emergent urbanism include urban planning and design that makes intentional allowances for organic growth, as well as affordances for micro-level interactions and relationality — think of urban residents and the spaces that they create as birds in a flock that, over time, builds coherence and order by simply responding to the movements of their neighbours.</p><p>However, current bureaucracies aren’t allowing that full emergence to&nbsp;occur.</p>Commercial buildings under threat of increasing vacancy&nbsp;rates Planning for emergence in the post-pandemic city <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, cities worldwide underwent a silent but significant transformation to adapt to the changing needs of their residents. The explosion of remote work, mixed with often higher interest rates, single-use zoning and other contributing factors, has seen a reduction in commercial space use, leaving a massive trail of empty shops, restaurants and offices in inner urban areas. Montreal has seen its <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-work/empty-office-towers-remote-work-montreal/wcm/7ab7c7f4-900f-45e3-8072-23f09cd6c20c/amp/">office-vacancy rates double from 2019 figures</a>, and the change is even more pronounced in megacities like New York City, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">the equivalent of 26 Empire State Buildings could fit into Manhattan’s empty office spaces</a> or 74,582,671 square feet. With similar trends around the world, including in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/sweden-property-crisis-deepens-with-one-of-the-biggest-landlords-on-the-brink">Sweden </a>and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-06/legoland-korea-s-default-adds-to-risks-for-nation-s-developers">South Korea</a>, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/commercial-real-estate-reset-is-causing-distress-from-san-francisco-to-hong-kong">commercial real estate market is approaching a perilous precipice</a> that requires radical reimaginings.</p><p>The office as we know it shows no sign of returning to pre-pandemic reality. Researchers are calling this phenomenon a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">“shift from vocation to recreation”</a> and that the economic futures of cities rely on embracing the opportunities opening with this transition.</p><p>At the same time, the public health risks of indoor spaces during the pandemic provoked a need for more open-air public spaces, which were used for COVID testing, vaccine distribution and emergency medical care, as well as permitted small-scale civic activities. With strict social distancing rules in place, cycling, walking and personal mobility devices replaced public transportation. Several cities in Europe saw the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/covid-19-change-cities-public-transport-work-from-home-lockdown-aviation-social-distance-overpopulation/">expansion of cycling and pedestrian infrastructures</a>, which became permanent after the pandemic and outdoor seating areas in restaurants and cafes became a common feature. During this time, concepts such as ‘15-minute cities’ emphasising the all-inclusive, walkable, healthy, sustainable and pleasantly dense neighbourhoods were embraced by mayors around the world from Daegu to&nbsp;Paris.</p><p>As cities implemented measures to limit inbound travellers and in-person social interaction, life in the city underwent a dramatic change. In Barcelona, the quiet streets of COVID-19 — devoid of tourists, offered a glimpse of what had been overlooked in the business-as-usual mode of the city. Shortly after pandemic measures began, citizens published an open letter to the mayor called the “<a href="https://manifiesto.perspectivasanomalas.org/en/manifiesto-2/">Manifesto for the reorganisation of the city after the COVID-19</a>”, which included new demands for (re)naturalising the city, decommodifying housing, reorganisation of mobility, and degrowth.</p><p>At the heart of this request is a collective desire for communities to be able to shape the city they are a part of and prioritise other indicators of well-being and sustainability over economic interests. One of the suggestions in the manifesto, the reappropriation of streets for children’s play as opposed to “artificially organising dedicated play areas”, is a good example of bottom-up, light-touch planning that allows for emergence. It reflects a growing desire for a radically different utilisation of the city — one that privileges ‘play’ over&nbsp;‘work’.</p><p>In the context of the post-pandemic (and mid-pandemic) reorganisation of urban space outlined above, we began an experiment called “<a href="https://www.permissioning.city">Re:Permissioning the City</a>” in collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City in South Korea. Developed initially as a proposal for the <a href="https://www.daegu.go.kr/english/index.do?menu_link=/icms/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do&amp;menu_id=00000844&amp;bbsId=BBS_00131&amp;nttId=517463">Bloomberg Mayors Challenge in 2021</a>, the concept has since developed further in conversations with various cities around the world. In short, Re:Permissioning the City is a citizen-led governance and permissions system which interrogates how we use, manage and share urban&nbsp;space.</p><p>It takes as a starting point the numerous vacant and underutilised spaces that opened up due to the pandemic and larger demographic and industrial restructuring, with the intention to aggregate and unlock them for civic uses. Core to this concept is the light-touch, flexible, and multi-use planning approach by the local government that permits citizen-driven, creative appropriation of space. Enabling this new capacity of the city is a new governance model operated through a digital system that facilitates autonomous decision-making around when and how a space can be used, for what and by whom. In the following parts, we will describe in detail how this system would be organised in terms of functions and design principles, and illustrate its significance as it attempts to build upon the existing legacy of experiments in temporary use, meanwhile spaces and tactical urbanism.</p> PART 2 — Proposal  Protocols-driven permissions system <p>When we first began exploring the concept of a not-for-profit <a href="https://www.hel.fi/en/decision-making/grants-and-premises/book-a-space">‘Airbnb-like platform’ for publicly owned space</a> in Daegu with the local government, municipal administrators were very keen on the idea of digitising and automating the permission process. In the case of Daegu, leasing a (publicly-owned) space involved lengthy bureaucratic processes that involved multiple departments across neighbourhoods, districts and city levels. In other words, procedures for temporarily renting a space in a public park differed from a room in a community centre or a stage in a traditional market, and streamlining the process required a new kind of central authority.</p><p>Our challenge was then to push the thinking further from a centralised, government-operated permission system to envisioning distributed, community-driven permissions. After a series of workshops with civil servants and communities to design the blueprint of the permissions system, we have identified the following design questions to take forward as we develop and test&nbsp;further.</p><p>Protocols for a self-governing space: How can the system facilitate new governance of urban space that is based on discursive (as opposed to coercive) practices of collaborative rule-making and trust-based compliance? How can we encourage a culture of stewardship towards shared urban assets that goes beyond traditional rental or ownership agreements?</p>  Spatial protocols for governing the use of&nbsp;spaces  The permissioning space  Human-machine feedback&nbsp;loops  Towards a protocols-driven governance  <p>Measuring spatial outcomes: How can the system encourage the repurposing of spaces to drive positive (neighbourhood/city) outcomes? Specifically, how can we develop the tools to measure, monitor and aggregate the spatial impact of civic activities in the city — impact that is aligned with the city’s larger objectives?</p>  Linking spatial data to city-wide strategies  Potential use&nbsp;cases   Protocols for a self-governing space <p>A common practice regarding the management of publicly-owned spaces is that they are ‘governed’ by public authorities and ‘managed’ by local entities, which can range from district or neighbourhood-level government entities to non-profit organisations entrusted with the responsibility. This means that the purpose of such spaces is pre-determined by certain policies or mandates of the government, and often through a lengthy public procurement process, an entity will be assigned to operate and manage the space for a specific period of time. This was a significant pain point in the case of Daegu, as it posed a barrier to aggregating available spaces and centralising their permissions. Also, on the part of the local entity, the selective procurement process carried significant ethical and administrative burdens.</p><p>The idea of a self-governing, demand-driven space enabled by flexible planning regulations (mixed-use, light-touch) appealed to civil servants and citizens alike. It allowed civil servants to be unburdened by the responsibility to select who gets to manage and operate the space and citizens the ability to shape the use of spaces based on their changing needs. However, for such a concept to be used in practice, many layers of standards and mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure accountability, transparency, safety, and fairness. Below we describe how these layers can be defined and organised.</p><p>Spatial protocols for governing the use of&nbsp;spaces</p>  General standards<br>Taking inspiration from London’s <a href="https://www.hackneynights.co.uk/">Hackney Nights venue accreditation scheme</a>, which sets out a new standard for nighttime spaces based on inclusivity, safety, well-being, and sustainability, and accredits venues that follow these standards, Re:Permissioning the City system will also aim to set certain general standards that govern the listing of spaces in order to lower thresholds to entry. In effect, the system will serve as a verification tool that filters spaces that adhere to certain standards and principles in a given&nbsp;region.  Site-specific standards<br>Each space is embedded in its unique and relational context — spatial histories and stories, physical conditions, materialities, users, neighbours, historical uses, and possibilities for the future. The unique conditions that make up the characteristics of a space form certain ‘site-specific standards’ that determine how the space can be accessed and used, by whom and for what purpose. These standards act as a kind of profile that is unique to each space. As spatial data accumulates over time, based on activities and its users, it will serve as a form of digital spatial memory that influences the decisions that are made about the space, including permissions for&nbsp;access.  Community standards<br>As space stewards, citizens agree to community standards, including codes of conduct, shared principles and values that make explicit the behavioural standards and responsibilities of civic actors engaging with the&nbsp;space.  <p>The permissioning space</p><p>These three layers of standards form what we call the ‘permissioning space’ or ‘contracting space’. This is both a discursive space where negotiations occur and a decision-making space where micro-contracts are easily signed electronically to enable the use of spaces. Clauses in this micro-contract are formed from the standards described above, but these are continuously evolving through the iterations made through peer-to-peer nudging, negotiation and validation. There are numerous ways to test how this permissioning space can operate. Currently, we are exploring the use of a conversational chatbot that takes on the character of the space and functions as an interface between itself and the&nbsp;users.</p><p>Human-machine feedback&nbsp;loops</p><p>Standards and shared protocols require an important additional step, which oversees compliance and enforcement of said standards. New developments in sensing and monitoring technology and the ability to record and distribute real-time feedback may enable a different kind of compliance model that is more automated and autonomous, as opposed to top-down, analogue and penalty-based systems. Imagine noise, air, and light sensors in the space, monitoring and auto-adjusting for the optimal well-being of its occupants and neighbours. Peer-to-peer feedback systems, such as digital social ‘nudges’ and ratings, as well as shared incentives for repair and maintenance, can also help with voluntary compliance and collective care/stewardship of spaces. A new type of spatial compliance system that ensures the sustainability of public spaces would need to be balanced and make use of both machine and human capabilities.</p><p>Towards a protocols-driven governance</p><p>In a nutshell, Re:Permissioning the City is an experiment in technologically assisted collective governance and regulation. We are particularly interested in exploring how ‘rules’ and ‘rule-making’ can evolve and adapt to a complex system that requires flexibility and responsiveness in the design of our societal structures.</p>  The existing ‘rules-driven’ governance system operates on predefined rules set by a central authority such as the government. Rules are meant to be applied universally, and the system struggles to make allowances for ambiguity and emergent alternatives that fall within the grey areas of regulation.  The second step in this gradual transformation is what we call ‘parametrics-driven’ governance, which takes advantage of technology to allow more flexibility and adaptability. Instead of a simple yes/no or right/wrong equation, real-time sensing technologies allow us to collect and analyse situational data and thus enable conditional permissions based on a degree/parameter of tolerance. Rules are still predefined and set by a central authority, but they are governed with a higher level of shared risk assessment and tolerance through the aid of technology.  The third and most ambitious model of governance — one that we hope to test through the system, is a ‘protocols-driven’ model. Here, a set of rules — “protocols” — are defined and iterated in a distributed way by multiple stakeholders, including human and more-than-human agents.  <p>Underpinning this, an expansive tech stack, which includes data registries that document and validate various identities, rights, and provenance, allows us to compute the interdependencies of each agent — be it a human, a stray cat, or a window in a building. Protocols do not function to control or limit the agents but serve to discover optimal conditions of mutual&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>A key question in this experiment is how the system can enable a different kind of relationship between spaces and the people using them. Beyond ownership and rental agreements, beyond the capitalist logic of perceiving space as real estate assets holding speculative market value — can we foster reciprocal, stewardship-based agreements and see space as a foundational ‘civic’ asset with the potential to produce positive civic outcomes?</p> Measuring spatial&nbsp;outcomes <p>One of the most commonly cited challenges of temporary and transitional uses of vacant spaces is the need for continuity and scalability. The dynamism created through these uses tends to dissipate with the turnover of its users and, ultimately, with the end of the time-limited lease. So for Re:Permissioning the City we posed the question — how can the impact and the values created through civic activities in space be measured, and each legacy of use be archived and built&nbsp;upon?</p><p>Linking spatial data to city-wide strategies</p><p>Measuring spatial outcomes involves a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Energy consumption, footfall, indoor air quality, noise levels, number of activities hosted and participants attended are some of the easier indicators that can be measured using sensors and platform metrics. Space users’ feedback, social media posts, and a pattern of activities and users can also be fed into the impact analysis. These site-specific data points (informing site-specific standards described above) would be combined with existing social and economic indicators (such as crime rates, and loneliness index) to form part of a larger impact evaluation metric connected to city-wide strategies and objectives.</p><p>Imagine if we could better account for the mental health benefits of a particular space, or a cluster of spaces in a neighbourhood. This data could validate the public value of spaces, helping to ensure the sustainability of spaces and encourage further investment. (See more on our thinking on commons-based investment <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/financing-city-transitions-a-public-civic-deep-code-innovation-challenge-9f2ef55b4bda">here</a>)</p><p>Spatial outcomes and patterns of civic activities aggregated on a neighbourhood level or city level could inform future urban planning as well, serving as a core data set of a city’s urban space and the micro-level activities that take place within it. In effect, this could mean that spatial permissions can be granted based on iterative feedback. In the future, we hope that the data aggregation and analytics provided by the digital system, linking ‘space’, ‘people’ and ‘civic activities’ can become an integral part of the city’s collective intelligence, helping to measure impacts and contribute to developing new types of indicators of wellbeing, resilience, and sustainability of a city. (Read more about our work on developing new community-led indicators <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">here</a>)</p><p>Potential use&nbsp;cases</p><p>Below is a compilation of potential uses that could be unlocked by Re:Permissioning the City. It is important to note that these examples are merely indicative, as the diverse potential of spaces will emerge through the creativity of people reappropriating the city to their own needs, desires, and&nbsp;hopes.</p> PART 3 — Pilot  Pilot sites <p>The Re:Permissioning the City concept can be applied in various contexts of vacancy and underutilisation, and in the case of Daegu, we have found that it aligns well with the City’s existing strategies around urban regeneration. As an attempt to salvage historic buildings in the old inner city from demolition, the City’s Urban Bureau has committed significant funding over the next 20 years to acquire sites of historical significance. Among these buildings is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBubsxUChj4">‘Muyeongdang(무영당)</a>’, the first department store in Daegu, opened by a Korean entrepreneur under the 1930s Japanese colonial government. The place served as a cultural hub for many young intellectuals and artists of the day, selling books, and hosting poetry readings and art exhibitions. In the same neighbourhood is another modernist building that served as a place of refuge for artists and literati fleeing from the Korean War of the 1950s, called ‘Kotzari <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZEPHVOlQEY">Dabang(꽃자리다방)</a>’. These two buildings have been selected as potential sites for testing the Re:Permissioning the City concept in the real world. Taking into account the rich cultural history of these sites as a refuge for creative minds, the City hopes to enable more young people to make creative use of these spaces through Re:Permissioning the City. In the upcoming pilot, we will be working with local artists and cultural groups to build and test the foundational parts of the permissions system, including shared protocols and compliance systems.</p> Next steps <p>Many areas still require further thinking and development, for instance, defining the boundaries and units of spatial permission — should it be by square metres, or rooms, buildings, or virtual boundaries drawn with geofencing technology? How do we deal with data governance and privacy if we install sensors in spaces and use digital platforms to generate analytics about a space? How can we operationalise and enable self-compliance, deliberation and conflict resolution?</p><p>We are also actively exploring ways to ensure that protocols for a self-governing space can reflect the diverse interests of more-than-human agents, such as bees, cats, plants, microbiomes and of course, the space itself. Learning from past experiments in temporary/meanwhile use and tactical urbanism, we also acknowledge the importance of designing for long-term viability, so developing new kinds of civic business models and incentive structures will be a critical area that needs more&nbsp;work.</p><p>Despite uncertainties and unknowns, we believe that this is a critical moment for cities to explore and experiment with civic technologies that centre civic capabilities/capacities, democratising the way we plan and use our cities and demonstrating how public space, as one of many civic assets, can be harnessed for an emergent civic&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The Re:Permissioning the City project team at Dark Matter Labs is actively looking for new partnerships with organisations and governments with an appetite for exploring and testing the core instruments. While the contexts of each city are unique, we hope that Re:Permissioning the City can serve as a common technological infrastructure that can be shared across cities and enable compound learning and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, supporting the development, and/or doing a system pilot in your city, please contact&nbsp;us:</p><p>🇰🇷: Eunji Kang (<a href="mailto:eunji@darkmatterlabs.org">eunji@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇰🇷: Eunsoo Lee (<a href="mailto:eunsoo@darkmatterlabs.org">eunsoo@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇨🇦: Jonathan Lapalme (<a href="mailto:jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org">jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇫🇷: Theo Campbell (<a href="mailto:theo@darkmatterlabs.org">theo@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇬🇧: Chloe Treger (<a href="mailto:chloe@darkmatterlabs.org">chloe@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: Adam Purvis (<a href="mailto:adam@darkmatterlabs.org">adam@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)</p><p>This blog is written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunjikangsin/">Eunji Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tteslee/">Eunsoo Lee</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanlapalme/">Jonathan Lapalme</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-treger-6a6bb47b/">Chloe Treger</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocalvin/">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-campbell/">Theo Campbell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indy-johar-b440b010/">Indy&nbsp;Johar</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4">Re:Permissioning the City — Unlocking cities’ growing underutilised spatial assets for an emergent…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As a leading financial group in Spain, CaixaBank has long been an innovator by taking a technology-first approach by placing innovation, digital transformation, customer experience and sustainable banking at the forefront of its strategy. The bank reportedly serves 20 million customers and is a country leader in digital banking with more than 11 million customers.</p>



<p>For years, the bank has been part of IBM’s growing ecosystem of financial institutions and technology partners leveraging IBM Cloud for Financial Services to help deliver more improved customer services and products better tailored to each individual customer’s financial needs. CaixaBank is continuing its initiative to increase cloud absorption. With reporting more than 200 billion transactions at the end of 2022, CaixaBank understands how critical it is to scale securely, increase operational efficiency and accelerate time to market to optimize digital banking experiences—all while safeguarding customers’ data.</p>



<p>This week IBM opened the doors to our latest Multi Zone Region (MZR) in Madrid, Spain, designed to help European companies accelerate their modernization journey. The MZR can help deliver resiliency, performance and security to help clients leverage hybrid cloud and AI solutions in a secured environment. Furthermore, IBM Cloud’s operations in the MZR in Madrid, Spain uses a network of data centers backed by 100% renewable electricity.</p>



<p>We spoke with Pere Nebot, Chief Information Officer of CaixaBank, on how IBM Cloud has served as a catalyst for digital transformation as the bank strives to integrate simplicity into its innovation to build products and services that financially empower its clients.</p>



<p>The digital transformation journey can be challenging to integrate new platforms and applications quickly and seamlessly, especially with increasing security complexities and evolving regulatory and compliance standards. How can financial institutions overcome these challenges to build trusted and established digital brands that deliver the experiences that customers need?</p>



<p>CaixaBank focuses on improving the flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of its IT infrastructure, an approach which enables us to improve cost efficiency, potentially diversify outsourcing, reduce time-to-market, increase timing of versions, and become more resilient.</p>



<p>For example, the bank successfully and reliably completed the largest technological integration in the history of the Spanish banking system with its merger with Bankia in 2021 – all without any service interruption. This was a milestone that involved the migration of 10.4 petabytes of information in less than 24 hours, and the digitalization of more than 2,500 million documents, as well as setting a capacity to manage up to 29,000 transactions per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to infrastructure, we know any system downtime has real-world consequences and costs. During an integration process, data can be in transit in multiple places, ultimately making it vulnerable to fraud and other sophisticated cybersecurity schemes. Cybersecurity pressures will always be present, and therefore, financial institutions need the right ecosystem of partners to seamlessly help navigate these challenges and build trusted platforms and services that are beyond the boundaries of a traditional bank. These partners must also be compliant as the financial services industry is inundated with stringent regulatory laws. Leveraging IBM Cloud for Financial Services provides the built-in security and compliance controls for us to host applications and migrate mission critical workloads in the cloud with confidence and improve operational efficiencies to provide seamless and frictionless customer experiences.</p>



<p>We view the next chapter of digital transformation as harnessing the combined power of hybrid cloud and AI to help drive growth and performance in an industry landscape rife with new and nimble digital competitors. How is CaixaBank leveraging both technologies to successfully integrate and execute simplicity into innovation?</p>



<p>CaixaBank and IBM have been working together for over a decade to help drive new solutions for the banking industry with a goal of increasing speed for processing a large number of transactions in an open, secured, and scalable environment. To accomplish this, we need to continue to maintain the highest levels of operational efficiency to successfully deliver an ecosystem of products, services and hyper-personalized experiences tailored to each customer’s financial needs. It is important to remember that simplicity means making decisions easier for our customers, which leads to generating more engagement with them.</p>



<p>Our collaboration with IBM has helped us combine our current technological infrastructures with an updated environment that helps evolve core business applications with cloud and artificial intelligence. We developed one of the first virtual banking assistants created in Europe. Built with IBM Watson, the AI-based virtual assistant manages millions of client conversations each month, handling tasks such as helping bank employees quickly obtain relevant detailed information about new client offerings and assisting mobile customers via chat with day-to-day queries.</p>



<p>The IBM Cloud Multizone Region (MZR) is a key milestone to keep offering our customers the best user experience we can, while maintaining the highest levels of information confidentiality and protection.</p>



<p>CaixaBank’s IT company, called CaixaBank Tech, also serves as a key enabler for digital transformation. CaixaBank Tech incorporates most of CaixaBank Group’s specialized technology and systems teams to help facilitate the attraction and retention of internal and external talent.</p>



<p>Financial institutions and its stakeholders have focused more attention on climate change, thrusting sustainability requirements even more firmly into the spotlight. Sustainability strategies must be impactful and realistic. How is CaixaBank mobilizing sustainability efforts to help its clients transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy?</p>



<p>CaixaBank has roots in delivering social impact for the benefit of society through its mission in helping customers improve their financial well-being. The bank has developed a Sustainable Banking Plan, which includes proposals to solve sustainability challenges such as inequality, climate change and unemployment.</p>



<p>CaixaBank aims to mobilize €64 billion in sustainable finance by 2024, including financing and growth in mutual funds, pension plans and sustainable intermediation. In the first year of the plan’s life, the mobilization rate has increased by 27%, from €18.53bn in 2021 to €23.58bn in 2022.</p>



<p>The bank has also set the goal of reducing the electricity holdings in its portfolio by 30%, and the absolute emissions financed by the oil and gas sector by 23% by 2030. Currently, these two sectors as a whole account for 70% of global emissions.</p>



<p>CaixaBank views cloud as a valuable asset in accelerating sustainability transformation. Unification of the bank’s dedicated private clouds is also helping the bank not only reduce operating costs and work in a more agile way, but also improve its energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>Flexible work arrangements and accelerating digital transformation changed the way we secure access. Traditional network security approaches just don’t scale to modern demands. They not only hurt end user experience but also grant each user excessive access to the entire corporate network. All it takes is one compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to access and laterally move anywhere inside your network, exposing your most critical assets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legacy network security approaches are no longer sufficient&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you adopted modern access solutions for your organization, you still need to integrate and manage multiple identity and network tools as neither identity nor network security controls alone can protect all access points. But if you use disconnected tools, some critical integration points can be missed. Skilled adversaries often exploit seams between solutions. Organizations need an easier, more agile approach to protecting access to all applications and resources. The new networking model we’re introducing today will transform the way you secure access.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’ve <a href="https://aka.ms/BlogEntra">announced two new products</a>: Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access. With Identity and Network Access solutions working together, organizations don’t need to spend time deciding which tool would work better for each app, or how to bridge the policies your identity team created with the policies your networking team created. You can now configure unified identity and network controls with Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra. </p>

<p>You can connect any end user, application or external resource, and internal IT systems through a cloud-delivered, identity-centric network access solution. This cloud service provides agility, is easy to manage, and proves cost effective, when compared to legacy on-prem systems, so you don’t need to sacrifice user productivity to get best-in-class security controls. This model is built on Zero Trust principles. It helps to verify each identity and uses risk-based context, giving users access only to applications, resources, and destinations they need to do their job. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Internet Access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access is an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for SaaS apps and internet traffic that protects against malicious internet traffic, unsafe or non-compliant content, and other threats from the open internet. For example, you can block access to all external destinations for your high-risk users or non-compliant devices except self-service password reset pages. It also extends the conditions of Conditional Access with network conditions. This would prevent, for example, a stolen access session token from being replayed by requiring a user to be on a “compliant network” to access resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also has unique capabilities for Microsoft 365, including Universal Tenant Restrictions, to prevent data exfiltration to other tenants or personal accounts including anonymous access, near-real time threat detection, higher precision of the risk assessment on user, location, and device, and more seamless access to Microsoft 365 apps. Internet Access can be deployed as a main solution or side-by-side with other SSE solutions, and integration opportunities will be offered via a new API in Microsoft Graph. Traffic can be acquired using either cross OS from end user devices or IPsec tunnels from remote networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Access for Microsoft 365 scenarios and the Windows client are now in public preview. Internet Access for all traffic, cloud firewall, threat protection and support for all other OS types will be available later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to all internet, SaaS, and Microsoft 365 apps and resources with an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Some of you may be familiar with Application Proxy in Microsoft Entra - thousands of customers use it to access private web apps today. We’re excited to introduce an even better solution: an identity centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution that shares the same application connectors but offers so much more, to help organizations simplify and secure access to any private resource, port, or protocol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access, users can quickly and easily connect to private applications, no matter where the user is – in the office or remote - and regardless of where the application is hosted – a local on-premises data center or in any public cloud. You don’t need to make any changes to those applications or resources to add another layer of security controls such as multifactor authentication (MFA), device compliance check, identity protection, identity governance, and single sign-on to any TCP/UDP-based application, including SSH, RDP, SAP, and SMB file shares and other private resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using attribute-based Conditional Access policies, you can now create simple policies to more effectively target groups of applications based on the sensitivity of the application for the enterprise. Examples of such policies include requiring MFA, device compliance, low user risk, compliant network for highly sensitive applications, or even specific per application Conditional Access policies. With deep integration with Conditional Access and Continuous Access Evaluation, you can enable secure, seamless access with modern authentication in front of legacy auth protocols such as Kerberos or NTLM without changing legacy apps. Private Access is now in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to all private apps and resources, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution&nbsp; 
<p>Together, Internet Access and Private Access, coupled with our SaaS –security-focused CASB – Microsoft Defender for Cloud apps - comprise Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution. This solution integrates deeply with broader Microsoft’s security portfolio and enables an open partner ecosystem, so it also works with your existing network and security solutions. Internet Access and Private Access share the same agent, which works across operating systems and provides consistent connectivity across devices and networks. You can enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions with any application or website, regardless of which IdP the application uses and without changing those applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric security service edge solution. Enforce unified Conditional Access controls that simplify network access security and deliver a great user experience anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>. The global network connects our Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/">data centers</a> across 61 Azure regions with more than <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/global-network/#features">185 global network POPs</a> and a large mesh of edge-nodes strategically placed around the world, enabling organizations to optimally connect users and devices to public and private resources seamlessly and securely. Currently, Microsoft’s SSE solution is available in a select set of locations in North America and Europe, with additional locations to be added throughout the course of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the introduction of our SSE solution, Internet Access and Private Access enable customers to secure access with a unified, identity-centric approach to any application, resource, or destination, using user identity, device compliance, application, and now new network compliance as conditions. This is an easy way to unify and centralize all your access policies and strengthen them with continuous access evaluation.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>One of the ironies of decentralized identity is that while it radically simplifies data sharing and verification, it does so by way of new and mostly unfamiliar technical terms. Most people will never need to know the meaning of any of these terms, they will simply enjoy the seamless benefits, privacy protection, and security that the technology delivers; but as this technology is increasingly deployed, a quick lexicon of essential concepts and terms will help businesses and organizations get a better grasp of the digital transformation now on tap.</p>
<p>Distributed Ledger</p>
<p>Imagine that every time you wrote something in a special notebook, the exact same note appeared in a dozen other notebooks in a variety of different places. If you lost your notebook, you’d still be able to access an exact copy of what you had written. If you tried to change what you wrote (or someone with access to another notebook tried to change what you wrote), the note, the record, would break — and everyone could see that it was broken.</p>
<p>Turn that notebook into a database and that’s what a distributed ledger is: a network of ledgers for recording information in a way that creates a consensus about that information. As there are multiple copies of the one ledger in different locations, we say it is “distributed” or “decentralized” (in contrast to holding information on a single, centralized database).</p>
<p>A distributed ledger provides transparency (everyone can see what you’ve written), immutability (you can’t change what you’ve written), and resilience (there are multiple copies of what you’ve written). Information written to a distributed ledger is often described as a “write to the ledger” or a “record” or a “transaction.”</p>
<p>Blockchain</p>
<p>A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger. It assembles records into time-stamped blocks&nbsp; that are chained together chronologically through an encrypted hash, hence a “blockchain.” This block is validated and duplicated on multiple ledgers. All this happens rapidly. Blockchains are constantly adding new blocks.</p>
<p>If you try to alter information in one block, the encrypted hash changes and the chain breaks. If you try to enter new information between blocks, the chain breaks. To alter a blockchain on one ledger, you would have to successfully hack and alter all the blocks at once. But then that blockchain would be out of consensus with all the other copies of the ledger. You would then have to persuade every other copy of the ledger that your altered copy was the correct copy. This is not impossible but it would be exceptionally difficult to do — and orders of magnitude more difficult than stealing a password and accessing a conventional database.</p>
<p>While all blockchains use distributed ledgers, not all distributed ledgers are blockchains. Similarly, while blockchain found its first application in supporting Bitcoin, where it is used to record and validate ledger transactions (a process which allows new Bitcoin to be created or “mined”), not all blockchains are cryptocurrency blockchains or need the energy-intensive mining functionality. Blockchain-based distributed ledgers used for decentralized identity can be used to issue millions of identity credentials with just one write to the ledger, while verification requires no more energy than a web search.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>In Web 2.0, your digital identity is the product of multiple user accounts, usernames, and passwords, all of which are tied to centralized databases. Some of these digital identities are federated, meaning you can use your identity across multiple sites (e.g., your Facebook or Google account can be used to access different sites). All these digital identities are leased, meaning you don’t own them, the identity provider owns them. In exchange for an identity, we share our personal data with the identity provider and often the right of the provider to use that data to track our behavior online. The advertisements that follow us across multiple sites are a common example of this data surveillance in action. At the same time, the security risks that come with this way of managing identity are considerable: stealing usernames and passwords has become a major source of identity fraud requiring ever more complex systems for managing security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity replaces centralized and federated ways of doing identity. It allows us to prove who we are without a third party cross-checking our personal data or passwords against information it already stores. Instead, cryptographic information about our digital identity credential is written to a distributed ledger and that information is able to definitively prove the source of the credential (i.e., who issued it) and that the personal information held in the credential hasn’t been tampered with. It may be easier to grasp decentralized identity by what it sets out to achieve:</p>
 
 You can hold personal data without anyone else having access to it. 
 You can consent to share that personal data (either wholly or selectively) and be able to share that data in ways that enable maximal privacy. 
 Someone else can verify your data without a direct integration between their database and the database belonging to the issuer of the credential (which is a complex and expensive process). 
 This can all work on mobile devices in a simple, seamless way that is “transport agnostic” (which is to say isn’t dependent on any one communications channel) and which effectively means your phone can host an API (only better than an API). 
 
<p>To understand the mechanisms by which all this works requires understanding the interplay between credential issuers, decentralized identifiers, digital signatures and cryptography, verifiable credentials and distributed ledgers, and holders and verifiers. That’s a lot to take in! And it’s one of the reasons people struggle to “see” how decentralized identity works from reading about it; there are a lot of unfamiliar concepts and components working together simultaneously to deliver multiple benefits. The good thing is that it’s a lot easier to see decentralized identity in action than it is to read about it, so if interested, we recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPmfkO3WaIo&amp;list=PL3LvHy3eIPsmqmOFTCxjtFAMMJSL6wCMB&amp;index=42">watching this video</a> on its application in finance, which has a&nbsp; demonstration of what using a digital credential looks like.</p>
<p>Still, it’s helpful to have a quick review of some of the components.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Issuer, Holder, Verifier</a></p>
<p>There are three roles in decentralized identity: those who issue credentials, those who hold them and present them to —&nbsp; those who verify them. Each of these roles has its own dedicated software for issuing, holding and presenting, and verifying. We refer to this software as an “agent” — as it acts on your behalf and in your interest. Agent software can be mobile or cloud based so, for example, you would use a mobile agent in a digital wallet application to receive, store, and present credentials. If you don’t have a phone, you would use the web to access a cloud agent that would execute the same responsibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCCatllgNv4">Verifiable Credentials</a></p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are digital credentials that are cryptographically signed. This signature means you can prove their integrity, that they haven’t been altered, and their source (i.e., the authority that issued them). A verifiable credential is similar to a physical identity credential, such as a driver’s license or passport. But the verifiable credential has specific digital benefits compared to other kinds of digital ID: In addition to being able to authenticate the source of the credential and determine the integrity of the information in the credential, the credential and its information can be shared over an encrypted, authenticated communication channel. This adds another layer of security because it means that the person or entity you are interacting with can only be the source of the credential they’ve presented.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that verifiable credentials aren’t just about proving conventional identity; they are much more expansive: anything that can be given an identity can share data in a trusted way — as long as that information can be sent via a credential. This means devices and machines can be authenticated for sharing important data.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</p>
<p>Decentralized Identifiers or DIDs&nbsp; are a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">open web standard</a> approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enable verifiable, decentralized identities. If a device has an IP address and a website, a URL or web address, the digital identity of someone or something begins with a unique DID. Technically, a DID is a URI (a uniform resource identifier), meaning it identifies some resource.</p>
<p>What makes DIDs different from IP addresses and URLs is that anyone with agent software can create one: they are not leased from a third party or controlled by a centralized organization (as emails and user accounts are), hence they are decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of DIDs that can be created, and this means that there is no need to reuse them for sharing verifiable credentials. DIDs also create their own communications channel, known as DIDComm for direct, peer-to-peer communication between DIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s as if you were able to create a unique email address for each email, send it across a direct, encrypted communications channel to each recipient, and the recipient could verify that it came from you — all independent of an email provider. This means that interactions between DIDs are non-correlating, which has important security implications.</p>
<p>DIDComm is a powerful way to manage complex information flows as it enables people with mobile devices to fully participate in seamless, secure digital interaction (currently impossible, as APIs cannot interact with mobile devices or be used by people).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a></p>
<p>Web3 denotes what many people see as the next iteration of the internet, which will include decentralization technologies and token-based economics in an effort to provide more scalability, privacy, and data security for the end user.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>A cryptocurrency is any currency designed to be exchanged over computer networks with no central authority over the currency. Often built on blockchain technology, these currencies use a decentralized system to verify that both parties have the funds they claim to when completing a transaction, and records the transaction so anyone can verify.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a></p>
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique identifiers used to certify the&nbsp; ownership and authenticity of an asset. NFTs are different from crypto currencies because they reference specific digital files, for example 1 bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin, but 1 NFT is not the same as any other NFT.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Trusted Digital Ecosystem</a></p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem describes parties interacting with each other using verifiable credentials. Parties issue, share, and verify high-value data in a direct, secure, and privacy-preserving way that enables the data and its source to be trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystems remove the need for direct integrations between different data systems, avoid the need for third parties to store personal data, enable mobile devices to function as highly secure APIs, and transform how we create and manage digital relationships.</p>
<p>This list is by no means comprehensive, but we hope it gives you a good starting point. If you have specific questions or would like to learn more please feel free to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team.</a></p>

<p>In July 2023, the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) published a comprehensive report titled “The crypto ecosystem: key elements and risks.” This report sheds light on the key components of the crypto ecosystem, identifies structural flaws, and emphasizes the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Let’s delve into the main highlights and risks outlined in the BIS report.</p>



 Key Elements of the Crypto Ecosystem 



<p>The report begins by discussing the rise of cryptocurrencies, noting their global spread and the involvement of various investors. In theory, cryptocurrencies aim to provide decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems, relying on anonymous validators instead of central bank money and trusted intermediaries. The growth of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/decentralized-finance/"> decentralized finance (DeFi) </a>within the crypto universe further aims to replicate conventional financial services.</p>



<p>However, the report reveals a significant divergence between the crypto vision and reality. It highlights the presence of new centralized intermediaries in the crypto ecosystem, including exchanges. These intermediaries have played a crucial role in fund allocation and management within the crypto universe. The report argues that despite the claims of decentralization, crypto and DeFi often exhibit substantial de facto centralization, which introduces potential vulnerabilities.</p>



 Structural Flaws and Risks 



<p>The BIS report identifies several structural flaws and risks within the crypto ecosystem. These include:</p>



 
 Fragmentation and Congestion: The report highlights the inherent fragmentation and congestion within the crypto ecosystem. Lack of standardization and coordination across different platforms leads to inefficiencies, higher fees, and slower transaction processing times. 



 Stablecoins: Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to a specific asset, introduce risks due to the search for a nominal anchor. These stablecoins rely on the credibility of central bank-backed currencies and may impact monetary sovereignty. 



 False Decentralization Claims: Despite claims of decentralization, the report emphasizes the presence of centralized intermediaries that challenge the notion of true decentralization. This introduces concerns around accountability, regulatory compliance, and concentrated power. 



 Risks within the Crypto Ecosystem: The report notes various risks associated with cryptocurrencies, such as fraud, hacking, vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure, and risks related to smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). 



 Risks in DeFi: DeFi platforms, which aim to provide financial services without intermediaries, carry their own risks. These include code vulnerabilities, governance challenges, and potential losses for participants. 



 Interconnectedness with Traditional Financial System: As the crypto ecosystem becomes more intertwined with the traditional financial system, risks like money laundering, terrorist financing, and impacts on financial stability need to be closely monitored and managed. 



 Risks to Emerging Market and Developing Economies: The report emphasizes the importance of considering risks specific to emerging market and developing economies. These risks include potential capital flight, limited access to financial services, and the impact on monetary policy and exchange rates. 
 



 Addressing the Risks 



<p>The BIS report acknowledges the need to address these risks and suggests options for mitigation. It emphasizes the importance of robust governance frameworks and regulatory compliance measures to foster a safer and more sustainable crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>The BIS report on the crypto ecosystem provides valuable insights into the key elements and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and DeFi. It highlights structural flaws resulting from fragmentation, false claims of decentralization, and the risks posed within the crypto ecosystem. Addressing these risks will be crucial for ensuring the long-term viability and stability of the crypto market.</p>

<p>Breath in, Breath out. Another <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> has come and gone.</p><p>Held at Camp Navarro in <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/northern-pomo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Northern Pomo Territory</a>, DWeb Camp is something between a celebration and a caucus. “Conference” doesn’t really sum it up. Five days at an immersive woodland camp, hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and attended by the best minds of the distributed web, is a special time. “The work” is not at DWeb Camp, it’s back at our organizations, deep in our codebases, and with our communities. The relationships, the cross pollination, the alignment between projects, policies, and people? That’s DWeb Camp.</p> Why DWeb Camp? <p>DWeb Camp is an opportunity to support and build with the broader distributed web community. From conversations with Tim Berners-Lee to learning from the DWeb Fellows about the actual needs of communities, DWeb Camp makes us and our work better. A testing ground for ideas, this event marks progress towards a web truly built for all.</p>DWeb Camp Volunteers and Build Crew at the opening of camp. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. How we Showed up <p>Holochain came to DWeb Camp with an aim towards collaboration. Many of us have our own pet projects for saving the world, but what we can agree on is that a better world is possible. Working with humility, and in cooperation, we want to build the relationships needed to walk in that direction. As a sponsor of DWeb Camp it was important to us not to be overbearing, or to push a particular agenda, but rather to partner with the Internet Archive and DWeb community in order to host a fantastic, experiential week.</p><p>At the same time, we talked to a lot of people about Holochain, showed and asked people to try Holochain apps, connected folks to our work, and held space for deep questioning.</p> Panels, Talks, and Workshops <p>Participation was a big theme of how we held space at DWeb. Every event we hosted invited the community to speak, ask questions, or get their hands onto the technologies and ideas.</p><p>Co-founders Art Brock and Eric Harris-Braun held a fishbowl on the Grammar of Intelligence which explored the evolution of complex adaptive systems as they relate to AI, sensemaking, and coordination. The fishbowl format sets up four chairs in the middle of the room, one of which must always remain empty. This arrangement invites participants to sit in the empty chair, requiring someone else to step out, encouraging a participatory conversation where anyone has the opportunity to be heard. Thank you to those who took the chance in the hot seat and joined the conversation.</p><p>Paul d’Aoust and Collin McClain held a workshop titled Thinking Differently: How do distributed patterns affect the way we do things? Building from a design exercise that helped illuminate the relationship between our technical tools and the social effects of our innovations, they pointed to the need for a new toolbox of distributed patterns.</p><p>On Saturday, the last full day of the conference, the event transformed into a series of emergent sessions, where anyone could propose and hold sessions on anything they wanted. During this, the Holochain team and our community held six separate, intimate sessions. We opened with The What, Why, and How of Holochain, an audience question focused panel discussion between Ferananda Ibarra, Art Brock, Mary Camacho, and Collin McClain. Throughout the rest of the day we held a rolling Hands on Holochain session where we let DWeb participants try out and use Holochain apps. Simultaneously Zacchaeus Scheffer (a tiny machine learning expert), Holochain dev and trainer Guillem Cordoba and a group of other participants, worked through possible Designs of Distributed Machine Learning with Private Data; Paul d’Aoust and Michael Dougherty held a Holochain Under the Hood AMA; Eric Harris-Braun ran a Holochain Dev Session; and Mary Camacho and Matt Schutte discussed how to Build Businesses with Holochain.</p><p>Outside the Holochain team, community projects ran wonderful sessions such as <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Neighbourhoods</a> demonstration of their Distributed Groupware Framework and <a href="https://trustgraph.net/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Harlan Wood’s</a> talk Trust Graphs in the Age of AI: Privacy, Sovereignty &amp; Collaboration, both on Thursday.</p>DWeb Camp was honored by the music of the <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Del Sol Quartet</a>. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. Emergence <p>One reason we went to DWeb Camp was to break things — often called stress testing. The distributed web community has been building fantastic technologies in the last few years, but the situations in which we need this tech to work are not always readily available for testing at scale. And so DWeb Camp decided to shut off the connection to the internet for the day and focus on the implementation of peer-to-peer technologies in the real world. Running solely on the local meshnet, Holochain and many other projects brought technologies for people to use in this environment. We want to build things that work out in the real world, with real people, who have actual problems, and so we need tests and challenges that mimic those contexts to get there. </p><p>Folks from the Holochain team as well as volunteers from the community worked for months building the Emergence app, specifically to support Saturday’s emergent sessions. We are planning another blog in the coming weeks that will explore the technical hurdles we faced and the lessons we learned, but we want to call this a success in terms of the leaps forwards for both development of Holocahin apps and what we learned about using a Holochain app in the world when trying to solve real problems. </p><p>We had more people than ever before log in to a Holochain application at once, this while working entirely off a local network. Running multiple team and community tests over the week, we saw the improvements and challenges with the system we custom designed for DWeb Camp. Our prototype wasn’t perfect, but it broke in fantastically informative ways. </p><p>We appreciate the community of DWeb Camp for being on this adventure with us. This new pattern of testing and using peer-to-peer apps ‘in the wild’ feels like a massive win for the DWeb community, and one that we hope will be continued into the future.</p>The DWeb Camp Fellows passed a flame of hope around the amphitheater during the opening ceremony. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. Community and Growth <p>The Holochain community showed up in force at DWeb Camp with eight team members and over twenty-five community members, making us perhaps the best represented project in attendance. Connecting with our community was a key goal of Holochain’s at this event. As a distributed team and an even more distributed community, we don’t get a lot of face time. It’s our intent to always work with our community and to create a healthy ecosystem of both builders and users, but we recognize that this is tough without clear spaces for that to happen within. DWeb Camp both provides an incredible example of community nurturing in action and acts as an opportunity for us to connect with many of the people building a more distributed web.</p><p>We are also growing our capacity for community development. If you haven’t seen our recent announcement W<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-head-of-developer-relations/">elcoming our New Head of Developer Relations Mark Franks</a> to the team, we encourage you to read it and to hear his remarks on meeting our team and community at DWeb Camp.</p><p>Beyond our immediate community we found allyship with others across the distributed web, digital identity, Web3, and more. We see the need for policy work in these spaces and the importance of collaboration with other aligned projects to achieve real change. </p><p>We are excited for what the future of the distributed web holds. There is more to say about how we do that work and what next steps look like, but that will have to wait for another article.</p><p>In the meantime…</p>Group photo taken on the last day of camp. Now reconnected to the internet we turned to reconnect with the world. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. Thank You! <p>Thank you. To the Internet Archive and particularly Wendy Hanamura; to the DWeb Camp volunteers, fellows, and staff; to the Holochain and DWeb communities; to the builders and the dreamers. Thank you for another year of magic, in the woods where we celebrate and in the world where we live.</p>

 Ubisecure and VerifyVASP announce partnership supporting LEI adoption for VASPs and non-individual entities ahead of new FATF regulation. 
<p>LONDON, UK, &amp; SINGAPORE – 11th July 2023&nbsp;– RapidLEI by Ubisecure, the leading issuer of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), has announced an exciting new partnership with Singapore-based RegTech solutions provider, <a href="https://verifyvasp.com/">VerifyVASP</a>. The venture makes VerifyVASP the first Travel Rule solution provider to become a Validation Agent (VA). The collaboration will enable VerifyVASP to quickly and seamlessly obtain LEIs for their Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) clients, using RapidLEI’s automated issuance technology.</p>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has set comprehensive standards for AML/CFT regulations, which are then adopted by regulators worldwide for enforcement in the respective regions. As part of the FATF Recommendations, Recommendation 16 pertaining to the Travel Rule was introduced to mitigate the AML/CFT risks associated with Virtual Asset transfers. The Travel Rule mandates VASPs to to obtain, hold and submit required and accurate originator and beneficiary information for all VA transfers.</p>
<p>Some countries have begun to adopt and enforce the Travel Rule. There have also been global calls for accelerated enforcements globally, leading to the European Union (EU) approving the recent Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation &nbsp;and Transfer of Funds Regulation which mandates the Travel Rule. VASPs, otherwise referred to as Crypto Assets Service Providers (CASPs) in the EU, are expected to comply within approximately 1.5 years.</p>
<p>Within some of these regulations, the LEI will be required for non-individual entities that are the originator or beneficiary in Virtual Asset transfers. The LEI is also anticipated to support counterparty due diligence between VASPs – another key requirement in several regulations.</p>
<p>By becoming a Validation Agent, VerifyVASP, who is a leading global Travel Rule solution provider, can streamline the issuance of LEIs to its members, facilitating improved counterparty due diligence. It will also assist members with the issuance of LEIs to their non-individual customers, fostering increased adoption of LEIs ahead of the EU regulations coming into force. This will drive broader adoption of the LEI across the entire Virtual Asset industry, globally, for international transfers.</p>
<p>RapidLEI’s API offering enables automated LEI issuance and management. The API enables VA capabilities to be integrated directly into partner applications easily, supporting new and innovative LEI use cases. VerifyVASP will use the LEI as one of the key organisation identifiers in its platform. This LEI use case showcases the value of the LEI in identifying players of virtual asset transactions and facilitating Travel Rule implementation.</p>
<p>Shihyun Chia, CEO of VerifyVASP, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Travel Rule is effectively a messaging protocol that would require data standards, taxonomies and industry best practices for effective frictionless compliance. The adoption of LEI as prescribed by regulations such as the TFR would be a cornerstone in achieving this. Additionally, LEI would also facilitate the identification and verification of counterparties in establishing counterparty or correspondent relationships between VASPs/CASPs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Hudson, Director of Channel Sales at RapidLEI, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“LEIs are increasingly becoming part of regulatory requirements across multiple industries, with over 300 regulations already requiring LEIs in some capacity. Our partnership with VerifyVASP will increase adoption of LEIs for VASPs ahead of the MiCA and Transfer of Funds Regulation mandates. We are eager to support their work to implement LEIs in and around RegTech and Travel Rule solutions.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a revolutionary force in several fields, transforming industries and increasing efficiency. Its impact, however, is not restricted to good applications. AI has also found its way into the hands of cyber attackers, allowing them to exploit weaknesses, launch targeted attacks, and evade traditional security measures more effectively. Certainly, AI can help attackers just as easily as it can help defenders.</p>
 How is AI used by attackers? 
<p>Cyber attackers that use AI may exploit system and network weaknesses with unparalleled precision. Attackers can rapidly detect holes in defenses using advanced algorithms and Machine Learning (ML), allowing them to execute targeted attacks that maximize their chances of success on their probes. Besides, AI provides cyber attackers with sophisticated capabilities for bypassing traditional security barriers. Attackers can use AI to build evasion strategies that resemble genuine user behavior, making it more difficult for security systems to discern between regular and malicious activity. This behavior makes it difficult for defenders to detect and respond against cyber-attacks led by AI.</p>
<p>If attackers have the correct tools, manipulating an AI system can be simple and easy. AI systems depend on the datasets used to train the models, and any minor modifications might gradually bias AI in the wrong direction. Changing input data can easily cause system failures and expose vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, cybercriminals can employ reverse engineering to obtain access to sensitive datasets used to train AI systems. Once it happens, they can do almost anything. Data is stored in many forms (values, text, image, audio) and the use of this data could contribute to malicious purposes, for instance,&nbsp; deepfakes. By accessing data such as images, videos and voice, cybercriminals could create fake content to post on social media, which propagates the news rapidly, and this could create disinformation, attracting users to click on phishing links. This is a common practice nowadays. In a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/the-triple-threat-ai-ethics-bias-and-deepfakes-in-cybersecurity">recent blog post</a>, we have discussed the risk of bias in AI.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, AI is very powerful, and can also be used by cyber-attackers to scope and locate weak applications, devices, and networks in order to scale their social engineering attacks. This is possible due to the capability of AI to easily detect behavioral patterns and identify personal vulnerabilities, making it simple for hackers to locate opportunities to obtain sensitive data.</p>
 Is everything lost? 
<p>Exploiting vulnerabilities, automating attack lifecycles, and evading standard security measures demonstrate the potential of AI for cyber attackers. AI holds enormous promise for defenders, assisting in threat identification, incident response, and predictive threat intelligence. Alexei Balaganski, lead analyst at KuppinerCole approaches this topic in depth, referring to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/ai-and-cybersecurity-a-new-hope-for-cyber-defenders">the use of AI for cyber-defenders</a>.</p>
<p>The landscape looks a bit hostile, but there is always light at the end of the tunnel. The rise of AI technologies is not something bad. Contrarily, AI is a major technology breakthrough. It opens an immense number of new opportunities that will make the work of cybersecurity specialists easier.</p>
 A new journey 
<p>In the light of cyber-attackers using AI to create and deploy new methods of assault against organizations, the best way to combat hostile AI programs is to utilize AI against them as well, but always having human supervision. It is important to remember that generative AI cannot be as creative as a human, and that is simply because it is a machine that uses supervised and unsupervised models to process the data and produce outcomes. In this sense, it seems like fighting AI with AI is a good solution. But it is not all about AI, human experts are necessary in this battle. Moreover, methods such as biometrics, use of multifactor authentication, and password management can help to boost cybersecurity. Lastly, the common sense of experts must be heard, and this would prove, once again, that AI is not here to replace humans, but to augment their ability and efficiency, including in cybersecurity.</p>

 <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2-0-a-decentralized-infrastructure-for-web3-4c1e63b597d">Aergo 2.0 WHITEPAPER</a>  Major Updates  Stage1. Broader Implementation/adoption (Q3-Q4&nbsp;2023)   Composable Transactions  EVM Support (Phase&nbsp;1)  <p>Aergo will be scaled using composable transactions, which batch transactions and executions together to reduce transaction costs and time for end users. Composable transactions will also help developers to utilize more advanced features as they can execute several contracts within one or fewer transactions.</p><p>Aergo mainnet will be able to run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. Along with composable transaction features and EVM support, Aergo will not only achieve scalability but also a great user experience with faster and cheaper transactions for both end users and developers.</p> Stage 2. Web3 Expansion (Q4 2023 — Q2&nbsp;2024)   Computing Hub  dApp Ecosystem  Aergo DeFi  <p>In order to expand the Web3 ecosystem, Aergo will provide crypto-native features including a computing hub, and DeFi. Aergo’s computing hub will enable end users to run and developers to build Web3 applications in the cloud. High-volume users, developers, and enterprises will benefit from the hub as it provides easy-to-scale, high-fidelity solutions for blockchain adoptions in Web3 sectors. Furthermore, Aergo will introduce enhanced liquidity and token utility to its ecosystem by releasing a suite of on-chain DeFi services.</p> Stage 3. Road to AI/ML (Q1&nbsp;2024)   New Smart Contract&nbsp;Language  <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have become practical for everyday usage. Aergo technology can enhance the robustness of the AI and ML models by bringing several benefits including data security, data acquisition, operational visibility, audit trails, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Aergo integration with AI and ML will be visible sooner than expected as Aergo’s fundamental language Lua is being used by <a href="http://torch.ch/">Torch</a> which is a computing framework with comprehensive support for AI and ML algorithms. By integrating TensorFlow Lite to Aergo mainnet, developers will be able to utilize trained models within smart contracts directly.</p> Ongoing and Completed Projects  1) Entertainment (Q1&nbsp;2024)   Aergo-based NFT Marketplace: An NFT market will be the foundation of the entertainment-oriented blockchain solution. We are in the process of building a market environment where NFTs linked to the entertainment company’s various IPs including songs, characters, and goods can be traded. Fan-created and fan-driven content will also be curated and minted as NFT on the Aergo blockchain, establishing a ‘Reverse-NFT’ market environment.  M2R(Meta to Real) or W2R (Web3 to Real) to connect various IPs/goods to the Web3 environment: Aergo-based NFTs and SBTs will revolutionize the fan goods market by building a fan engagement platform with the notion of M2R or W2R. The company’s IPs and fan-created content will be implemented in games, dApps, and&nbsp;more.

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here with Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer. Mike, it’s been a heck of a quarter, a lot of busy activity. I haven’t talked to you in a while, but we do have a new white paper on our website, and this is about a topic that’s come out quite a bit about overcoming the resistance to passwordless multifactor authentication. So I wanted to take a few minutes to talk to you about this. Can you tell us a little bit about passwordless, the feature or the shiny object, if you will, versus the task of getting an organization to go passwordless across the enterprise? Seems to me there’s a little difference there. Can you shed some light on that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Sure. Yeah. It’s great to be here again. The term passwordless is not clearly defined. In fact, at the conference a few weeks ago, I put up 10 definitions that you can get of the first 10 places you look, and they’re all different. People will call emailing you a magic link passwordless. But it’s important to start with the objectives. We want to get rid of passwords because they’re bad, they’re stealable, and the number one cause for breaches. But we also want to fix a broken user experience. We have customers that hate logging in, employees that hate coming to work, and it’s not about just getting rid of a password in a system somewhere. It has to be done with a holistic plan across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Well, that leads to the very second question I was going to ask you, which is the mini edge cases, authentication edge cases around the enterprise. How important is it to get your arms around these versus, for the sake of discussion, just duct taping passwordless onto one or two systems?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. No, the reality is you can get rid of, I’d say, 80% of your passwords if you target the heaviest used systems. And in an organization, they are your remote access, your operating systems and your SSO gateway, paying Okta, ForgeRock, Azure AD. And so you start there. You just do remote access and that’s a major point of friction because typically they’re using secure ID tokens and it’s where the bad guys would try to get in first. So you start there, but you do need a plan to cover that remaining 20%, otherwise you actually introduce more friction. And so it starts with a holistic inventory. Here’s the 12 ways that people have to authenticate today. Prioritize them and go after them. It’s pretty straightforward, but for some reason, people will start with one feature on one platform and go after that.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Oh, okay. So you’re saying we don’t kind of tiptoe into this with some lightly used systems. It’s not a big bang, but we’re going to dive into some of the heaviest used systems and go passwordless there. So how do you do that? What’s a simple way of doing that without risking business disruption?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so there’s a couple strategies we have. One is we have a term called coexistence, and you don’t do a big bang changeover on any system. For example, when you hit that remote access portal, you’ll have a path for users to do it the old way and do it the new way, and it’s usually split that black and white. Here’s the new stuff, use your modern identity software like 1Kosmos, and here’s the old way. Maybe you haven’t gotten there yet, or you’re having problems, or you’re one of those 8% of users that refuse to use a phone or whatever it is. You have to handle exceptions, edge cases and a gradual rollout. So coexistence is one strategy, and the other is self onboarding. So let users learn about it and come to a portal and say, “Sign me up.” And the way we do that is we have them authenticate one last time the way they do today, prove who they are from the company’s standards, and then enroll into a modern identity based authentication system. So those are two strategies that make it can really go viral if you do that right.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That makes sense. I mean, give the user or employees, so to speak, an option to do it at their own, I guess, appetite.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
That’s right.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So I know that we’ve worked with a handful of companies that have tried passwordless and failed and we’re kind of coming in and helping to reenergize that initiative. Can you talk a little bit about the egg on your face moment when you’ve kind of tried to do it, it failed? How do you go about recovering from something like that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Most times it fails because they didn’t take user experience into consideration, so if you try rolling something out that’s worse than what it is today from a user experience. And that could even be the enrollment was too painful, you couldn’t get it done. There’s security considerations as well. Does my system create a security vulnerability by maybe storing something on the workstation, something secret? We’ve seen that happen to some of our competitors, and that excludes them from the race before they even get to the starting line. So yeah, there’s a number of really important factors that we’ve learned, and we love sharing those in RFPs and things like that.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
When you do a passwordless project, what’s the ultimate success indicator? How do you know that you’ve done your job or you’ve done it well?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, there’s a handful of metrics that you can use to get that high five moment from your peers in the C-suite. And the one is, there’s a clear path to ROI within six months. It’s I got rid of these three other authenticator platforms. These tokens cost $5 or all these SMSs that are going out to authenticate cost $100,000 a month, whatever. Put those in a bucket, you’re going to get rid of them, and take credit for it when you do.</p>
<p>The second is you have all this data in your logs. How long does it take to log in with username, password, and then fetching a code? It takes about 15 seconds, even if you’re fast. And then you can very clearly measure how long it takes with a usernameless and passwordless system like ours, and that’s going to be about four seconds on the high side. So take that 11 seconds and add them up. Just have somebody analyze six months of logs and you saved about 6,000 man-hours. And that’s soft ROI, but it’s really powerful. But even more important is you measure customer satisfaction. So before you even get started, ask them, how much do you logging into these three systems, A, B, and C, one to 10? And you’ll get a one, a two if you’re lucky, on the before, and then on after, we’re consistently getting eights and nines. So take credit for that as well. It’s very rare that a security system will make people’s lives easier and more secure. So yeah, they all add up.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Well, in dealing with the number of companies you have, have you seen the aha moment where companies go from passwordless, how am I going to wrestle this beast, to passwordless, I got this, I’ve got it covered?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Yeah. We walked into one of our big Wall Street clients and it was up on the monitors. So click this QR code, it takes them to an intranet site to get onboarded. And we then went down to a meeting down the hall, and it was an all hands with 70 people in this group, and they had to log into one of these big kiosks here in front of everybody. And normally, you’d have to get out the keyboard or type on the screen and type in J Smith and the 16 character password in front of everybody. And what he did is he whipped out his 1Kosmos authenticator, he scanned here, touched, and he was in in one second. And you could hear the little gasps from the audience from the four people that weren’t enrolled yet, like, oh, I’m really embarrassed now. That was aha moment.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That’s awesome. That’s awesome. Well, when it’s that easy, I imagine users buy in. You talked a little bit about coexistence before and getting users to buy in. Just maybe a parting shot, how do you get users to buy in to this type of initiative?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Just give them a choice. If you had a choice today of using face ID versus typing in your Apple ID username and password, which would you choose? It’s a no-brainer. The one or two times on your mobile phone when it says, what’s your Apple ID password? You’re like, oh my God, what am I, in a stone ages here? Right? It happens every once in a while. If you try to turn off find my iPhone, all of a sudden you got to type in. I don’t know my Apple ID password. Well, I do. So just give them a choice and they’ll make the right choice and in turn be more secure.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, personal anecdote, it took me about three weeks because my iCloud ran out of space and my phone was screaming at me, but I couldn’t add, iCloud without knowing my password. So I went about three weeks without having my phone backed up. And finally I bit the bullet and I reset the password this past day.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
There you go.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
All right. Listen, I appreciate your time, Michael. Again, the white paper on our website, Overcoming Resistance to Change on the Journey to Passwordless Multifactor Authentication, it’s on the 1Kosmos website. Click the insights, go to white papers, download your copy. It’s complimentary, just a short form fill. I think it might help you quite a bit in understanding the difference between passwordless as a feature and the job of getting passwordless done. Mike, thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Great to be here. Thank you.</p>

<p>En este artículo, exploraremos cómo la identidad auto soberana redefinirá la autenticación en línea, proporcionando una solución mucho más segura y eficiente para proteger nuestros datos y privacidad en un mundo cada vez más digital.</p>
<p>El problema de las contraseñas tradicionales y las bases de datos centralizadas</p>
<p>Uno de los principales problemas con las contraseñas tradicionales radica en el hecho de que se almacenan en bases de datos centralizadas. Esto plantea un riesgo significativo, ya que, si un atacante logra acceder a esta base de datos, puede obtener fácilmente las contraseñas de múltiples usuarios.<br>
A lo largo de los años, fuimos testigos de muchísimos casos en los que bases de datos centralizadas han sido pirateadas y millones de contraseñas y datos privados de los usuarios fueron robados. Estos ataques cibernéticos han expuesto la vulnerabilidad inherente de este sistema. Incluso si los usuarios eligen contraseñas fuertes y únicas, si las bases de datos centrales no cuentan con medidas de seguridad adecuadas, sus cuentas siguen estando en riesgo.<br>
Además, estas medidas de seguridad para proteger bases de datos centralizadas se vuelven cada vez más costosas, debido a que las técnicas de los ataques se van refinando y haciendo más eficientes y difíciles de prevenir. Si a esto encima le sumamos la explosión de la inteligencia artificial que estamos viviendo, próximamente será casi inviable poder prevenir ataque cibernéticos y fraudes en internet.</p>
<p>La Identidad Auto Soberana como método de autenticación</p>
<p>La identidad auto soberana es un enfoque revolucionario para la autenticación en línea, que pone a la privacidad y a la seguridad como focos centrales de su diseño. En lugar de depender de terceros centralizados, como empresas o instituciones gubernamentales, la identidad auto soberana otorga a los individuos el control total sobre su identidad digital. Utiliza tecnologías descentralizadas como blockchain para proporcionar un sistema seguro y confiable.</p>
<p>En un sistema de identidad auto soberana, los usuarios tienen la capacidad de crear, poseer y gestionar su propia identidad digital. Esto implica la generación de claves criptográficas únicas que se utilizan para firmar y verificar las transacciones. Estas claves criptográficas se almacenan en una billetera digital personal, que está protegida con una contraseña fuerte o incluso con biometría.</p>
<p>Beneficios de la identidad auto soberana (SSI)</p>
<p>La identidad auto soberana ofrece una serie de beneficios en comparación con las contraseñas tradicionales y otros sistemas de autenticación centralizados. Algunos de estos beneficios incluyen:</p>
<p>·         Mayor seguridad: Al descentralizar el control de la identidad, se reduce significativamente la posibilidad de ataques cibernéticos. Las claves criptográficas y la tecnología blockchain proporcionan un nivel adicional de seguridad.<br>
·         Privacidad mejorada: Con la identidad auto soberana, los usuarios tienen el poder de compartir solo la información necesaria en cada interacción en línea, sin revelar más datos personales de los necesarios.<br>
·         Eliminación de contraseñas: Al utilizar claves criptográficas, la identidad auto soberana elimina la necesidad de contraseñas tradicionales, lo que no solo reduce la posibilidad de robos y ataques basados en contraseñas, sino que mejora ampliamente la experiencia de los usuarios.<br>
·         Mayor conveniencia: La identidad auto soberana simplifica el proceso de autenticación al permitir a los usuarios acceder a múltiples servicios en línea con una sola identidad, eliminando la necesidad de recordar varias contraseñas.</p>
<p>El futuro de la autenticación con SSI</p>
<p>La identidad auto soberana es un enfoque prometedor que está redefiniendo la forma en que nos autenticamos en línea. Al proporcionar a los individuos el control total sobre su identidad digital y eliminar la dependencia de contraseñas tradicionales, la identidad auto soberana ofrece una solución más segura, privada y conveniente. Aunque todavía existen desafíos por superar, el potencial de la identidad auto soberana para transformar la autenticación en línea es innegable.</p><p>The post <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/todavia-sirven-las-contrasenas-o-passwords-en-la-identidad-digital/">Más allá de las contraseñas: Cómo la identidad auto soberana redefine la autenticación en línea</a> first appeared on <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/todavia-sirven-las-contrasenas-o-passwords-en-la-identidad-digital/">Más allá de las contraseñas: Cómo la identidad auto soberana redefine la autenticación en línea</a> appeared first on <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>.</p>

<p>SpruceID will host the first fully-remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations at the end of August. This event will provide a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7).</p><p>The objective of this interoperability event is to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption, while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standard.</p> Mobile Driver’s Licenses: Background <p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases than just proving one’s capability to operate a vehicle. A driver’s license serves as the primary form of identification for many people globally. As society shifts to a digital-first world, people need digital versions of identification credentials to represent various facets of their identity in a secure way. </p><p>However, creating a digitally capable version of a physical credential is not as simple as one might think. Digital credentials need to be verifiable, tamper-evident, provably authentic, and (we believe) afford individuals more privacy and control of their personal data in their digital interactions. </p><p>You can learn more about SpruceID’s philosophy on building mobile driver’s licenses in a way that empowers users with more privacy in digital interactions here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">  Credible: Introducing Mobile Driver’s Licenses  We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet. That’s why we’re excited to share a new solution we’ve been working on with early partners as a part of our new Credible Product Suite.  SpruceElissa Maercklein    </a><p><br>In order for mobile driver’s licenses to work seamlessly across different industries and sectors, both online and offline, it is critical to build Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats and protocols, so verifiers across different geographies and industries are able to confirm a person’s identity. </p><p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17, which team members of SpruceID participate in, works on global standards for motor vehicle driver licenses and related documents, with the aim of providing a common technical framework and promoting the safe and secure use of this technology. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 published <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">18013-7</a> which is a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p> Event Information and Resources <p>Interoperability events are hosted to provide various implementers (including those building mobile driver’s license solutions and also verifier solutions) the opportunity to test and improve their respective solutions, as well as improve the underlying technical specifications. Previous interoperability events enabled mDL verifiers and issuers to test the interoperability of their respective solutions, most recently at an in-person test event in December 2022 in Brisbane, Australia testing implementations of 18013-5 and 18013-7 presentation and verification. </p><p>You can find more specific event details for the ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event on our dedicated webpage for the event, along with the guidelines and technical scope for testing. If you are interested in participating in the event, we encourage you to register <a href="https://spruceid.com/iso-mdl-interop-event?ref=blog.spruceid.com">through event webpage</a>.</p>  Join the event  We invite organizations of all sizes who have implementations of either mobile driver's license applications or verifier solutions to participate in the event. <a href="https://spruceid.com/iso-mdl-interop-event?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Register now</a> <p>There will be an open informational session on Friday, July 14 where we will cover more information about the event, testing guidelines, and allow for Q&amp;A from interested participants.

   Sophisticated identity attacks are on the rise. Learn to prevent them with new anti-fraud protections. 

<p>It's no secret that the bad guys are training their artificial intelligence (AI) engines to crack passwords, perform <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeovers</a> (ATO), and automate their ransomware demands. In fact, they are using AI to not only predict your users' current passwords... but to go one step further and predict their next password well before those users have even had a chance to think of them! Mind blown!</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">2023 ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a>, fraudsters are using generative AI to execute phishing emails, create malicious code, and deliver voice or video-based impersonation attacks, known as "deepfakes," that are becoming more frequent and more difficult for humans to detect. You can learn more about AI-generated identity fraud and how you can use AI to protect your business and your customers by attending our webinar: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/protect-customers-against-identity-fraud">Protect Your Customers Against Identity Fraud.</a></p>

 Introducing "distributed attack heuristics" 

<p>One way ForgeRock is helping organizations stay a step ahead of bad guys is through distributed attack heuristics, which is available in ForgeRock Autonomous Access.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> uses AI to monitor login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when it detects anomalous behavior. It uses AI, machine learning, and advanced pattern recognition to stop threats before they occur, so you don't have to deal with the unfortunate aftermath of an expensive mitigation effort.</p>

<p>What are distributed attack heuristics? If an attacker is using a rotating set of IP addresses, it can be challenging for traditional detection and prevention tools to recognize the threat, much less stop it. Using bots, the bad guys automate the attack across thousands or tens of thousands of IP addresses, and iterate each attack just a bit to make it appear different. Basic pattern matching breaks down here. If you shut down one pathway by blocking the IP address, you really haven't stopped the attack in any meaningful sense.</p>

<p>The ForgeRock approach looks at the big picture to shut down the attack while at the same time ensuring the legitimate user maintains access. We typically know the location of the legitimate user. When we recognize a distributed attack is occuring on a particular identity, say the bad guys are using multiple IP addresses to try to guess a user's password, we take steps of verifying whether or not the login is legitimate by challenging the user with a step-up multi-factor authentication (MFA). A successful MFA means the user can continue to login and be productive. Meanwhile, the distributed attack IP addresses can be flagged as suspicious and access requests from these addresses blocked. What's more,we allow organizations to set the thresholds on the number of login attempts they allow before an MFA challenge is issued so a globetrotting power user doesn't get fatigued by too many step up requests.</p>

 Avoiding unnecessary friction with double jeopardy avoidance 

<p>Another recent enhancement to Autonomous Access is something we call double jeopardy avoidance. Anomalous user detection, the ability to flag a user based on certain behavioral characteristics, has been around for a long time. When a user is flagged because of logging in from a different location, a different browser or from a non-typical time of day, the normal response is to flag the user and ask for a step-up MFA.</p>

<p>The problem is that many standard anti-fraud solutions don't have a mechanism for avoiding having the user repeatedly asked to enter their step-up MFA once they've successfully passed a challenge the first time. This leads to frustration and lost productivity. Modern solutions need to take into account the new behavioral situation of the user and allow some flexibility – for a defined period of time.</p>

<p>ForgeRock double jeopardy avoidance is a new feature that adds the capability to not flag a user for the same reason twice, and to do this for a period of time that is configurable. The user may be asked for MFA the first time logging in from a previously unknown location or from a new browser or device, but will be unencumbered during subsequent logins – for a period of time determined by the organization – resulting in a more friction-free experience.</p>

 The velvet rope of IP allow/block lists 

<p>Like any good night club, attendees may try to charm their way past the front door security. To prevent bad actors from entering or, conversely, to make sure legitimate users breeze through, ForgeRock can allow or block specific IP addresses and/or subnets regardless of how securely they have been rated or the risk assessment they have been given. The IP allow/block list feature is just one more essential tool to have in your security arsenal.</p>

 It's time for a holistic identity approach, powered by AI 

<p>The reality of our current threat environment is that it takes a complete approach to identity — one that involves authentication, authorization, and governance working together, along with layered intelligence and AI – to effectively counter today's modern threats. ForgeRock remains committed to an AI-driven approach to identity and security, and looks forward to additional innovation in the future.

<p>Developers have always been a focus of the Holochain Foundation, and with the release of beta 0.1.x and continued development of 0.2.x &amp; 0.3.x it is time to more actively focus on supporting both new devs as well as more developers from a variety of backgrounds. As a step towards that goal, we are very pleased to welcome Mark Franks as the Head of Developer Relations. </p><p>Mark is a seasoned professional with a deep understanding of developer communities. His extensive experience combined with a passion for decentralized tech will make Mark an important addition to our organization as we continue to launch Holochain and provide the ground for a thriving developer ecosystem.</p><p>As the Head of Developer Relations, Mark will play a role in nurturing relationships with developers, facilitating their learning, ensuring their success in utilizing our framework, and driving the growth of our developer community. Collaborating closely with our team, he will provide guidance, support, and resources to empower developers in creating cutting-edge decentralized applications within the open-source ecosystem.</p><p>Prior to joining Holochain, Mark was a Senior Developer Relations Manager at Acumatica. He built their developer relations and community engagement to the highest levels across their executive management, education, marketing, and engineering teams. Before Acumatica, he evangelized various emerging technologies and supported Microsoft’s ISV partners.</p> What Folks are Saying <p>It’s right there in the name, building a community of developers is all about relationships. And Mark has already jumped into building those with several of the folks in our community. As you’ll read more below he joined the team at DWeb 2023, which was a perfect way to meet many team members and developers in our community. Here’s what some of them had to say about Mark joining the team.</p><blockquote>“Developer relations is bridge building: connecting those who create tech, with people who experience it. We are so delighted to see Holochain make strides in this space!"</blockquote><p>—Sid Sthalekar, Founder of Neighbourhoods and Sacred Capital<br></p><blockquote>“We're so delighted to have Mark join the team and lead our Developer Relations efforts. This moment is important for the launch of our groundbreaking P2P open-source framework. We have an opportunity with Holochain to change the power dynamic between digital technology and people. Developer adoption is key to that work. Mark's love for devs and commitment to their experience of learning and growing in a context of community is a perfect fit for our culture and this moment of expansion and growth.” </blockquote><p>—Mary Camacho, Executive Director of Holochain Foundation</p><blockquote>“The news of Mark joining Holochain to spearhead Developer Relations has filled me with excitement. After our conversation at DWeb, his dedication to helping developers technically and professionally was clear. His work in drawing more developers to our ecosystem will help Holochain reach new heights, improving usability and widening its impact. I look forward to seeing our community grow!”</blockquote><p>—Josh Parkin, Co-Founder of AD4M &amp; Flux</p><blockquote>“As a writer, I'm often the first person developers encounter when they start learning about Holochain. As a lead technical evangelist who helped bring Microsoft's .NET framework to the world and establish it as a force to be reckoned with, I've got great hope that he'll take what we've started and shape it into something powerful. He tells me that he feels most alive building trust in the day-to-day, taking care of individual people's needs, motivating them to grow, thrive, and excel. At its core, that's what Holochain is about — creating digital systems that support people as relational beings."</blockquote><p>—Paul d'Aoust, Holochain Technical Community Mentor<br></p> What Mark is Saying <p>As mentioned, Mark attended DWeb shortly after joining the team. His timing couldn’t have been more perfect. Here are his short thoughts and observations after that experience with the team and the growing Holochain community.</p><blockquote>“Attending DWeb Camp provided me with invaluable insights into the Holochain team, the vibrant community, and the broader peer-to-peer (P2P) space. The Holochain team's commitment to decentralized technology and their passion for empowering developers stood out during insightful presentations and engaging discussions. The sense of camaraderie within the community was inspiring, with diverse projects and initiatives driving the transformation of the P2P space. Witnessing the rapid advancements in peer-to-peer technology solidified my belief in the immense potential of decentralized applications. I am sincerely grateful and humbled for the opportunity to work with Holochain and contribute to this incredible community, as together, we strive to build a more decentralized, equitable, and resilient digital future."</blockquote><p>—Mark Franks, Holochain Head of Developer Relations</p><p>We are thrilled to have Mark on board and eagerly anticipate the exciting initiatives and collaborations that will arise under his leadership. Together, we will continue to push boundaries, foster innovation, and build a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications.</p>

<p>This in-depth analysis follows our <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/blog/global-overview-of-virtual-asset-service/">previous</a> study of geographical references in Virtual Asset Service Providers’ (VASPs) terms and conditions, expanding into the domain of global VASP registrations. The VASP industry, driven by the rise of digital assets, has grown significantly, now reaching more than 2700 entities spanning 106 countries. The geographical spread of these registrations illuminates the international scope of digital assets and the varied regulatory landscapes across the globe.</p>



<p>Comparing the top 10 countries in VASP registrations, we observe the following:</p>



RankCountryShare1Estonia11.4%2United States of America8.1%3United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland7.9%4Lithuania7.2%5Singapore6.3%6Canada3.6%7British Virgin Islands3.3%8Hong Kong3.2%9Seychelles2.9%10Australia2.7%



<p>These rankings gain further intrigue when juxtaposed with the top countries mentioned in VASPs’ terms and conditions:</p>



RankCountryShare1United States of America9.94%2United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland9.89%3Estonia8.17%4Singapore6.77%5Lithuania5.27%6British Virgin Islands3.98%7Hong Kong3.65%8Seychelles3.60%9Australia2.42%10Canada2.10%



<p>Although the precise rankings differ, the overlap in countries reveals their key role within the VASP industry. Estonia leads the pack in VASP registrations, perhaps driven by its advanced<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset </a>regulations, while the United States tops the list of countries mentioned in terms and conditions, signaling its considerable influence on the world stage.</p>



<p>Analyzing VASP registrations by region, certain areas emerge as leading players:</p>



RankRegionShare1Europe40.43%2Asia15.98%3North America11.75%4Offshore Centers11.76%5Oceania3.31%6Central &amp; South America2.35%7Africa1.14%



<p>Notably, Europe holds the largest share of VASP registrations, a fact that could be attributed to the progressive regulatory environment, particularly the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The MiCA framework promotes transparency, fairness, and investor protection in</p>



<p>crypto-assets markets, setting a ‘gold standard’ for digital asset regulations that could be attractive for VASPs.</p>



<p>The fact that the top countries are similar in both VASP registration and terms and conditions highlights the correspondence between regulatory environments and operational preferences. Moreover, the strong presence of Offshore Centers in VASP registrations signifies the strategic advantages that these jurisdictions offer, such as more flexible regulations and tax benefits.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the geographical distribution of VASPs offers rich insights into the global landscape of digital asset regulation. Understanding these dynamics is essential for policymakers, investors, and businesses aiming to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem. The influence of regulatory frameworks, such as MiCA in Europe, highlights the potential of well-articulated policies in fostering growth in the sector. Future trends in VASP registrations and terms of conditions references will undoubtedly continue to reflect the unfolding regulatory landscape of digital assets worldwide.</p>

 Does the release of the UK government’s fraud strategy signal the start of a new era of fraud prevention? 



 



<p>Fraud appears to be high on the UK’s political agenda at the moment, and with good reason. Consistently ranked as the fraud capital of Europe, the UK loses almost <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955193/Britain-3bn-fraud-capital-world-Probe-reveals-40m-targeted-scammers-2022.html">£3 billion a year to fraud</a>. In fact, Britons are almost 9x as likely to be victims of scams than their German counterparts, with <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/beatthescammers/article-11074643/UK-crowned-card-fraud-capital-Europe.html">134 cases of card fraud per 1,000 people in the UK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in May 2023, when the UK government published its new <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154660/Fraud_Strategy_2023.pdf">fraud strategy, which it claims will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025</a>, there was a collective sense of relief from the government, private sector and most resoundingly from law enforcement. Despite fraud amounting to 40% of all crime in the UK, the UK’s law enforcement services dedicate less than 1% of their resources to investigate and tackle the fraud epidemic in the UK. The new fraud strategy aims to rectify that and has earmarked £100 million of additional funds to bolster law enforcement efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Foreword to ‘Fraud Strategy: Stopping Scams and Protecting the Public,’ Home Secretary, Suella Braverman spoke of the need for coordinated collaboration between the police, the public and private sectors, as well as “allies abroad.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Industry can do more to protect its customers, our citizens, and businesses. The financial sector has worked with us for a long time on fraud. Whilst I welcome their continued efforts, I challenge them to go further. But it is other industries, especially online technology giants, who should do more to stop criminals exploiting their services and should never profit from online crime.</p>Home Secretary, Suella Braverman.</blockquote>



 What are the most common types of fraud in the UK? 



<p>The definition of fraud is the attempt to gain or cause a loss of money or other owned goods through an act of dishonesty, deception, or breach of trust. Fraud is quite a broad and umbrella term for crimes that vary widely in nature. The most common type of fraud in the UK is <a href="https://www.fool.co.uk/2021/07/25/the-most-common-types-of-fraud-in-the-uk-revealed/">card fraud, affecting almost one in five Brits</a>. The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955193/Britain-3bn-fraud-capital-world-Probe-reveals-40m-targeted-scammers-2022.html">average UK card fraud incident costs £8,833.20</a>, nearly £3,000 more than its closest rival, France.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud has been a serious threat in the UK for many years. This is partly as a response to the English language not only being the lingua franca for business, but also for crime. Other explanations for the comparatively high rate of fraud are the kingdom’s comparative wealth, and fast and frictionless payment systems,” said Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</p>



 What is the difference between authorized fraud and unauthorized fraud? 



<p>Fraud falls into two distinct categories: authorized fraud (tricking the victim into willingly transferring funds) like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance fraud</a>, and unauthorized fraud (stealing details from the victim to make unauthorized transactions), like account takeover fraud, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-fraud/">identity fraud.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partly due to banks stepping up controls, and implementing better and more secure KYC processes, there was an 8% reduction in the total amount stolen in 2022 (<a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">£1.2 billion</a>) compared to 2021 (£1.3 billion). This was due to a significant decrease in unauthorized fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, unauthorized fraud losses across payment cards, remote banking and cheques still totalled a whopping <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">£726.9 million in 2022</a>. Remote purchase fraud was the biggest category of losses at £395.7 million. Fraud on lost and stolen cards increased by 30% (to £100.2 million), and identity theft almost doubled to £51.7 million.</p>



 What is the UK’s new fraud strategy? 



<p>The UK’s fraud strategy is supported by three key pillars:</p>



 Pursue fraudsters&nbsp; 



  Establish a National Fraud Squad with 400 new specialist investigators&nbsp;  Deploy new UK Intelligence Community&nbsp;  Replace Action Fraud with a state-of-the-art reporting system&nbsp;  Imprison more fraudsters&nbsp;  Lead a global partnership to pursue fraudsters worldwide<br>&nbsp;  



 Block fraudsters&nbsp; 



  Ban cold calls on all financial products&nbsp;  Ban SIM farms&nbsp;  Review use of mass text aggregators&nbsp;  Stop more spoof calls&nbsp;<br><br>The UK government is also calling on the tech community to do their part in blocking fraud at an industrial scale. Some of the steps include:&nbsp;  



  Make the tech sector commit to protect their customers through legislation and voluntary commitments&nbsp;  Make it easier to report fraud on social media and the internet&nbsp;  Create new powers to take down fraudulent websites&nbsp;  Publish information about fraud levels on different platforms&nbsp;  



 Empower the public&nbsp; 



  Support more victims&nbsp;  Reimburse more victims&nbsp;  Better communications about how to protect yourself from fraud, how to report fraud, and what to do if you become a victim of fraud&nbsp;  



<p>The 66-page document also goes into detail as to the financial and emotional harm that fraud causes to businesses and victims.</p>



 Who is responsible for enacting the UK’s fraud strategy?&nbsp; 



<p>Collaboration between the below agencies and departments will be integral for enacting the UK’s fraud strategy.</p>


 
 
 
 National Fraud Squad 
 

<p>Perhaps the most important: the UK’s brand new National Fraud Squad is made up of 400 specialist investigators and replaces the Action Fraud division.</p>

 Response to the UK fraud strategy. 



<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">creation of the Crypto Cell</a>, which was designed to tackle crypto crime, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has again announced the creation of a brand new, shiny specialised division to tackle the specific problem of fraud in the UK. Will this, alongside the other measures, make a marked difference to one of the world’s most lucrative fraud markets?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IIDnow believes the UK’s fraud strategy is a step in the right direction, but reiterates the need for collaboration between invested parties, and for companies to accept the responsibility they bear as part of concerted efforts to reduce and eliminate fraud in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud manifests at every step of the online customer journey – there is no one single silver bullet or catch-all. As fraudsters continue to innovate and collaborate, so must we across industry and government – the UK’s fraud strategy is the first step in the right direction.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Organizations need to go beyond what is required of them, from a regulatory and legal perspective, and ensure their product offering is safe and secure. In the past, organizations would often be faced with a tough reality: A fully protected and compliant platform would require extra checks and balances, thereby impacting the overall customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, technology offers companies the ability to provide slick, streamlined and fully compliant customer journeys.</p>



 Technology: A gift and a curse. 



<p>The proliferation of online services, such as banking and shopping, has made UK citizens and businesses a prime target for fraudsters. According to the fraud strategy paper, the “adoption of new technologies by consumers, businesses and fraudsters is almost certainly the main driver of recent increases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As explored in our recent blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/work-chatgpt/">‘Learning to live (and work) with ChatGPT and other AI forms,’</a> technology and the online world offers incredible opportunities to supercharge and optimize services and operations, but these same tools are also available to criminals who are exploiting them for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">Most fraud nowadays at least starts online.</a> As huge amounts of data are now stored online, any data breach provides fraudsters with all the information they need to steal personal information and commit all manner of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">Spoofing</a> via bulk text messaging services, enables fraudsters to target thousands of people at once, from seemingly genuine, local numbers. Technological advances like deep fakes have also ushered in a new playground for fraudsters to operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fraudsters-tactics-are-becoming-more-complex-here-is-what-to-look-out-for-12910842">Fraudster tactics are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated.</a> In fact, according to the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service, which is often asked to assist in cases where an agreement between a consumer and financial firm cannot be reached, complaints are up, and are becoming increasingly complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service received 21,918 fraud and scam complaints in 2022-23 compared to 18,450 complaints in 2021-2022. Some of the most common scams include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams,</a> and scams involving investments and cryptocurrency.</p>



 Fraudsters have become smart. It’s time to get smarter. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring businesses can protect themselves and their customers from fraud. At IDnow, we help put the power of identity back into the hands of businesses; helping to reduce friction for trusted users, preventing fraud, and&nbsp;detecting high-risk or anomalous behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable identity verification services work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, and our industry-leading fraud prevention technology ensures your business remains safe from increasingly complex attacks. With our latest round of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, our identity-proofing methods, including document verification, biometric selfie and video liveness have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>In the last few years, several prominent security-related incidents have originated from inefficient governance of identities such as the Equifax data breach in 2017 where data of 147 million identities was compromised or the Microsoft Exchange Server data breach in 2021 which affected 30,000 organizations from 150 countries. Data theft, loss of personally identifiable information (PII), and industrial espionage through unauthorized access are severe security risks in every industry. Organizations struggle with centralized visibility for identifying who has access to what, who has accessed what and why, and who granted that access.</p>
<p>Access governance concerns the access mechanisms and their relationships across IT systems. As an IAM-focused risk management discipline, access governance focuses on providing centralized visibility for access. It is instrumental in monitoring and mitigating access-related risks. Current access governance solutions provide continuous monitoring of the ecosystem of applications and systems within an organization. Removing risks, enforcing compliance, and automating processes provide security against access breaches and data leaks.</p>
 Oracle Access Governance 
<p>Oracle Access Governance satisfies the above-mentioned requirements expected from an access governance solution. It is a comprehensive tool for fostering the security posture and helping protect organizations against breaches, as well as supporting them in managing access of identities to IT systems within an enterprise. Oracle Access Governance is a cloud-native solution that also supports meeting compliance requirements by automating the processes with machine learning driven recommendations. This provides greater visibility into the access structure of the entire organization’s IT environment.</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance runs as an OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) cloud-native service. It can detect and remediate high risk privileges by enforcing internal access audit policies to identify orphaned accounts, unauthorized access, and privileges. All of this helps to enhance compliance to regulatory requirements (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, 21 CFR Part 11, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, HIPAA, and GDPR).</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance can run alongside Oracle Identity Governance in a hybrid deployment model to provide identity analytics from the cloud to Oracle Identity Governance customers. Following are the major features of Oracle Access Governance:</p>
 
 Automated access reviews: The solution simplifies access reviews through automation and provides insights for making decisions for high-risk access requests. 
 Machine Learning Based Workflows: Oracle Access Governance uses prebuilt ML-based workflows to further simplify the access review campaigns. The inbuilt model suggests workflows by reviewing use cases and recommending the designated next steps. 
 Insight-driven Dashboard: The insight-driven dashboard provides information related to tracking access review trails, real-time analytics, and powerful filters to focus on high access review priority tasks. The dashboard further provides a risk assessment of each activity using peer group analysis. 
 Cloud Identity Governance: it provides simplified identity orchestration that can collect data&nbsp;about OCI users, groups, and policies across multiple tenancies and compartments, and recognize unseen patterns for security threat and violation with real-time risk and threat monitoring. It also identifies over-provisioned accounts. 
 Access Control: Oracle Access Governance provides access control mechanisms like Request/approval-based, Role-based, Attribute-based, Policy-based and a combination of these access controls mechanisms. 
 Fulfilment/Identity Orchestration: The solution simplifies system integration by providing downloadable agents for systems behind firewalls, handing integration for systems in public domains, providing prioritization of authoritative target systems and supports correlation and all of it without the need for coding. 
 Flexible Licensing Model: It allows customers to mark users as active or inactive and as workforce vs. customer. Only the active users are considered for billing. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Organizations of all sizes and in all industries need access governance to protect digital assets, their data and comply with regulations. Good access governance products address these issues. Oracle’s Access Governance provides the modern tooling required to govern access to the identities within an enterprise and proactively address risks. The centralized visibility required to achieve trustworthy access governance is possible through its various features, such as the use of automation and machine learning, event-based micro-certifications, and a transparent and effective dashboard. With multiple access control mechanisms, Oracle Access Governance enables provisioning and entitlement management to ensure compliance while providing better flexibility. Oracle Access Governance improves orchestration and provides a flexible licensing model. It is a solution that is attractive to customers in various industries.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise that Belgium ranks among the vanguards of digital identity. The digital world as we know it may never have existed without this tiny northwestern European country of just 11.6 million people.</p>
<p>After all, the Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">first hypertext system</a> for CERN in 1987. Collaborating with Tim Berners-Lee, he went on to help develop <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web#:~:text=Tim%20Berners%2DLee%20wrote%20the,management%20proposal%20in%20November%201990.">the management proposal</a> behind what would eventually become the World Wide Web (WWW).</p>
<p>He was instrumental in forming the European Commission’s first web-based project for information dissemination in Europe (WISE). And his work with CERN’s Legal Service led to the release of web technology into the public domain 30 years ago this year—on April 30, 1993. “When we have all data online, it will be great for humanity,” Cailliau remarked. “It is a prerequisite to solving many problems humankind faces.”</p>
<p>But while the digital world he helped create has transformed how we live, work, learn, shop, and play for the better, it hasn’t been free of some costly and dangerous challenges. At the heart of them all: identity.</p>
 Digital Identity: A Pressing Need Worldwide 
<p>Citizen or resident identity and property rights have long been cornerstones of free market economies. Particularly as digital economies flourish, this makes it critical to enable individuals to prove their identity online for purchases, access to healthcare and to government services, access to entitlements, and more. But verifying identity in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect web-accessible user accounts has never been even remotely adequate.</p>
<p>Thanks to endless phishing attacks and corporate data breaches, <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> recently-compromised login credentials and personal identity files are available on the dark web. Cyber-thieves and threat actors use stolen or synthetic identity information to defraud businesses and governments. And they leverage pilfered logins to swipe money or steal information they can monetize downstream—the price tag: More than <a href="https://financesonline.com/cybercrime-statistics/">$7.8 trillion</a> in global losses expected just this year.</p>
<p>Today, the ability to facilitate fast, convenient, and secure interactions and transactions online is crucial to the digital economy. But that requires a universally-accepted form of digital identity that protects privacy and prevents personal information from being stolen and exploited by others. While the US is beginning to make strides, other countries are leading the way. A compelling case in point is Cailliau’s native Belgium.</p>
 Belgium: A Bellwether for Digital Everything 
<p>From the saxophone to the <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/11-essential-things-that-belgium-gave-the-world/">Big Bang Theory</a> and beyond, Belgium has always been a center of innovation—and a central hub for Europe’s digital economy. More than 90% of its tech-savvy populace is online. Its kids help design city playgrounds<a href="https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/belgian-town-redesigns-playground-with-roblox-11611"> using Roblox</a>. The country accounts for 35.5% of all <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/belgium-ecommerce">cross-border e-commerce</a>. More than half of all companies operate <a href="https://www.stackscale.com/blog/cloud-adoption-eu-enterprises/">in the cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Belgium’s capital city is a global financial center and home to the EU Parliament, the European Commission, and NATO. It’s also home to a vibrant startup scene—and a government-driven “<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2017/tech-center-eu-capital-city-grows-its-tech-reputation/">Digital Belgium</a>” initiative focused on developing and nurturing digital skills and business, inclusion, infrastructure, and security. It is also a global leader in <a href="https://thepaypers.com/digital-identity-security-online-fraud/the-philippines-to-work-with-china-belgium-on-digital-id--1259823">digital identity</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, Belgium rolled out the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/customer-cases/belgium">itsme mobile ID scheme</a>, which allows citizens to securely access a range of government and private sector services such as banking, travel, and healthcare through a mobile app. It’s an extension of the card-based national eID cards required of all Belgians 12 and up.</p>
<p>Once tied to their eID, consumers can use single sign-on to log into accounts, share information, conduct transactions, and sign documents. Two-factor authentication, such as a fingerprint biometric or pin code on the user’s device, provides an added layer of security, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 Convenience Meets Security–But Not Without Complexities 
<p>Typically issued or regulated by a national ID scheme, digital identity is generally comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced with government-issued physical world credentials. Think birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc.</p>
<p>One of the critical benefits of Belgium’s eID and itsme app is convenience. Citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. And in addition to two-factor authentication, it’s certified for the European Union’s “Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services” (EIDAS) standards. It meets the requirements for <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-privacy/">GDPR privacy law</a> and <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/regulatory/">PSD2 open banking</a> regulations. And more than 80% of the population has used it, making <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/focus/the-state-of-digital-identity-in-europe">25 to 35 million transactions per month</a>.</p>
<p>But it has yet to be free of issues. EID technology is complex and has significant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/07/05/eidas-20-turns-to-self-sovereign-identification-to-bring-users-ownership-and-control/?sh=2b2274f77f07">barriers to entry</a> for private industries, holding back its full promise. And detractors have expressed concerns over privacy and government overreach. But the European Union’s updated “Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services” (EIDAS 2.0) could soon help change that.</p>
 A Step Toward Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>Thanks to EIDAS 2.0, itsme and systems may soon give citizens far more control over how their information is used, while making digital identity far easier to apply across all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>EIDAS 2.0 goes into effect <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/24/2023-the-year-digital-identities-go-mainstream/">this September</a>, and requires that all member states offer a digital identity wallet (DIW) that acts like a “digital twin” of hard-copy identity documents. In addition to standards for easier adoption across industry sectors, EIDAS 2.0 introduces other key benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of a “federated” model for digital identity, for instance, EIDAS 2.0 can potentially set the foundation for a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> framework. With SSI, authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally on servers belonging to large public or private organizations, where it can be hacked and either ransomed or exploited to commit fraud. Instead, users can control what personal information they share and how that information is used.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>The promise of digital identity is predicated on distributed ledger technologies and the architectural advantages they enable. For one thing, they provide for storing immutable records of identity. This enables financial services firms to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) mandates. It also allows them to accurately log access and activities in alignment with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Just as importantly, they are key enablers of SSI-based authentication through digital wallets. For instance, when users opt to share data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/04/why-zero-trust-is-all-about-identity/?sh=350d5c6e54ee">zero-trust systems</a> can apply risk, quality, or credit scores without contributing private user information or metadata to the process.</p>
<p>This means that someone applying for a loan can do so without revealing personal information or having a decision tied to outdated or inaccurate information stored on far-flung corporate servers. Or someone entering a bar can prove they’re at least 21 years old without revealing their name, birthdate, address, or other details. Users can also set <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=6740c174584a">time limits</a> so that shared information is deleted after a predetermined period.</p>
<p>Belgium seems set on forging the way. In 2024, the country will hold the EU presidency, and it recently announced plans to lead the creation of “<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/belgium-digital-minister-eu-crypto-blockchain-092425913.html">Europeum</a>,” an official blockchain for Europe designed to further pioneer digital identity.<br>
But to be effective, digital ID wallets must also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and<a href="https://www.ibeta.com/"> iBeta biometrics</a>-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating virtually any attempt at identity spoofing.</p>
<p>If Cailliau’s vision of the web as a prerequisite for solving many of humanity’s problems is ever to be fully realized, digital identity will need to be solved, most likely with an architecture similar to that baked into 1Kosmos BlockID and discussed in this free research paper on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/analyst-report/reusable-verified-identity/">Reusable Verified Identity</a> from KuppingerCole.

 While the ethos of cryptocurrency may be partly rooted in anonymity, mass adoption and the subsequent increase in fraudulent activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing, has forced legislators to step in and fill the regulatory void.  



 



<p>Binance and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase</a>, both leaders in crypto trading worldwide, are just two major players that have decided to enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> regulations, along with regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>. When registering on one of those platforms, users need to provide a government-issued ID, take a photo identification selfie, as well as provide additional personal data.</p>



 People bypass KYC requirements for multiple reasons:&nbsp; 



<p>• Some users believe identity verification goes against the ethos of cryptocurrency;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Others may want to avoid sanctions, embargoes, or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">PEP</a> screening lists;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Illicit organizations looking to access <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">crypto exchanges to launder money</a>;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other users may want to evade tax;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Underage users looking to trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these reasons and more, some users may resort to dubious methods to avoid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, bypassing KYC and identity verification is likely to have not only serious consequences for crypto users, but also cause regulatory difficulties for crypto operators.</p>



 



 

 



 Upcoming regulatory regimes. 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a>) regulation, which received a majority 517 votes from European Parliament lawmakers in favor of the crypto licensing regime in April 2023, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Countries, such as the UK are devising their own national regulatory framework for the crypto market. Read more on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regulations in our blog</a>.</p>



 Regulations that apply to crypto companies in Europe. 


 
 
 
 Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, issued in January 2020, requires crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations. CASPs must conduct customer due diligence (CDD), implement risk-based AML programs, and report suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities.</p>

 
 
 
 Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a> is a regulation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets in the EU. It introduces requirements for issuers of crypto assets, crypto asset service providers, and digital asset custody providers. It aims to establish a consistent and harmonized approach to regulation across EU member states.</p>

 
 
 
 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
 

<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GDPR</a>, in effect since May 2018, applies to crypto companies that handle personal data of individuals within the EU. It imposes obligations on data controllers and processors, including obtaining consent, implementing data protection measures, and ensuring the rights of data subjects are respected.</p>

 
 
 
 Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">PSD2</a>, implemented in January 2018, regulates payment services within the EU. It affects crypto companies that provide payment services or interact with traditional payment systems. PSD2 establishes requirements for strong customer authentication (SCA) and imposes obligations on payment service providers.</p>

 
 
 
 Capital Markets and Securities Directive (MiFID II) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/publications-and-data/interactive-single-rulebook/mifid-ii">MiFID II</a>, in effect since January 2018, applies to crypto companies that provide investment services, such as crypto exchanges or platforms offering crypto derivatives. It introduces requirements for authorization, investor protection, transparency, and reporting.</p>

 
 
 
 Various Tax Regulations 
 

<p>Crypto companies operating in Europe must comply with tax regulations applicable to cryptocurrencies. Tax treatment can vary across countries, but typically involves reporting crypto transactions, capital gains taxation, and potential value-added tax (VAT) obligations.</p>

 
 
 
 Electronic Money Directive (EMD) and Payment Services Directive (PSD) 
 

<p>The EMD and PSD provide a regulatory framework for electronic money institutions (EMIs) and payment service providers (PSPs). Crypto companies offering services such as crypto wallets, prepaid cards, or remittance services may fall under these directives and must comply with their provisions.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>It is important to note that regulations and their application can vary across EU member states. Companies should closely monitor updates from regulatory authorities, seek legal advice, and ensure compliance with the relevant regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate.&nbsp;</p>



 Common crypto compliance mistakes.  



<p>There are several compliance mistakes that many new crypto companies make when they first launch. These mistakes can lead to legal and financial difficulties, damage to reputation, and hinder long-term growth. Some of the most common mistakes that new crypto firms make with their compliance programs include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Lack of regulatory compliance. 



<p>Ignoring or underestimating the importance of regulatory compliance is a common mistake. Crypto companies need to understand and adhere to the legal and regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> regulations, securities laws, tax obligations, and other relevant regulations can result in hefty fines, legal actions, or even shutdowns.&nbsp;Read more about how the dangers of money laundering in the crypto sector in our latest blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">‘How criminals leverage non-compliant crypto exchanges for money laundering.’ </a></p>



 Inadequate security measures. 



<p>Crypto companies must prioritize security due to the highly sensitive nature of the data they exchange. Failing to implement robust security measures, such as strong encryption, secure key storage, and comprehensive cybersecurity protocols, can leave them vulnerable to hacking, theft, and fraud. Breaches can result in significant financial losses, legal liabilities, and erosion of user trust.&nbsp;</p>



 Poor risk management. 



<p>Effective risk management is crucial in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Companies need to identify and assess risks related to market fluctuations, operational vulnerabilities, technological risks, and regulatory changes. Failing to implement risk management strategies, such as diversifying investments, establishing contingency plans, and conducting regular risk assessments, can leave companies exposed to unexpected losses and instability.&nbsp;</p>



 Poor governance and internal controls. 



<p>Establishing strong corporate governance practices and internal controls is essential for the long-term success of crypto companies. Inadequate governance structures, such as a lack of independent board members or conflicts of interest, can create reputational risks and regulatory scrutiny. Weak internal controls, including inadequate financial reporting or weak auditing practices, can lead to financial mismanagement, fraud, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid these mistakes, crypto companies should invest in robust compliance programs and a dedicated compliance officer, prioritize security measures, and implement effective risk management practices.&nbsp;A KYC program is integral in offering a safe and secure crypto platform. </p>



 Regulatory risks of missing KYC. 



<p>While KYC processes prevent most users from signing in without proper screening, these restrictions have created a business opportunity on the black market. Indeed, for a small amount of money, marketplaces on different dark webs now offer vetted accounts on crypto exchanges and other payments services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For prices ranging from $150-$500, you can now buy an approved account on peer-to-peer trading platforms, professional crypto exchanges, or mainstream payment services. These accounts are either created with a fake name, address, and identification documents, or with genuine data obtained by illicit means.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/">an investigation from specialized news outlet, CoinDesk</a>, fake accounts on the exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro, and payment services Cash App and Wirexwere were reviewed by a reporter. Analysis revealed that most accounts belonged to genuine United States and European citizens, and came with instructions on how to use VPN networks. Most importantly, it was also found that credentials for email addresses were linked to Google Voice numbers, which is sometimes used as a tool by fraudsters to create fake accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some users went to extraordinary lengths to adopt specific behavioral patterns, for example matching the geolocation of victims, or keeping to transaction limits. It is therefore likely that some users were able to access crypto wallets by using other individual’s accounts, thus evading KYC checks. Fake crypto exchange accounts are just a small subset of the global black ID market; an industry boasting more than 15 billion different types of credentials, as reported by <a href="https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/from-exposure-to-takeover">cyber consultancy firm Digital Shadows</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudsters leveraging data for illicit purposes represent a major risk for cryptocurrency platforms and service providers. Regulators including the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have already <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/sanctions/bitgo-fined-99k-for-digital-currency-sanctions-violations/29889.article">fined cryptocurrency exchanges like BitGo</a> for violations of U.S. sanctions programs, alleging the platform had allowed – even unknowingly – individuals from Syria, Iran, Sudan, and Cuba to access and use its trading services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 KYC as a support for crypto market development. 



<p>Despite the popularity of the black market trade in verified accounts, it is still possible to mitigate those risks by leveraging <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">robust KYC processes</a>. However, to increase the likelihood of customer adoption, onboarding processes must remain as simple, safe and secure as any other financial service. The robustness of KYC processes must be analyzed and put to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although crypto enthusiasts might see KYC processes as a diminishing factor for adoption, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/binance-ceo-cz-zhao-advocates-for-fundamental-crypto-rights">Bloomberg</a> that implementing such rules had had only little impact on business; just 3% of customers were lost after implementing a robust KYC process.</p>



<blockquote><p>We have chosen to go with full compliance, full mandatory KYC for global users, for every feature. We feel that being compliant will allow more users to use us. Most people do feel more comfortable using a licensed exchange. Most people – 97% of users – go through KYC. We lose only 3% of users.</p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO at Binance </blockquote>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, crypto platforms can rest assured that their customers are who they say they are. While a selfie in isolation may not keep the fraudsters at bay, when combined with video identification, in addition to collecting official documents, it forms part of a solid and robust KYC process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC processes must be painless for the user, and take place in a user-friendly environment to keep the onboarding experience as seamless and intuitive as possible. Automated identity verification, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respecting these conventions will allow exchanges to participate in the democratization and mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, while deterring fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrency platforms &amp; KYC mechanisms. 



<p>Although it is still possible to buy crypto without completing a KYC check, it is a more complicated and risky thing to do (as such platforms offer no protection if something was to go wrong), when compared with an exchange that complies with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC requirements</a>. </p>



<p>Crypto firms expanding into the European market now have to comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>. As such, platforms should take steps to enhance their KYC and AML procedures (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto KYC Page</a>), which will ultimately benefit both the users, and the platform itself.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Single Sign-On is one thing that, today we take it for granted. So, it’s even hard for us to remember when was the first time we have used it. Today, we’ll go a bit deeper into that and in which direction Single Sign-On is going. And for that we have a special guest, who is Keith Uber, VP at Ubisecure. Hello, Keith.</p>
<p>Keith Uber: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for joining us for the second time. So, you have been – two years ago. Two years ago, you’ve been here before talking about mergers and acquisitions. So happy to have you back here.</p>
<p>Keith: It’s a pleasure. Thank you for the invite to come back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, nice to have you, Keith. And we’d like to hit a few things about yourself. So, you can tell us about your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So, my entry into the world of identity probably began around the year 2000 when I had just moved to Finland from Australia. I was working for telco provider, who was in the – around the dot-com boom era had been acquiring lots of small businesses. Lots of startups, they had their own projects and all of these have many different types of identity systems and lobbying systems. And my introduction to that process was – my job was to evaluate different solutions to their problem and ultimately, take part in a commercial pilot to implement a product to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And I already can imagine that a single sign-on had some role on that. Just guessing that yes, single sign-on is something that. I was really trying to remember when was the first time that I used it and it’s quite difficult. Because it has been coming in different, in different flavours I would say.</p>
<p>Probably the first time I used was in one of my first jobs when, you know, you go to the office – people used to go to the office every day, and today is not, not for everyone at least. And then you sit down, and you login to your computer. You login to the domain and then suddenly, you can access some of the internal applications without logging in again. So that is one of the ways. And then later it came, what we see more often today is the web single sign-on, right? So, several applications.</p>
<p>So, in order to start with the basics, how you define single sign-on in a nutshell?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. Single Sign-On is maybe a more technical term that the industry understands. But for the end users, they don’t really understand what the single sign-on means. But they do understand that they don’t want to have to sign in again and again to different parts of the same website or different sections of the same company. So single sign-on is the ability to sign-on once using any form and use that same session information across many different services. For the end user, that’s great. That means that’s one less username and password, or many, many less username and passwords, or many less authentication methods for the user to manage.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the internet, or the web-based applications has a kind of thing they sort of came along. So, a long time ago, we all used to have desktop machines, and we would have PAT [personal access token] client-based applications and we’d even have to sign into those. Early on, there were different solutions for remembering and replaying the usernames and passwords across different PAT client applications. And that’s what we call enterprise single sign-on.</p>
<p>That’s very much faded away as the world has moved to web browser-based applications where people are spending most of their time in a browser or signing into applications based on browser-based technologies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thinking of we, as normal user, like majority of users, we are using without noticing, right? You might ask people what is single sign-on and not sure or maybe they try to find meaning from the name itself, but it’s everywhere.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us a bit more how people are using single sign-on, SSO, in practice? So, what are the – how many ways, what are the scenarios? How many scenarios? Or just mention of a few of the most common ones.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So single sign-on in essence is the reduction in the number of times that you have to sign-in to the different services. So instead of signing into different parts of the same website that might be based on different technologies, you only have to sign in once. And then when you transfer to a different section of the website or a different application within an organisation. You’re already logged in, your name appears, and your information appears.</p>
<p>And a lot of what’s happening, or the technology behind that is happening behind the scenes. It’s mainly invisible to the user and that sometimes makes demonstrating single sign-on, for example, quite a boring demo. Because you’re actually removing a lot of the things which you don’t want to see, and the end result is you see nothing. So, the best type of single sign-on is where the user doesn’t notice it.</p>
<p>But there are other advantages. For example, in order to create an account, you only have to create that account once. So, the user registration process is also simplified with a single sign-on. Without single sign-on, you would have to have a registration process for every individual user application. Or at least some way to authorise your account to be used on other applications. So that makes it easier.</p>
<p>And then password reset, or credential management is then simplified. Because instead of having to reset your password in different services, you can reset your password in one spot, and it’s the same password used for many different services.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, that illustrates the advantages that as you also said is the users don’t notice. It’s well, in a way, invisible once it’s set up.</p>
<p>So, going deeper into, what are the nuts and bolts of single sign-on? I’m sure there are many technicalities behind, but what are the main standards that make single sign-on possible?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So single sign-on doesn’t have to be done using standards. But of course, standards simplify the implementation process and simplify the management of the solution. There’s basically two main standards which are in use today. The older standard is called SAML 2.0. And this is an XML-based standard. A way to transfer information about the user and the login session between different services using public key-based technology. In more recent years, and the more modern technology is what we call OpenID Connect, which is based on OAuth 2.0. Different workflows use different parts of those two standards.</p>
<p>And that’s a JSON-based, REST JSON-based protocol. It implements most of the same use cases, most of the same user flows. But of course, as technology has developed, new use cases have come, now OpenID Connect is what we call the gold standard. Even though it’s the gold standard, there’s still a lot of software systems and products which are based on the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>
<p>So, to truly implement SSO in a – as wide range of target applications as possible, the best thing is to have a solution that supports multiple standards. And there’s ways to bridge between these two standards. So that some applications can use SAML 2.0, and other applications we use OpenID Connect and you don’t have to do a lot of your own development work. Because if the products and the servers support those standards, it’s pretty much plug and play.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, as you said, two main standards, even though there are other ways, but then two main standards is SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Yeah, even though there are two main standards, there are a lot of software that can make single sign-on happen. We know because from experience being talking with customers, organisations in different sizes. And even though we feel as user that single sign-on is almost ubiquitous. There are still many organisations, companies that don’t have single sign-on or don’t have single sign-on, at least for all the applications.</p>
<p>So, it’s common that there might be in an organisation, let’s say 20 applications and a portion of them, let’s say four of them, which have some similarity, they have single sign-on. But all the rest are disconnected, different identities for that.</p>
<p>So, there is still some technicalities behind putting that in practice from an organisation perspective. So, if you can tell us how organisations can implement SSO. The main step, let’s say, for setting up single sign-on.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. What you described is a common scenario that even a company that’s implemented SSO in their environment. There could be a lot of applications which are outside of the system, either they’ve been implemented by a team that was unaware of the technology or unaware of the how to do it, or the product developers were unaware, the people buying it didn’t know what to ask for. So, there’s a lot of situations where a company can be – have SSO in place for maybe their main applications. But maybe for their own employees or different user groups, such as external suppliers, they might really go back to square one where the users have to log in many, many times.</p>
<p>The best way to implement SSO is to pick the most used applications, that are used by most of your customers. Who are probably requesting that today, especially for consumer customers. The most typical situation is that there’s a main application, it might be a web shop, or some service portal, it’s connected to some other related application such as a support portal or documentation system or something. And these two services are used hand-in-hand and they’re used often buy most of the users. So, you try to work on the principle of bringing in the most used applications that touch the most users sort of in a priority order.</p>
<p>SSO isn’t something that you would implement across the whole organisation and across all applications overnight. It’s done as a roadmap project, where over the lifecycle of different applications, you would plan carefully which applications you’re going to switch on for SSO. That might be on-premise applications or cloud services. It’s important at the very start to do an inventory of the applications which you’re offering to different user groups. Clearly define those different user groups, see what dedication they’re using already today, and then prioritise how you’re going to move them across to a true single sign-on system. It’s something that has to be done bit by bit.</p>
<p>Some applications may need to wait until their supplier switches on SSO or makes it available for the customers. Some cloud services might charge additional service fees for enabling corporate SSO, some might already have that today that’s just not turned on for your organisation.</p>
<p>It’s really good to work with pilot organisations, especially in B2B. And these are probably organisations which are already coming to you, already asking, when will you support my corporate login? When will I be able to click through and not have to log in? When will I not have to synchronise my users with your service, for example?</p>
<p>Because one of the big advantages of SSO, when we’re talking about business-to-business use cases. Is allowing customers, not only to move between their applications that you offer but allow them to use the authentication method which they already have. Which is their corporate login. That might be their own SSO system, or typically today, it’s Azure AD corporate login that they use. Not only for the Windows desktop and cloud services, but you can use it for third party applications as well.</p>
<p>And as the project goes forward and people start to see the benefits, then it becomes a little bit like a tsunami. That then you get requests to switch on every application that you have or to have a goal, to have as many as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, for some applications which are used by a very small user group for a very specific purpose, or very infrequently. The cost and effort of implementing SSO for – even if it’s just configuration, may not be worth the effort or the return. But you’d focus on the high volume, high value applications first.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s definitely a good observation. High volume applications and the most relevant applications, those are the ones to do first and then gradually all the others.</p>
<p>In terms of best practices that you could give us – let’s do it from two perspectives. From the end users in which might be easier, and then you can go deeper into the – what are the best practices for organisation. So, what would you say to users, either they’re aware or not, they are using single sign-on. But to users who are regularly using single sign-on?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So, for end users, these are the untrained, for example, citizens or consumer users for your services. You have to make it as easy as possible and as simple as possible and use the language that the users understand. So best practices there are to avoid any of the technical terms which are not understandable to begin with. But to make it a very simple and easy process for the user to – for example, register an account, approve terms and conditions, approve attribute consent to allow their information to be processed. To make it easy for them to adopt strong passwords, and have a suitable password policy for the target service.</p>
<p>And then, of course, a way to – or today, it becomes basically standard that you would – enabling a two-factor authentication. Which is familiar for the target audience, something that they’ve done before, they know how to use and something that’s appropriate for the risk, sort of the risk involved in the transaction. You don’t want to have to get the user to do some very complex authentication process just to look at their information. But you might want to have a step-up authentication or a stronger two-factor authentication. For example, in conjunction with some high value transactions, such as a bank transfer or termination of an account service.</p>
<p>My recommendation for end users is just to remember that it has to be understandable and easy to use and configure or design the system accordingly.</p>
<p>Oscar: And for organisations?</p>
<p>Keith: For organisation, it’s really important that the whole process and the whole project around single sign-on is very, very well documented. It’s a core part of security for the applications. It should be regularly reviewed, to understand is it keeping up with the latest threats in the environment? Part of that review is not only the paperwork review of the policies and configurations. But regular automated reviews of logging events, things that happen in the system to trigger evidence of potential attacks or anomalies in the processing. And to address those swiftly and quickly to make sure that there’s no impact on the organisation.</p>
<p>So, it’s important that you dedicate adequate resources either within the organisation or through a partner. Not only through the implementation project, but through the ongoing day to day running of the system. To understand the responsibilities of who is responsible for what and who is monitoring and actioning those events.</p>
<p>Of course, for organisations, one of the downsides for single sign-on is that in some ways, you put all of your eggs in one basket. That if the single sign-on system fails for one reason or another, it can become a single point of failure. But it’s a risk that could prevent users from signing in, and it could prevent customers from buying things. It could prevent customers from moving to a new application within their session.</p>
<p>So, it’s important when the system is scoped and system is implemented, that’s taken into consideration. So, it’s highly available, works at a high performance, can deal with any sort of attacks from the outside world. Because it was, it becomes, in a sense a front door for the organisation. So not only does it have to be welcoming for the user community, and easy to use. But it has to be very well hardened, with very strong locks, so that you’re not a victim of any kind of organised attack on the system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely, it’s very good that you emphasize this importance of hardening the systems that are – which single sign-on has been built. As you put a piece of software and behind there’s a lot of infrastructure servers. Everything has to be well-secure indeed. Even though, as you see, we haven’t talking about this easiness of its function, single sign-on. It sounds like a solution that you just switch on, and it’s ready. But it’s very good that you emphasize all these security and availability aspects, because it’s so important.</p>
<p>Keith: On that topic, the standards, for example, SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect. They give you a lot of protection. They have well-defined and reviewed and audited protocols and flows, which have been tested and seen the test of time. But even though the specification says something, it’s the implementation which has to be examined. So, it’s very easy for somebody to make a simple mistake, which can put either an individual application or the whole system at risk. For example, incorrectly validating a signature, or looking at the incorrect audience information or so on.</p>
<p>So particularly where in the coding is done by an individual team, it’s important to have the technical reviews and technical audits and importantly, testing of those solutions. Luckily, especially for OpenID Connect there is very, very powerful tools for automated testing of implementations. Which is a great way to give yourself faith in an implementation. To see how it complies with the various risks involved in poor implementation quality.</p>
<p>Oscar: Such tools that – for instance, in especially in the OpenID community there are these, of course products of several years of, I don’t know thousands of organisations contributing to that standard. So, and there has been, of course, evolution of those standards.</p>
<p>So, seeing also the evolution of the standards behind SSO and what other functionality that comes along with single sign-on. What do you see today are trends related to single sign-on?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, I think single sign-on is quite mature in terms of, how if for generic single sign-on, for example, for web applications, moving between one application and another. What’s interesting is multi device single sign-on when you’re, for example, signing into a setup box using your mobile phone or signing into applications across devices where a session will follow you.</p>
<p>Today, we’re seeing the better understanding and the commercial release of passkeys. So, this is the culmination of years and years of work on standards such as WebAuthn and the FIDO Alliance standards. Which is now finally wrapped up into consumer understandable services which we know as passkeys. And that kind of takes the user out of the equation when we’re creating – it’s no longer creating passwords of a passkey. They don’t have that risk of creating a credential which is too weak. It’s all, in a way automated and easy to understand. And I think that’s a really exciting thing.</p>
<p>Something new for users to understand how to manage their own collection of passkeys, their own wallet. And how to keep that safe and be able to recover if they lose or break their device. It has its own challenges, but that’s probably the latest, biggest trend. It doesn’t mean that you use the same passkey for every service, still you have a different passkey for every service. So, it’s not like all of the different services are connected in that way. So, it’s privacy protecting.</p>
<p>The related technologies, which I think is a current trend is more of an authentication method. Which is used for single sign-on systems, is related identity wallets. Which are now really starting to come into the public use. Where an organisation can issue a credential and assign that credential and the user can be asked to present that at various services. And they can present as much or as little information as they want. And the service receiving that information can be sure it’s issued by the organisation that issued it.</p>
<p>It’s really exciting, the EU identity wallet projects will bring that into the forefront as more and more governments adopt those type of services. And we’ll see that, we’ve seen that already with, for example, electronic driver’s licenses and electronic professional credentials. So, they will spread, and it will make things easier, I think, for the user. A lot of time and effort into hiding the complexity and the security beneath it all and making the user experience friendly and familiar. Using the service logos and branding and colours and the analogies to cards that you have and so on. So, it’s a big thing.</p>
<p>And this might also drive many, many single sign-on projects. As customers won’t know how to ask for single sign-on, but they say, “Why Can’t We? Why can’t we sign into all of these applications with a passkey instead of using individual credentials for each service?” Those discussions become the underlying discussion of a single sign-on set up with passkeys and authentication method.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I’m sure the user will be pushing the companies or organisations to deliver single sign-on now that these technologies, passkeys and wallets are reaching that usability level. That it’s ready to be used for the masses.</p>
<p>Final question for your Keith, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Keith: I think for single sign-on, one of the related technologies is what’s called federation. And federation is when you have single sign-on across organisational boundaries. So, for example, I could sign in using my Ubisecure login into a third-party application where I do work, for example, with other companies. And this federation signing in with your own commercial credentials across organisational boundaries is something that I think a lot of organisations haven’t benefited from enough today. And that would be – maybe my actionable idea is to look at the B2B applications that you have. Look at the time it takes to manage the users in those systems. For those users to get an account, those users to ask for access, for audits to be done. How do you check what the company is? Are they still in operation? Does that person still work for the company?</p>
<p>A lot of those problems can be solved by implementing cross organisation single sign-on – this federation. And it can be as simple as entering your email address and then signing in using the – or approving the login using your existing home organisation single sign-on. Or are signing in using, Azure Active Directory sign in. In that way, the target application or target organisation gets all of the up-to-date information about the user that they were allowed to get or that they requested to get. They get evidence that the user has a continued relationship with that organisation. And of course, they get single sign-on, so they don’t actually have to sign in again. They might just approve the login and get to work.</p>
<p>It’s got benefits for all parties in the transaction. It improves security, it improves the auditing. It’s easier to use. It’s convenient, less hassle, less clean up, less risk. And I think it’s not anything new in terms of technology, but it’s something that’s underutilised and maybe undervalued.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree with that. I think organisations could use more to fulfil the potential of more collaboration between organisations. By using these techniques that there has been for a while, and we have been discussing today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Keith, for joining us today. It has been super interesting to hear more in detail what single sign-on can do for different types of organisations. And of course, ultimately, to make our lives and users life much easier. So, if someone would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>

<p>Bluesky is a public benefit corporation with the mission to “to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.” The public benefit corporation status allows us to pursue our mission above profit, but we still need to make Bluesky a sustainable service in order to build an open ecosystem that lasts. In order to do this, we’ve raised an $8M seed round to support our mission and growth, and are taking the first steps towards a services-led business model.</p>
 Our Seed Round 
<p>The hardest part of building a new social network is bootstrapping growth. As you might recall, Bluesky started as a project funded and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/2-7-2022-overview">supported by Twitter</a>, and even after our incorporation as a separate company, we retained a close relationship with them. However, once Twitter changed hands, the relationship was terminated, and our original plan of building the AT Protocol to support Twitter as a client was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Last fall, we started building our own client app to drive adoption and development of the AT Protocol. This summer, we converted from a public benefit LLC to a public benefit C Corp in order to gain more independence from the legacy of the past. Our mission and board have stayed the same, but along with this conversion, we’ve raised funding from an array of values-aligned investors who share our vision for an open and decentralized commons for public conversation. Our goal for this raise was to find new partners and to give ourselves room to grow the network and experiment with new business models.</p>
<p>We raised $8M in a seed round led by <a href="https://neo.com/">Neo</a>, a community-led firm with amazing partners like Ali Partovi and Suzanne Xie, and a wonderful cast of additional investors including Joe Beda who co-created Kubernetes, Bob Young of Red Hat, Amjad Masad of Replit, Amir Shevat of Darkmode, Heather Meeker, Jeromy Johnson, Automattic, Protocol Labs, Sarah Drasner, Katelyn Donnelly, Ali Evans, Stav Erez, Kris Nóva, Brad Fitzpatrick, Abdul Ly, and many other operators who have much wisdom to share.</p>
<p>With this funding, we can expand our team, manage increasing operation and infrastructure costs, and grow the AT Protocol ecosystem as well as the Bluesky app. It’s a lot to tackle at once, but we’re excited to have seasoned allies who want to help us realize our vision of an open commons for public conversation.</p>
<p>Just as we’ve made the source code for the protocol and the client public, we also want to be  transparent about our business plans. We’ll be experimenting with different strategies and services to see what provides real value to our users, and will continue to share what we learn as we build a sustainable social network.</p>
 Our First Paid Service 
<p>Traditionally, social media companies have supported business costs through advertising. While advertising can subsidize services to make them free to the end user, it comes with negative long-term consequences like incentivizing platforms to lock their users in. In the business of advertising, where social media companies exchange user data to serve ads to specific audiences, users become the product.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s business model must be fundamentally different — we are a public social network and our code is all open source, so we have no “moat” when it comes to data. We set out to build a protocol where users can own their data and always have the freedom to leave, and this approach means that advertising couldn’t be our dominant business model. So, we’ve been exploring other avenues of monetization.</p>
<p>We believe that there must be better strategies to sustain social networks that don’t require selling user data for ads. Our first step in another direction is paid services, and we’re starting with <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains</a>. While setting up a custom domain to use with Bluesky and the AT Protocol is fairly straightforward, it does require some familiarity with domain registrars and DNS settings. Yet, over 13,000 users have already either repurposed domains they already owned to use as handles, or purchased a domain solely because of Bluesky. Domains have so much potential as a personalized way to customize identities and as a decentralized way to verify reputation that builds off the existing web. For example, U.S. Senators have used the <code>senate.gov</code> domain to verify their identity on Bluesky without our involvement, and a third-party developer built a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb">web extension</a> that checks if websites are linked to an AT Protocol identity. The possibilities are wide in the domain-as-a-handle space.</p>
<p>We’re partnering with Namecheap, a popular domain registrar, to <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">offer a service</a> for easy domain purchasing and management. With this, people can set a custom domain as their handle on Bluesky and the AT Protocol in under a few minutes. Of the domain registrars, Namecheap has one of the best reputations for defending their users against unauthorized domain transfers and protecting their domain names. Our shared values of putting users first and moving towards a more open internet makes us confident that together, we can provide a great service to our users. To learn more about how to easily get your own custom domain through Bluesky, read our product announcement <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">here</a>.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce a new feature that allows users to seamlessly purchase and manage domains directly through Bluesky. With this, you can easily set a custom domain as your Bluesky handle and much more.</p>
<p>On Bluesky and the AT Protocol, you can set domains that you own like <code>bsky.team</code> or <code>alice.lol</code> as your username. Typically, this requires buying a domain name from a registrar and configuring DNS records in their portal. We’re partnering with Namecheap, one of the leading domain name registrars, to let you pick out a domain name and link it to your Bluesky account in under a minute.</p>
<p>Namecheap, an ICANN accredited registrar that supports the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the open internet, has existed for over 22 years, and their reputation for dependable and affordable domain services aligns with our dedication to providing users with more choice in managing their digital presence.</p>
<p>Here’s what this means for you:</p>
 
 Custom Bluesky handle. Set your new domain as your username in Bluesky with just a few clicks. 
 Easy domain purchasing. Simply type in your desired domain and browse the listed options to purchase your desired domain. 
 Increased privacy. Bluesky offers an additional layer of privacy protection by acting as your domain registrar agent. We do not register your personal information with the WHOIS directory, which is a searchable database that holds information on domain ownership. 
 Convenient domain management. Manage your domain settings and configurations within Bluesky. 
 Email forwarding. Emails sent to your domain can be easily forwarded to an email address of your choice. 
 URL forwarding Your domain will redirect to your Bluesky profile or URL of your choice. 
 
<p><br><br>
Buying a domain through Bluesky does not lock you in — you will still be able to transfer your domain away if you wish.</p>
<p>We’re excited to provide domain management as our first service. We’re also exploring other services that we can bundle to users to provide a more seamless experience. You can read more about our business plan <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">here</a>, and more about why we use custom domains as handles <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
 Great! How do I get started? 
<p>Simply navigate to <a href="https://account.bsky.app">https://account.bsky.app</a> and login with your Bluesky account. From there, type in your desired domain to view the available options.</p>
<p>Here’s a demo of this process:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGpJjq186bc"></a></p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 19th June to 4th&nbsp;July <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>In this edition, we shine a spotlight on the significant regulatory strides we’ve seen in recent&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>From the UK recognizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity to the European Union adjusting bank regulations to incorporate cryptocurrencies to countries like Argentina and Thailand stepping up their game to align with international standards and tackle unique crypto challenges — the regulatory landscape is continuously evolving.</p><p>So, let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Regulation Takes Center Stage: A Global Update from the EU, Argentina, Thailand, and the&nbsp;UK <p>Advancements in cryptocurrency regulation are shaping the global financial landscape, with the European Union, Argentina, Thailand, and the United Kingdom taking significant strides in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Starting off with the European Union, a pivotal consensus has been reached to revise banking regulations, integrating new rules specifically for crypto assets. This reform, as per EU authorities, aims to harmoniously incorporate digital assets into the traditional financial system while mitigating potential risks associated with unbacked cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Moving over to Latin America, Argentina demonstrates a keen interest in adhering to international norms by planning to adopt the crypto regulations outlined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF is an international entity dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. This alignment signals Argentina’s commitment to meeting global standards and could potentially improve its chances of securing a financial aid package from the International Monetary&nbsp;Fund.</p><p>In Asia, Thailand is addressing its unique challenges by imposing fresh regulations on companies providing crypto services. This development comes in the wake of a significant crisis in the crypto lending market in 2022. Under the new rules, companies are barred from investing or lending customers’ money, and the emphasis is on comprehensive risk disclosure to customers prior to providing services.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Kingdom marks a pivotal moment in its financial regulatory history by legitimizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity. This legal transformation underscores the country’s support for the safe and regulated use of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Now let’s look into two of these most important developments in detail and explore their impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p> EU’s Regulatory Revision: Analyzing the Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The European Union’s proposed changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive signal a critical juncture in the integration of crypto assets within the traditional financial system. This significant regulatory shift is aimed at bolstering the resilience of EU banks while acknowledging the growing influence of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The new regulations include a “transitional prudential regime for crypto assets,” a clear nod to digital currencies. However, an initial high-risk weightage on free-floating cryptocurrencies may deter banks from embracing crypto. This stance softened with a more lenient proposal for regulated stablecoins, hinting at a gradual acceptance of these digital currencies.</p><p>These changes can be viewed as a double-edged sword for the crypto ecosystem. On the upside, formal regulations lend legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, potentially spurring their mainstream integration. Yet, the high-risk weightage could dampen innovation and concentrate power among larger institutions capable of bearing regulatory costs.</p><p>Although the regulatory text is pending approval, the emerging outline indicates a significant, if challenging, path ahead for the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> UK Government Greenlights Crypto Trading, Makes it a Regulated Financial Activity <p>The UK government has made a strategic move, recognizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The law, now enacted after Royal Assent, officially views cryptocurrencies as “cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights.”</p><p>Although significant, this development comes with its own national and international challenges and opportunities. For instance, local industry stakeholders must adapt to the new regulatory landscape while maintaining a user-friendly environment.</p><p>Potentially, this could ignite a global race as more and more countries join the fray to stake their claim in the crypto world. Indeed, the UK’s move could inspire other nations to follow suit, shaping the future of global crypto regulations.</p><p>In contrast, the downside of this decision reveals that greater regulation could mean lesser autonomy for crypto entities, which may deter some investors. While the intention is to bolster security, it could also inadvertently stifle innovation due to the strict compliance requirements.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report: Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliance-spotlight-unraveling-the-eus-new-transfer-of-funds-regulation">Compliance Spotlight: Unraveling the EU’s New Transfer of Funds Regulation</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1674788547990278148?s=20">#DiscoverShyft Campaign Wrap&nbsp;up</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Revolutionizing Food Supply Chains:<br>
The UNISOT Reversed Marketplace Solution 
<p>In a dynamic partnership with Amped/<a href="https://unisot.com/short-food-supply-chain/">Local2Local</a>, UNISOT is shaking up conventional supply chains by introducing a Reversed Marketplace solution – an innovative platform that connects consumers directly to local farmers and producers, thereby fostering sustainable Short Food Supply Chains.</p>
 Shortening the Distance Between Producers and Consumers 
<p>The Reversed Marketplace solution has the potential to drastically transform the way consumers source their food. Instead of relying on traditional retail outlets, consumers can now place direct orders and make advance payments for the products they desire. This model instigates farmers to cultivate to order, creating a supply chain that is responsive to consumer demands and beneficial to the local economy and community.</p>
<p>By eliminating the need for traditional distribution channels, which often impose high fees and squeeze the profit margins for producers, the UNISOT Reversed Marketplace empowers local producers to sell their products directly to consumers. This model not only reduces waste and lowers costs, but it also leads to higher quality products and enhances sustainability.</p>
 A Win-Win for Producers and Consumers 
<p>The direct-to-consumer model offers substantial benefits for local producers. By bypassing intermediaries, they can avoid the additional costs associated with distribution, marketing and other overhead expenses. This increased profitability offers financial stability for local producers, enabling them to reinvest in their businesses and refine their production practices. Consequently, consumers gain access to fresher, locally sourced food products.</p>
 
 
     
 
 Connecting local consumers with local farmers,<br>
creating Short Food Supply Chains. 
 Public Blockchain Technology: The Backbone of the Reversed Marketplace 
<p>The UNISOT Reversed Marketplace is underpinned by public blockchain technology, which ensures a transparent, traceable supply chain. Consumers can trace the products they purchase back to the farm where they were grown, instilling trust and confidence in the products they consume.</p>
<p>Public Blockchain technology is used to secure transactions made through the platform, guaranteeing the integrity of the payment process and protecting against potential fraud. Moreover, the technology provides real-time data about the status and location of products in the supply chain, leading to more efficient distribution.</p>
<p>The UNISOT solutions provide the infrastructure that allows for efficient tracking and tracing of products from farmers to consumers. This secure, transparent, and decentralized solution is enhancing the reliability of the supply chain by ensuring all stakeholders have access to the same, immutable information.</p>
 The Future of Food Supply Chains 
<p>The collaboration between UNISOT and Local2Local is revolutionizing the food supply chain industry. Through the Reversed Marketplace, farmers receive the capital they need to produce, while consumers can influence what is produced based on their preferences. This direct model ensures fair prices for producers and quality products for consumers, setting a new standard for sustainability and trust in food supply chains.</p>
<p>With its potential for significant economic, social, and environmental impacts, the UNISOT Reversed Marketplace is paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable food system.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Benjamin Franklin, the famous American statesman (happy 4th of July, by the way!), once claimed: “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”. Well, nowadays, there is another certainty for every organization in the world – eventually it will be hacked. If yours has not yet been attacked by cybercriminals, then it can easily happen tomorrow or even worse: it might have already happened, but you just haven’t found out yet.</p>
<p>Statistics from around the world clearly show that data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other kinds of cyberthreats are on the rise, and the cost of dealing with their consequences is increasing as well, despite companies investing more in cybersecurity solutions. Combined with the ongoing shortage of qualified staff to use those tools, it is completely unsurprising that everyone has high hopes for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, which promise to reshape the entire field of cybersecurity and finally tip the scale in favor of cyber defenders. According to some predictions, this market will grow nearly tenfold by 2030.</p>
<p>With the latest developments in areas like generative networks and large language models, some of the new tricks AI tools are able to perform look so impressive even for seasoned IT experts that the public perception of AI has quickly shifted from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mme2Aya_6Bc">I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I cannot do that</a>” to “<a href="https://angryemailtranslator.com/">Can ChatGPT help me be nice to my coworkers?</a>”. And while I’m not going to comment on ethical implications of that, at the very least we need a small reality check on the current and potential capabilities of AI tools in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>First, let’s get one thing out of the way: there is no such thing as “The Artificial Intelligence”. Even leaving aside the philosophical dispute about the nature of human intelligence (hint: we still don’t really know how it works), the very idea that AI is one thing, technology, or process is profoundly wrong. The academic field of AI research is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/ai-landscape-more-complicated-than-you-might-have-thought">very complex and diverse</a>, with numerous methods and algorithms suited for different applications. Perhaps the only common thing among all modern AI technologies is their enormous appetite for hardware resources and demand for huge datasets for training.</p>
<p>So, what are the most relevant applications of AI-related technologies to the field of cybersecurity? Well, the lowest-hanging fruit is pattern recognition and anomaly detection in a stream of security events (such as the telemetry collected from endpoint devices, server logs, or cloud services). Even the most basic unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques can find outliers and thus identify potentially suspicious behaviors, thus massively reducing the number of statistical noise and improving the productivity of security analysts. Clustering methods help group events together based on their similarity and thus recognize ongoing attack timelines instead of single data points.</p>
<p>More sophisticated methods rely on training ML models with data from past incidents and do not just identify anomalies but align them to known malicious tactics and techniques (like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>), thus helping classify incidents and measure their risks much better. The biggest downside of such methods is collecting enough quality data for training – thus, large vendors with massive global telemetry networks usually lead in this field.</p>
<p>These AI techniques are perhaps the most popular in modern cybersecurity tools – most endpoint solutions use them in conjunction with traditional methods to detect malware, identify suspicious user behavior, and even to stop destructive activities of ransomware. Whenever you see a “Powered by ML” label on a product box, this is what most vendors actually mean. Unfortunately, their exact capabilities can vary significantly – some early AI-powered antivirus solutions <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-claim-they-bypassed-cylances-ai-based-antivirus/">could easily be tricked</a> by hackers.</p>
<p>A more recent and sophisticated class of AI techniques is based on neural networks originally designed to perform tasks like image recognition. These deep learning-based solutions can be trained to identify other kinds of complex patterns and features in, for example, binary code or network traffic instead. They have been applied successfully in modern intrusion detection systems or application security solutions that can identify obfuscated malicious code without the need to execute it dynamically first.</p>
<p>The area of e-mail security requires a completely different approach. While even the early anti-spam solutions have utilized some primitive kind of machine learning to identify unwanted mails, preventing modern social engineering attacks and business e-mail compromise requires a much higher degree of sophistication. This is where natural language processing technology (NLP) comes to the rescue. NLP has been used, for example, to identify the sentiment of an e-mail or to check whether it is likely to have been written by the person it appears to have come from. The same technologies are also widely used by brand reputation management solutions.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a> (LLM) – the technology behind tools like ChatGPT – have been the focus of public interest. Trained on enormous datasets from various sources, they can generate texts in multiple languages that not only look like they were written by a human, but actually make sense, at least most of the time. Combined with NLP, they enable the creation of chatbots that are potentially indistinguishable from humans, easily passing the famous Turing test. These intelligent chatbots enable truly unique possibilities for cybersecurity as well, allowing analysts to perform tasks like threat hunting, incident analysis, and even preventing future attacks just by talking to an AI assistant. It must be stressed, however, that general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT are not sufficiently trained to perform mission-critical jobs like this. Specialized solutions for industries like healthcare or cybersecurity are being developed, with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">promising early results</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, however impressive these developments are, ChatGPT is not the holy grail of cybersecurity automation. What many analysts are dreaming about is a solution that is not only smart enough to identify and analyze security incidents, but can also deal with them autonomously, with human involvement reduced to a minimum (ideally, to making only critical decisions, completely spared from the tedious job of reacting to every boring alert). Interestingly, this is perhaps the most controversial area of AI applications, with many people still afraid of letting AIs make their own decisions. However, most people usually agree that letting robots take over the most boring stuff like patching, performance tuning, and maintenance is perfectly fine, and some vendors already have <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/">working solutions for that</a>.</p>
<p>So, what should we expect from the latest AI innovations in the field of cybersecurity? Will ChatGPT soon replace all human security experts? I seriously doubt that. If your job can be completely replaced by an automated tool (like the job of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/german-tabloid-bild-to-replace-range-of-editorial-jobs-with-ai">journalist writing for a tabloid newspaper</a>), you should probably reconsider your career choice, but I do believe that in cybersecurity, the risks and priorities are still somewhat different. Instead, you should be looking for tools that improve your productivity and leave you more time for critical decisions and creative tasks.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the latest trends in cybersecurity and in meeting real experts, we are planning a conference devoted entirely to this subject. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Check out cyberevolution</a> this November – perhaps we will see you then in Frankfurt, Germany!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Existing feature changes&nbsp; 
<p>Improved experience for managing passwords in My Security Info&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning October 2023 through a phased rollout, we're improving the end user experience of managing passwords and providing the capability to do so in the My Security Info management portal (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmysignins.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity-info&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cv-vidhianand%40microsoft.com%7C3de2bd951c21480e592708db62f85b6b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638212591060798838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=pUMIpaz4LDa%2BLQBdNBukhIb6c7iEcSQMY7yG8oBQVyE%3D&amp;reserved=0">My Sign-Ins | Security Info | Microsoft.com</a>). Users will be able to change their password, and users that are capable of multifactor authentication (MFA) will be able to reset their passwords in My Security Info. By December 2023, the legacy experience to change passwords will be redirected to the new experience. This change will occur automatically for all customers and no action needs to be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introducing voice OTP&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voice call is our least secure authentication method; there are far <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods">better ways of doing MFA</a>, including Microsoft Authenticator (which offers both MFA and Passwordless options), or even better: Windows Hello for Business.&nbsp; Although we encourage everyone to move away from voice, we’re making security improvements to the voice call method for those that are dependent on it. Rather than confirming the authentication by pressing “#” a one-time passcode (OTP) will be read out to the user during the voice call. We’ll introduce voice OTP as part of the “Phone OTP” authentication method, which will be an evolution of today’s SMS authentication method. This authentication method will have two delivery methods (SMS and voice OTP) and as such allows for delivery method optimization. You’ll be able to migrate from traditional voice to voice OTP, and we recommend you do so, as traditional voice will be deprecated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting July 2023, all new tenants using Azure AD free licenses will have this new optimized channel. For existing tenants using Azure AD free licenses, we will begin rolling out this feature from early August. Customers with Azure AD Premium licenses will follow, once all the configurability in the Phone OTP authentication method is available. We’ll share timelines over the course of the next few months in another public announcement. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a> where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their specific organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration campaign improvements &nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Azure AD tenants that are Microsoft-managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning July 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change starting with tenants with Azure AD free licenses and progressing to all organizations worldwide. We will share timelines in another public announcement. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their specific organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPv6 enablement in Azure AD may impact users&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPv6 rollout ends on June 30th across all Microsoft regions, which may impact Azure AD customers. Your users might experience blocks or receive more MFA requests than usual. In such cases, we recommend reviewing your tenant’s sign-in logs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This impact on your tenant could be due to end users connecting from IPv6 ranges that are not configured in your tenant’s Named Locations. To address this, please follow the steps outlined on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition#identifying-ipv6-traffic-with-azure-ad-sign-in-activity-reports">this page</a> to identify IPv6 ranges in your tenant’s environment and configure the necessary settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please share the following guidance with the relevant members of your IT administration team:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement and Powershell Module Deprecation&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">announced the deprecation</a> of the Azure AD Graph service, and we have <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">communicated</a> that Azure AD Graph will stop functioning at some point after June 30, 2023. We’ve also previously communicated that three legacy PowerShell modules (Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online) would be deprecated on June 30, 2023. We understand that many customers are not yet complete with these migrations, and we confirm our continued commitment to work with our customers during this migration period to minimize and avoid impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve published updates on timelines and details for the Azure AD Graph retirement process and PowerShell module deprecation. The details can be read <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 PowerShell: We recognize that some scenarios supported by the legacy PowerShell modules are not yet available in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, and we have postponed the deprecation date for the legacy PowerShell modules to March 30, 2024, accordingly. 
 Azure AD Graph: As of June 30, 2023, we are entering a retirement cycle for Azure AD Graph. There will be no impact on applications on June 30, but Azure AD Graph APIs do not have SLA or maintenance commitments beyond security-related fixes. We’re committing to retiring Azure AD Graph in incremental steps, with three months of advance notice for each step. The first step of retirement will involve preventing newly created applications from using Azure AD Graph. Our next update will provide a timeline and details of this step.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly encourage all customers to prioritize migrating applications using Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph APIs and begin planning for migrating PowerShell scripts using the legacy modules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upcoming change in B2B sign-in experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, when a B2B guest user is prompted to sign in to a resource tenant, the background and logo branding reflects that of the resource tenant. As soon as the B2B guest enters their User Principal Name (UPN), the logo will change to that of the home tenant, but the background branding remains the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is working on changing this branding experience for cross-tenant collaboration authentication requests. In the new experience, when a B2B guest user is prompted to sign in, after entering the UPN, they’ll be redirected to their home tenant login page, and the branding experience will reflect that of the home tenant instead of the resource tenant. After successfully signing in, the user will be signed into the app in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to roll out this change starting July 2023 and complete by October 2023, and there are no actions that need to be taken.

  The recent FATF report identifies significant issues with most Travel Rule solutions, particularly their difficulty in capturing and relaying data in real-time and their limited scope that cannot accommodate the full range of digital&nbsp;assets.  The FATF report also highlights the lack of interoperability among various Travel Rule solutions, leading to operational complexities and increased compliance costs for&nbsp;VASPs.  Shyft Veriscope, an advanced Travel Rule solution, addresses these challenges through automated detection, comprehensive data retention, and strategic interoperability with other solutions for effective global compliance.  <p>In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory compliance is both a central focus and a complex challenge. As Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) strive to keep pace with these developments, they also have to grapple with the intricacies of global standards. This struggle highlights the delicate equilibrium between innovation and regulation in this evolving&nbsp;domain.</p><p>One such standard is the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, which poses a unique set of challenges that VASPs must address effectively.</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule, whose intended goal is to instill transparency in virtual asset transactions, requires VASPs to gather and share specific user information about transactions. And although the principle behind the rule is simple — greater transparency leads to greater security — putting this into practice while preserving the blockchain privacy ethos, presents a substantial challenge.</p><p>Various solutions have surfaced in the market to address these challenges, assisting VASPs in the multifaceted task of gathering, storing, and sharing the necessary user information for Travel Rule compliance. Yet, even with these existing tools at hand, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/June2023-Targeted-Update-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.pdf">the recent FATF report</a> underscores critical issues prevalent in many of these solutions, some of which are deeply rooted in the fundamental nature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The Issues With Most Travel Rule Solutions</p><p>The FATF report notes that given the speed and scope of digital asset transactions, existing solutions may struggle to capture and relay information in real-time. Furthermore, these solutions might not be able to retain transmitted data adequately, making record-keeping and transaction monitoring a difficult task.</p><p>Another issue with most Travel Rule solutions, as pointed out in the FATF report, is their limited scope. As such, virtual assets encompass a broad spectrum of digital currencies and tokens, and not all solutions can accommodate the full range of these assets. This lack of comprehensive coverage leads to gaps in compliance, making it challenging for VASPs to adhere to FATF standards fully.</p><p>The report also highlights the pressing issue of interoperability: the ability of various Travel Rule Solutions to work in unison. It noted that many Travel Rule Solutions operate in isolation, hindering a streamlined approach to compliance across different platforms and jurisdictions. This lack of integration contributes to operational complexity, ultimately driving up compliance costs for&nbsp;VASPs.</p>(<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/June2023-Targeted-Update-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.pdf">Image Source</a>)<p>Given these challenges, the FATF has presented a series of questions that VASPs must consider when choosing a Travel Rule solution. These include understanding the timing and scope of data submission, methods of counterparty identification, due diligence procedures, and data retention capabilities. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with the Travel Rule, thereby helping VASPs operate securely and transparently.</p><p>Navigating the world of Travel Rule compliance is no simple task, but it is a necessary one. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, compliance will become an increasingly significant marker of a VASP’s credibility and success. Understanding the intricacies of the FATF’s Travel Rule and choosing a comprehensive, interoperable solution will be key in this endeavor.</p> The Solution? Shyft Veriscope <p>In the context of the FATF outlined challenges, Shyft Veriscope comes as the only one that successfully addresses all of them and even more — it is the only frictionless Travel Rule solution in the blockchain space.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper into how Shyft Veriscope distinguishes itself in the crowded space of Travel Rule solutions. Beyond the basic criteria of compliance, it provides a level of sophistication and automation that other solutions fail to&nbsp;match.</p><p>Veriscope’s distinct set of features not only address the immediate concerns highlighted by the FATF but also anticipate future challenges and opportunities in the digital assets&nbsp;space.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the differentiating aspects of Shyft Veriscope and how they seamlessly tackle the complex requirements of the FATF Travel Rule, making it the go-to solution for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Fully Automated <p>One of the key issues identified by the FATF report is the lack of an automated system for VASP discovery at an entity level. However, unlike most existing solutions, Shyft Veriscope enables VASPs to auto-detect counterparty VASPs in real-time using just the crypto wallet address. This eliminates the need for users to input additional information or VASPs to publicize their wallet addresses.</p><p>Moreover, Shyft Veriscope’s automated address proofing ensures the accuracy of the identified VASP, thereby reducing the risk of accidental data breaches. It also provides a robust framework for VASPs to reliably identify counterparty VASPs at a legal entity/jurisdiction level, allowing them to make informed decisions based on their risk-based approach.</p> Data Retention and Comprehensive Coverage <p>In addition to real-time detection, Shyft Veriscope facilitates comprehensive data retention, which is critical for record-keeping or transaction monitoring purposes, in line with the FATF guidelines. It enables VASPs to ‘hold’ originator and beneficiary information on their own servers rather than on third-party ones, making this information available upon request to the appropriate authorities.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope can also handle transactions involving all types of virtual assets and transactions of any amount. This broad capability supports the FATF requirement that accurate information must be transmitted for transactions over USD/EUR 1000 involving any type of VA or fiat currency.</p><p>This is an important feature, as the FATF guidelines permit individual jurisdictions to set their own minimum thresholds. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan has set a higher threshold of $3000</a> at which the FATF Travel Rule is triggered.</p><p>Despite these variances, Shyft Veriscope is equipped to adapt and comply with the unique regulations of each jurisdiction, demonstrating its global relevance and applicability.</p> Peer-to-Peer Data Transfers <p>Shyft Veriscope doesn’t stop there. Recognizing the lack of a standardized framework for secure data transfers between VASPs, Shyft Network has engineered a mechanism for peer-to-peer, VASP-to-VASP data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This ensures that user data is transferred securely, with no third-party servers involved, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or wide-scale data breaches.</p><p>It also fully complies with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">major data privacy laws such as the GDPR</a>, reinforcing its commitment to user privacy. However, addressing the challenges of the present is only half the&nbsp;battle.</p> Interoperability <p>In a landscape as dynamic as the virtual assets industry, preparing for the future is equally crucial. This is where Shyft Veriscope’s strategic approach to interoperability takes center&nbsp;stage.</p><p>Recognizing the barriers that lack of cross-system collaboration can erect, Shyft Veriscope has entered into strategic partnerships with various Travel Rule Solutions and blockchain analytics providers, including Sygna, Notabene, Crystal Blockchain, and Coinfirm, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>By facilitating seamless interactions between diverse solutions, Shyft Veriscope is fostering a truly global network of compliant VASPs. These partnerships embody the spirit of interoperability that is integral to a comprehensive compliance solution.</p> Sunrise Issue: A Major Challenge and Shyft Veriscope’s Innovative Solution <p>Shining a light on a critical obstacle addressed in the FATF report, we now turn our attention to what’s widely known as the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.”</p><p>While the sunrise symbolizes a new day, ushering in light and clarity, in the world of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), the “Sunrise Issue” brings about more shadows than light. This issue essentially stems from the diverse timelines adopted by different jurisdictions for implementing the FATF’s Travel Rule, and the resultant compliance chaos it creates in an inherently borderless and international virtual asset landscape.</p><p>VASPs in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule has been adopted — referred to as “sunrise jurisdictions” — grapple with immense challenges when executing transactions with VASPs in “non-sunrise jurisdictions.” These are jurisdictions that have not yet enforced the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>This creates an asymmetry, as one VASP may be legally required to collect and transmit specific customer information while the other might not, impairing the ability of the former to execute transactions in a fully compliant manner.</p><p>The Sunrise Issue brings to light a key question: How can a VASP in a sunrise jurisdiction remain compliant while transacting with a VASP in a non-sunrise jurisdiction? Well, the key to solve this issue is Shyft Veriscope.</p> How Shyft Veriscope Solves the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue? <p>Utilizing an approach known as “historic lookback,” Veriscope enables VASPs to retrieve information on any transaction, regardless of when it occurred, even if the receiving VASP hadn’t implemented a Travel Rule solution at the time of the transaction.</p><p>When a VASP joins the network, it can receive historical requests and respond with the necessary information. This feature allows VASPs to be compliant when processing transactions, no matter when their counterparty VASPs begin using a Travel Rule solution or where they operate across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Veriscope’s approach to resolving the Sunrise Issue is akin to enabling someone to see and appreciate a sunrise, even if they weren’t awake when it happened. It does this by allowing transactions to occur based on the sender’s timeline and then retroactively generating the supporting material that shows the receiver is compliant when they ‘wake up’ to their Travel Rule obligations.</p><p>Overall, Shyft Network’s innovative approach to Travel Rule compliance builds on the principles of privacy, security, and AML, aligning with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>By presenting a comprehensive solution to the problems VASPs face in implementing the FATF Travel Rule, Shyft Veriscope proves to be more than just a compliance tool — it’s a step towards a safer and more secure future for the virtual asset ecosystem.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Over the past quarter, we have been tirelessly working behind the scenes to offer new product releases, features, and enhancements based on customer feedback. We also announced our latest partnership with Merit Protocol to reduce loan underwriting costs, sponsored a decentralized identity hackathon, and presented at the Internet Identity Workshop Conference in California.</p><p>Check out all the highlights below.</p> New Partnership  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/merit-protocol-and-dock-partnership/">Merit Protocol and Dock Collaborate to Reduce Loan Underwriting Costs</a> <p>Merit Protocol, a platform that connects employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services, has integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology in their system. </p><p>By using Verifiable Credentials, Merit Protocol will enable employers to issue fraud-proof and instantly verifiable employment history and income data in a privacy-preserving way. It is anticipated that this will reduce the cost of the loan application process by up to 10 times.</p> New Product Features and Releases  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-releases-custom-credential-template-builder/">Dock Certs Release: No-Code Custom Credential Template Builder</a> <p>This feature enables users to create custom credential templates to accommodate their specific needs and a variety of use cases including identity documents, membership associations, and professional licenses. </p><p>Benefits of the Custom Credential Template Builder</p>  Efficient: Organizations can easily create custom credentials without knowing any code  Cost-effective: The no-code solution increases savings by reducing the need to hire developers to build a custom solution  Reliable data: Verifying organizations such as employers or financial institutions can be assured that the data on the custom credentials is reliable   <a href="https://blog.dock.io/sorting-and-filtering-credentials/">New Dock Wallet Feature: Sorting and Filtering Credentials</a> <p>These features make it easier for users to find and manage their digital credentials.</p> <a href="https://blog.dock.io/send-verifiable-credentials-directly-to-recipients/">Dock Certs Release: Send Credentials Directly to Recipients’ Dock Wallet and Email</a><br> <p>Issuers can now conveniently send credentials directly from the Dock Certs platform to recipients’ emails and Dock Wallet. This feature will help them save time, improve efficiency, and ensure the secure delivery of credentials.</p> <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/white-label-digital-identity-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">White Label Digital Identity Wallet Solution</a> <p>With Dock’s white label wallet, organizations can simply customize Dock’s pre-built digital wallet rather than investing a lot of time, money, and resources developing their own wallet from scratch for their users. </p><p>Benefits of Dock’s White Label Wallet</p>  Easy integration to get faster to market  Helps with data compliance  Automatic wallet updates  Cost-effective  Enhanced security and privacy   <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-introduces-threshold-signatures-for-secure-multi-party-credential-transactions/">Dock Introduces Threshold Signatures for Secure Multi-Party Credential Transactions</a> <p>Threshold signatures are a type of digital signature that requires the agreement of multiple parties, rather than just one, on the credential being signed in order for it to be issued to a recipient. This makes them useful in a wide range of applications, from identity management to safety inspections. </p><p>Use case examples</p>  Distributed identity management systems  Product approvals  Health and safety inspections  Petition systems   <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/dock-sub-accounts?ref=blog.dock.io">Sub-Accounts Feature</a> <p>The sub-accounts feature was built and designed based on feedback from Dock’s customers.</p><p>The ability to create sub-accounts is an important feature for many organizations because it provides them with enhanced security, better data segregation, and improved user management capabilities. Sub-accounts are often used by organizations (resellers) offering digital identity and Verifiable Credential features and services to their own customers on their platforms. </p><p>Benefits of Sub-Accounts</p>  Improved data segregation for reports and billing  Increased security and privacy  Easier auditing  Easier to securely delete user data   Events  Dock Sponsored the Decentralized Identity Hackathon did:hack  <p><a href="http://didhack.xyz/?ref=blog.dock.io">did:hack</a> took place on June 5-8 where 140 participants worked on decentralized identity projects. As a sponsor, Dock gave a presentation about Verifiable Credentials, and answered questions from participants. It was wonderful connecting with people who are excited about building decentralized identity solutions.</p> <a href="https://blog.dock.io/highlights-from-the-internet-identity-workshop/">Dock Presented at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> <p>Dock CEO, Nick Lambert, and COO, Elina Cadouri, joined the 36th bi-annual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) on April 18-20, 2023 in California. IIW is a community-driven event that brings together a diverse group of individuals interested in digital identity.</p><p>Among over 300 participants, Nick and Elina met with representatives from government, companies, and researchers. </p><p>Nick and Elina did a demo of the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs Web App</a>, our no-code Verifiable Credentials platform, and they got great feedback and engagement. Some people were even surprised to see a no-code solution that non-technical people can conveniently use because many of the current products on the market are mainly used by developers.</p><p>Key topics that were discussed:</p>  Governments’ digital identity strategies  Product market fit for decentralized identity and Verifiable Credential technology  AI impacts on the industry   What’s in Store for Q3? <p>Check out <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap?ref=blog.dock.io">our roadmap</a> to stay up-to-date with our innovative solutions and see the evolution of our offerings.</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=dock-blog">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently, securely, and at a lower cost.

     <p>Further to our update last week on <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/uk-government-u-turns-on-cryptoasset-financial-promotion-regime/">His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT’s) revised approach</a> to the cryptoasset financial promotions regime, the<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/cryptoasset-firms-marketing-uk-consumers-must-get-ready-financial-promotions-regime"> Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has now published</a> an update reminding cryptoasset firms to prepare for the changes.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The route to approve a financial promotion – whether a UK-registered or overseas firm – are set out as below:</p> 
     <p>“Subject to Parliamentary approval, when the regime comes into force, there will be four routes to communicating cryptoasset promotions to UK consumers:</p> 
       
       The promotion is communicated by an FCA-authorized person.<br><br>  
       The promotion is made by an unauthorized person but approved by an FCA-authorized person. Legislation is currently making its way through Parliament which, if made, would introduce a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995565/HMT_WR_113_Consultation_Response.pdf">regulatory gateway</a> that authorized firms will need to pass through in order to approve financial promotions for unauthorized persons.<br><br>  
       The promotion is communicated by a cryptoasset business registered under the MLRs with the FCA.<br><br>  
       The promotion otherwise complies with the conditions of an exemption in the Financial Promotion Order.”  
       
     <p>Route three above would be the typical method for a UK-registered crypto firm to approve a promotion. Cryptoasset firms that are already registered under the MLRs will be able to communicate their own financial promotions for cryptoassets, subject to complying with the conditions of the exemption and the relevant FCA rules. They will not have to apply for any further permissions to communicate their own promotions.</p> 
     <p>In line with existing restrictions to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents">Financial and Services and Markets Act (FSMA)</a>, financial promotions that are not made using one of these routes will be in breach of Section 21 of the legislation. This is a criminal offence punishable by up to two years imprisonment.</p> 
     <p>We recommend that firms seeking FCA registration have a clearly documented process for approving a financial promotion, and an identified responsible person for oversight and control of this process.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Existing UK-registered crypto firms should also take a similar approach to documenting their process and allocate responsibility.</p> 
     <p>The FCA clarifies that it will assess as part of its “fit and proper” assessment:</p> 
       
       When making a fit and proper assessment, the FCA will consider not only the fit and proper nature of the persons responsible for running the firm, but also the financial promotions associated with that firm.<br><br>  
       The company should be able to meet its requirements at the point of application (i.e. systems controls and an identified responsible person). <br><br>  
       As part of this assessment, the FCA will also consider whether the company is carrying on “business in the UK”. The strict obligations have not changed, but because the assessment now includes the activity of approving financial promotions, the regulator may set a higher standard for requiring firms to be established in the UK to ensure supervisory oversight.  
       
     <p>The FCA website provides help with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/register">registration process</a> and <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/feedback-good-poor-quality-applications">feedback on good and poor quality applications</a>. Also, see here for our<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/the-fca-s-cryptoasset-aml-ctf-regime-applications-feedback-what-you-need-to-know/"> comments on the FCA’s “good and poor” quality applications</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fueling Web3 Expansion and Decentralized Identity Solutions</p><p>Welcome, Ontology community! As we approach the half-way point of 2023, it’s time to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the MainNet launch, and reflect on the progress we’ve made so far and the exciting developments that await us in the remainder of the&nbsp;year.</p> Recent Developments <p>Over the past year we have made significant strides in our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-roadmap-2023-8f48e0ae3a71">roadmap</a>, and have been relentless in our pursuit of removing barriers and creating a more open and accessible Web3 experience for developers and users alike. We are proud to highlight some of our notable achievements:</p><p>Fostering Collaboration: Through the incubation of <a href="https://goshen.network/">Goshen Network</a>, a layer 2 Optimistic roll-up, we have brought Ontology and Ethereum developers closer together. This collaboration breaks down silos, promotes interoperability, and expands the possibilities for decentralized applications, unlocking new frontiers in Web3 innovation.</p><p>Empowering Stakers: We have made significant enhancements to our <a href="https://node.ont.io/">staking ecosystem</a>, focusing on clarity, ease of use, and increased accessibility. Our efforts have resulted in a revamped user experience that simplifies the staking process, empowering users to actively participate in securing the network and earn rewards. Additionally, our ongoing development of liquid staking (stONT) provides flexibility and liquidity, allowing users to maximize the potential of their staked ONT&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Optimizing Performance: With a commitment to continuous improvement, we have achieved remarkable milestones in optimizing Ontology’s infrastructure. The completion of ONT staking optimization ensures a seamless and efficient staking experience for all participants. Our ongoing efforts in high ledger memory usage optimization and EVM bloom bit index optimization are aimed at enhancing performance, scalability, and overall network efficiency, further solidifying our commitment to providing an open and high-performing Web3 environment.</p> Partnerships and Collaborations <p>Ontology’s commitment to empowering users and developers in the world of decentralized technologies is evident through our strategic partnerships and collaborations. These initiatives open up new possibilities and enhance the Ontology ecosystem in various&nbsp;ways.</p><p>iZUMi Finance: Ontology has joined forces with <a href="https://izumi.finance/home">iZUMi Finance</a>, a DeFi protocol providing a decentralized exchange for the Ontology EVM. This collaboration aims to facilitate the seamless swap of ONG to ONT, simplifying the user experience within the decentralized exchange. By working together, Ontology and iZUMi Finance are empowering users to navigate the world of decentralized finance and unlock new opportunities.</p><p>Alchemy Pay: To further enhance accessibility and usability, Ontology has partnered with <a href="https://alchemypay.org/">Alchemy Pay</a>, a leading crypto payment gateway. This collaboration offers convenient on-ramp solutions, as well as allowing users to seamlessly convert their digital assets into real-world purchases. By integrating Alchemy Pay’s payment infrastructure, Ontology users can enjoy frictionless transactions and expand the utility of their cryptocurrencies across a diverse range of merchants.</p><p>ONTO Wallet: Serving as the gateway to owning and controlling your decentralized identity (DID), <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO Wallet</a> allows users to securely manage their digital identities across multiple platforms. With ONTO Wallet, individuals have full control over their personal data and can seamlessly interact with decentralized applications. It acts as a key component in realizing the vision of self-sovereign identity, putting users in charge of their digital presence.</p><p>Orange Protocol: Building on top of the robust foundation provided by <a href="https://ont.id/">ONT ID</a>, <a href="https://www.orangeprotocol.io/">Orange Protocol</a> takes decentralized identity a step further by introducing cross-chain reputation management. By leveraging the capabilities of ONT ID, Orange Protocol enables the establishment and verification of reputations across different blockchain networks. This breakthrough collaboration brings greater trust and transparency to the decentralized ecosystem, fostering a reliable environment for users and businesses alike.</p><p>These partnerships exemplify Ontology’s dedication to removing barriers for developers and users, making Web3 a more open and inclusive experience. By combining the power of ONTO Wallet, Orange Protocol, collaborations with industry leaders like Alchemy Pay, and the integration with iZUMi Finance, we are driving the adoption of decentralized technologies and paving the way for a decentralized future.</p><p>We also continue to encourage the development of partnerships via the <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">OntologyEVM Development Fund</a>. This fund provides vital support and resources to developers building on the Ontology EVM, ensuring the availability of cutting-edge tools, documentation, and technical assistance. By nurturing the development of EVM-based projects, we aim to foster innovation, expand interoperability, and drive the advancement of&nbsp;Web3.</p> Ontology Community Growth <p>We take pride in our growing and vibrant community. The MainNet now hosts 164 total dApps, and the total number of dApp-related transactions on MainNet broke 7.6 million. Our community engagement activities include the Weekly Community Call Series and Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Ontology Loyal Members​ — a great testament to the unwavering commitment demonstrated by our community.</p><p>As we move forward, we remain committed to our vision of a decentralized future where everyone has control over their own data. We are thankful for your continued support and are excited to see what the rest of 2023 holds for Ontology and the broader Web3 industry.</p> Conclusion <p>As we celebrate the 5th anniversary of Ontology’s MainNet launch, we reflect on our remarkable progress and the profound impact we have had on the Web3 industry. Over the past year, we have made significant strides in our roadmap, focusing on optimization, decentralized identity, and ecosystem development. Through strategic partnerships and collaborations, such as iZUMi Finance, Alchemy Pay, ONTO Wallet, and Orange Protocol, we have expanded possibilities, enhanced accessibility, and fostered trust in the decentralized ecosystem.</p><p>Looking ahead, Ontology remains dedicated to our vision of a decentralized future where individuals have control over their own data. We are committed to removing barriers for developers and users, creating a more open and inclusive Web3 experience.

<p>In this final blog in a 3-part series developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.samhallskontraktet.se/">Samhällskontraktet</a>, we want to share some of the things that didn’t go so well in the process. This work is dense, difficult and emotionally demanding. We feel that it is important to acknowledge that, so that we can improve our own work and set realistic expectations for others who might want to build on&nbsp;it.</p>  Throughout these blogs we are using the word citizen to represent the people who live in a country rather than as a statement of nationality or legal&nbsp;status.   Blog 3 (of 3): learning into the&nbsp;future <p>Recently we have given talks about the Cornerstone Indicators at the <a href="https://bmw-foundation.org/en/our-work/releadershipfest/">RE*Leadership Festival </a>in Copenhagen and the <a href="https://creativebureaucracy.org/">Creative Bureaucracy Festival</a> in Berlin. This has been a great privilege, but has also highlighted how rare it is to hear anyone speak about what went wrong in their projects. If you read books and listen to talks describing the numerous wonderfully successful initiatives, you would be forgiven for thinking that everything is on track. Perhaps we should all just relax and feel confident that the knotty problem of urgent systemic change is under control? Except it isn’t and the problem space continues to intensify. It is for this reason that we want to embrace our vulnerability and appeal for help in strengthening and scaling this work. We haven’t quite got it right yet, but we believe the underlying ethos of everyday politics¹ is a foundational requirement in the race to reclaim our&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@jontyson?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Jon Tyson</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> What did we&nbsp;learn? <p>Like anyone with an exciting new idea we quickly realised that not everyone would share our enthusiasm. People are busy. They also have their own ideas, value systems, constraints and goals. The five points that follow highlight some of the key challenges that we faced. We have also included some thoughts on how we might approach things differently in the future. We would be curious to know what you think or might&nbsp;suggest?</p><p>Local politicians: our initial assumption was that local politicians would be fully supportive of the project. This assumption came from a belief that the indicators we were planning to co-design, would be viewed as politically neutral and useful to multiple stakeholders. In reality, we found that there was an understandable level of resistance to the proposed strategy. This tension centred around concerns about raising unrealistic citizen expectations, together with potentially creating indicators that clashed with the mandates of elected politicians. In the future we plan to involve politicians early in the process with a quick initial survey about the project and then hold a workshop to explore their responses. We also think it will be important to clearly explain that the indicators chosen by their citizens will not conflict with their current policies and plans. Instead, encompassing the citizen’s views about wellbeing into their work should actually validate their actions. For example, if an indicator shows that citizens value cycling this does not mean that a new road cannot be constructed, but it would indicate that it should include designated cycling&nbsp;lanes.</p><p>Narrative: a strong learning point for us was the importance of having a clear and appealing narrative for the process that could be easily explained in a few sentences. We would suggest that future project leaders dedicate time early in the process, to think about who exactly their audience is and what success would look like. A further consideration is that there may be multiple narratives needed, for example one for the citizens and another for the local politicians.</p><p>Analytical rigour: we undertook both the EFA statistical analysis and the thematic mapping from the questionnaires and workshops ourselves. Within our team we have a talented statistician who was able to run this process for us, but we didn’t have the capacity to really drill into the finer detail. The initial results produced some interesting patterns that we think merit further investigation. In respect of the thematic analysis, we would acknowledge that our process could be strengthened to make it more robust and replicable for future teams. We would propose partnering with a university to develop this knowledge resource, so that results can be more effectively targeted to different scales of&nbsp;project.</p><p>Practical use: when we finished co-designing the indicators we realised that we hadn’t made detailed plans for how they would be used and monitored in practice. Whilst the process is important in its own right, we need a clearer pathway for how the indicators can be practically integrated into existing decision making structures. How for example could they be used to steer investment allocation decisions? Who should be responsible for keeping them up to date? How will the results be communicated to the citizens and what are the implications if they are getting better or&nbsp;worse?</p><p>Avoiding overload: we have been repeatedly asked why we are adding to the growing number of indicators that policy makers have to consider. This is understandable, because at a national level it is extremely difficult to continuously measure, consider and and compare data from multiple contexts. However, the Cornerstone Indicators are built on top of existing data points rather than creating new ones. Our challenge is therefore to make this interface function more easily understood, such as by presenting a clear link to existing frameworks such as the UN SDGs. In the future, we hope that we can develop this area of the work to create a natural mesh between citizen-led and state-led outcomes.</p><p>Despite the challenges outlined above, the energy and interest in the work is growing rapidly. This gives us the opportunity to really build and improve on this exploratory work. For example, we are endeavouring to address many of the above points in the design of the Canadian project. In Scotland, the focus of our work is to establish credible links from the ongoing community workshops back to policy making. We will share more about the progress of our work in both contexts later this&nbsp;year.</p> Some closing&nbsp;thoughts <p>At this point we are still grappling with a number of questions that we would like to invite others to join us in exploring:</p>  Are fully definable metrics (i.e. those that can be held to account) appropriate to quantify a thriving&nbsp;life?  <p>Recently we were approached by a colleague and asked how the Cornerstone Indicators could be used to set the targets for outcomes based investing. Our reaction was quite viscerally defensive, almost as if watching someone kick a small animal. This is interesting! One of the defining features of the Cornerstones is that they embody feelings and a sense of vitality that cannot be directly measured. We see this as hugely important in the fight against the commodification of life; the Cornerstones represent a numerical buffer against further elements of the natural world and human experience being sucked into financial targets.</p><p>2. How can we bridge existing capital (investment finance) into generalised vitality&nbsp;goals?</p><p>When we reduce living stocks and flows to a set of digits, financial accounts and budgets, we are creating an abstracted view of reality. If we can understand these tools as useful approximations then they clearly have merit, but more often than not we see them as hard, technical ‘truths’. When we look at the world in this way, it becomes harder to make good decisions. It also blocks investment into critical elements of society, such as preventative healthcare and coordinated climate adaptation infrastructure.</p><p>3. If GDP and the underlying profits that define it have driven us to the survivable edge of our current system, what is an appropriate goal for the next phase of human civilization?</p><p>In our opinion, anything less than collective thriving is an insufficient goal to strive for. This is both our motivation to continue this work and our challenge to you in&nbsp;yours.</p><p>We would welcome your thoughts and reactions and of course be delighted if you feel inspired to run a process in your own city or region. Please do get in touch if you would like to collaborate.</p><p><a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">Blog 1</a> and <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Blog 2 </a>are linked here for ease of reference.</p><p>This blog was co-authored by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) and Linnea Rönnquist <a href="http://linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se">(linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se)</a></p><p>References:</p>  The term everyday politics refers to community centred activities that reconnect citizens with public&nbsp;life.   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">Samhällskontraktet X Dark Matter Labs: The Cornerstone Indicators</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this second blog in a 3-part series we are expanding on the reasons behind the Cornerstone Indicator initiative. We are also grounding the concept in the results from the first prototype process, that was developed and run in tri-partnership with <a href="https://www.samhallskontraktet.se/">Samhällskontraktet</a> and the citizens of Västerås, Sweden.</p><p>* Throughout these blogs we are using the word citizen to represent the people who live in a country, rather than as a statement of nationality or legal&nbsp;status.</p> Blog 2 (of 3) Going deeper: why are we calling for a global movement of citizen empowerment and what could it look&nbsp;like? <p>In our introductory <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">blog </a>we made some bold statements about the need for widespread citizen involvement to drive the critical transitions ahead. Unfortunately the practices of community engagement and citizen participation are often viewed as soft options; a ‘nice to have’ in confirmation of existing policy initiatives or to inform small local decisions. We fundamentally reject this view for a number of&nbsp;reasons:</p><p>Firstly, our current power and governance dynamics are not working. Despite the numerous frameworks that set out aspirational aims (such as the UN SDGs), the unifying goal in our current system is still financial profit. Whilst on a personal level we might intrinsically consider factors such as health to be more important than financial profits, the political landscape has barely evolved to embed alternative metrics into critical decision making structures¹.</p><p>Secondly, many people are struggling to connect the challenges that they face in their daily lives to the structural issues that underpin them. This appears to be leading to increased levels of distrust and social fragmentation and consequently to previously unthinkable outcomes. For example, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/06/02/german-far-right-surges-in-polls-alarming-mainstream-parties">German polls</a> are showing that the neofascists of the AfD are the second most popular party in the country, whilst the corrosive effects of the <a href="https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/three-years-brexit-casts-long-shadow-over-uk-economy">Brexit vote</a> continue to unfold across Europe. Despite Sweden being a country which still has high levels of trust in its government² and a strong welfare system, they too have recently elected a right wing government. People are looking for something different and a lack of viable alternatives is opening the door to widespread authoritarianism.</p><p>Thirdly, a clear observation is that prevalent wellbeing policy initiatives such as Scotland’s National Performance Framework, New Zealand’s Wellbeing Budget and Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index have been designed using a top down approach. Experts have defined the dimensions of wellbeing (e.g. life satisfaction, access to green spaces and education) and these factors are then measured using standardised and universally applied metrics. If the people with the lived experience of the policy decisions being made on their behalf have no say in how they are measured and interpreted, then it is hardly surprising that shock election results continue to roll&nbsp;in.</p><p>These issues are complex, but one way to understand the situation is to view it as an imbalance in the democratic triangle:</p>  The Market: markets create many positive outcomes (for example, innovation and employment) but business leaders are not voted in to make decisions on behalf of the citizens;  The Nation State: a country’s Government has the authority to make and enforce laws and this authority is granted by the citizens. It can therefore direct the market towards things that society needs but would not otherwise be profitable (such as subsidies for green energy or the development of new medicines) and away from undesirable outcomes (e.g. fines for pollution or abusing employment rights);  The Citizens: the people have the power to tell the government what they need to create a thriving society and thus how to use its authority to check and guide the&nbsp;market.  <p>There is an urgent need to displace the current extractive and exploitive GDP paradigm. In our view, this will only be achieved if the next generation policy instruments are anchored in the third, citizen based leg of the triangle. We hope that the Cornerstone Process can therefore provide a scalable stepping stone towards a civic-centred, ecologically viable and just&nbsp;economy.</p> What happened in&nbsp;Västerås <p>The Swedish prototype was run over a period of 9 months with the citizens of Skultana, which is a sub-district within the city of Västerås. The overall goal was to co-design simple, intuitively understandable indicators that encapsulate what thriving means to the people of Skultana. As is the case with any work centred on people, this process was both intensely rewarding and emotionally demanding. We will expand on some of the challenges that we faced (together with lessons for the future) in the <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">final blog</a> of this series. In summary the key steps were as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Statistical analysis: we used <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/exploratory-factor-analysis">Exploratory Factor Analysis</a> to explore data from existing wellbeing indexes such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/wise/measuring-well-being-and-progress.htm">OECD Wellbeing Framework</a>. This analysis highlighted a set of factors³ that have the greatest impact on wellbeing in Sweden (for example, safety and security, access to nature and good infrastructure).  Participatory insights: in parallel, we used an online survey and held a series of in-depth workshops to understand local priorities and views on the factors underpinning wellbeing. Findings included feeling safe, spending time with friends, family and animals and having the freedom to&nbsp;choose.  Thematic sensemaking: the outcomes of these two processes were combined to define clusters of wellbeing dimensions. Using these as a basis, we were then able to identify everyday experiences that could represent the complexity of the data points underpinning the different clusters.  Iteration: we used stories and visualisations to communicate these findings to the citizens. This allowed us to include their feedback and to adjust the suggested measures until we arrived at the final set of cornerstone indicators.  <p>There is a lot of detail behind the steps outlined above that we hope will be of use to others working in this area. A full report of the prototype project that was run in Västerås, Sweden can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">downloaded here</a>.</p> Unpacking the indicators <p>The Cornerstone Indicators provide an interface and balance point between scientific measurements and our human lived experience. They are not intended to be used as hard evidence. Similarly, we do not claim that each individual indicator will accurately represent the multiple factors included within it. To do so would be missing the point; the indicators exist to help us think, listen, reflect and learn. Ultimately they are a medium to help us understand our relationship with the world and thus to make better decisions.</p><p>The indicators have been designed to have a strong visual identity that can be understood across diverse contexts. Each indicator consists of an outer informatic frame and an inner intuitive visual:</p><p>Outer frame: the wheel shown below visualises the factors that were drawn from the different parts of the process. The spokes shaded in blue represent factors from the statistical analysis, those in green are from the citizen engagement and red shows the overlaps. The wheel is used as an outer frame in each indicator to allow a quick visual comparison.</p><p>Inner visual: we have then added playful drawings in the centre to express the experiences and feelings that the indicator encapsulates. For example, when you look at the following pictures, what is your instinctive response? How do they make you&nbsp;feel?</p><p>The full picture: when the outer frame and visual are combined, we can quickly get a sense of what is happening and which factors are included. Crucially, they create a quantitative definition to the full lived experience including latent, unmeasurable factors such as how people feel about the indicator itself.</p><blockquote>Example 1: The number of households who enjoy not owning a&nbsp;car</blockquote><p>The narrative here is inclusive climate action: people feel safe to mix, confident in public transport services, physically able to use active transport and empowered to act on the climate emergency.</p><p>Underpinning the story are multiple factors (for example, safety and security and a good work life balance) which can be further broken down into measurable data points such as crime rates and life expectancy.</p><blockquote>Example 2: Regularly doing a leisure activity with people you don’t cohabit&nbsp;with.</blockquote><p>In this example the theme is a balanced life: people feel empowered to enjoy their free time, to mix with others in the community and try new&nbsp;things.</p><p>Beneath the narrative we can identify factors such as a sense of belonging to place, health and wellbeing and personal autonomy. The measurable dimensions include metrics such as people having free time, the availability of cultural activities and life expectancy rates.</p> Our next&nbsp;steps <p>We are incredibly proud that the first Cornerstone Indicators are now being used in the city of Västerås. However, it is important to state that whilst the community indicators are an important element of the Cornerstone aspiration, they are not the end goal. Instead they are part of a longer journey to build the everyday politics of the future⁴. With this in mind we have started working in two additional international contexts, to expand and develop the wider civic Cornerstone Movement:</p>  In Scotland we have partnered with <a href="https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/">Carnegie UK</a> to develop an <a href="https://www.cornerstoneconversations.org/">online playbook</a> which enables diverse communities to run their own conversational workshops. This is currently being used in the Scottish Government’s <a href="https://carnegieuktrust.org.uk/publications/conversations-for-scotland-a-joint-response-to-the-review-of-national-outcomes/">call for evidence</a> as part of their review of the National Outcomes.  In Canada we are collaborating with the David Suzuki Foundation to design a multi-site, multi-year Cornerstone process across a diverse set of communities.  <p>The shared experience of working in partnership with the citizens of Västerås has been an incredibly rich experience. We have been inspired and humbled by the depth and generosity of people’s engagement with the project, and we will work hard to ensure that the final indicators become widely&nbsp;used.</p><p>We hope that this first step might inspire others to join us in playfully fighting for the future we will be proud to leave behind. In our next and <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">final blog</a> in this series we will share our key learning points and areas that we hope to build on in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you would like more information, or if you have any comments or suggestions on the process so&nbsp;far.</p><p>This blog was co-authored by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) and Linnea Rönnquist (<a href="http://linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se">linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se</a>)</p><p>References:</p>  In Scotland for example, the Government introduced the National Performance Framework in 2009 to set out its ambitions for society and the values that guide its approach. Despite this outcomes based framework being enshrined in legislation, a review in 2022 concluded that ‘the status of accountability against the NPF is at best “patchy” and that the NPF is not always actively used to shape scrutiny, funding decisions, and commissioning’ (<a href="https://scottishleadersforum.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/leadership-collective-responsibility-and-delivering-the-national-outcomes.pdf">Scottish Leaders&nbsp;Forum</a>)  <a href="https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023-03/3.%20Svenska%20f%C3%B6rtroendetrender%201986-2022_0.pdf">https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023-03/3.%20Svenska%20f%C3%B6rtroendetrender%201986-2022_0.pdf</a>  In this blog we are using the terms Factors and Dimensions to mean the following: Factors are things that contribute to wellbeing; for example good health, life satisfaction. Dimensions are elements that can be directly measured and contribute to the factors; e.g. levels of depression or mortality rates.  The term everyday politics refers to community centred activities that reconnect citizens with public&nbsp;life.   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Samhällskontraktet X Dark Matter Labs: The Cornerstone Indicators</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Learning into the future: <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">Blog 3</a> looks at the key lessons that we have learnt and outlines our invitation to others to build on this initial&nbsp;work.  <p>*Throughout these blogs we are using the word citizen to represent the people who live in a country, rather than as a statement of nationality or legal&nbsp;status.</p> Blog 1 (of 3) The taster: reimagining indicators as radical tools for citizen empowerment <p>How are you feeling about the world and your place within it? If you looked at the news when you woke up this morning you might have felt a strange yet familiar mixture of emotions. Frustration, hope, resignation, anger, empathy, anxiety, injustice, bewilderment? This feeling of disconnection between the issues that we are facing and what we (as individuals, organisations, communities and nations) can do about them was the underlying driver for this initiative. Our conviction is that meaningful change will only be achieved collectively via widespread citizen engagement. The escalating global situation is too complex and too important to be entrusted to niche system change experts, politicians or economists. The Cornerstone movement is therefore about reconnecting people to public life, to build shared agency and inspire positive civic action. It is a journey towards continuous, reciprocal national conversations that recognise both our shared fates and our collaborative potential. Of course, every journey begins with a first step; for us this involves communities being in dialogue about what it means to thrive and then collaboratively designing indicators to track progress.</p> What is unique about the Cornerstone Indicators? <p>There is certainly no shortage of frameworks and impact measures. In fact it sometimes feels like we are drowning in them! The Cornerstone Indicators were originally co-developed with <a href="https://katherinetrebeck.com/">Dr Katherine Trebeck</a> and have three key qualities that make them different:</p>  Streamlined: each indicator combines multiple data points into a single easily understandable format. For example, the number of people who would recommend their community as a place for others to move to, would represent underlying measurements such as crime rates, employment opportunities and&nbsp;schools.  Co-designed: the indicators are designed by the communities who will use them. This ensures that the things that matter to people, in their unique contexts, are the things that define&nbsp;success.  Intuitive: each indicator is visually appealing and intuitively understandable. When you see the image you can quickly form an impression of the underlying meaning without having to read the&nbsp;detail.   How are they developed? <p>The process combines statistical rigour with deep participatory engagement. This dual approach ensures that both the universal and contextual elements of wellbeing are carefully considered. In the first prototype initiative conducted in the Swedish city of Västerås, the citizens co-designed 5 Cornerstone Indicators which are illustrated below. We have also created a short PDF (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view">linked here</a>) which presents the indicators more fully. In <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Blog 2</a> of this series we will expand on the intention and details that underpin&nbsp;them.</p><p>We hope that this short introduction has piqued your interest and that you will continue to read the next blog in this series (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Blog 2</a>).

 Digital payments are everywhere.  



<p>Whether we realize it or not, most of us have incorporated technology into our financial lives. According to the <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/eemea/en/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases/en/2022/august/mastercard-new-payments-index-2022-consumers-in-mena-embrace-digital-payments/">Mastercard New Payments Index</a>, which surveyed 35,040 general consumers across 40 markets, 85% of people globally have used at least one emerging payment method in the last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the appeal is choice and simplicity. Consumers can buy a new refrigerator with a credit card, digital wallet or using an automatic buy-now-pay-later program. And they can perform most of their financial transactions from anywhere within a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet enabling consumers to bank and pay with ease is anything but simple. Banks and fintechs must carefully conceive and build payment technology stacks that are agile, user friendly and integrated with their organizations’ complex infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Platforms like <a href="https://www.i2cinc.com/">i2c</a> can help. A global banking and payment processing platform, i2c provides financial institutions and fintechs with “building block” technology to create their own unique consumer and commercial solutions. As a partner, the company relies on Mastercard Open Banking’s consumer-permissioned data to get the right information into the right hands, safely and quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent conversation at the Tech Innovation Roundtable in New York, Jess Turner, EVP, Global Open Banking and API and i2c CEO Amir Wain sat down with moderator Sherri Haymond, Head of Global Digital Partnerships, to explain how their collaboration works and why it matters:&nbsp;</p>



 What are the key market drivers that are leading to unprecedented demand for digital payments? 



<p>Jess Turner: The pandemic changed the way people interact with services and products, as well as the way they interact with each other. That change accelerated digitization faster than we expected, providing an opportunity for innovation. People expect more from their digital payment experience. And because of that, everything we do at Mastercard —whether it’s direct-to-consumer or business-to-business products—must have a best-in-class user experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>&nbsp;Jess Turner and Amir Wain in conversation at the Tech Innovation Roundtable, Master Tech Center, New York</p>



 How does the partnership between i2c and Mastercard help deliver a best-in-class experience to fintech innovators?&nbsp; 



<p>Amir Wain: A significant component to the digital payment experience rests in the hands of banks and fintechs. These financial institutions provide consumers with the ability to bank, borrow and buy what they need. To make those services work seamlessly, a lot of connectivity needs to happen between Mastercard and service providers like i2c. Through our platform, banks and fintechs can access Mastercard capabilities —such as digitization, open banking and APIs—to extend those services to their end users. &nbsp;</p>



 How does open banking strengthen i2c’s platform offerings? 



<p>Amir: The basic tenets of payments—convenience, security and ubiquity—haven’t changed. Now open banking offers the right tools to keep us up to date with the new underlying digital technology, not to mention the consumer’s desire to interact with their finances differently. Through i2c, our clients can use open banking to help sign on new customers. Like mortgages, opening a bank account has largely been a manual process, one that required a lot of paperwork for banks and customers alike. But with open banking, customers can give permission to share their data digitally. &nbsp;</p>



 Jess, can you share other use cases in which open banking creates opportunities?&nbsp; 



<p>Jess: In addition to digital payments, another powerful example is that people can use open banking to get a loan for the first time in their lives. These are people who have been credit invisible or considered thin credit, perhaps because they have a low income, or they lack a credit history. Now they can share open banking data –such as bank transactions or rent payments— to prove they are creditworthy. And that could help a consumer qualify for a loan or empower a budding entrepreneur to kickstart their idea or a small business owner to invest in its growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking is also precise. At Mastercard Open Banking, we are working with permissioned data that we then must clean and categorize to verify things. So, if someone says they make $12.9 million dollars every year, we can check that quickly and accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are you seeing in the landscape of digital payments that you are most excited about?&nbsp; 



<p>Amir: I look forward to seeing consumers benefit from even more payment choice. Different people need different kinds of products that are relevant to them. Cookie cutter products are a thing of the past. Expanding what you know about the totality of a customer through tools like open banking and AI enables the development of more personalized products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At i2c, we work with partners like Mastercard to enhance our building block technology that helps banks and fintechs offer differentiated products and elevated customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jess: I agree with Amir. Right now, these building blocks are critical for innovation because the world is becoming borderless. I am looking forward to seeing how our partnership with i2c will make real innovation happen at scale.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We recently announced our <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW10qzO">2023 State of Cloud Permissions Risks</a> report, which laid out some interesting and eye-opening findings on not just the expansion of cloud environments, but the increase in identity types accessing critical cloud resources. The report reveals interesting findings on why securing workload identities has become more critical than ever:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Workload identities now outnumber human identities 10:1—double that of 2021. This significant uptick introduces new security risks. 
 More than 80% of workload identities are inactive, double the percentage reported in 2021. 
 Workload identities are using less than 5% of their granted permissions. 
 Approximately 70% of workload identities have access to sensitive data. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exorbitant number of inactive workload identities and credentials represents an opportunity for significant risk reduction, especially given how many have high privilege permissions and operate across clouds. Inactive identities and stale credentials make easier targets for compromise and can generally be removed without impact, while expiring credentials can create outages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the whitepaper from Kuppinger Cole, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/cb05bfdbbdb25b6535a42835b77465e2#heading1">Securing Non-human Identities</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/cb05bfdbbdb25b6535a42835b77465e2#heading1">,</a> one significant change is the rapid growth in the number and types of non-human identities, including workload identities. It’s become increasingly difficult to ensure proper identity management to avoid exposure to business, security, and compliance risks. </p>
<p>To help resolve emerging issues with non-human identities, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/managing-governing-and-securing-identities-for-apps-and-services/ba-p/3402816">we launched Microsoft Entra Workload Identities in November 2022</a>. It allows organizations to configure conditional access, identity protection, credential policies, and access reviews for workload identities. This helps detect and remediate risks of workloads that may be acting differently than users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easily recognizing which identities have risky configurations or should be removed altogether is becoming crucial, so we‘re excited to announce a new feature—app health recommendations—within Microsoft Entra Workload Identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 App Health Recommendations help enhance app hygiene 
<p>With more than 80% of workload identities inactive, visibility on these apps and services is crucial. The app health recommendations capability in Microsoft Entra Workload Identities provides insights and actionable guidance to help you secure your environments and avoid outages with recommended best practices. For example- addressing applications that haven’t been used for more than 30 days, removing unused application credentials, and renewing credentials that expire soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing unused applications and unused app credentials improves the security posture of a workload identity portfolio and promotes good identity hygiene. It reduces the risk of compromise- for example, by a bad actor discovering an unused application and abusing it. Depending on the permissions granted to the unused identity, this could lead to exposure of sensitive organizational data or enable lateral movement to further the actor’s objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Recommendations and how to address them 
<p>These new capabilities are available in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Azure AD recommendations</a>.&nbsp;Each recommendation has a description of the issue, the benefits of taking action, and an action plan with step-by-step remediation instructions. The three app health recommendations initially offered as a part of Microsoft Entra Workload Identities are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Unused applications 
 Unused application credentials 
 Expiring application credentials 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Status of a recommendation can be updated manually or automatically by the system. If all resources are addressed according to the action plan, the recommendation status automatically changes to ‘Completed’ the next time the recommendations service runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find this and determine your best course of action, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go to the Azure AD or Microsoft Entra admin center and select Recommendations 
 Select a recommendation from the list to view the details, status, and action plan. 
 Follow the action plan. 
 If applicable, right-click on the status of a resource in a recommendation, select Mark as, then select a status.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Try app health recommendations today and align with best practices 
<p>As workload identities accessing cloud infrastructure continue to increase, it’s critical that organizations closely monitor their posture to reduce their risk of attacks and outages. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Web apps continue to grow in complexity. Front-end developers are expected to be experts in security and infrastructure just to get their apps deployed. It's time we change that.</p> How Did Web App Development Get So Complicated? <p>Over the last fifteen years, the complexity of putting a web app online has increased significantly. </p><p>Responsive design is required now that more browsers and device types have emerged. </p><p>Web apps are more feature-rich, and performance optimization is key. Users won’t stick around if it takes too long for their files to load. </p><p>The more features and complexity an app has, the more attack surfaces it has. Security is a big concern, and web app developers must educate themselves on various security vulnerabilities and employ best practices to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and defend against attacks. </p><p>Users expect real-time updates and collaborative features in web apps. This adds complexity to the overall architecture and requires data synchronization. </p><p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Front-end developers shouldn’t have to become full-stack super devs AND security experts. We can’t go back to the way the Web was before, but we can take computing paradigms from the past and engineer them with today’s advancements and know-how to build web applications that are resilient, reliable, and require no backend.</p> Local-First to the Rescue <p>There are plenty of ideological reasons why a developer would choose local-first - no centralized big tech companies holding user data hostage, less susceptible to censorship, etc. But there are also many practical reasons why a developer would opt to build local-first apps.</p><p>Since files are stored locally, users don't need to wait for a server to access their data and send it back to them. We've all experienced trying to use an app only to find that the server went down. This may annoy some, but it could devastate a business or app that relies on real-time data. In 2023, apps should be more resilient than this. Local-first means no waiting around and opens the door to edge computing products and services, like autonomous vehicles and health monitors.</p><p>It is vital that your app is encrypted and safe from hackers. An advantage to using a distributed system is that no central point of failure can be targeted. Many news reports have reported user data being stolen or held for ransom by bad actors. With local-first apps, the data never leaves the user's device, mitigating much of the risk. Marketers also love that it's compliant with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>. </p> Fission's ODD SDK <p>The <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, our encrypted file system protocol, empowers developers to quickly build local-first, edge-ready applications without a complicated backend infrastructure. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to solving the issues above, it enables real-time (as well as offline!) collaboration, even though it's a decentralized tool. This is possible because we use CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency and authorize users with the capabilities-based <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">UCAN</a> protocol.</p><p>The ODD App Template is responsive, so there is no need to fiddle with the CSS.</p> <p>If you'd like to learn more about simplifying your approach to building apps while keeping them robust and secure, check out the <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD.dev</a> site for templates, demos, and workshops.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Artificial intelligence has transformed the field of cybersecurity by enabling advanced threat detection, automated response systems, and improved overall defense strategies. Although it is considered a game changer in cybersecurity, the adoption of AI presents significant ethical challenges, bias, and the growing risk of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Ethics in AI is a topic that has been discussed for many years, but in today's context, AI is making decisions that directly impact people and organizations, and the importance of considering ethics is a must. A critical examination of the moral and societal implications of AI systems used for threat detection, intrusion prevention, and incident response constitutes AI ethics in the context of cybersecurity. There are five pillars of AI ethics to consider:</p>
 
 Fairness: It should be ensured that the AI model is fair to everyone - especially historically underrepresented groups. 
 Explainable: An AI model should be explainable in the sense that it should be possible to demonstrate to an end user how results and decisions are made, what data was used to curate the model, what methods were used, what expertise was required, and how the model was trained. 
 Robustness: It should be possible to assure end users that the model does not favor one person or segment over another.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: It is important to inform users that an AI model is being used to make decisions, and people and organizations should be able to access the metadata to learn more about the model and how their data is being used. 
 Privacy: An AI model should ensure privacy for all the parties involved. 
 
<p>It sounds good and feasible to achieve, but is it that simple?</p>
 Bias and Deepfakes: Cybersecurity Concerns 
<p>In cybersecurity, algorithmic bias in AI is an evolving concern. Due to their reliance on historical data, AI systems can replicate and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. To ensure that security measures do not unfairly target certain groups, inadvertently undermine privacy, or perpetuate harmful stereotypes, it is critical to address bias in cybersecurity AI tools. Similarly, deepfakes pose a cybersecurity challenge because they use AI algorithms to manipulate or fabricate audio, video, or images, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake content. In the context of cybersecurity, deepfakes can be used to deceive individuals, impersonate high-level officials, or manipulate public sentiment, with potentially destructive consequences.</p>
<p>There are things that can be done to mitigate bias and deepfakes. From a technical perspective, developing AI algorithms that are less susceptible to bias is one possibility. Another requirement is to strive for fairness by including a representative level of diversity in model training data sets. Also, using techniques such as adversarial training to detect and counter deepfakes can improve the effectiveness and reliability of cybersecurity systems. Research and innovation in this area is essential to stay ahead of the curve. On the other hand, industry, academia, and society must work together to raise awareness of the ethical implications, biases, and threats that deepfakes pose to cybersecurity. Today, there are conferences, seminars, and public campaigns to promote knowledge sharing, best practices, and the responsible use of AI technologies. Governments and regulatory bodies also play a critical role in establishing ethical AI practices in cybersecurity. By establishing guidelines and standards, frameworks promote transparency and regular audits of AI systems to make it easier to detect and counteract bias.</p>
 A Long-term Journey 
<p>As AI continues to transform the cybersecurity landscape, it is important to proactively address the interrelated issues of ethics, bias, and deepfakes. It is possible to mitigate the potential risks associated with biased AI systems and the malicious use of deepfakes by taking a multi-pronged approach that incorporates technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and collaborative efforts. There is still much work to be done to create a safe and inclusive cybersecurity environment that protects individuals, organizations, and society by prioritizing ethical principles, promoting fairness, and using AI for the greater good. Most importantly, it is necessary to understand that the use of AI in business should augment human intelligence, and in no way replace it, which indirectly leads to transparent and accountable AI systems.</p>

<p>Pride month is a time when we celebrate the diversity of human identity and recognize the importance of embracing and honoring individuals for who they truly are. It is a reminder that everyone deserves to be seen, respected, and acknowledged, regardless of who they are, where they come from, who they love or how they pray.</p>
<p>Here at 1Kosmos, we believe that individuals should be recognized for who they are in both the physical and digital world. It’s in the way we run the business and in the products we build. That’s why we are so proud of having created a digital <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/iba-friday/nist-compliant-identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> platform that is fair and inclusive. Unfortunately, this hasn’t always been the case in the digital identity proofing world.</p>
<p>In the past, many identity proofing and authentication systems have excluded individuals by using technology with built-in decisioning bias, relying on AI that may not adequately represent the diversity of the population. This can exclude various segments of the population from accessing services intended for them. This is NOT how 1Kosmos solutions are built!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our solutions do not use AI facial recognition, but rather leverage anti-spoofing AI to establish a one-to-one facial match. Our innovative LiveID capability is certified to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a>. In plain language, this short “selfie video” requires facial movements that can be randomized when matching an individual’s realtime likeness to that displayed on a verified credential. The result: the top rated NIST algorithm for non-bias racial and gender decisioning to drive objectivity, equity, and fairness into remote identification proofing benchmarked at 99.6% Target Accept Rate (TAR) and .01% False Accept Rate (FAR).</p>
<p>Unlike traditional methods that fail to recognize the nuances of individual identity by comparing facial characteristics in mass to an AI database, 1Kosmos adopts an innovative approach to identity proofing and authentication based on deterministic verification of an individual to truly identify the user behind a device rather than assuming identity based on how closely they resemble a static, unverified biometric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of relying on an external AI database, 1Kosmos utilizes government-issued identification documents and live biometrics to identify and authenticate individuals. At no time is an individual compared to others in a database. Their real, live biometrics and government issued IDs are used to verify their identities digitally, just as they would be verified in person, but without human error.</p>
<p>By employing this approach, 1Kosmos has established the most fair and inclusive identity proofing and authentication system to date. This system recognizes the multifaceted nature of identity and ensures that individuals are not excluded or denied access to digital services based on biased comparisons with AI trained by sample data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to promoting fairness and inclusivity, 1Kosmos prioritizes the security and user-friendliness of our identity proofing and passwordless authentication solutions. User data is securely stored on a private and permissioned <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/iba-friday/why-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, ensuring protection against unauthorized access and data breaches. The double encryption of data adds an extra layer of security to safeguard individuals’ personal information.</p>
<p>1Kosmos recognizes the importance of giving users control over their own personally identifiable information. In an era where data privacy concerns are at the forefront, 1Kosmos allows users sole access and control of their own data. This transparency empowers individuals to have a say in how their personal information is handled and used, instilling trust and confidence in the identity verification process.</p>
<p>As the annual celebration of Pride Month concludes this week, we will continue to advocate for inclusion and equality in our identity proofing and non-phishable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/multi-factor-authentication/">multifactor authentication</a> solutions. 1Kosmos is determined to set a new standard, prioritizing fairness, inclusivity, security, and user-friendliness. By embracing this innovative methodology, we take a step towards ensuring a more equitable future where everyone’s identity is recognized and respected – not just those who can afford the latest, expensive handsets.</p>

<p>A typical scene at a car enthusiasts motorhead event involves souped-up cars with their hoods propped open and a bunch of grease monkeys gathered around staring at the powerful V12 combustion engine. With the migration to electric cars it is probably a scene that will start to phase out over time. A bit like classical asymmetric cryptography!</p>
<p>There has been a lot of coverage on the anticipated advance of quantum computers: the boon they will bring to medicine, science, and chemistry; and the curse on IT security, with Shor’s algorithm sounding the death knell for traditional classic asymmetric cryptography, which underpins the security for most of what we do on the internet. For this blog post I decided to focus on some of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) related activities that are going on as we speak, under-the-hood. I’m talking specifically about the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), who are tasked with preparing the public internet for a post-quantum world, figuring out how to retool and migrate the protocols and standards built on classical algorithms that we rely on extensively today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;NIST forms the nucleus of the PQC migration, surrounded by a shell of other standards bodies</p>
<p>First to provide a bit of context, it is worth reviewing where the IETF fits in to the PQC story. At the nucleus of figure 1 is National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Their ongoing competition tasked with identifying and standardizing on the PQC primitives has been well-documented. You might already be au fait with some of the short-listed PQC algorithms including SPHINCS+, CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber, as well as XMSS and LMS, which are already NIST standards [SP 800-208]. The output of the NIST’s work will then be used by a shell of orbiting standards bodies such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), EMVCo, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Wi-Fi Alliance®.</p>
<p>Outside of the NIST’s area of responsibility, updating the protocols and technologies that rely on cryptography deemed vulnerable to quantum attacks falls to each of the respective standards bodies to make them ready for a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Consider the IETF, who own the specifications for many of the internet’s cryptographic and security protocols:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Some of the security protocols and standards maintained by the IETF</p>
<p>You might not recognize all of these protocols, but you should be at least vaguely familiar with TLS, SSH, HTTPS, TCP/IP, and DNSSEC, fundamental building blocks for internet communication and security. Fortunately, there is an opportunity to reuse and recycle. The protocols highlighted below are those that need to be retooled with PQC algorithms. The remaining protocols actually don’t need updating. They get their cryptography for free by embedding another PQ-safe protocol. So the list is perhaps less daunting than it first appears but still some non-trivial work lies ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: IETF security protocols and standards with those requiring PQC retooling highlighted</p>
<p>A couple of my Entrust colleagues, Mike Ounsworth and John Gray, are fully embedded in the IETF Working Groups. They have been working for the past 5 years on defining the standards for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs/">composite digital certificates</a>, utilizing a combination of classical and PQ cryptography. Last time I counted they have authored or co-authored 13 papers that will eventually define and specify how communication protocols operate in a post-quantum world – pretty cool stuff! They reported back from their recent IETF 116 session in Tokyo/Yokohama, Japan, where the general MO is “Hurry up and wait.” In essence it means get drafts of these protocols started, then put them in a holding pattern until final NIST specs for CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+, and CRYSTALS-KYBER are standardized. As I chatted with my colleagues, one of the things that was clear is their appreciation for just how well-crafted and versatile the classical algorithms and APIs were. I’m referring to those which came from the pioneers of modern-day cryptography such as public key cryptography defined in the ’70s by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA), Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, and others. I imagine it is the equivalent of modern-day car designers gazing under the hood of a vintage E-Type Jaguar or Ferrari in appreciation of its design, power, and finesse. We’re talking about the nuts and bolts of cryptographic algorithms and APIs here: key transport, key agreement, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), double ratchets, and 0.5 (round-time trips) RTTs! What the IETF working groups are finding is that some of the classic algorithm and mechanism properties are very hard to retain when migrating to PQC equivalents. It is proving challenging even for some of the sharpest minds in the industry. However, in a slow and steady pace they are making good progress.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives I learned about from Entrust’s participation in IETF 116 was our support for the new IETF PQUIP (Post-Quantum Use In Protocols) working group. The name PQUIP, a post-quantum spin on the word “equip” was actually coined by my colleague Mike Ounsworth. The PQUIP group was founded in Jan 2023 and recently had its first meeting at IETF 116. The PQUIP charter is here: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/</a> I know my Entrust colleagues are super proud to be founding and active members of this group focused on bringing the entire internet community together to share knowledge and best practices for how to integrate the new PQC algorithms into the myriad IT security protocols that we rely on every day. This is about mathematicians, subject matter experts, software engineers, and cryptographers coming together across academia and industry to pave the way for a smooth transition to PQ. Architecting the largest cryptographic migration that humanity has ever done is no small feat! It involves juggling security against ease-of-deployment for IT admins through often politics-ridden public discussion groups while under a tight and unforgiving deadline!</p>
<p>So far, the primary output of PQUIP is this document cataloging all of the PQC efforts across the IETF. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc">https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc</a> to see how much design work is involved. Also note the listing at the bottom “Security Area protocols with no PQC-specific action needed” referring to the protocols that will get PQC for free.</p>
<p>Eminent mathematician and PQC academic Michele Mosca when asked for his advice to enterprises on preparing for PQ said “make this about lifecycle management not crisis management.” I think it is fair to say that the IETF working groups are implementing those wise words, figuring out the tricky low-level stuff while we have time. I look forward to seeing the output of their good work in the coming months and years.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Sybil attacks present a distinct challenge in safeguarding the security and equilibrium of a system, among other types of cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advancement of modern technology has enabled malicious individuals to generate highly convincing fake, digital identities. Therefore, the difficulty in distinguishing between a malevolent bot and a genuine human being becomes especially challenging.</p>
<p>Even when targeting smaller online groups or individuals, counterfeit digital duplicates can inflict significant harm. On a larger scale, within a private system, the infiltration of these malicious replicas can lead to catastrophic consequences. Not only do they endanger individual security, but their calculated intentions have the potential to disrupt the overall security and equilibrium of the entire system.</p>
<p>To combat this issue, SelfKey is aiming to develop decentralized solutions that may prevent the unauthorized access of these malicious bots to private online accounts and systems. By harnessing the very technology used to create fraudulent identities, SelfKey's online security methods aim to counterattack Sybil attacks and establish a secure digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth exploration of Sybil attacks and their detrimental impact on the security of digital spaces. Additionally, we’ll elaborate on how SelfKey strives to reinstate security and balance to private accounts and systems.</p>

 Sybil Attacks: The horrifying truth 
 In a nutshell 
<p>According to literature, Sybil attacks are a method of network-based attacks in which a perpetrator creates multiple fake identities or accounts to gain control or influence over a system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term "Sybil" comes from the book "Sybil" by Flora Rheta Schreiber, which portrays a case of multiple personality disorder. In the context of digital security, this refers to a multitude of counterfeit identities which may be controlled by one, single, malicious individual.</p>
 What happens in a Sybil attack? 
<p>During this kind of cyber attack, bad players create numerous fake identities, also known as Sybil nodes or Sybil identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perpetrators then use them to deceive a network or system into believing that each identity represents a unique and independent user. By controlling multiple identities, the attackers can manipulate the network's behavior, disrupt its operation, or undermine its security.</p>
 Who do they target? 
<p>Sybil attacks are commonly associated with decentralized systems, such as peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks. Here, participants rely on the assumption that each identity is unique and represents a distinct user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating a large number of Sybil identities, an attacker can:</p>
 
 gain disproportionate influence. 
 compromise consensus mechanisms. 
 launch various malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation, performing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed Denial of Service</a> attacks, or controlling a majority of voting power. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks can be challenging since traditional identification methods may not be effective in decentralized systems that rely on pseudonymous identities. Mitigation strategies often involve:</p>
 
 implementing reputation systems. 
 proof-of-work mechanisms. 
 identity verification protocols to establish trust and distinguish between legitimate users and Sybil nodes. 
 
<p>Overall, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. Therefore, robust security measures and consensus algorithms are necessary to prevent or minimize their impact.</p>
 The dreadful consequences of Sybil Attacks 
<p>Sybil attacks can be highly dangerous to digital systems, especially in decentralized networks or systems that rely on trust and consensus. Some reasons why Sybil attacks are considered a significant threat include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
 Undermining Consensus&nbsp; 
<p>In decentralized networks, like blockchains, where consensus is essential for maintaining integrity and security, a Sybil attack can disrupt the process. By controlling multiple identities, malicious individuals may manipulate voting or decision-making processes. And this may potentially lead to false consensus or control over the network.</p>
 Disrupting Network Operations 
<p>Sybil attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a network or system. For instance, an attacker may flood the network with fake identities, overwhelming the resources and causing performance degradation or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
 Spreading Misinformation 
<p>Bad players can leverage Sybil identities to spread false information or manipulate the perception of consensus. By taking control of a significant number of identities, they can amplify their influence and create the illusion of broad support for malicious content.</p>
 Exploiting Trust and Reputation Systems 
<p>Many digital systems rely on trust and reputation systems to establish credibility and make informed decisions. During a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create a large number of fake identities with positive reputations. This way, they may mislead others into trusting them and granting them privileges they shouldn't have.</p>
 Security Risks 
<p>Lastly, Sybil attacks can compromise user security. For instance, if a Sybil attacker gains control over multiple identities, they may have access to sensitive user information, financial data, or private communications. Horrifyingly, this may lead to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a>, fraud, or unauthorized access to personal accounts.</p>
<p>Because the consequences of Sybil attacks can be devastating to a decentralized system, it’s crucial for certain security measures to be implemented, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identity verification protocols. 
 Reputation Systems. 
 Proof-of-Work mechanisms. 
 Consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior. 
 
<p>By doing so, individuals may help minimize the risks and consequences of Sybil attacks, before they corrupt whole systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of all these security methods, though, developing strong defenses against Sybil attacks remains a continuous challenge. Therefore, constant vigilance and research are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
 Ways in which Sybil attacks may occur 
<p>Unlike other methods of cyberattacks, which target one type of individual in particular or have a single scope, Sybil attacks can occur in many ways, with many specific purposes. Let us examine a few of them.</p>
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 
<p>In this type of attack, malicious individuals can create multiple Sybil nodes and use them to flood a target system or network with requests. This process can overwhelm the system’s resources and cause it to become unresponsive. And, by controlling a large number of identities, the attackers can amplify the impact of the attack.</p>
 Influence Manipulation in Social Networks 
<p>In social networks, attackers can create multiple fake profiles and use them to manipulate discussions, spread propaganda, or artificially inflate the popularity of certain content. Because they can appear as different individuals, the attackers can exert undue influence and manipulate the perception of consensus.</p>
 Blockchain Network Attacks 
<p>In blockchain networks, malicious individuals may create numerous Sybil identities to gain control over the consensus process. By controlling a majority of identities or computing power (known as a Sybil attack on proof-of-work), the attackers may:</p>
 
 manipulate transaction verification. 
 double-spend coins. 
 launch other malicious activities that undermine the security and integrity of the blockchain. 
 
 Spamming and Reputation Manipulation 
<p>In online platforms that rely on reputation systems, such as e-commerce or review websites, an attacker can create multiple Sybil accounts to spam or manipulate ratings and reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the aid of numerous, fake identities, the attacker can artificially inflate or deflate the reputation of products, services, or individuals. And, this way, they can mislead other users and affect their decision-making.</p>
 Influence in Online Voting Systems 
<p>In online voting systems or opinion polls, attackers may create multiple Sybil identities to sway the results by casting multiple votes or skewing the perception of public opinion. In doing so, the perpetrators can distort the outcome and compromise the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>These examples shed a light on how Sybil attacks can be used to manipulate, disrupt, or deceive various digital systems. Preventing and minimizing these attacks often requires implementing strong security measures, such as:</p>
 
 identity verification protocols. 
 reputation systems. 
 consensus mechanisms that can differentiate between genuine users and Sybil nodes. 
 
 Sybil Attacks against Decentralized Systems 
 A brief introduction to Decentralized Systems 
<p>Decentralized systems are computing or network architectures in which authority, control, and decision-making are distributed among multiple nodes or participants. This comes in stark contrast to centralized systems, in which a single entity or central server has authority.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, no single entity has complete control or ownership over the entire system, and participants collaborate to achieve shared goals.</p>
 Why do Sybil attacks target decentralized systems? 
<p>Sybil attacks specifically target decentralized systems because these systems rely on the assumption that each node or participant represents a unique and independent entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating multiple fake identities, or Sybil nodes, malicious players can exploit the inherent trust and consensus mechanisms of decentralized systems. And this, in turn, could lead to various malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us discuss a few reasons why Sybil attacks are particularly effective against decentralized systems.</p>
 1. Exploiting Consensus Mechanisms 
<p>Decentralized systems often employ consensus mechanisms to achieve agreement among participants. Sybil attacks can undermine these mechanisms by creating a large number of fake identities that skew the consensus process. This way, attackers can manipulate voting, decision-making, or transaction verification, compromising the integrity and security of the system.</p>
 2. Gaining Disproportionate Influence 
<p>What’s commonly known about decentralized systems is that they strive to give equal power and influence to each participant. However, in a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create numerous Sybil nodes, effectively giving them disproportionate influence over the system. This can enable the attacker to exert control, manipulate perceptions, or disrupt the normal operation of the network.</p>
 3. Exploiting Trust and Pseudonymity 
<p>Many decentralized systems rely on pseudonymous identities to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, this anonymity also creates opportunities for Sybil attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious individuals can create multiple fake identities that are almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. And using these, they can deceive others into trusting them and granting them privileges or access they shouldn't have.</p>
 4. Undermining Network Resilience 
<p>Decentralized systems often emphasize resilience and fault tolerance. But, a Sybil attack can compromise these attributes by flooding the network with fake identities.</p>
<p>An attacker can overwhelm resources, disrupt communication, or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, undermining the stability and availability of the system.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. In turn, this highlights the importance of implementing strong security measures, to prevent and reduce the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil Attacks and Malicious AI 
<p>The significance of digital security is amplified in decentralized systems, given the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities they entail. Some crucial aspects that require strong security measures in decentralized environments include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 preserving data integrity. 
 upholding consensus integrity. 
 mitigating network threats. 
 safeguarding digital assets. 
 fostering trust among participants. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks in decentralized systems can be challenging, but there are several measures that can help mitigate the risk. Let us discuss some strategies which may prevent Sybil attacks.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>The first step is implementing strong identity verification mechanisms to ensure that participants in the decentralized system are unique and authentic individuals. This can include verification through trusted third parties, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, or reputation systems that assess the trustworthiness of participants based on their past behavior.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a possible solution to combat identity theft and digital duplicates. SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to detect fake, AI-generated digital identities and identity thieves, which could considerably lower the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 Sybil Resistance Mechanisms 
<p>Another important step is to design the decentralized system with built-in Sybil resistance mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to make it difficult or costly for attackers to create and control a large number of fake identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sybil resistance mechanisms include proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols, where participants must provide computational resources or stake tokens to participate in the system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a>, members may mint SELF tokens as a part of the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-poi-staking/">proof-of-individuality staking</a> protocol. Again, this is developed utilizing the power of AI to gain more accurate and quick results, as AI can read and analyze patterns which may be impossible for the naked human eye to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this process, SelfKey aims to prevent duplicate accounts, malicious bots, or identity thieves from accessing private accounts or systems. Staking, in this context, is done solely with the purpose of increasing digital security.</p>
 Reputation Systems 
<p>Implementing reputation systems that track and evaluate the behavior of participants in the decentralized system is another crucial step. Reputation systems can help identify suspicious or malicious activities, making it harder for attackers to blend in and gain influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants with positive reputations may be given more privileges, while those with negative reputations may be subject to additional scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this purpose, SelfKey has developed an <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">engagement system</a> which offers active members the opportunity to mint SELF tokens for their contribution to the DAO.</p>
 Consensus Algorithms 
<p>Consensus mechanisms like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> (PBFT) can require participants to prove ownership of a significant stake. Additionally, they may require them to demonstrate a high level of computational resources. This may make it more challenging for attackers to create a large number of identities and control the network.</p>
 Randomized Node Selection 
<p>Another method which may be efficient in preventing Sybil attacks is to incorporate randomized node selection in the network's protocols and algorithms. By randomly selecting nodes for tasks, such as voting or validation, the likelihood of multiple fake identities controlled by the same attacker being chosen is reduced, making Sybil attacks less effective.</p>
 Network Monitoring and Analysis 
<p>Analyzing network traffic, node behavior, and communication patterns can help identify patterns that are indicative of Sybil attacks. Therefore, employing network monitoring tools and techniques to detect unusual or suspicious activities is crucial.</p>
 Community Engagement and Auditing 
<p>Lastly, encouraging active participation from the community in detecting and reporting potential Sybil attacks is vital. It’s also important to conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging the community can create a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that preventing Sybil attacks entirely is challenging, and a combination of preventive measures is often necessary. The specific prevention techniques employed will depend on the nature of the decentralized system, its objectives, and the potential threat landscape.</p>
<p>What’s vital is for the community to work together and for members of a DAO to be consistently active. Not only to keep the DAO alive, but also to protect their common goals and the security and balance of the system they are a part of.</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO aims to become a digital environment which may offer both security and convenience. By utilizing the amazing potential of AI, and with the contribution of its participants, SelfKey strives to prevent cyber threats that threaten the security and balance of our digital future.</p>

<p>The verifiable data landscape has experienced exponential growth in recent years, with the pace of innovation accelerating rapidly. Within this dynamic landscape, the presence of competing standards poses an interoperability challenge. To address this issue, Veramo was designed to offer flexibility, modularity, and scalability. It empowers developers to create a customized system from a growing list of standards, without concerns about interoperability or fast-changing specifications.</p><p>Competing standards can burden product owners and developers, who prefer to avoid vendor lock-in or invest extensive resources in building upon standards that are prone to change. However, this should not prevent businesses from bringing the immense value of verifiable data to their users. Over the past year, we’ve been working with a growing community, to build an ecosystem of interoperable functionality made possible through specialized community plugins that respect open standards.</p> Our Story <p>Veramo was born out of the uPort project (now defunct). uPort, which started at ConsenSys in 2015, entered the self-sovereign identity landscape during its early stages. Back then, self-sovereign identity was primarily theoretical, lacking standards and practical implementations. Undeterred, uPort took the initiative and developed its first architecture using smart-contract-based identities.</p><p>As time passed, the limitations of on-chain identities became evident as maintaining compatibility across various technology stacks (web, mobile, backend) hindered rapid iteration, which is crucial in a rapidly evolving standards landscape. In 2021, uPort embarked on developing the next architecture iteration, which was internally referred to as DAF (DID Agent Framework) — which would later become&nbsp;Veramo.</p><p>Our primary goal was to create a flexible, modular and extensible architecture that dApp developers could use as a base layer for using decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. Our mission is to empower developers to build better trust layers in their applications irrespective of any particular tech stack or&nbsp;vendor.</p> Why Open&nbsp;Source? <p>There are some reasons why organizations and projects choose to go the open-source route but for us, three (3)&nbsp;things:</p>  Community First: We were open from the start, even before being close to done because we wanted to connect with other projects and collaboratively build a product that the community loves.  Trust in the code: If the code is open source, it is easier for people to trust that their data is safe, and not uploaded to a certain server without consent. Since trust is one of the things that web3 seeks to achieve, building an open and transparent community will ensure that our users can fully trust in the project, and contribute to steering its direction as&nbsp;well.  Collaboration over competition: In a regulated industry, organizations focus on intellectual property software. However, as an open-source project, the competitive line is blurred, and we can all come together to form an ecosystem building the future of identity. We maintain a “Found a bug? Need a feature? Bring along” ambience and it benefits the whole ecosystem.   Where we are&nbsp;today <p>Veramo has experienced tremendous growth over the past year, with a vibrant and engaged community of users and contributors. With over 300 stars on GitHub and thousands of weekly downloads, Veramo is becoming an essential tool for developers in building decentralized Identity into their applications without having to build from scratch or bother with the changing standards.</p><p>You have the opportunity to shape the future of identity, by getting involved. You can start by leaving a star on our <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo">project repo</a>, providing valuable feedback on GitHub, participating in discussions on our <a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">Discord server</a>, or testing new and existing features, your input is invaluable.</p> What Next? The Future of Decentralized Identity <p>As we look ahead, the future of decentralized identity holds immense promise and potential. Veramo, as an open-source project, is hands-on-deck in shaping this future, driving innovation, and empowering developers to build better trust layers in their applications. Let’s take a closer look at what this could&nbsp;mean:</p><p>Enhanced Privacy and Security: Decentralized identity puts individuals in control of their data, allowing them to selectively share information while maintaining their privacy. As technology evolves, we can expect even stronger encryption and privacy measures to ensure that user data remains secure and protected.</p><p>Seamless Interoperability: The issue of competing standards and interoperability challenges within the verifiable data landscape is being actively addressed. Veramo’s modular architecture enables developers to navigate this complexity effortlessly, integrating multiple standards and protocols into their applications. The future will bring further advancements in interoperability, making it easier for different systems to communicate and exchange verifiable data seamlessly.</p><p>Mainstream Adoption: Decentralized identity is gradually gaining recognition and acceptance in various industries and sectors. From finance to healthcare (<a href="https://www.caro.vc/">Check out the CARO project by Spherity</a>), supply chain management to social networks (<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>), decentralized identity has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with digital services and entities.</p><p>Empowerment and Inclusion: Decentralized identity has the power to empower individuals by providing them with ownership and control over their digital identities, bridging the identity gap, and enabling underserved populations and marginalized communities to access essential services and opportunities.</p><p>In conclusion, the landscape of decentralized identity is dynamic and ever-evolving. New technologies, standards, and protocols will emerge, pushing the boundaries of what is possible. As an open-source project, we will continue to adapt and incorporate these advancements, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to stay at the forefront of innovation.</p><p>Join us on this exciting journey as we pave the way for a future where individuals have control over their digital identities and trust is embedded in every interaction.</p><p><a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">Join our Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/veramolabs">Follow us on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo">Check us out on Github</a> | <a href="https://veramo.io">View our&nbsp;website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/open-source-for-greater-good-why-we-chose-to-make-veramo-open-source-d335fbda3bf">Open Source for Greater Good: Why we chose to make Veramo Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As consumers, we’re increasingly attracted to websites that ask for less information, not more. Imagine your hair trimmer is not doing the job it used to do when it was brand new. Should you buy a new one? Of course not, let’s get a blade replacement instead. Often, such parts are not available from your usual ecommerce sites. After searching and comparing prices through websites, you find a good deal on an online shop. However, you’ve never heard of this shop before, but it looks trustworthy. Once the part is added to your basket, you proceed to the checkout and what you see makes you cringe: a long form that asks not only for your name, email and postal address — which would be reasonable—but also age, gender, phone number, marital status, and date of birth as mandatory fields.</p>
<p>The result is simple: you close that browser tab and go to another shop. These days, increasingly more online businesses realise that the opposite is more likely to result in a sale: they ask for as little data as possible.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, there is a solution that not only removes the user’s pain but also provides more in-depth customer analytics over time. Its name? Progressive profiling.</p>
 What is progressive profiling? 
<p>Progressive profiling is a technique in which a business collects users’ data incrementally, during different touchpoints of the customer’s journey. The goal is to build and constantly update a profile for every user, to enable a customised user experience. Let’s bear in mind that the customer journey starts from the first visit (unknown, anonymous user), next becoming a customer, continuing to upselling, and only ending if the user account is deleted.</p>
<p>To convert and retain customers, a company aims to go from knowing almost nothing about the user, to building a detailed user profile. All this can be accomplished without violating the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other similar stringent regulations.</p>
<p>Building (and maintaining) a user profile takes several steps, which may include forms to download an asset, user registration, questions with an incentive, surveys, etc.</p>
<p></p>
 Benefits of progressive profiling 
<p>Progressive profiling offers benefits for both users and companies. Let’s review the strongest.</p>
 
 Improved user experience
 
 Reduced customer frustrations. Asking users for their data all at once is not only time-consuming but perceived as aggressive by most people. I think all of us has had such an experience, got annoyed and decided not to come back to that service. By asking for information bit by bit, and with the right incentive in place, users will be much more willing to provide additional information. 
 Improve the onboarding process. If a visitor decides to create a user account for your service, you will have some of their data already available, so instead of asking again you can shorten the user registration. Alternatively, after account setup, you can ask a couple of questions to enrich that user profile. But keep those questions optional so they don’t feel obliged to share that data with you. 
 Personalise the buyer’s journey. As a result of building a good user profile, your company will be able to personalise every step of the customer journey. 
 
 
 Increased security and data protection
 
 Minimise the impact of a potential data breach. In the unfortunate event of a data breach, the less data a company has in its data repository, the smaller the damage. Don’t collect data you don’t need, and progressive profiling helps you achieve that from the start. 
 Be an ally for security awareness. Another reason people don’t like putting information in forms is because they are becoming more aware that the data can be misused. Show that your company is careful about its customers’ personal data. 
 
 
 Marketing benefits
 
 Helps update and strengthen user profiles. Typically, a user profile is created at the time a person registers for a service. Within months, this data can become outdated. What if your company decides to launch a great campaign to send a gift or greetings card to your users, only to realise that more than half of your users’ postal addresses are empty, wrongly typed, or outdated? Well, not many of your customers will be delighted as you expected. Nobody wants to miss out on great experiences. 
 Increased conversions. By collecting only information that is necessary and relevant to the customer experience at hand, the customers will be less likely to abandon your form or page and instead press the Submit button. 
 
 
 
 Keep it clear and simple 
<p>When presenting requests for more information, always present the reason for collecting the additional information in terms of the user benefits. Provide easy access to the relevant data processing and privacy policies.</p>
<p>Where possible, make the data collection as quick and easy as possible, such as structuring questions in a yes or no format, or a choice of 1 to 3 options for quick selection.</p>
 Why CIAM is better than marketing tools for progressive profiling 
<p>Most marketers talk about progressive profiling as merely a marketing topic and preach that the magic solution is buying an advanced marketing tool. From a marketing tools perspective, progressive profiling is often applied to leads, from a person’s first interaction through to becoming a customer. In this marketing world, it’s mostly about filling data in forms, sometimes surveys, in which the customers enter more personal data themselves. The purpose is to convert a form visitor to lead to customer. Progressive profiling is clearly advertised as an advanced feature in marketing tools, available only in premium plans or the exclusive products in the portfolio.</p>
<p>But is progressive profiling something that can be achieved with just a marketing tool? Not really. For progressive profiling to become magic, it needs a few spells of Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM).</p>
<p>From a CIAM systems perspective, progressive profiling is applied to registered users who can already log in to one or many services. A login session is the key here. Those users can be leads or converted customers.</p>
 Some advantages of using a CIAM solution for user profiling: 
 
 Marketing tools can’t use attributes from an identity provider. As the user is never authenticated, data must always be entered by the user themselves. Instead, an authenticated user brings to the relying party (the service) at least a few attributes from the identity provider: first name, surname, email, country etc. The list depends on how the identity provider’s system administrator has configured its attribute release policies. 
 You can use a user verification tool to improve the accuracy of a user’s data. If users enter personal attributes for themselves, how do we know if such data is accurate? When users authenticate with a high level of assurance method such as a national e-id, your service can add new verified attributes and correct inaccurate data. 
 Profile differently based on the user’s level of assurance. If more than one authentication method is enabled in the login pages, the service can trigger different questions if the user is authenticated by social media or a bank-based authenticator app. 
 Follow through devices. Marketing tools cannot add more data to the same user’s profile if this person has logged in with different devices. What if the user frequently switches between a laptop, tablet, mobile phone? The cookies are set up in the browser per device. Instead, an authenticated user will be the same regardless of which device is used. Your service can trigger progressive profiling at any touchpoints, whenever the right time comes. 
 
 Can marketing and CIAM join forces? 
<p>If at the time the user creates an account, this person already exists as a lead in the marketing automation platform (or mail automation), the user registration workflow – which is powered by the CIAM system — can make a backend call to synchronise the identity with the already collected data. With the user’s permission, it is also possible to link the new account to an existing browser history on a device, even if created before user registration or a logged in session. This allows wider insight into the same user’s behaviour across all their devices.</p>
<p>All in all, progressive profiling is a powerful technique that helps companies in both their business and security goals. The best way of achieving progressive profiling is putting CIAM into the equation.

A pallet for deployment on identity relying parties. The pallet provides other pallets in the runtime with a DIP origin and manages the entire XCM communication with the identity providers. The DIP origin contains identity provider-specific information. For example, in KILT this includes DID signature verification.  Support crates, suitable for use within an identity relying party’s runtime, including common type and trait definitions.  <p>DIP integrates with existing runtimes with minimal changes. This&nbsp;means:</p>  The fee model of the relying party remains unchanged.  The identity subject only needs a wallet to generate a signature and does not necessarily need to submit the transaction and pay the fees (subject to specifications of the relying party / provider)  The relying party only needs to perform per-transaction origin verification to have access to the identity of the submitter, as defined by the identity provider.   Why Integrate KILT as an Identity Provider? <p>KILT provides practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standards</a>, identity on KILT begins with a unique <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> generated by the user on their device and anchored to the KILT blockchain. This DID can be customized with a user-friendly web3name that provides a 1:1 link to the DID. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> from trusted entities can then be added to the DID, building the identity. These credentials are stored on the user’s device in their wallet, under their control. They decide who to share them with, and how much information they want to share (selective disclosure).</p><p>For a parachain, integrating DIP with KILT results&nbsp;in:</p>  Less effort: The parachain doesn’t have to build and maintain its own identity solution as identity management and verification is handled by&nbsp;KILT.  Focus: Parachains can focus on what they do best without having to worry about identities.  Risk mitigation: The parachain doesn’t have the risks stemming from managing and storing users’ identities.  Access to the KILT user base: Parachains can gain access to the identity information graph composed of all existing KILT’s&nbsp;users.  <p>For builders and users, additional KILT benefits&nbsp;include:</p>  Portable identities: The parachain users just need to create and maintain a single identity on KILT and use it on all supporting chains.  Support for unique <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3names</a>. Enabling cross-chain identity means that these web3names are usable anywhere they are supported.  Support for <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/develop/sdk/cookbook/account_linking/account-link">cross-chain account linking</a>. These accounts have explicitly been linked to the DID by the DID subject. Polkadot and Ethereum are currently supported, with more chains&nbsp;planned.  Support for verifiable credentials and service endpoints will be included in the next&nbsp;phases.   OpenID <p><a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> has become the industry standard, with Facebook, Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Auth0 as the most well-known providers, making OpenID very centralized.</p><p>In addition to providing a decentralized alternative to OpenID, DIP can potentially also be used in conjunction with OpenID in future iterations: the OpenID community is already pushing for the integration of W3C DIDs and verifiable credentials, and are working on the specifications.</p><p>If integrated, any website that relies on OpenID as the authentication method could start accepting users that own a DID and present requested credentials.</p><p>All the building components to implement these features are already available and ready to use in the KILT&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This development is a huge milestone for the intersection between Web2 and Web3, moving blockchain and decentralized identity into the real world and giving control of identity back to the person it belongs&nbsp;to!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/one-identity-across-all-parachains-using-kilt-infrastructure-c87b1115fe64">One Identity Across All Parachains Using KILT Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital-first, but not digital only! This is what we found consumers prefer based on a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">recent survey</a> of 1,000 consumers in the United States.</p>
<p>This survey (<a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic">see this infographic</a>) generated unique insights around the state of the American consumer, including their preferred ways to pay and which digital banking innovations excite them the most.</p>
<p>We learned that consumers ask for digital experiences, but not exclusively digital: Indeed, physical cards are still widely utilized and will remain a valuable tool for for issuers looking to provide a complete payments experience.</p>
<p>The survey showed that consumers continue to prefer physical payment cards in-store (69%), while 14% prefer using a digital wallet (Apple Pay or Google Pay, for example). Another 14% of respondents prefer paying with cash. Even so, digital payment experiences and digital touchpoints are very relevant to the consumer. Read <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/are-mobile-banking-and-payments-capabilities-the-answer-to-your-cardholder-acquisition-problem/">this article</a> on the importance of digital onboarding, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/from-app-to-branch-and-beyond-cardholder-acquisition-starts-with-choice/">this article</a> on how offering more payment choice will help push customer acquisition.</p>
<p>We see this preference for both digital and physical also when we have a look at interactions with the bank. We asked: How do you prefer to interact with your bank? Respondents told us that while they prefer to engage with their banks digitally (51.2% say they mainly use the mobile app, and 22.7% say that they prefer to interact via their banks website), nearly 20% of the surveyed people still listed in-person (or in a branch) as their preferred way of engagement. This shows us that banks must rise to the challenge and offer customers a variety of ways to interact to stay relevant and meet their needs.</p>
<p>Seamless, sustained payment enablement is key.</p>
<p>Net-net, consumers were loud and clear in their responses: Providing seamless, sustained payment enablement is key. And they want this not just when it comes to the types of cards that are offered, but also for every interaction with their bank, from account opening to onboarding, issuance, and payments.</p>
<p>We see a strong need for a complementary and complete card portfolio to answer the very diverse needs of cardholders and to cover all requested touchpoints along the banking and payment journey. Without these offerings in place, banks will find consumers are unwilling to compromise when it comes to finding a bank that will provide them with this flexibility, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity">Executive Order 14028 (EO 14028), Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> directs the federal government to improve its efforts to identify, protect against, and respond to malicious cyber campaigns and their actors through bold changes and significant investments in cybersecurity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released the Federal Zero Trust Strategy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Memorandum M-22-09</a> adding specific guidance where federal agencies should focus their efforts with regards to identity, specifically, (1) A centralized cloud-based identity solution, (2) Strengthening authentication by implementing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) and (3) Include device signals in authorization decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many agencies are struggling to implement these requirements by the deadline without severely disrupting their business. Since the announcement, we’ve been diligently working to make it faster and easier for our customers to deploy Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of the Microsoft Entra family, features to meet EO 14028 requirements. We’re excited to share how Azure AD can support your scenarios so your organization can meet EO 14028 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, we’ll walk you through our top five curated tips and tricks, and how you can leverage them for your migration. In the second half we’ll share some of our deployment best practices we’ve developed that have been instrumental to minimize risk and maintain business continuity, all while consolidating identity providers (IDPs) and moving to phishing-resistant MFA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Top five tips to ensure requirements are met 
<p>Over the last year, we’ve released several features to extend the capabilities of Azure AD and ensure they also meet EO 14028 requirements. Here are our top five tips and tricks and how you can use them: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Consolidate your identity providers and use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication">Azure AD certificate-based authentication (CBA)</a>. Historically, federal agencies and customers who wanted to use CBA had to federate Azure AD with other IDPs (such as AD FS). Now, Azure AD CBA eliminates the need to federate, making it easier for you to consolidate your Identity Providers (IdPs) and move to the cloud faster (Azure AD CBA as a central IdP meets the federal requirement).  
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-single-sign-on">Phishing-resistant MFA for your Azure Virtual Desktop users</a>. We’ve implemented RDS AAD Auth to authenticate a user to an Azure AD-joined device or to a Hybrid Azure AD-joined device. This means that any authentication method supported by Azure AD can be used to authenticate to Azure Virtual Desktop, and Windows 365.  
 Phishing-resistant MFA on mobile (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-mobile-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-mobile-android">Android</a>). Users can now authenticate on mobile devices using certificates stored on security keys. Unlike software certificates installed on the mobile device, these certificates are hardware protected and require an activation factor making them a true MFA solution. This solution also eliminates the need to issue certificates for every mobile device since the user can roam with the same security key across multiple devices. 
 Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for all your users. Use pre-configured <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths (or define your own custom authentication strength) as a control in conditional access policy</a> to allow granular access to specific resources, actions and applications for your users and groups. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-authentication-strength-external">Configure cross-tenant access settings</a> to require phishing resistant authentication for your external users who are coming from other Azure tenants. And, if you have users coming from other Microsoft Clouds, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-cloud-settings">configure Microsoft clouds settings for B2B collaboration</a> to apply the same phishing resistant policies to these users.  
 Leverage device signals for authorization. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device">Configure conditional access policy to require Hybrid Azure AD Join or compliant device</a>. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration#to-change-inbound-trust-settings-for-mfa-and-device-claims">Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration to require the same for external users</a>.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s dive into some actual customer deployment scenarios to help you with your migration even more. </p>
 <br>Customer deployment story 
<p>We’ve worked with countless customers in various stages to help them maintain business continuity and minimize risk and disruption to their users while deploying their EO 14028 solutions. We’ve seen agencies with many 10's of thousands of users and devices do this as quickly within a few days. Below are the best practices we’ve refined over the last few years that will help you as well:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Moving CBA from on-premises IdP to Azure AD. Switching CBA from on-premises IdP to a cloud IdP can be disruptive if the only options are to move users to another domain or to move all users at once. Azure AD supports a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-staged-rollout">staged rollout</a> approach providing federal agencies the ability to granularly pilot and then move to Azure AD CBA en masse, mitigating the risk and disruption to your business and your users. To do this, designate a test group of users to start authenticating using Azure AD CBA in the cloud. Once you’ve validated everything is working as expected, gradually migrate your users in phases until all your users are migrated. After all users have been migrated it is safe to cut over to cloud authentication. 
 Gradually enforce phishing-resistant MFA. Configure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage">authentication methods policy</a> and scope the use of individual authentication methods to specific groups, reducing the overall availability of non-phishing-resistant methods. For scenarios where non-phishing-resistant methods are still needed—such as legacy apps or interoperability—<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">configure conditional access policies with authentication strength control</a> restricting the level of access granted when authentication is done with such methods.  
 Quickly add device signal as part of authorization decision. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join">Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join (HAADJ)</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-partners">configure Intune to work with a device compliance partner</a>. Create conditional access policies requiring Hybrid/compliant devices to quickly bring device signal into your authorization decision. We’ve seen agencies with 10's of thousands of devices do this within a few days. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude, Microsoft is very committed to helping our US government customers meet the EO 14028 requirements by the September 2024 deadline. We have more features lined up to further assist you, make your migration easier and help you achieve your Zero Trust goals. To get started, here are some helpful resources: </p>

 Categorized as a major threat to the stability of the financial system since the late ‘80s, what more can be done to tackle the global trade in dirty money?&nbsp; 



 



<p>In 1989, the <a href="http://Financial%20Action%20Task%20Force%20(FATF)">Financial Action Task Force (FATF</a>) was created to address the emerging threat posed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorism financing</a>, and&nbsp;provide some much-needed stability to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, more than 30 years later, the dangers of the trade in dirty money still looms large. In fact, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, up to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">$2 trillion</a> is laundered every single year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In a June 2023 report, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-finds-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-risks-payments-institutions-are-not-managed">European Banking Authority</a> announced that money laundering and terrorist financing risks were still not being managed effectively by EU payment institutions, citing insufficient AML/CFT internal controls. Findings from the report indicated that as some authorities were not supervising their sector effectively, payment institutions with weak AML/CFT controls were still managing to operate in the EU by establishing an entity in a member state where authorization and AML/CFT supervision processes were&nbsp;less stringent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering leads to unreliable changes in money demand, major risks to a bank’s soundness, affects the legality of financial transactions, and wreaks havoc on exchange rates due to unanticipated cross-border asset transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what more can be done, and how can you better protect your business and your customers from the scourge of money laundering? Below, we share some of the most common red flag indicators associated with money laundering. </p>



 What is money laundering? 



<p>In short, money laundering refers to the act of obscuring the source of ill-gained funds, and injecting them into the legitimate financial system. In 1988, the United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 defined money laundering as: </p>



<blockquote><p>The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from any offense(s), for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in such offense(s) to evade the legal consequences of his actions.</p>The United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 (1988)</blockquote>



<p>For a more detailed explanation of how money laundering works, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/3-stages-of-money-laundering/">‘Explaining the 3 stages of money laundering’</a> blog.</p>



 Organizations fighting back. 



<p>As money laundering is transnational by nature, many international coalitions have been developed in a bid to tackle the issue. Some of the major groups focused on combating money laundering and adjacent offenses include the FATF, the <a href="https://egmontgroup.org/">Egmont group</a> (composed of 166 Financial Intelligence Units [FIU]), <a href="https://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a>, Europol and UNODC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different legal frameworks and regulations have also been created to support anti-money laundering efforts. For example, in the European Union (EU), there have been multiple AML directives (the latest being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) featuring&nbsp;requirements, tools and processes for EU countries, their respective authorities, and “<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0421">selected obliged entities</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/new-eu-authority-for-anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-partial-position/">proposal</a> part of a legislative package to strengthen European AML/CFT rules also laid ground for the creation of a supranational body – the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amla-eu/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority</a> (AMLA), which should be created this year and become fully operational by 2026.</p>



 6 money laundering&nbsp;red flag indicators. 



  Unusual transaction patterns: Different transactional patterns can indicate when money laundering is taking place. Fast-paced transactions coming and going, significant increases in frequency or value, structuring schemes to break down deposits as well as inconsistent transactions regarding the client’s activities should all raise eyebrows and hint at suspicious activities.&nbsp;<br>  Cash-intensive activities: As cash is&nbsp;the major&nbsp;facilitator of money laundering, cash-related businesses are prime targets for money launderers. They offer an unparalleled opportunity to move funds with extremely limited monitoring, and relatively easy ways to escape controls. Businesses with a high volume of cash transactions (casinos, restaurants, grocery stores) or with no apparent justification for cash transactions (construction companies, service providers) may contribute to money laundering schemes. Important controls have been implemented in regulatory frameworks to hinder money laundering, such as reporting thresholds for cash transactions, deposits, or withdrawals.<br>  Third party relationships: Finding the beneficial ownership of companies in tax havens is an <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/blog/cjeu-ruling-eu-public-beneficial-ownership-registers-what-next-for-corporate-transparency">uphill battle</a>, and will remain so, especially in countries with less clear regulations. Money launderers may use third parties to create complex transaction chains, involving multiple accounts or intermediaries, to obscure the trail and source of illicit funds. Some laundering schemes will also appeal to complex international ownership structures, and leverage shell or offshore companies with nominees to hide beneficial ownership. Transactions from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/#:~:text=A%20Politically%20Exposed%20Person%20(PEP)%20is%20someone%20who%2C%20through,bribery%2C%20money%20laundering%20or%20corruption.">Politically Exposed Persons</a> must also be considered when looking for signs of money laundering.<br>  Specific geographical areas: Some countries are more exposed to corruption, organized crime, and money laundering than others, due to weak regulatory systems and poor governmental oversight. When monitoring transactions, geolocation data might be an indicator of suspicious activities. To support transactional analysis, the <a href="https://index.baselgovernance.org/">Basel AML index</a> and <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022">Corruption Perception Index</a> are always helpful to put into perspective global money laundering risks per country.<br>  Deficient financial systems: “Finding the weakness” could be the&nbsp;motto for money launderers. Whether it is corruption-enabled, lack of&nbsp;proper KYC/AML program implementation,&nbsp;or simply weak regulatory framework, some <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html">financial systems are easier than others to launder money</a>. In particular, inadequate due diligence processes or weak internal controls within a financial institution are especially interesting for people looking to hide the source of their funds.<br>  Technology-enabled money laundering: Digitalization and technological developments have been powerful enablers of money laundering, and opportunities are countless. The emergence of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets provides an additional layer of anonymity to be exploited, on top of decentralized or peer-to-peer exchanges. For example, funds going through an account and instantly converted into crypto might be flagged as suspicious.&nbsp;Read more about the need for cryptocurrency compliance and regulation in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">‘How criminals leverage non-compliant crypto exchanges for money laundering’ blog.</a><br>&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-takedown-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer-processed-over-3">Darknet marketplaces also facilitate illicit transactions</a> and provide means to acquire fictitious identities. Darknet visitors are able conceal their identity or location thanks to specific protocols, VPNs, or proxy servers. &nbsp;  



 AML measures and deterrence mechanisms. 



<p>Having a robust AML program is essential to&nbsp;effectively deter money laundering. Countries with strong AML regulatory frameworks now enforce fines and administrative sanctions on actors who fail to demonstrate effective AML programs. For example, the French institution Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution&nbsp;in charge of monitoring the activity of banks and insurances can impose fines up to €100 million or 10% of a company’s annual turnover. In 2020, the UK’s <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a>&nbsp;fined the London branch of the German Commerzbank <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures">£37 million</a>, “for failing to put adequate anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls in place between October 2012 and September 2017.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>To remain compliant and avoid being sanctioned by authorities, having your reputation damaged, and incurring fines, improving these three pillars can drastically help:</p>



  KYC processes: Implementing thorough KYC procedures is crucial for financial institutions. This involves verifying the identity of customers, understanding their business activities, and assessing the legitimacy of the funds involved in transactions. Enhanced due diligence measures may be applied for higher-risk customers, such as PEPs or high net worth individuals. KYC obligations are now largely informed by national or supranational regulations, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Anti%2DMoney,based%20closely%20on%20FATF%20guidance.">AML directives</a> in Europe.<br>  



  Transaction monitoring and reporting: Transaction monitoring plays a vital role in tackling money laundering by identifying and flagging suspicious financial transactions for further investigation. Rule-based and behavior-based analytics, detection of unusual activity and real-time monitoring are all actions that can help detect suspicious patterns and support further investigations.<br>  Collaboration and information sharing: Financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports&nbsp;(SAR) through dedicated channels with their respective authorities, whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. Enhancing public-private partnerships is therefore one of the main ways to&nbsp;successfully tackle money laundering. As a global issue, money laundering also requires international cooperation and information sharing among different countries and regulatory bodies. Collaboration facilitates the exchange of intelligence, supports investigations, and assists in tracing and recovering illicit assets across borders.  



 Combating money laundering for the better good. 



<p>Money laundering poses a significant threat to the integrity of financial systems and can have severe consequences for global security. <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781589067738/ch014.xml">According to the International Monetary Fund,</a> “Countries with weak AML/CFT regimes are subject to the negative effects that large international criminal organizations can have on their economic growth and financial stability.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>With IDnow’s proprietary fraud prevention technology, you can conduct identity verification checks to prevent fraudulent activity such as<a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/"> account takeover</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>.</p>



 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 


 
 
 
 What are the main AML red flags?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Common red flags include large cash transactions, structuring transactions to avoid reporting thresholds, rapid movement of funds, unusual customer activity, lack of business justification, dealing with non-resident customers or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons</a>, offshore transactions, unregistered or unlicensed entities, and lack of proper documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What is an example of a red flag in AML?&nbsp; 
 

<p>One example of a red flag in AML is a sudden and unexplained increase in cash deposits or withdrawals in a customer’s account. For example, if a customer who typically makes small transactions suddenly starts depositing or withdrawing substantial amounts of cash without an apparent reason, it could indicate potential money laundering activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What are some red flags in banking?&nbsp; 
 

<p>In banking, unusual cash deposits or withdrawals, rapid movement of funds, multiple accounts with similar names or unusual customer behavior could indicate&nbsp;money laundering activities, prompting the need for further investigation or the need to submit a SAR to the national FIU.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 A Complete Custody Solution for Tokenized Securities 
<p>Welcome to our monthly product newsletter, featuring Tokeny’s latest solutions and innovations available to our clients.</p>

		 
	 
                <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Last month, we discussed our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/network-agnostic-tokenization-platform-for-enterprises/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ofZm8n3SJwcPbEky_ddwlGgm7VUE8JJnnBq_f8RrY7_cOTSrl1tMJ04hR6LPap2zwkwzL">network-agnostic approach</a>&nbsp;for enterprises seeking to tokenize assets. This month, we’re focusing on our&nbsp;‘Custody’ solutions, highlighting our strategy for&nbsp;smart contracts management and wallet services.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about digitization of finance. One of the key components of this technology is the blockchain wallet, which allows users to interact with the blockchain by signing operations.&nbsp;Wallets are used to sign transactions on the blockchain in order to validate information, authenticate, or trigger smart contract functions.</p>
<p>However, despite its numerous benefits, blockchain wallets can often be complex and difficult to use for the average user, increasing the risk of user error, such as misplacing private keys or sending funds to the wrong address. These errors can have serious consequences, including the loss of funds and the potential for fraudulent activities. To address these issues,&nbsp;it is crucial to simplify the user experience of wallets for institutional players. This can be achieved through the development of user-friendly interfaces, permission systems, and automation.</p>
<p>For years already, Tokeny has provided solutions to facilitate operations for users, being issuers, agents, or investors. Tokeny has not and doesn’t plan to develop a proprietary solution for blockchain wallets. We believe in self-control and direct ownership of assets and want to&nbsp;remain agnostic in terms of wallet solutions. Our role is to integrate these blockchain solutions into the <a title="T-REX Platform" href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX tokenization platform</a> in order to provide a good and secure user experience.</p>
<p>Each of the different roles presented below has a defined set of available actions that can be signed by a wallet:</p>
 
 The issuer&nbsp;(i.e., owner) is the top level administrator. An issuer can mostly appoint/revoke agent(s). 
 Agents&nbsp;manage the day-to-day operations on behalf of the issuer, such as the token supply, investor qualification, redemption… Agents use their wallets to sign these actions (i.e., blockchain transactions). 
 Investors&nbsp;use their wallets to control their identity and the tokens assigned to them. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We distinguish several types of wallets:</p>
 Custodial Wallets vs. Non-custodial Wallets 
<p>We usually talk about custodial wallets when a third-party keeps and/or manages the private keys of the wallet. Custodial wallets solutions enable a high-level of automation and security, but can be subject to operational constraints linked to crypto-assets regulations.</p>
<p>Non-custodial wallets are managed directly by the end-user. With recent developments, they are now much easier, secure and cost-effective to use and are probably the future of this industry.</p>
 Integrated Wallets vs. Connected Wallets 
<p>We’ve integrated custodial and non-custodial wallet providers into our platform. These integrated wallets can be provided automatically to Issuers, Agents, and Token holders.</p>
<p>Signatures are made from the front-end, or automated if using custodial wallets, and the platform is connected to the wallet provider by API to trigger the blockchain operation. A gas tank feature enables gas-less transactions. As a result,&nbsp;the platform handles both the preparation and the signature information of the users’ transaction.&nbsp;It enables a simplified UI flow and facilitates automation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, thanks to connections with Metamask and WalletConnect, the T-REX platform is compatible with all the key wallet providers and digital assets custody solutions of the industry.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, our ultimate goal is to foster comfort and confidence among users when using our wallet solution. Regardless of their choice of wallets, we aim to empower our platform’s users, ensuring ease and confidence in wallet navigation.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this data challenge was to develop data analysis reports and machine learning models that accurately assess investor sentiment towards the OCEAN token over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Twitter, and specifically ‘Crypto Twitter (CT)’ has risen as a unique economic indicator in global sentiment for a particular project and token. Ocean Protocol provided two datasets for this exercise: one contained a record of all tweets featuring “$OCEAN” since 2020, while the other included the price history of the OCEAN token since 2019. Entrants were asked to find correlations between Twitter sentiment and token price and to develop a machine-learning model capable of classifying tweets as bullish, bearish, or&nbsp;neutral.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>1st Place: Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Nicolas’ in-depth analysis report and machine learning model caught our scoring team's eye. The paper included Nicolas’ methodology, clear explanations of the asked data analysis questions, data, and visual expressions of said data to support the thesis. Nicolas dug deep to find correlation coefficients, explain his query scripts, and test more than one ML model in his findings.  <p>2nd Place: Alexis Gassmann ($1500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Alexis was immensely thoughtful and results-oriented in the data analysis portion of this quest. Using HTML notebooks, Alexis was able to find averages and make assumptions backed by data to prove when and how bearish/bullish sentiment was most prominent in the time frame provided for this challenge.  <p>3rd Place: Mohammad Jamali ($1000&nbsp;prize)</p>  Mohammad took a unique approach in polishing and re-preparing the data by language, time, and price movement of the data set provided in this challenge. By doing so, Mohammad found patterns in the correlation between Twitter sentiment and price movement that we hadn’t thought of before. This creativity and exploration is a prime example of how Ocean data challenges empower the data scientist and lead to better informed, data-driven decision&nbsp;making.  <p>Are you curious about how the performance of your project, protocol, or favorite team reflects on the town hall of crypto, Twitter? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a sentiment challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

 Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant Fundraising <p>Use case sets the basis for regulatory compliance in decentralized finance (DeFi), reducing the risk of fraud and accelerating Web3.</p><blockquote>“We are excited that only 8 weeks after our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-7ea12c0e0806">initial announcement with Deloitte</a>, we can already announce Polimec as the first use case for reusable KYC credentials. We are confident that many more will follow soon, inside and outside the Polkadot ecosystem.” — Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Press Release by Deloitte and&nbsp;Polimec</p><p>June 28th, 2023 — Switzerland — <a href="https://www.polimec.org/">Polimec</a>, a decentralized funding protocol developed on Polkadot, and Deloitte Switzerland are joining forces to issue reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) credentials enabling access to global fundraising of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Banking grade standard KYC credentials, issued by Deloitte, streamline the process of participating in early-stage fundraising on Polimec. The credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain, providing an additional level of regulatory compliance, security, and data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Users share their KYC documentation exclusively with Deloitte, a company trusted by the largest multinational enterprises and governments worldwide. Deloitte Managed Services then provides KYC credentials in Web3, an evolved version of the internet that incorporates blockchain technologies and decentralized systems. These Deloitte KYC credentials present a more efficient and secure alternative to traditional KYC methods, which typically involve significant time and resources to confirm the identities of customers.</p><p>“We are proud to share the result of the last nine months that we’ve been working together with Deloitte. This enables us to take a step closer to a vision of Web3, where everyone controls their own data, identity, and destiny — and with Polimec they can own parts of the most exciting Web3 projects from the very earliest fundraises. This collaboration will bring additional funding possibilities to the Polkadot ecosystem and lead the way to a more decentralized community-focused Web3, while also satisfying regulatory criteria”, said <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/kmjoergensen">Kasper Mai Jørgensen</a>, Co-Founder of&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>Credentials will be available for natural persons as well as for legal entities in consideration of their respective needs:</p>  Issuers: The credentials serve as authenticity certificates of the legal entity raising funds, instilling trust and accountability in funding&nbsp;rounds.  Participants: The credentials allow access to Polimec and enable the categorization into retail, professional, and institutional.  <p>With the introduction of reusable KYC credentials, Polimec revolutionizes fundraising practices by creating a compliant and transparent fundraising environment with the goal of ensuring data ownership for all stakeholders. Now each credential holder gets to choose who holds their data and decide what data to share with&nbsp;whom.</p>  Issuers are able to offer contribution tokens to individuals/entities that have been appropriately certified by using the required KYC/AML (Anti Money Laundering) standards, reducing their risk of fraud and ensuring a more secure, more compliant and pseudonymous investing environment. This enables the customization of funding round criteria such as jurisdiction and participant types and provides access for investors based on criteria specified by the&nbsp;issuer.  Participants no longer need to share KYC/AML documentation with multiple intermediaries and issuers to be compliant. Their sensitive documentation is shared with Deloitte exclusively; they save time and reduce the risk of potential data breaches and identity theft. Participants are also assured of project legitimacy due to the issuer and the founders obtaining KYC credentials.  <p>The result is a fast, accessible, privacy-preserving, and compliant authentication experience.</p><p>“After announcing our partnership with KILT Protocol at the Decentralized conference in Lugano, we are proud to announce our first use case,” said <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/de/profiles/mbitterli.html">Micha Bitterli</a>, Head of Deloitte Managed Services. “With this first of many expected use cases, we demonstrate that we are not only talking about potential projects but executing on our promise. Together with the Web3 community joining us as either a user or as a use case for our solution, we want to enable blockchain technology to move toward a compliant DeFi environment.”</p><p>The KILT infrastructure ensures that KYC credentials can be verified at any time. That verification is documented on the Polimec blockchain, ensuring that all transactions and network participants can be processed in a regulatory-compliant, transparent, and secure manner while preserving data privacy. As a result, Polimec is able to create a secure and regulatory compliant fundraising environment for all involved stakeholders.</p><p>”I’m thrilled to see Polimec evolve into a fully-fledged decentralized funding mechanism. This is due to the fantastic and dedicated team at the Polimec Foundation. Together with the Polimec and Deloitte teams, we have created a seamless entry point for new teams to join the Polkadot ecosystem”, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingo-ruebe-0915068/">Ingo Rübe</a>, Founder of KILT Protocol.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem exemplifies effective collaboration between Protocols and Enterprises, establishing a streamlined workflow through interoperability and shared security. This synergy fosters innovation, yielding products that enhance user experience and community value. While KILT Protocol and the Polimec fundraising protocol undertake extensive tech operations and XCM (Cross-Consensus Message) transactions, complexities are rendered user-friendly. This simplicity catalyzes Web3 adoption, facilitating accessible, compliant, and decentralized products.</p><p>Polimec will go live as a Polkadot parachain in late 2023, after which the first projects will be supported in reaching their fundraising goals, enabling them to focus on building new and exciting technology for Web3. Everyone in the ecosystem will be able to participate via&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>There will be possibilities to use your KYC credential early on to get acquainted with this new way of performing KYC and managing your data on chain. We invite you to join our <a href="https://polimec.link/did-signup">waitlist</a> to stay updated on the next&nbsp;steps!</p> About Polimec: <p>Polimec is a decentralized community-driven funding protocol developed on Polkadot to accelerate the Web3 ecosystem. Polimec facilitates fundraising in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner using on-chain credentials, by providing an automated framework for projects to raise funds within a broad and diverse community with transparent and fair access for all. The protocol provides access to fundraising and governs the issuance, distribution, and conversion of tokens to&nbsp;mainnet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A summary of the mechanics of OCEAN, circa Jun&nbsp;2023 [Image: <a href="https://freerangestock.com/photos/129158/waves-in-sea.html">freerangestock.com</a>] Summary <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> mechanics currently include locking OCEAN for curation of data assets, burning OCEAN as a function of network revenue, and as a unit-of-exchange.</p><p>OCEAN has a generalized design that can incorporate new features, towards the overall goal of growing traction.</p> Introduction <p>OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>:</p>  A rise in usage volume → leads to more network revenue, which goes to Ocean community via (a) burning OCEAN (b) other community initiatives  A rise in usage volume → leads to more OCEAN being&nbsp;locked  <p>So the name of the game is to drive usage&nbsp;volume.</p> On Network&nbsp;Revenue <p>The baseline revenue: anytime a data asset is consumed, 0.1% of the value goes to Ocean community; a portion of that is burned. It’s independent of what currency the data asset it sold for. The higher the data consume volume (DCV), the more OCEAN to the community, the more value to OCEAN. So the name of the game is to drive DCV&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>.</p><p>Over time, other revenue-generating mechanisms may be&nbsp;added.</p> OCEAN Distribution Towards&nbsp;Traction <p>The majority of OCEAN supply is earmarked for the community, distributed over decades, to incentivize locking OCEAN and driving&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">2</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">4</a>] has the main mechanics:</p>  Passive DF. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN → earn weekly OCEAN rewards&nbsp;.  Active DF. Currently via curation: Point your veOCEAN to assets that you think will have high DCV, and if they do, you earn OCEAN rewards. DCV isn’t that high (yet), so “active” DF rewards aren’t that high&nbsp;(yet).   Unit of&nbsp;Exchange <p>OCEAN can also be used as a unit-of-exchange, as it is in Ocean Market&nbsp;[1].</p><p>However, do understand that this mechanic doesn’t drive value much, as <a href="https://medium.com/@cburniske/cryptoasset-valuations-ac83479ffca7">Chris Burniske’s PV=MQ work showed.</a> Thus, the Ocean core team puts more emphasis on greater drivers of&nbsp;value.</p> Looking Forward <p>Inside Ocean core team, all our work is around driving traction, and especially DCV [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">5</a>].

<p>When we last left off, Dhiway had a new narrative but the same identity. We were only half there! Let us unfold the rest of this rebrand story….. see you on the flip side (Wink wink).</p>



 <br>Out with the old, in with the new? 



<p>Rewind the clock by three years! When we embarked on our Dhiway journey, all we cared about was verification. But things have changed! Our story has grown broader.</p>



<p>It’s like showing up to the office in your cricket gear. Something just feels off. We realized we needed the right attire to look the part.</p>



<p>Our path to design was clear</p>



 
 We need to shed our startup vibes and embrace the look of a serious tech player. Think established, timeless, with a touch of class. 



 The visuals need to match our personality – We are bold, authentic, thorough, rational &amp; dependable 
 



 <br>Visualizing Dhiway 2.0 



<p>What does ‘reshaping the digital future’ look like? Could it be a majestic rising sun, or perhaps a precious pearl tucked away in an oyster, or maybe an animal that shakes up its entire ecosystem? The ideas were flowing during our brand creation process.</p>



<p>But then, someone chimed in, saying, “What if it’s all about turning over a new page?” Intriguing, we thought. It sounded simple, yet held a profound meaning. It also had a visual element that excited our creative senses!</p>



<p>But the kicker: it fit perfectly into our brand story.</p>



<p>‘Turning the page’ going once, twice, thrice. Sold. We had our visual concept.</p>







<p>Concept note</p>



<p>In a world rampant with data breaches and digital clutter, we find our trust and convictions often being put to the test. It has become the need of the hour to begin a fresh chapter, to turn over a new leaf. Dhiway is here to drive change, and belief and open doors to a new world.</p>



<p>Achieving certainty in the digital world is no longer a far-off dream. With Dhiway, it’s just the turn of a page.</p>







 <br>Introducing Dhiway 2.0 







<p>The Dhiway identity visualizes the story of ‘Reshaping the digital future’, about creating a better digital world. The identity boasts three essential elements</p>



 
 Circle: A powerful symbol embodying a better digital world 



 The Fold: A bold depiction of the transformative path from darkness to light 



 The ‘W’: The dynamic slant of the ‘w’ symbolizes forward movement (We are ‘reshaping’ the digital future &amp; not just ‘reshape’ the digital future) 
 



<p>On a side note:</p>



<p>We actually had three different design approaches in mind, and we were leaning towards going with something completely different. You know what changed our minds? During the Dhiway Townhall, someone said, ‘I really miss that tilted W from approach 2.’ And that statement made us pause and reflect. Looking back, it’s pretty funny how we were drawn to the ‘Turning the page’ approach, but we reluctantly chose a different one. We genuinely think that these unexpected twists are where the real fun happens.”</p>



 <br>Redesigning a cohesive visual language 



<p>Building from our identity, the new visual language needed to portray a forward-looking tech company while conveying our brand narrative.</p>



<p>We did this through 3 main components</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>1. Colour system</p>



<p>Most tech and blockchain companies have the usual visual tropes of blues &amp; blacks. For us, the opportunity lay in ‘purple’ and ‘yellow’ basis of our competitive research.</p>



<p>Our colour pallets give Dhiway a fresh new look while not letting go of our bold yet dependable image. The balance between solid and gradient palettes communicates the confidence of a well-established ecosystem while retaining a timeless appeal.</p>



<p>Additionally, the gradients act as a visual representation of frictionless interactions; dipicting a smooth flow of data.</p>







<p></p>



<p><br>2. Typography</p>



<p>Our brand typeface, Aeonik, complements our colour systems by embodying our brand’s personality while maintaining a sense of boldness and dependability.

<p>Protocol Engineer Brian and Head of Design Ryan recently attended <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp 2023</a> in the California redwoods. DWeb Camp is a five-day retreat for builders and creators constructing tools, making apps, and cultivating a community around the decentralized web. While there, they presented a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop</a> on the ODD SDK using <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> and the <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a>. The workshop invites participants to create ODD Avatars, like the one below. </p>Our marketer Becky, transmogrified! Creating Your ODD Avatar <p>After grabbing a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop code</a> from GitHub, you'll first complete the Transmogrify activities. These activities will enable you to upload a photo in the public file system (WNFS) and run <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Tensor Flow.js</a> over it. This adds the signature ODD eyeballs to the image over the eyes of the person in the image (this mostly works for people, but we've also seen it work on illustrations!). </p>The ODD Haskell High Priestess<p>First, create a public avatars directory path. Then, create the directory on your local machine and verify it is in your local file system.</p><p>Now it's time to complete the Summon activities. Summon enables the gallery view. The activities are similar to the previous ones, with an additional activity enabling the "delete" function. When finished, you can view your transmogrified image in the gallery. There is also a link to the image hosted on IPFS. </p> Served with Your Choice of Nodes <p>IPFS doesn't persist an image - instead, it assigns it a CID (content identifier in the form of a hash) and enables storage and sharing across the nodes in the network. Over time, if a file isn't being requested very often, eventually, it will be "garbage collected" and removed from the node to make room for other content. To ensure that your files remain on IPFS, you must use a "pinning" service to persist them. When you use ODD SDK, Fission persists (or pins) them to our node. (NOTE: We don't run a paid pinning service, but we currently offer complementary pinning to ODD SDK users). </p><p>However, if you choose to move your content to another node or change the delivery gateway, all of this can be done very easily! For example, to change the delivery gateway, you only need to change the domain in the code and refresh the ODD Avatars app. When you click on the IPFS link, you'll see it's using a different gateway. The content is being pulled temporarily to the node behind that gateway. But again, make sure to use a pinning service if this is content that you wish to keep around! </p><p>Fission will never lock you into our services, and we always build to open source and interoperable standards. </p> Collect Your Favorite Avatars <p>This activity utilizes the public file system in WNFS. Since all the files are public, you can use the CIDs of those files and add them to your own gallery. Currently, there is no way to search for CIDs in IPFS (<a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-nns/">though we're working on it!</a>), but if you know the CID, you can plug it into the function we built into the app. </p> <p>This was a lot of fun to put together, and we hope you enjoy making your own ODD avatars. We'd love to see what you come up with! Tag us on social media so we can see your ODD creations.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">Workshop Code</a></p><p><a href="https://ugly-thick-brass-whale.fission.app/">ODD Avatars App</a></p><p>And if you'd like to learn more about ODD SDK, you can visit the <a href="https://odd.dev/">website</a> or join the #ODDSDK channel on <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a>.</p>

   The Antidote to Costly Security Risks and Unhappy Customers is Enterprise-Grade Digital Identity 
	
<p>For five years running, the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=reports&amp;utm_content=2023-breach-report_healthcare_blog">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a> has uncovered the fact that cybercriminals target healthcare more than any other industry. Attackers aim for the path of least resistance, and, According to Accenture,<a>1</a> the call center has become that path due to legacy and siloed authentication processes and technology. The security risks associated with healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk authentication include weak passwords and credentials, insider threats, social engineering, unauthorized access, and account takeover (ATO).</p>

<p>The customer experience authenticating with traditional healthcare call centers, front desks, and help desks is similarly poor. Customers often have to repeat their weak credentials at multiple points within their journey – a frustrating experience that diminishes customer confidence and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Overhauling call center authentication security and experiences may seem daunting, but with the right digital identity solution, healthcare leaders can realize significant cost savings and profit gains.</p>

<p>For example, a recently commissioned study, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/186-roi-new-total-economic-impacttm-study">Forrester® Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) of ForgeRock CIAM</a>, shows that over three years, healthcare enterprises could achieve:</p>

  40% reduction in security-related calls to the call center 
   $4.7M reduction in costs associated with fraud 
   400% increase in customer engagement 
   133% increase in customer conversions 
 <p>ForgeRock offers enterprise-grade digital identity security solutions that not only protect healthcare customers and enterprises from breaches, fraud, and ransomware, they also enable great call center, front desk, and help desk experiences. These include:</p>

 CIBA and Secure Impersonation 
<p>Rather than having callers answer weak authentication questions, client-initiated backchannel authentication (CIBA) enables front-desk, call-center, and help-desk representatives to authenticate callers with methods such as sending a prompt via a mobile app or text. CIBA also enables secure impersonation, which, upon an authentication prompt, allows consumers to hand over temporary control over their account to another party, such as a call-center agent, for a set period of time. Both of these security methods make it much harder for fraudsters to achieve their mission.</p>

 Passwordless and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> eliminates the need for a password during authentication using a variety of alternatives, such as passkeys, biometrics, or by gathering contextual authenticators such as device, IP address, geo-location, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> validates a user's identity through multiple authentication mechanisms in addition to standard login credentials. These may include a push notification or biometrics like facial recognition or Touch ID.</p>

 No-Code Identity Orchestration With Continuous, Contextual Authentication 
<p>To predict whether fraud is likely requires context. ForgeRock offers a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">no-code identity orchestration engine</a> that enables administrators to design authentication journeys for all users that detect anomalies both before and after authentication. Anomaly detection goes on behind the scenes and is invisible to legitimate users; their experience isn't impacted. Suspicious actors, on the other hand, are required to provide added proof of their identity.</p>

 Autonomous Access 
<p>Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> is a threat protection solution that helps healthcare security leaders prevent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover (ATO)</a> and fraud at all points of authentication. It uses AI to analyze threat signals and anomalous behavior patterns, and provides risk scores to help stop bad actors in real time. AI-informed risk scores can be incorporated into the design of call-center and help-desk journeys, allowing healthcare security leaders to remove unwanted friction and improve the experience of legitimate users.</p>

 Autonomous Identity 
<p>Internal actors are the second-highest cause for healthcare breaches.<a>2</a> ForgeRock Autonomous Identity leverages AI to disrupt the traditional, static identity governance models used to grant workforce access by looking at an organization's entire entitlement landscape. It then provides insights to make informed provisioning and governance decisions, and identifies high-risk areas that may require more governance. This helps healthcare security leaders significantly reduce the number of users that have access to things they shouldn't.</p>

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity capabilities, listed above, can address risks and vulnerabilities to significantly improve healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk security while enhancing end-user experiences.</p>

<p>What’s the secret to overcoming common roadblocks when implementing Zero Trust</p>
<p>The concept of Zero Trust dates back more than a decade, when forward-thinking CIOs realized that digital expansion was making perimeter-based security obsolete. As digital connections with acquisitions, contractors, customers, banks, government agencies, and business partners proliferated, the traditional wall of security surrounding the enterprise became increasingly porous. The global pandemic accelerated trends like remote work and work from home, extending the perimeter to remote locations and people’s homes, making security extremely difficult to manage with traditional perimeter-based technology, identity, and policy frameworks.</p>
<p>As enterprise technologies moved to the cloud and remote worker populations soared, the need for security beyond the traditional perimeter took on greater urgency. In 2010, a Forrester researcher – let’s give John Kindervag his due credit – crafted the term “Zero Trust” to describe a modern framework for enterprise security in a perimeter-less ecosystem. Kindervag made it clear that Zero Trust could not be achieved through a single product or technology. Rather, the framework guided a highly disciplined approach that called for all users, devices, and systems to be authenticated before connecting, then continually verified while engaged with accessing networks, systems, and data.</p>
<p>Growing risk drives big talk, but little action on Zero Trust</p>
<p>That was 13 years ago. Since then, we’ve seen cybercrime become an <a href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/cyber-crime-costing-the-world-8-trillion-every-year#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20by%20Cybersecurity,space%20to%20protect%20cyber%20rights.">$8T (USD)</a> annual industry, <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach#:~:text=The%20latest%20IBM%20Data%20Breach,one%20data%20breach%20during%202022.">83% of organizations</a> have suffered a breach, and the average cost of those events has surpassed $4.5M (USD). Analysts warn that cybercrime will surge to even higher levels as hackers increasingly add the power of quantum computing and tools such as phishing-as-a-service and ransomware-as-a-service to their arsenals. Most cyber incidents can be tracked back to compromised credentials and security frameworks not planning for cyber resilience – i.e how to ensure business continuity in case of a breach.</p>
<p>And yet, adoption of Zero Trust principles has been slow due to several factors:</p>
 
 Fuzzy line of sight to business outcomes: IT and security professionals have been challenged to create a line of sight between Zero Trust implementation and goals for the business. 
 Big bang IT project orientation: With limited budgets and a long-term shortage of cybersecurity staff, moving to a strategy where every user, device, system, and application represents a new perimeter can appear daunting – and easy to put off until more time and more resources are available. 
 Cyber insurance was sufficient: We’ve seen in some the attitude that risk of a cybersecurity incident is tolerable – and the cost would be covered by cyber-insurance policies. 
 
<p>Finally, there remains confusion over what Zero Trust is. Technology vendors get some of the blame here, often presenting Zero Trust as a tech re-platform project, rather than an infosecurity paradigm shift, where you can measure and plan your road to maturity.</p>
<p>No more. Today, we’re clearly at an inflection point. In the U.S., the White House has directed federal agencies to adopt Zero Trust principles by 2024. And the release of the latest Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> has moved the concept from buzzword to blueprint, providing that roadmap for addressing the key pillars of a Zero Trust architecture. Version 2 of the model adds an additional maturity level, recognizing the fact that getting to an optimal maturity level is a huge leap for any organization. Enterprises are rapidly engaged as well, with PwC reporting that 36% of CISOs say they’ve already started to implement components of Zero Trust and another 25% plan to start in the next two years.</p>
<p>But achieving maturity will take time; Zero Trust is a journey and an ongoing effort to coninuously improve and enforce controls. CISA makes it clear that there is no one solution to get to Zero Trust maturity, and that implementation will take strategic backing, time, and investment. The upside: With each step a maturity model approach enables improvement to the organization’s risk posture.</p>
<p>Breaking through roadblocks to overcome inertia</p>
<p>Success requires two high-level commitments – with a number of practical steps to support them. The first comes from the board or C-suite. No senior leaders or board members are unaware of the cost and ubiquity of cyberattacks. They get it. IT is the environment for innovation, the conduit for sales, the connectivity to customers, and the engine for market expansion. Boards and CEOs need to invest in digital infrastructure like it’s the core business, not just departmental overhead. Building the business case for that mindset shift requires a dedicated strategy on the part of IT and security leaders.</p>
<p>The second commitment is patience – across the enterprise. Start by evaluating your current state, and from there plan out how you will grow into a Zero Trust posture – rather than simply buying a new tech platform and, inevitably, underdelivering on results. Getting to Zero Trust maturity require integration of carefully selected and integrated security technologies. But you can’t deploy a new tech stack and say, “Check Zero Trust off the list.” What you can do is work with your team and your partners to make sure the tech meets you at your Zero Trust maturity level. Your IT security teams and business leaders need to be in sync with an evolving framework that gets smarter, more agile, and more secure over time.</p>
<p>These two high-level commitments provide the sustained momentum for change. But building an effective Zero Trust framework requires strategic guidance to funnel that momentum in the right direction. Entrust has helped a number of organizations design, launch, and maintain their frameworks over the past several years. We’ve collected several insights and best practices from those engagements and distilled them into a quick-read ebook titled “Building a Solid Foundation for Your Zero Trust Framework.” You can download the ebook <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/ebook/entrust-report-zerotrust-eb.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Account takeover prevention actively reduces attack surfaces by which hackers can break into and use system accounts for malicious purposes.</p>
 What Is an Account Takeover Attack? 
<p>Account takeover (ATO) refers to identity theft, where an attacker gains access to a user’s account. This can be any account, including those associated with online banking or an enterprise platform.</p>
<p>Account takeover is often a lengthy process, following a few common steps:</p>
 
 Reconnaissance: The fraudster gathers the victim’s information through tactics like, such as phishing, credential stuffing, or purchasing the information on the dark web. 
 Unauthorized Access: Using this information, hackers will then take control of these accounts… including any access privileges that account and user enjoy. 
 Malicious Activity: The hacker may now carry out various malicious activities. This can include using email to send phishing emails (in what is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bec-attack/">Business Email Compromise attack</a>), stealing information from secure sources, changing roles and privileges, or simply monitoring networks or emails for more information about the organization. 
 
<p>Account takeovers are a severe security issue that can significantly impact the immediate and future sense.</p>
 How Do Attackers Launch Account Compromise Attacks? 
<p>Hackers can use several methods to execute account takeover attacks. More importantly, very few attacks utilize a single technique–sometimes single attacks are used to breach an account, but more often than not several forms of attack are strung together to trick users and gain access to their information.</p>
<p>Here are some common ones:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">Phishing</a>: In this method, hackers send fraudulent emails or messages posing as legitimate organizations to trick recipients into revealing credentials like usernames and passwords. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/credential-stuffing/">Credential Stuffing</a>: This attack involves hackers using stolen usernames and passwords to “stuff” them into common platforms (with the understanding that many users will reuse passwords across different accounts). 
 Malware: This includes any viruses or spyware that can exploit vulnerabilities such that they may be embedded into systems to track user behavior, steal information, or break system usability. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/man-in-the-browser-attack/">Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM)</a>: These attacks occur when hackers intercept network traffic to steal or manipulate communications. 
 Data Breaches: Database hacks can result in lost credentials and fuel additional attacks like credential stuffing or rainbow table attacks. 
 
<p>Not all of these attacks are the user’s fault (especially related to data breaches). Still, it is often the case that user behavior can be one of the most significant contributors to account takeover threats.</p>
 How Can My Organization Detect Account Takeovers? 
<p>Detecting account takeover can sometimes be challenging because perpetrators often try to hide their activities (and, in the case of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/advanced-persistent-threat/">advanced persistent threats,</a> these efforts are very sophisticated). However, there are several tell-tale signals for account takeover.<br>
Some of these signs include:</p>
 
 Unusual User Behavior: Uncommon or risky user behavior can signal an account takeover. In enterprise settings, this is much more sophisticated than detecting individual anomalies and falls under a discipline called User Behavior Analytics. 
 Account Activity Monitoring: A critical part of any behavior and threat analysis is monitoring. Regularly monitoring account activities can help detect suspicious behavior. Look for sudden changes in account details, unfamiliar transactions, unexpected password resets, or unanticipated email subscriptions. 
 AI and Machine Learning Systems: While traditional monitoring has contributed to mitigating fraud and account takeover, modern AI-driven tools can model risk and odd behavior with much more sophistication than those managed by humans. Advanced AI and machine learning systems can learn patterns, detect anomalies, and flag suspicious behavior that might indicate an account takeover attempt. 
 Device Identification and Tracking: By identifying and tracking the devices typically used to access an account, enterprises can spot when an account is accessed from a new or unusual device. 
 Login Velocity Checking: By tracking logins’ frequency and geographic location, systems can flag when an account is being accessed repeatedly (a sign of account takeover threats). 
 Risk-Based Authentication: This method analyzes several risk factors (like the reputation of an IP address, the user’s device, geographic location, and behavioral biometrics) during the authentication process. If the risk score is high, it will trigger additional security measures. 
 Threat Intelligence Feeds: Enterprises can subscribe to threat intelligence feeds, which provide real-time information about ongoing cybersecurity threats. These services can alert enterprises to known malicious IP addresses or newly discovered vulnerabilities that might be exploited for an account takeover. 
 
 How Can I Prevent 
<p>Preventing account takeover fraud involves passive and proactive measures to secure personal and financial information.</p>
<p>Enterprises can take several measures to prevent account takeover attempts. Here are some key strategies:</p>
 
 Implement <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>: MFA adds security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of identification before accessing their accounts. This can be factors like fingerprints, facial scans, or hardware tokens. 
 Force the Use of Strong Passwords: Enforce policies for password strength and regular password changes. Consider implementing a password manager enterprise-wide to help users manage their unique, strong passwords. 
 Require Training: Regular training can help employees recognize the signs of phishing attempts and other security threats through the use of security best practices (particularly authentication practices). 
 Automate Updates and Patches: Automatically maintain the latest patches from software and hardware vendors to protect your enterprise from many known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for account takeover. 
 Scan and Flag Emails: Implement email scanning and filtering to detect and block phishing emails and other malicious content that could lead to account takeovers. Most email providers offer ways to flag emails from outside the organization so that users will not fall for phishing attacks. 
 Follow the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principle of Least Privilege</a>: Apply the PoLP, giving employees only the necessary access to perform their tasks. This reduces the number of high-value targets for attackers and minimizes impact if an account is breached 
 Monitor Account Activity: Use tools that can help monitor account activities, such as log analysis and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. These can help you spot unusual patterns that may indicate an account takeover. 
 Conduct Regular Audits: Regular audits can help you identify potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited. These include both technological audits and process audits.

<p>As a leader in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) sector, Coinfirm not only provides solutions for businesses to stay compliant and secure but also helps victims of cryptocurrency fraud through our project, ReclaimCrypto.com. Here, we offer victims a platform to report crypto crimes and assist them in the possible recovery of their stolen assets. In this article, we delve deep into the data from ReclaimCrypto.com to identify the shifting trends in cryptocurrency-related crime over the past five years.</p>



<p>The data, reflecting the percentage of claims associated with different cryptocurrencies from 2019 to 2023, provides a comprehensive view of the changing landscape of crypto crimes. This analysis identifies notable trends and anomalies that offer a clearer understanding of how the crypto-crime scenario has evolved over the years.</p>







 Declining Bitcoin Claims: 



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, unsurprisingly, featured heavily in the claims in the earlier years. In 2019, Bitcoin accounted for 39% of all claims, which surged to a peak of 66% in 2020. However, the percentage of Bitcoin-related claims has shown a consistent decline since then, falling to 35% in 2021, then to 21% in 2022, and finally to 28% in 2023. This trend could be attributed to increased awareness and security enhancements around Bitcoin transactions, but also to the growing diversity in the crypto market.</p>



 Varying Ethereum Claims: 



<p>Ethereum (ETH) claims have varied over the years, starting at 8% in 2019, peaking at 22% in 2021, and dropping to 14% in 2023. The popularity of Ethereum for smart contracts and the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects built on its platform could account for the peak in 2021.</p>



 Emergence of Binance Coin (BNB) Claims: 



<p>Interestingly, Binance Coin (BNB) claims made their first appearance in 2021, accounting for 5% of claims, and maintaining that proportion in 2022. As Binance Smart Chain’s native token, BNB’s growing involvement in fraudulent activities could be tied to the rapid expansion of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem and its increasing adoption.</p>



 Resurgence of Ripple (XRP) Claims: 



<p>Ripple (XRP) claims have remained relatively low, accounting for 5% in 2019, falling to 4% in 2020, and then further reducing to a negligible presence in 2021 and 2022. However, 2023 witnessed a resurgence of XRP claims, rising back to 4%.</p>



 Rising Tether (USDT) Claims: 



<p>Most notably, the percentage of Tether (USDT) claims, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, saw a significant increase over the years. Starting from a mere 3% in 2020, the USDT-related claims rose to 7% in 2021, then significantly jumped to 19% in 2022, and finally reached a peak of 32% in 2023.</p>



<p>The surge in USDT-related claims is noteworthy, as it marks the increasing involvement of stablecoins in crypto crimes. Tether (USDT), being a stablecoin, is designed to maintain a stable value against a specific asset or a pool of assets, most commonly USD. The appeal of stablecoins lies in their ability to provide stability in a highly volatile crypto market. They allow users to escape volatility without exiting the cryptocurrency space entirely, and hence have seen widespread adoption for transactions, trading, andvalue storage.</p>



<p>The increased use of USDT in fraudulent activities could be attributed to several reasons. First, the widespread adoption of USDT might have attracted criminals due to its high liquidity and ubiquity across exchanges, making it easier for them to move funds while avoiding detection.</p>



<p>Second, the relative stability of USDT may provide an additional layer of security for fraudsters. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, whose value might drastically fluctuate, the value of stolen USDT is relatively stable, reducing the risk for criminals holding these assets.</p>



<p>Third, the perception that stablecoins, being pegged to real-world assets, are somehow ‘safer’ or ‘less traceable’ might be playing into this trend. It’s important to debunk such misconceptions and continue to improve the tracking of stablecoin transactions in the fight against crypto crimes.</p>



<p>Finally, the rise in DeFi and yield farming platforms, many of which use USDT as a base currency, might have also indirectly contributed to the increase in USDT-related claims. As more users engage with these platforms, the opportunities for fraud also increase, leading to a higher number of reported incidents.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while we have seen an increase in USDT-related claims, it does not necessarily imply that the USDT network itself is less secure. Rather, it’s a reflection of its widespread usage and certain characteristics that might be exploited by bad actors. Despite these challenges, we are confident that with continuous improvements in tracking technologies and regulatory practices, we can tackle this issue effectively.</p>



<p>As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving crypto landscape, it’s crucial to stay vigilant and informed. At Coinfirm, we are committed to aiding in the fight against crypto fraud and providing support for victims of these crimes. Through continuous innovation, advanced tracking technologies, and regulatory partnerships, we strive to make the crypto world a safer place for all.</p>

<p>Dhiway is abuzz this week.</p>



<p>We have all been excited, nervous, pumped, and more. Who knew a rebrand would have this effect? But before this turns into a gushy session, let us take you through all the fun parts.</p>



 <br>How it all started! 



<p>Sometime last year, we were working on creating new offerings, launching version 2 of our Blockchain (The fastest, most scalable blockchain in town – a humble brag?) and our new wallet application.</p>



<p>And as we were juggling all this, one of the founders said out loud ‘How do we really make our clients understand all this?’ Not everyone understands tech. And honestly, we were very close to our work – read ‘really really close’. And why not, it was our baby. But now it was time to bring in a sounding board. Enter Small Town Folk (STF) – the design agency we worked on the rebrand with.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Digging deeper than deep tech 



<p>Although we all knew what we did at Dhiway, it was not articulated in a common language. So STF and us did several workshops to answer numerous questions related to our business, our offerings, and even the most existential question – our why?</p>



<p>But every time we started, we came up with too many answers. All of us had the same sentiment but a different articulation.</p>



<p>“Maybe we should just document the building blocks” – said a team member. So we locked ourselves in a room and just started whiteboarding.</p>



<p>Finally ending up with this. Some documentation this …. phew!</p>







<p>The clarity of putting something down on paper can’t be underestimated. We understood the relationship between Dhiway, Cord &amp; Mark. A proper brand architecture was now ready.</p>



 <br>And now back to the big one – The Why? 



<p>“At the end of your life, what fundamental impact would you have made on this world?”</p>



<p>This powerful question got the most passion out of us. Someone said ‘Dhiway would be fundamental to our lives’ others said ‘Dhiway will put power back in the hands of the people’. And then the aha moment – ‘Dhiway would make the digital world comparable to or better than the current physical world’</p>



<p></p>



<p>Hold on…. this is interesting. So this meant</p>



 
 The current digital world is not comparable to the physical world 



 Which meant that there is mistrust in the current digital world 



 This translates to – the current digital world in its current form is broken 
 



<p>And voila our brand purpose</p>







 <br>Swiftly moving on to The How 



<p>By now it was very clear what we were solving for.</p>



 
 Dhiway is about friction-free interactions 



 Dhiway is about population-scale technology 



 Dhiway is about collaborations 



 Dhiway is about ever-adaptive solutions 
 



<p>We needed a single narrative that tied it all together. Easy right? </p>



<p>Introducing Dhiway’s brand promise…. (Drum rolls)</p>



 “Reshaping the digital world” 



<p>At first glance, it seemed right. We shared it with our existing investors &amp; select people in our ecosystem. It seemed right to them as well.</p>



<p>Did we just crack our narrative? I think we did. Clap Clap</p>



 <br>Wait…..there’s more – A new brand identity? 



<p>You know those conversations that rain on your parade? Ours goes something like this.</p>



<p>“What about the logo?”</p>



<p>“The logo? What about it?”</p>



<p>“You do know the logo talks about our Mark Studio &amp; verification story, don’t you? Shouldn’t the logo reflect our new brand narrative”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this was true. Our identity was designed when we launched MarkStudio. And that’s when it dawned on us.</p>



<p>We were only half there!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Almost every website, app, and user platform now requires usernames and passwords. And for user data to remain secure, passwords must be strong—most platforms require a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many users now employ passphrases so they won’t have to remember different passwords to protect their accounts from cyber threats and hackers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Keeping track of multiple passwords or generating endless passphrases becomes quite unwieldy after a while. Fortunately, we are on the path to a bright future of passwordless technology.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Passwordless Technology?  
<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless technology</a> is a type of user authentication that does not require the use of a password.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is being done in different ways:</p> 
 Biometrics  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">Biometric authentication</a> refers to the automated capture of an individual’s unique characteristics, which are then saved and encrypted into a security system. When the user logs in, their biometrics will be recaptured to verify their identity and provide access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biometric authentication can use any of the following body parts:</p> 
  
  Fingerprint  
  Palm print  
  Face  
  Voice  
  
<p>This technology is being leveraged in place of or to supplement simple passwords on smart devices, transport, banking, and more.&nbsp;</p> 
 Credentials  
<p>Possession-based authentication leverages personal credentials that are unique to the user. They are usually information saved on hardware that only the owner controls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some examples of possession-based credentials include:</p> 
  
  Software tokens  
  Soft Token Software Development Kits or SDKs  
  Smart cards  
  Security keys  
  Mobile credentials  
  
<p>Credential authentication is complex and more difficult to compromise. However, malware attacks may lead to access to the hardware where the unique keys are found.&nbsp;</p> 
 Email OTPs and SMS  
<p>Most websites or apps require users to register an email address or mobile number, often both. Whenever you try to access your account, two-factor authentication will be triggered, and a one-time pin (OTP) will be sent to your mobile number or email address. You must enter the OTP into the login system within a certain period.</p> 
<p>Some sites send multiple OTPs or use authentication apps to generate random codes. It should be noted that these methods are discouraged by the OMB, CISA and other agencies as they are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">susceptible to phishing and interception</a>.</p> 
 Magic Links  
<p>Similar to OTPs, if you have a registered email address or mobile number, the site or app will send a magic link that will give you access to your account. Similar to OTPs, these can pose security risks.</p> 
 Push Notification  
<p>Users receive a push notification to their device, which serves as verification of their identity. When the user clicks the notification, they will gain access to their account.</p> 
 Benefits of Using Passwordless Technology  
<p>According to a study, <a href="https://fox8.com/business/press-releases/globenewswire/8825620/composecure-launches-security-awareness-campaign/#">90% of internet users are worried</a> that their accounts will be <a href="https://dialanerd.co.za/5-ways-hackers-can-get-into-your-network">hacked due to weak passwords</a>. Weak passwords have been identified as a leading cause of data breaches in numerous studies.</p> 
<p>While a <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/cheapest-vpn/">reliable VPN</a> or Cloud DLP can help curb security breaches, protection and security can be improved with passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It’s about time sites and apps leverage passwordless technology to protect user data. Here are the benefits of such methods of authentication:</p> 
 Better Security Protection  
<p>Most users only have one password for every site and app that they use. This is a well-known security risk, but many still do it as the alternative is more complicated for them to attempt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With hackers becoming more sophisticated by the day, simple or complex passwords are no longer dependable as protection. When a cyber attacker breaches one password, multiple accounts become vulnerable. An individual can lose money or their identity in an instant. And when it happens to a company, it can lead to millions of dollars in losses.&nbsp;</p> 
 Reduced Long-Term Costs  
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/12/11/go-passwordless-strengthen-security-reduce-costs/">Passwords are expensive to manage</a>, according to Microsoft. Why? Because users often forget them, and constantly resetting them leads to a loss of productivity when the user can’t sign in. Based on Microsoft’s experience, there are associated hard costs for every hour the Microsoft Helpdesk administrator helps a single user figure out or reset a password.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since rolling out passwordless technology, Microsoft experienced an 87% reduction in soft and hard costs, estimated at $6 million and $3 million, respectively.&nbsp;</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>Most passwordless technologies provide better user experiences. Biometrics, for example, is easy to accomplish each time, with just a touch of a finger or a glance at a camera. Users gain access to their accounts in no time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Compliance With Regulatory Bodies  
<p>Regulatory bodies like the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) have a set of standards that industry players must satisfy when it comes to access controls in a bid to protect sensitive data.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most common requirements are multi-factor authentication, encryption, and hashing. Passwordless authentication will achieve all these and more. When complemented with automatic bot detection and secure session management, it can prevent broken authentication attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
 What To Look for in Passwordless Authentication Technology  
<p>Now that you know how important passwordless authentication is in the digital age, let’s look at the basic requirements when shopping for solutions.&nbsp;</p> 
 MFA for Desktop Login  
<p>While much passwordless authentication is used for mobile apps, it is best to look for vendors with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for desktop logins. For one, most employees work with desktops in the office. This is also a legal requirement of the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity#:~:text">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The work login must be complemented with offline capabilities so employees can maintain access while traveling or working remotely.&nbsp;</p> 
 Certifications  
<p>Passwordless technology providers obtain specific certifications as proof of their efficacy and credibility. Some of the top certifications for the technology include:</p> 
  
  <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Authenticator Assurance Level</a> - a NIST authentication process with three levels: AAL1 provides some assurance, AAL2 provides high confidence, and AAL3 provides very high confidence.&nbsp;  
  
  
  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification</a> - the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) alliance grants certification to validate a product’s conformance and interoperability.  
  
  
  <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa">CISA Certification</a> - the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) certifies companies that audit, control, monitor, and assess an organization’s IT and business systems.  
  
 Easy to Deploy  
<p>Using brand-new technology could disrupt productivity and may even intimidate employees. Find solutions that are easy to integrate into your operations so you can launch the system as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology with a robust SDK is easy to integrate. It should have built-in security controls for optimal functionality.&nbsp;</p> 
 Are Passwords a Thing of the Past?  
<p>Not quite yet, as passwords are still used in many sites and applications. But they are no longer dependable on their own as cybercriminals become more creative and sophisticated in breaching passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology is no longer a luxury; it is the present. Elevated authentication technology will be the future.</p>

 Now that the white paper has been released and the UKGC has outlined its plans, what do players and operators need to know? 



 



<p>After much frustration and numerous delays, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper </a>was finally released in April 2023. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the policy paper, many of the main measures will be effective by the summer of 2024. So, as the government initiates a series of consultations to convert policy into practical measures, what challenges lie ahead for the UK gambling sector, and how should UK gambling operators be prepared for the new era?</p>



<p>Numerous conferences and webinars featuring high-profile personnel with close connections to the gambling industry have also been held since April to discuss the white paper’s proposals. The much-anticipated document has certainly given the gambling industry plenty to think about, with many gambling operators pondering how best to react.&nbsp;</p>



 The UK Gambling Commission’s 3-year plan. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)</a>, which will work toward implementing the proposals in the coming years, has recently disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026">Evidence Gaps and Priorities</a> program, set to run from 2023 to 2026, mapping out areas in the UK gambling sector requiring further data collection and research.</p>



<p>In reference to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026#:~:text=The%20document%20outlines%20a%20cohesive%20and%20consistent%20framework%20for%20improving%20the%20evidence%20base%2C%20in%20line%20with%20our%20regulatory%20duties">its plan</a>, the UKGC states: “The document outlines a cohesive and consistent framework for improving the evidence base, in line with our regulatory duties.”</p>



<p>The UKGC also plans to enhance its research and evidence-based principles over the next three years, highlighting collaboration and transparency with the <a href="https://www.gamcare.org.uk/about-us/get-involved/lived-experience-forum/#:~:text=The%20Lived%20Experience%E2%80%AFForum%E2%80%AFis%20a%20group%20of%20people%E2%80%AFwho%20have%20been%20affected%20by%20gambling%20related%20harm%20which%20helps%20to%20influence%20wider%20developments%20in%20the%20prevention%2C%20support%2C%20and%20treatment%20of%20gambling%20harms%20at%20GamCare.%C2%A0">Lived Experience Forum</a>, which brings together a group of people that have lived experience of gambling related harms, either from their own gambling or from someone else’s. One of their chief aims is to share stories and insights to help influence wider developments in the prevention, support, and treatment of gambling harms.</p>



<p>The UKGC has designated six key themes of research that will function as the primary focus of its investigations:</p>



  The impact of operator practices<br>  Early gambling-related experiences and gateway products<br>  The variability and range of gambling experiences<br>  Harms and vulnerability related to gambling<br>  Gambling product characteristics and their risks<br>  Illegal gambling, fraud, and crime  



<p>Ultimately, the research process is set to examine how players respond to different gambling-related activities and the associated potential hazards. The Commission looks to understand the variability and range of different gambling experiences. For example, how betting on slots and sports betting can produce dramatically different behavior.</p>



<p>The UKGC also seeks to further its knowledge of the adverse impacts of gambling and the elements contributing to player vulnerability. By determining such potential hazards, they hope to create effective strategies that will potentially protect vulnerable individuals and safeguard them from harm.</p>



<p>With the UK’s gambling white paper now released, the Commission believes the coming years will provide more opportunities to make genuine progress toward making gambling in the UK fairer, safer, and free from crime.</p>



 How can operators prepare for the new UK gambling laws? 



<p>Operators can prepare by reviewing their ongoing policies and practices. This includes ensuring they comply with all relevant laws and regulations and identifying areas that might benefit from change. For instance, increasing the use of KYC checks. It is also crucial for operators to stay updated on any developments in the white paper, including any new proposals or updates to existing regulations.</p>



<p>According to panelist Chris Elliot, partner at law firm Wiggin, in a recent <a href="https://webinars.igamingbusiness.com/iGB/Hitting-the-jackpot-or-coming-up-short-Has-the-Gambling-white-paper-really-hit-the-mark?bmid=7936f8c37ba3">webinar</a> held by iGB in partnership with the Department of Trust, operators will face an imminent demand to figure out which consultations are most impactful for their business. As a short-term response, operators can focus, in the next few months or years, on which consultations matter. Overall, Elliot noted that the white paper presents operators with a clear and coherent policy direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial risk checks are perhaps the major cause of anxiety, with many licensees rowing back from offering VIP or loyalty clubs at online casinos. VIP services are designed to reward customers who spend large sums of money. However, after a report in 2020 that narrowed in on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/gambling-report-shows-industrys-reliance-on-loss-making-customers#:~:text=One%20of%20its%20rivals%20took,blow%20to%20the%20industry's%20revenues.">industry’s reliance on problem gamblers</a>, some operators decided to remove VIP schemes altogether.</p>



<p>The now obligated<a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/global/gambling-white-paper#:~:text=Unsurprisingly%2C%20the%20white%20paper%20proposes%20new%20obligations%20on%20operators%20to%20conduct%20%E2%80%9Cfinancial%20risk%20checks%E2%80%9D%20on%20customers%20who%20may%20be%20at%20risk%20of%20harm%20due%20to%20unaffordable%20and%20unsustainable%20gambling%20losses"> financial risk checks</a> are likely to significantly impact the quality of the gaming experience. Operators must now carry out financial checks if players incur a £125 net loss within a month or a £500 net loss in a year, with the most rigorous checks effective at a £1000 net loss in one day or £2000 net loss in 90 days.</p>



<p>Bodies such as the <a href="https://www.britishhorseracing.com/">British Horseracing Authority</a> questioned how intrusive these checks might be. However, ministers were quick to emphasize their desire for the checks to be as frictionless as possible. Consequently, operators must conduct these checks with the least friction possible or risk losing customers to other brands where checks feel less intrusive. Operators failing to comply with the new financial risk checks and keeping up to date with new requirements <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/05/02/white-paper-finance-risk/#:~:text=Operators%20could%2C%20therefore%2C%20be%20wary%20of%20the%20new%20finance%20risk%20checks%20and%20ensure%20they%20keep%20up%20to%20speed%20with%20new%20requirements%20to%20avoid%20fines.%C2%A0">could risk fines</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC will also undertake consultation on design rules for online gaming products, to take into account the impact of features such as the speed of play, the illusion of player control, and other features prone to heighten risk.</p>



<p>Considered a high-risk product, online slots are typically associated with long, binge sessions, large losses, and no statutory stake limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, stake limits will be introduced, consulting on a limit ranging from £2-£15 per spin. Greater protections have also been considered for 18-24-year-old players who are considered more vulnerable, e.g., options of a £2 stake or £4 stake limit per spin or a separate approach predicated on individual risk.</p>



 Who wants to be a VIP anyway? 



<p>There are two parts of the white paper that, either intentionally or not, will heavily impact the online gaming experience of VIPs or high-spending customers: slot limits and financial risk checks. It is highly likely, therefore, that the operators that are currently offering services to VIPS may decide to change tact, and refocus on the mass market.</p>



<p>However, although the now compulsory slot limits will make the process of attracting high rollers more challenging, gambling platforms shouldn’t necessarily neglect this player base. After all, the problem doesn’t lie with high rollers, who can afford to gamble significant amounts, but the one-size fits all approach. Operators must therefore look for innovative ways of offering VIP services, rather than just avoiding offering them altogether. It is therefore crucial for such consultations to find a voice for all customers. Operators need to put customers at the forefront.</p>



 3 further steps toward the new UK gambling laws.&nbsp; 



<p>To prepare for the new, updated and more accountable UK gambling landscape, operators should focus on three specific areas to ensure they meet new and upcoming compliance requirements:</p>


 
 
 
 Evidence 
 

<p>Evidence will remain a keyword for the next five years for the UKGC, and should be for operators too, who must now provide evidence of the decisions they make and the programs they implement.</p>

 
 
 
 Innovation 
 

<p>Innovation will become the answer to many of the challenges posed by the white paper, particularly open banking: one of the key drivers for innovation, alongside  artificial intelligence.</p>

 
 
 
 Collaboration 
 

<p>Collaboration will be essential across different business units and operations to effectively utilize innovative technologies. The goal is to protect consumers and enhance operations by automating processes, all while ensuring consistency and coherence in a thorough and comprehensive manner.</p>

 
 
 
 


 How can operators prepare for the future? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open up, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Canada</a>, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology that enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer checks</a>. Many current IDV platforms utilize the latest data analytics tools to ensure their players are who they say they are, the age they claim to be, and with the financial means they claim to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another crucial consideration for operators is the need to focus on and further enhance responsible gambling practices. The key to preparing for the future of the UK’s gambling industry is to be agile, innovative, collaborative, and focused on offering the best possible customer experience.</p>



<p>Our highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">platform for identity proofing in the gaming market</a> allows operators to keep abreast of constantly changing regulations, and new fraud schemes and scams, while ensuring a safe, secure and seamless gaming experience. With our latest round of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, we now offer UK-specific data checks, and financial risk checks, which provide operators with insights into a player’s affordability indicators to comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act.</p>



<p>This not only helps businesses avoid potential fines and reputational damage, but also allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>

   2023 ForgeRock Breach Report underscores the need for AI-powered identity 

<p>We are excited to announce the release of our fifth annual <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a>. Our goal each year is to discover what's trending — how enterprises are being breached, how many records are being exposed, and how attackers are getting past security controls that cost companies roughly $88 billion a year.<a>1</a></p>

<p>As in previous years' reports, we have published our key findings, including the industries most vulnerable to attack, the rising costs, and the leading cause of breaches (unauthorized access wins that dubious honor once again!). But this year's report revealed one trend we have not seen before: a significant drop in the number of breached records. In fact, the number was the lowest we've seen in five years. So can we infer that the bad guys are giving up, taking their keyboards and going home? If only!</p>

<p>An obvious challenge of storing so much sensitive personal information in digital form is that this data is highly valuable to criminals. And it appears in the last year that they've been going for quality over quantity – the number of records containing protected health information (PHI) rose by 160%. Why? Because a single healthcare record in the U.S. is now fetching $675 on the black market. Such records can be used widely for fraud, from filing false insurance claims to obtaining prescription drugs illegally. No wonder healthcare is the most highly targeted sector, accounting for 36% of all breaches.</p>

 An emerging threat: they're using AI to devise new attacks (and we can use AI to stop them) 

<p>This year, we've all been hearing a lot about generative AI, which produces various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data. Expect to hear a lot more about how generative AI makes it easier to impersonate others and perpetrate fraud.</p>

<p>Researchers recently discovered underground hacking communities using ChatGPT to generate malware, create encryption suitable for ransomware, and devise other fraudulent schemes. The new AI wave is contributing to a huge increase in voice and video deepfakes.</p>

<p>As criminals find novel ways to use AI, we can use AI to thwart their efforts. Decisioning AI, which fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> product, is essential for elevating protection against AI-based threats in a granular and responsive way.</p>

<p>AI that specializes in risk decisioning can take in a range of signals about who is trying to do what –&nbsp;and then determine what they can or cannot do next. Decisioning AI can also prevent attempts to gain unauthorized access by incorporating multiple contextual signals into the decision process, such as login location, IP network reputation, and the distance between login attempts and registered MFA devices.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management (IAM) can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>

 Third-party attacks: do your partners' security practices measure up to yours? 

<p>The 2023 report shows how a tactic that emerged in last year's report is now routine: breaching high-value organizations through their third-party partners and vendors. These attacks increased 136% from the year before and accounted for more than half of all breaches this time around. Attackers know that hospitals, for example, face strict regulations for protecting patient data – but hospitals' suppliers may be less stringent.</p>

<p>In one breach alone, an accounts payable vendor supporting hundreds of healthcare organizations was the victim of a ransomware attack, which allowed attackers to access systems and documents containing patient-related data. The breach affected more than 657 healthcare organizations and almost two million people.</p>

<p>Poorly protected integrations between third-party suppliers and the organizations that rely on them — weak access controls, vulnerable API integrations, or a lack of MFA for employee accounts — can be used to exploit third-party providers. Without strong identity security and governance, API security, and a least-privileged access model, an attacker can breach one workforce user's account and move laterally, not just across a vendor's systems but also its partners' systems, to find and exploit valuable data.</p>

<p>Our report shows that ransomware and unauthorized access were the leading attack vectors in third-party service provider breaches.</p>

 High-value data needs high-quality protection at the identity perimeter 

<p>The underlying theme of this year's report is that it takes only one compromised credential to pave the way for unauthorized access and the exposure of sensitive data, including customer data. This is not news to most of us, but it's worth reasserting now, in light of so many attacks on partner ecosystems.</p>

<p>This trend means that every identity must be secured — not just your workforce users and contractors, but every identity in your partners' organizations as well. Implementing single sign-on (SSO), passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA), and effective identity governance practices is vital for preventing unauthorized access. And this year we're seeing AI become essential in stopping breaches and for handling an onslaught of threats that are themselves AI-generated.</p>

<p>Dhiway has powered ON Sparknet, intending to enable developers with a platform to experiment with and build natively Web 3.0-ready applications.</p>



<p>Sparknet is built from the ground up using CORD. The project design is biased towards enabling modularity, decentralized governance, security and scalability. On Sparknet, developers can get the opportunity to build applications which leverage the key features.</p>



 
 Unique persistent cryptographic identifiers to better manage the representation of off-chain data. These persistent identifiers can help track the modifications to a diverse set of data objects, thus addressing some of the shortcomings of using hash-based systems. 



 On-chain delegations to enable the creation of delegation hierarchies for authorization and coordinated decision-making. 



 Creating dynamic data registries allows applications to build authenticated data sources, including collections of identifiers and data schemas. 
 



<p>CORD also introduces additional technological innovations that enhance trust in data exchange over the network. These include verifiable attributes, auditable history, and a comprehensive stack featuring tiered transactions, delegations, authorizations, and governance. The persistent identifiers available on CORD enable long-term verifiability, a requirement for sectors like supply chain management, healthcare, IP management, notarization services, public sector services and other systems where the capability to independently verify the integrity and authenticity of data over extended periods is crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sparknet is designed to provide a fully functional sandbox for application development. It comprises different types of nodes – boot node, full node, validator node and archive node. Today, the CORD project has pre-built binaries available, which can be used to get started quickly <a href="https://dhiway.notion.site/CORD-Sparknet-Deployment-643a902b3d714927b447f42b66c7f55e">view documentation</a>. Coming up – machine instances will be made available to reduce the time required for setting up a node and attaching it to a running network.</p>



<p>The CORD project and Sparknet have been designed to offer an improved experience of blockchain technology specifically for applications which need high scalability and throughput. Applications on Sparknet can be designed around the W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for use cases such as identity verification flows, data sharing and data exchange needs and controlling access to services.</p>

<p>Fission is ecosystem-obsessed. We believe in collaboration over competition and use this approach to build protocols and invent new tools that benefit everyone. In some cases, we've initiated these efforts. In others, we're active contributors. But in everything, we strive to make the Web more sustainable, equitable, and secure.</p> Fission-Led Efforts <p>UCAN - <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">User Controlled Authorization Networks</a> are a secure way of handling authorization in a distributed system. They use capabilities rather than an access control list, removing the need for a centralized server. UCANs were created by Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, in 2019. <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">The protocol is open source</a>, and the lovely team at <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3storage</a> has co-authored UCAN specs. Brendan from their team also created a <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/go-ucan/tree/master">go-ucan</a> implementation. We also run <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers, spec maintainers, and users come together to ask questions and build out new features.</p><p>WNFS - Webnative File System is a versioned content-addressable distributed file system with private and public sub-systems. It offers concurrent writes and offline access. <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and we have worked with the community to build a <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">Rust implementation</a>. Special thanks to the <a href="https://banyan.computer/">Banyan</a> team, who worked on large files, and the <a href="https://fx.land/">Functionland</a> team, who worked on mobile. Functionland also made a React native version. </p><p>RhizomeDB - RhizomeDB is a far-edge database for querying decentralized data in local-first applications. <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">The protocol is open source</a> and currently under construction.</p><p>IPVM - The Interplanetary Virtual Machine brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and our friends on the <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a> team have co-authored IPVM specs. We run <a href="https://lu.ma/ipvm">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers and users can collaborate to build out the VM. The <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> Rust implementation is available today. </p><p>Distributed Systems Reading Group - The DSys RG is a monthly virtual meetup led by our Staff Research Engineer, Zeeshan, for folks interested in learning more about distributed systems. The group picks a paper to read each month (classic or contemporary), a volunteer presents a summary, and then a general discussion follows. Check out the YouTube <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey_Adz2pUZFQdw7sp2mSiSbV">playlist</a> for call recordings. </p><p>Secure/Design Working Group - The Secure/Design WG is a product and UX-focused community seeking to make secure outcomes more probable in distributed systems. Initiated by Ryan, Fission's Head of Design, the group hosts <a href="https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-FOmHnDL7EZJ6P5F">monthly community calls</a> and has a <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/secure-design/discussions">GitHub discussion board</a>.</p> Places We Contribute <p>Filecoin - &nbsp;Filecoin is an open-source, public cryptocurrency and digital payment system intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. Fission is a member of the Permissioned Data Working Group, which is focused on enabling permissioned and private data on Filecoin. We're also a FIL Accounts Working Group member, working to integrate UCAN and WalletAuth into FIL Accounts in 2023.</p><p>Protocol Labs Network - The <a href="https://www.plnetwork.io/">PLN</a> comprises hundreds of DWeb and blockchain companies working together to enhance the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems. Fission is deeply involved with the PLN, from events to the marketing council to building the PL Network Mastodon server. </p><p>CASA - The <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a> is a collection of working groups dedicated to blockchain protocol-agnostic standards. CASA also publishes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals</a>, which describe standards created by the different working groups to make blockchains interoperable. Fission initiated <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> in response to MetaMask deprecating ETH encrypt/decrypt, and we are working with others in CASA to document a secure way for blockchain key material to be used for encryption and decryption.</p><p>IPFS - IPFS is a P2P hypermedia protocol that powers content-addressable data storage across a distributed network. Fission submitted one of the first accepted IPIPs, <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-redirect-support-for-ipfs/">Redirect Support for IPFS</a>.</p><p>In conclusion, Fission is involved in many ecosystem projects, with more in the works. If you're building in the distributed or decentralized web and want to work together, please join our Discord and let us know about your project. We'd love to see how we can support you! </p>

<p>The goal of Bluesky is to turn social media into a shared public commons. We don’t want to own people’s social graphs or communities. We want to be a tool that helps communities own and govern themselves.</p>
<p>The reason we focus on communities is that for an open commons to work, there needs to be some sort of structure that protects the people who participate. Safety can’t just be left up to each individual to deal with on their own. The burden this puts on people — especially those who are most vulnerable to online abuse and harassment — is too high. It also doesn’t mirror how things work in the real world: we form groups and communities so that we can help each other. The tooling we’re building for moderation tries to take into consideration how social spaces are formed and shaped through communities.</p>
<p>Today, we’re publishing some proposals for new moderation and safety tooling. The first focuses on user lists and reply controls which can be used for community-driven moderation. The second will focus on moderator services and how they can handle problems that small communities can’t. The third is for Hashtags, which are not directly related to moderation but can have a large effect on customizing what you see. (We wanted to include this to distinguish between the labeling proposal, which is intended to address moderation, and mechanisms for discovery.)</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0002-labeling-and-moderation-controls">Labeling and Moderation Controls</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals are <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals">published on GitHub</a>, and we’d love to hear your feedback and discussion there. In the rest of this post, we want to first share some insight into why we believe a public commons is important for social media.</p>
 Why build a public commons? 
<p>We’re a public benefit company that was formed with the mission “to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.” We believe that public conversations, which form the basis of a democratic society, should be held in spaces that can be a shared public commons.</p>
<p>A company is an efficient structure for building out a cohesive vision of how things should work, but locking users into our systems would be antithetical to our mission. An open commons can’t be governed at the sole discretion of one global company. We offer services like professional moderators so that we can help protect people and provide a good experience, but we shouldn’t exert total control over everyone’s experience, for all time, with no alternative. Users should be able to walk away from us without walking away from their social lives.</p>
<p>The reason we’re building in decentralization is because we observed that business interests and the open web have a habit of coming into conflict. Third-party developers often get locked out. Moderation policies come into conflict with the diverse interests and needs of different groups of users. Ads push towards algorithms that optimize for engagement. It’s a systemic problem that keeps playing out as centralized social media companies rise and fall.</p>
<p>Some might think this isn’t a big deal. Maybe social media is like a club, and the place can be happening one day and dead the next. Would it be so bad if people just moved on to the next joint...? The problem is that people put their lives and livelihoods into these networks. When a network shuts down, people lose out on a lot: they lose their connections, they lose their creative work, and they lose their places of business. Social networks are not just products; they’ve become digital homes.</p>
<p>Even when things are working correctly on social platforms, there are weird dynamics caused by people’s relationships being mediated by a single company. The Internet is pretty obviously real life in the sense that its management has real-world consequences. When these places control our identities and our ability to connect and to make money, having no way out from the founding company is a precarious situation. The power difference is daunting.</p>
<p>The goal of Bluesky is to rebuild social networking so that there’s not a lock-in to the founding company, which is us. We can try to provide a cohesive, enjoyable experience, but there’s always an exit. Users can move their accounts to other providers. Developers can run their own connected infrastructure. Creators can keep access to their audiences. We hope this helps break the cycle of social media companies coming into conflict with the open web.</p>
 What should this feel like? 
<p>Social media has a reputation for being emotionally chaotic. Some days it can be fulfilling, and other days it can be a box of horrors. If we’re going to succeed in our mission of creating social media that operates as a sustainable public commons, these tools need to not just be good in theory, but actually help create a better social space than what has come before. Our goal for investing in moderation tooling and processes is to create a better public commons for conversations to take place in. Perhaps it can even be a happy, healthy, and predominantly enjoyable space.</p>
<p>Here’s some of what we think it takes to create a great experience:</p>
<p>A great experience should be simple to use. It shouldn’t be overly complex, and there should be sensible defaults and well-run entry points. If things are going well, the average user shouldn’t have to notice what parts are decentralized, or how many layers have come together to determine what they see. However, if conflict arises, there should be easy levers for individuals and communities to pull so that they can reconfigure their experience.</p>
<p>A great experience should recognize that toxicity is not driven only by bad actors. Good intentions can create runaway social behaviors that then create needless conflict. The network should include ways to downregulate behaviors – not just amplify them.</p>
<p>A great experience should respect the burden that community management can place on people. Someone who sets out to help protect others can quickly find themselves responsible for a number of difficult choices. The tooling that’s provided should take into account ways to help avoid burnout.</p>
<p>A great experience should find a balance between creating friendly spaces and over-policing each other. The impulse to protect can sometimes degrade into nitpicking. We should drive towards norms that feel natural and easy to observe.</p>
<p>A great experience should reflect the diversity of views within the network. Decisions that are subjective should be configurable. Moderation should not force the network into a monoculture.</p>
<p>Finally, a great experience should remember that social networking can be pleasant one day and harsh the next. There should be ways to react to sudden events or shifts in your mood. Sometimes you need a way to be online but not be 100% available.</p>
 What’s our development process? 
<p>During the private beta, we’ve been actively responding to user feedback. For example, based on user feedback, we recently introduced an optional “context” field to add a few lines of text to reports so that moderators can better understand issues that require more context to make a decision on. With these upcoming proposals, we’re looking for feedback ahead of time so we can get to the best outcomes quickly and prepare for opening up the network.</p>
<p>The proposals we’re publishing have been in the works for awhile; we focused on moderation and safety from the earliest moments of developing Bluesky and the AT Protocol, even if they didn’t always appear to be front and center. We’ve been fleshing out our ideas over the last few months through the practical experience of engaging with users during the Bluesky app’s beta. In designing these, we researched existing tooling implemented on other sites, discussed with users from different communities on the app, consulted with trust &amp; safety advisors, and above all, constantly asked ourselves what tools would reduce harm, protect people, and decrease the likelihood of bad outcomes.</p>
<p>Decisions such as who has the right to speak or moderate an online space are intrinsically controversial. And it isn’t just about platforms making moderation decisions. For example, the ability to moderate replies to your own threads introduces complex tradeoffs around safety, counterspeech, and accountability. Replies are an area where some of the nastiest forms of abuse can happen, so we felt that per-thread moderation was a good idea. But there are downsides, too: For example, if a thread contains misinformation, then giving reply controls to the author means they might use it to suppress corrections from other users. Our hypothesis, reflected in the moderation proposals we’re sharing, is that giving users more tools to protect themselves from harassment is worth some downsides like not always having the record corrected in the replies.</p>
<p>We’re presenting proposals for community discussion and developer feedback to help develop a rough consensus around these approaches — these tools won’t be effective unless people actually use them. They’re a set of tools that are meant to overlap, work together, and provide the building blocks for new ideas.</p>
 An updated Community Guidelines 
<p>In addition to working on moderation tooling, we’ve also been developing new policies and processes to moderate the services we run. As we explain in the community guidelines:</p>
<p>Bluesky Social is one service built on top of the AT Protocol. While we won’t always be able to control everything that happens on other services that use the AT Protocol, we take our responsibility to the users of Bluesky Social seriously. Our community guidelines are designed to promote a safe and enjoyable experience. To achieve this goal, we moderate the content on Bluesky Social, and you can also adjust content filters within the app according to your preferences.</p>
<p>An important site of moderation is the servers themselves, and we want our policies to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for users who enter the network through our services. If the moderation tooling we’re building is like the building blocks and foundations of a city, the norms and policies we’re setting are how we’re actually going to run the city.</p>
<p>For the Bluesky servers we run (that is, the Bluesky app you’ve been using up to this point), we’re publishing updated Community Guidelines next week, linked to in our Terms of Service, which includes the following:</p>
 
 Treat others with respect. For example, no:
 
 Threats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence against people, groups, or animals 
 Repeated harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group 
 Encouraging self-harm or suicide 
 Promoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation 
 Depictions of excessive violence, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity 
 Misleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities 
 
 
 
<p>The actions that we take to enforce these guidelines will include removing individual posts and suspending and removing users from our services.</p>
<p>In the future, other services built on the AT Protocol might choose to adopt their own community guidelines that differ from ours. In a federated model, each server has discretion over what they choose to serve and who they choose to connect to. If you disagree with a server’s moderation policies, you can take your account, social connections, and data to another service.</p>
 Proposals 
<p>We’ve created a new GitHub repository to host some of these proposals to streamline discussion. You can find the links to them here:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0001-user-lists-replygating-and-thread-moderation">User Lists, Reply-Gating, and Thread Moderation</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0002-labeling-and-moderation-controls">Labeling and Moderation Controls</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals, and our implementation of them, are not the end of what is possible in an open network — they are part of a process of development that will go through multiple iterations. Other companies or communities can also help set norms and build tooling, but we are investing in a best-effort first pass at creating a safe, pleasant, resilient public social commons. Your feedback, both in the app and through GitHub, is appreciated. Thanks for joining us on this journey.</p>

  <p>Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and TrustBuilder as they discuss how to tackle these and other modern Identity Management challenges by using Policy-Based Access Controls and combining different personas into a single user profile to enable users to authenticate with a single set of credentials.</p>
<p>Nitish Deshpande, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will examine the concept of Policy Based Access Control (PBAC), looking at what that entails, as well as the security and business advantages of adopting this approach to identity management.</p>
<p>Kurt Berghs, Product Manager at TrustBuilder will explain how using PBAC with personas consolidates multiple accounts across disparate systems into one user profile for each identity, enables the management of user lifecycles, secures complex environments, and allows organizations to delegate rights enabled with self-service.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse brings a new release for the 0.1.x branch of Holochain. We’re still recommending that you stick with this branch for now, as we’re still troubleshooting performance issues in the 0.2.x branch.</p><p>Meanwhile, a goodly number of our team and community are en route or at DWeb Camp, where we’ll be involved in all sorts of ways — including being a sponsor!</p> Holochain 0.1.5: Backwards compatibility fixes <p>As you may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-01x-series-skip-014-wait-for-015">read</a> in the last Dev Pulse, I recommended that you not upgrade your hApp and userbase to Holochain 0.1.4, and instead wait for 0.1.5. Well here’s 0.1.5, with a bugfix for the broken dev environment (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2252?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2252</a>) as well as:</p>  There’s a compatibility path for a change to the database schema introduced in 0.1.4, so you can use 0.1.5 on databases created by older conductors (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2253?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2253</a>).  Some housekeeping tasks backported from 0.2: removal of the testing framework from the default build of the conductor (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>), and repair of a remote signals test (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2318?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2318</a>).  Breaking (sort of): 0.1.4 fixed a bug whereby a DNA’s name was mistakenly included when hashing the DNA. This broke some apps in the wild, so it’s been reverted (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>) and the correct functionality will appear in 0.2 onwards. This is not a breaking change if you’re updating your hApp from Holochain 0.1.3 to 0.1.5; it’s only breaking if you’re updating from 0.1.4.  <p>Additionally, you may want to read all the changes in 0.1.4 (with the exception that the last bullet point above reverts a change introduced in 0.1.4). Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/compare/holochain-0.1.3...holochain-0.1.5?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed">full changelog since 0.1.3</a>.</p> Known issues   In large-scale stress tests (around 200+ highly active nodes per conductor) we’re noticing some performance issues. These show up as zome call timeouts, high virtual memory usage, and dropped WebSocket connections — in short, the conductor gradually becomes unresponsive and needs to be restarted. We’re all-hands-on-deck troubleshooting this issue right now, and we believe it might also be present in 0.2.x and 0.3.x.  An out-of-bounds memory error is occasionally happening; depending on the circumstances, this can cause subsequent zome calls to fail. We’re putting in more tracing throughout the codebase to diagnose issues like this.  There’s a rounding error in the sharding algorithm that causes mismatches in the region of data being synced. (You can find out about regions in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Dev Pulse</a> from last year.) As we’re nearing the end of the six-month support promise for 0.1, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">fix for that</a> will land in 0.2.1.   Launcher release notes  0.9.4: UX improvements, bugfixes <p>This version has a few fixes, including better App Library download feedback, improved German translation, better error handling, and a bugfix for web forms on Linux.</p> 0.10.0: Holochain 0.1.5 support, more UX improvements <p>This version comes with Holochain 0.1.5. And it continues to get UX polish thanks to our friend Tibet Sprague from <a href="https://terran.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Terran Collective</a>. He’s been redesigning various parts of the UI to make things more accessible for everyone.</p><p>The most important UX change is mostly invisible — the hApp store no longer requires you to be part of the DevHub DNA and sync all the data. Instead, your node will look for a DevHub host and request the download from them. This means you don’t have to wait until you’re a full peer in the DevHub network before you can download hApp packages, which speeds up the first-run experience.</p>A screenshot of the new settings pane in the Launcher UI, showing the amount of resources each Holochain version is using, along with settings for each hApp, which used to be on the main pane.&nbsp;<p>There are a lot of changes; too many to list here. Just <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">download the Launcher</a> and see for yourself. And this is just a start — you’ll see more UX work in future releases!</p><p>This version is a breaking change, in that hApps that you installed in previous versions of the Launcher won’t show up in this version.</p> Known issues <p>Launcher is built on a Rust library called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, which is similar to Electron but of course Rust-based. It uses the operating system’s default web view library to display UIs. As such, we inherit any bugs that exist upstream in Tauri. Here are the ones we know about:</p>  Downloading files from a hApp that supports it is not supported on macOS.  App windows don’t have their own menu on macOS.  Trying to open a hApp UI that’s already open but minimised will not bring it to the front on some Linux distros.  Because of the dependency on the system web view, your hApp UI should target the built-in browser of the oldest desktop OS that your userbase is using.  As an example of this from the Launcher UI itself, on macOS Monterey the toggle switch for the new ‘developer mode’ (which allows you to become a DevHub host and upload packages to the hApp store) doesn’t toggle on.  hApp UIs that use WebRTC aren’t supported on Linux.  Launcher can freeze on macOS when an app is opened in full-screen view.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.9.5</a>.</p> Quick update on Holochain 0.2.1 progress <p>We were planning to release a new version quick on the heels of Holochain 0.2.0 to repair both a peer discovery issue and some network performance issues. The peer discovery issue is fixed, but we’re still troubleshooting the performance issues where there is less to no gossip between peers until one of them publishes a new piece of data. In doing so, we're also building more robust testing tooling to get finer-grained insight into them. We expect to release 0.2.1 soon given what we've recently learned.</p><p>At this point, we recommend that you stick with 0.1.5. You’re still welcome to try out the 0.2.x series releases (and dev candidates in the 0.3.x series — in fact <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> is in the process of upgrading to 0.3 already); just be prepared for the aforementioned bottlenecks. We’re also planning to roll some of the work already done on 0.3 into 0.2.1, giving it features we didn’t expect the 0.2.x series to have. Stay tuned!</p> Getting ready for DWeb Camp <p>We’re really looking forward to <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> in Navarro, CA, USA, which started on Wednesday, 21 June. A good number of us from the Holochain community and team from across the world are attending, volunteering, giving talks, hosting discussions, and taking care of meeting spaces. Not only that, but we’ll be a camp sponsor for the first time this year.</p><p>DWeb Camp will be a time for connecting, making new relationships with devs who don’t yet know that Holochain is the thing they’re looking for, and of course showing the DWeb community what Holochain can do. The theme this year is ‘Discovering Flows’, which is a lovely description of what happens there. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">really enjoyed</a> last year. We’ll be sharing how this year went when we get back!</p>Art and Eric lead a conversation on DAOs at DWeb Camp 2022, with a few others from the Holochain community also among the participants.&nbsp;<p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@promemouse?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Dian Yu</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZV7CO7hpZdA?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  WTR II applies to EU-based Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and also comes into play when these EU-based CASPs send crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.  CASPs must collect and retain sender and receiver information for crypto transfers exceeding 1,000&nbsp;Euros.  Through WTR II, the EU is actively seeking to enhance transparency and accountability in crypto transactions.  <p>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory frameworks are constantly playing catch-up.</p><p>The European Union (EU), known for being a forerunner in policy changes, has once again taken a bold leap forward with the introduction of Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II), sometimes called Transfer of Funds regulation. And as these regulations tighten, the crypto sector must step up to the challenge of ensuring compliance while preserving user privacy and security.</p><p>WTR II, in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, aims to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terror financing. It mandates the exchange of sender and receiver information during crypto transactions.</p><p>With this requirement, the EU aims to usher in a paradigm shift, significantly affecting anonymity, which many would rate as the most prized feature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The key to navigating these new regulatory waters lies in finding a solution that can reconcile the need for compliance with the equally important need to safeguard user data. One such promising solution is <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Veriscope</a>, Shyft Network’s very own Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>With Shyft Veriscope, we not only allow for the seamless exchange of user data amongst VASPs, but we also manage to do so without storing data on third-party servers or our own, keeping data privacy&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s peer-to-peer model also helps VASPs comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. Moreover, it offers an automated process that minimizes any negative impact on user experience, a major concern for many crypto businesses.</p><p>Although the EU isn’t likely to endorse a specific method for user data exchange, the onus is on VASPs to find a way to conform to the new regulations with minimal disruption. This means adopting a solution like Shyft Veriscope that can offer the necessary balance between compliance and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the crypto industry grapples with these challenges, solutions like Shyft Veriscope represent a beacon of hope. It demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence between regulatory compliance and user privacy, thereby shaping the future of cryptocurrencies in a progressively regulated environment.</p> When Does WTR II&nbsp;Apply? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) primarily applies under two key circumstances.</p><p>The first is when a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP), such as a cryptocurrency exchange, is involved in facilitating a crypto transaction. This facilitation includes activities such as executing, managing, or advising on the transaction.</p><p>The second circumstance is geographic in nature. If the CASP operates or has its registered office within the European Union (EU), the WTR II comes into effect. This geographic condition makes the WTR II relevant not just within the EU but also when an EU-based CASP engages in crypto transactions with entities outside the&nbsp;EU.</p> Information Obligations <p>For crypto-asset transfers, WTR II places obligations on the CASPs to gather and retain specific information about the transaction’s sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary). The aim is to ensure traceability of transactions, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability.</p><p>In case of missing or incomplete information about a transaction, it could be flagged as potentially risky. This necessitates the CASP to assess whether the transaction might be suspicious, possibly warranting reporting to the relevant financial intelligence unit under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing legislative framework.</p><p>As such, WTR II, in its essence, functions as a comprehensive guideline, not merely a regulatory rule. It fosters transparency, safeguards users, and combats illicit activities in the dynamic world of crypto-assets. And hence, for businesses, comprehending the nuances of its scope is crucial to navigating the compliance landscape where the stakes are high, and adherence to rules is paramount.</p> Exceptions to the&nbsp;Rule <p>EU’s Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR II) has a broad reach, yet it’s not an all-encompassing rule for every crypto transaction. There are certain scenarios where WTR II doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>For instance, when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) acting independently, WTR II provisions do not apply. Why is it so? WTR II assumes that both parties involved are aware of their actions and responsibilities.</p><p>The same goes for person-to-person crypto transfers without a CASP’s involvement. In such cases, the transaction happens directly between individuals, not unlike a cash handover, and thus, WTR II doesn’t apply in such a circumstance.</p> Self-Hosted Nuances <p>Now, let’s navigate the complex world of self-hosted wallets. These are personal crypto wallets that users manage independently, unlike wallets provided by a crypto exchange.</p><p>If a CASP’s client sends or receives funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must collect information about both parties. However, they typically aren’t required to verify the self-hosted wallet user’s identity.</p><p>But here’s the twist: when a transaction involves more than 1000 Euros and is facilitated by a CASP to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP has to ensure that the client indeed controls the self-hosted wallet.</p><p>Picture this as a safety check to verify the identity of the individual involved in a high-value transaction, similar to the protocols banks&nbsp;follow.</p><p>However, for transfers that occur between accounts managed entirely within the framework of the CASPs — like those on a cryptocurrency exchange — this 1000 Euro threshold for additional verification doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>So, while WTR II applies to most crypto transactions, it still leaves room to provide enough flexibility.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR&nbsp;II)? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) is an initiative of the European Union intended to curb the purported use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: Who does WTR II apply&nbsp;to? <p>WTR II applies to all EU-based CASPs and cases where an EU-based CASP sends crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.</p> Q3: What information obligations does WTR II place on&nbsp;CASPs? <p>WTR II imposes specific obligations on CASPs with regard to crypto-asset transfers. CASPs are required to collect and hold detailed information about both the sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary) involved in a transaction. And if the necessary information is incomplete or missing, the transaction could be flagged as potentially risky.</p> Q4: Are there exceptions to WTR&nbsp;II? <p>Yes, exceptions to WTR II exist. For instance, the regulation does not apply when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are CASPs acting independently. Similarly, it does not govern person-to-person crypto transfers conducted without a CASP’s involvement.</p> Q5: How does WTR II affect self-hosted wallets? <p>WTR II has a specific impact on self-hosted wallets. When a client of a CASP transfers funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must gather information about both parties. However, when a transaction exceeds 1000 Euros and involves a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must confirm that the client truly controls the self-hosted wallet.</p> Final Note <p>As the crypto industry continues to expand and mature, regulatory frameworks like WTR II are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto transactions. The key challenge lies in balancing the need for robust AML and CTF measures while preserving the privacy and security that make cryptocurrencies attractive.</p><p>Amid this shifting landscape, solutions like Shyft Veriscope are proving instrumental. By enabling CASPs to comply with WTR II and FATF’s Travel Rule in a manner that respects user privacy, Shyft Veriscope demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence of regulatory compliance and data protection. This is a significant step forward in navigating the compliance challenges and the fast-paced evolution of the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>Indeed, the introduction of WTR II serves as a stern reminder that regulations are as much a part of the crypto industry as innovation and disruption. By understanding and adapting to these changes, the crypto sector can continue its upward trajectory while ensuring a safer and more transparent environment for all participants.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>With the explosion of Software as a service applications, organizations are juggling a lot – from rollout out hybrid/remote work policies; supporting employee, contractor and vendor hiring and off-boarding; managing various identities, and ensuring only authorized users have access to what their job requires. This work has become critical to ensuring smooth processes, preventing account take over (ATO) attacks and reducing costs.</p>
<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is transforming Identity and Access Management in SaaS platforms, workflow, and Identity lifecycle management. SCIM is an open standard protocol designed to simplify the management of identities in cloud-based applications and services. SCIM provides predefined schema for users and groups, and a RESTful API, for automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning, making it easier for systems and applications to communicate identity-related data.</p>
<p>The key benefits for using SCIM based provisioning are preventing account takeover, mitigate the risk of dormant accounts, and achieve cost savings through permission rightsizing and streamlined onboarding &amp; offboarding processes.</p>
<p>User Provisioning &amp; De-provisioning</p>
<p>For an organization that uses multiple SaaS applications like O365, Salesforce, Slack, WorkDay, Webex, and Dropbox amongst others, manually creating and managing user access for these applications is time consuming and carries high security risks. For example when a new employee joins the organization, an IT administrator would have to individually create access across all these applications, a process that can take hours, if not days. Similarly, when an employee leaves or changes roles within the organization, it is critical to swiftly revoke all access to prevent potential misuse. Implementing SCIM can streamline and automate this process. For instance, when integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Entrust IDaaS, any change in the user status gets automatically updated across all the SaaS applications connected with IDaaS. So, a new user added to Entrust IDaaS gets automatically provisioned in Salesforce, Slack, Workday, Webex, and Dropbox, while an employee leaving the organization gets deactivated immediately, thus preventing unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Streamlining Workflow Management</p>
<p>Each application has it’s own user management, making it challenging to maintain data consistency. For example, if an employee moves from one department to another, their access rights need to be updated in each application – which can lead to inconsistencies if done manually. However, with SCIM, changes made in the central identity management system like Entrust IDaaS is automatically propagated through all connected applications, ensuring up-to-date and consistent access privileges, which enhances workflow management and overall efficiency.</p>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management</p>
<p>For a rapidly growing tech startup, frequent identity lifecycle events include onboarding new employees, assigning them to projects, updating their roles, and offboarding them when leaving the organization. Each ‘identity lifecycle event’ must be accurately reflected in the organization’s systems and applications to prevent dormant or under / over privileged accounts that could cause potential security threats.</p>
<p>Automating user provisioning and deprovisioning process across different platforms through SCIM will ensure that the update is mirrored across all integrated systems and applications. Direct integration with HR Systems like Workday can kickstart the entire Identity Lifecycle Management of the new, moving or departing employee. Such automated governance with least privilege access helps organizations deploy zero trust framework / architecture (ZTA) that leads to sustained high levels of security.</p>
<p>Cost-Saving</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening security and lifecycle management, deploying SCIM can also yield cost savings through automation, reducing the manual effort involved in identity management. For example, if an IT administrator typically spends 20 minutes managing each user’s access rights across five different applications, then an organization with 1000 employees will need to invest more than 330 hours just for a single round of access updates. With SCIM, this effort can be cut down, saving substantial labor costs while also minimizing the possibility of human errors that could lead to even more costly security incidents.</p>
<p>SCIM is not only a protocol for managing digital identities; it is an essential tool that can enhance an organization’s security posture through a Zero Trust framework, streamlined workflows, and yield cost savings. By automating and standardizing identity management, SCIM alleviates the risks associated with account takeover, reduces the potential security threats posed by dormant and over privileged accounts, and introduces significant efficiency into identity lifecycle management processes.</p>
<p>Entrust IDaaS provides out of box SCIM capabilities to organizations of all sizes.</p>

				  Exploring the Potential of Minimum Viable Ecosystems (MVEs) 
<p>During the webinar, we delved into the concept of MVEs and their pivotal role in unlocking the true potential of collaborative ecosystems. We explored the importance of defining roles, establishing governance frameworks, as well as the scalability aspect of ecosystems.</p>
 Practical Tools and Methodologies for Ecosystem Success 
<p>Darrell guided us through the intricate world of ecosystems. He discussed practical tools and methodologies Continuum Loop uses to design, deploy, and foster the growth of vibrant ecosystems. These resources enable ecosystem builders to design, deploy, and foster the growth of vibrant ecosystems.</p>
 Key Takeaways from the Webinar 
 
 Minimum Viable Ecosystems:
 
 We explored the concept of MVEs and their importance in laying the foundation for thriving ecosystems. 
 MVEs provide a starting point for ecosystem builders, enabling them to define roles, foster collaboration, and establish governance frameworks. 
 
 
 Ecosystem Governance Frameworks (EGFs):
 
 EGFs are crucial in maintaining order and facilitating effective collaboration within ecosystems. 
 Establishing clear rules, permissions, and boundaries allows ecosystem participants to navigate the ecosystem with clarity and purpose. 
 
 
 
 Supporting StudentReader’s Ecosystem Development 
<p>During the Q&amp;A session, we discussed our collaboration with StudentReader.io and their journey in creating an EGF for their MVE. By utilizing Trust Continuum™ Tools, we assisted in refining their framework to ensure role clarity and a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem participants.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In a recent survey that spanned six countries, Entrust found that while progress is being made in the way that governments and citizens interact, there is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>The vast majority of respondents (84%) interact with governments between one and five times each year, pursuing typical outcomes – a driver’s license, paying taxes, and traveling. It’s no surprise that almost four out of ten respondents (39%) prefer the convenience of web portals over more traditional interaction methods such as mail (5%) and in-person (15%). And while preferences favor digital interactions, governments still must deliver the services and the credentials that citizens require − offering both digital and physical to ensure equal access to services and meet the preferences of its citizens and service providers alike.</p>
<p>Citizen interaction preferences</p>
<p></p>
<p>To meet the evolving needs of its citizens, governments are working with the private sector to deliver the outcomes citizens require. We’re heading toward a simple, smooth, and secure user experience from entry into the system, through the issuance of credentials and completing the required transactions – all relying on a single chain of trust that ensures the privacy and security of personal information and government systems.</p>
 Only half rated their digital interactions as positive 
<p>Overall, respondents rated their last government interaction at 7.1 on a 10-point scale. But when it comes to their last digital interaction, barely half (54%) rated those interactions as positive. While a 7.1 overall rating isn’t terrible by any means, there’s room for improvement. And it’s telling that only half of citizens, who are moving to faster and more convenient methods of interaction, were left with a positive impression. There’s clearly work to be done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Citizens’ pain points with government interactions</p>
<p></p>
 Governments are paying attention…and taking action 
<p>In the countries we surveyed, citizens improving customer service is important to respondents. And many governments know it’s time to step up and simplify end-user experiences, as well as drive operational efficiencies and greater security. In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/entrust-wins-uk-home-office-tender-to-expand-digitization-of-immigration-processes">a new solution</a> enables a streamlined, more seamless way for travelers coming to the UK to be identified via biometrics, bringing more secure border control and speeding up identity and border checks. In the United States, “Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience” is the number two priority on the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/">President’s management agenda</a>. The administration has gone so far as to designate 14 agencies as “High Impact Service Providers” and put the following strategies in place:</p>
 
 Improve the service design, digital products, and customer-experience management of Federal <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/HISP-listing-2021.pdf">High Impact Service Providers</a> by reducing customer burden, addressing inequities, and streamlining processes. 
 Design, build, and manage government service delivery for key life experiences that cut across Federal agencies. 
 Identify and prioritize the development of Federal shared products, services, and standards that enable simple, seamless, and secure customer experiences across the Federal Government1. 
 
 Digital interactions are important and preferred, but phone, mail, and in-person remain important 
<p>Undoubtedly, phone calls, mail, and in-person interactions will remain among peoples preferences, and governments have the responsibility to make these services equally available to all. Citizens must have digital, physical, and hybrid credentials to fulfill the outcomes they’re after and the Entrust survey responses bear that out. People are asking for quick, convenient services at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Below is how respondents ranked what is important to them:</p>



1
Service when and where it’s needed
55%


2
Secure, easy, and convenient identity verification
53%


3
Customer data privacy and security is a priority
49%


4
Self-service capabilities
44%


5
Ability to track progress
44%


6
Online forms
43%


7
Consistent user experience across government organizations
36%


8
Engage on behalf of others
8%



<p>People are asking for the customer experience they’ve come to expect from their favorite retailers and banks. </p>
 Getting to simple, smooth, and secure. There’s good news and bad news. 
<p>The bad news is that from a technical perspective, simple, smooth, and secure experiences crash head-on into:</p>
 
 Legacy apps 
 Multiple independent solution providers 
 A growing and dynamic threat landscape 
 
<p>The good news is that the challenges presented on the journey to becoming simple, smooth, and secure are being overcome and improvements are within reach.</p>
 
 Composable systems break older models of rigid software development practices and introduce modularity − allowing organizations to quickly design, build, manage, and change systems as the needs of organizations evolve. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) address connectivity to legacy systems and stem the proliferation of vendors, and costs, simplifying and shortening the citizen experience. Systems become easier to deploy, maintain, and scale. 
 A single chain of trust reduces the attack surface and keeps citizen information safe. 
 Enabling the right credential for the right transaction means
 
 No citizen is left behind 
 People get what they need for the outcome they seek leading to happier citizens and increased trust in government 
 Strong identities and authentication methods can lower the risk of fraud 
 
 
 
<p>The next blog in our government-citizen series interactions will explore the similarities and differences among countries and age groups. Are we all really all that different?</p>
 Methodology 
<p>To assess the perceptions, experiences, and preferences of citizens about their interactions with government, Entrust engaged an independent research firm in May 2023. 3,501 online survey responses were received from people between the ages of 18 and 75 residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany UK, and USA. Only responses that met age and geographic qualifications were included, and respondents had to have interacted with the government in the previous 12 months.</p>

 Exploring the challenges, opportunities, and necessity for cross-functional collaboration. 



 



<p>Attempting to draw similarities between two different industries may not seem the most productive use of one’s time, but there are valuable insights to be gained, if you look hard enough. Let us take the financial services and gambling industries, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the obvious risks in the financial market and the speculative nature of trading, the banking and gambling industry have more in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370364/">common than one might expect</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both face similar risks, <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/86115">including</a> operational risk, regulatory compliance, money laundering, liquidity, solvency risk, IT and cyber risks, and reputational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both invariably have an Enterprise Risk Management function, which, as the name suggests, carries out risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As financial services and the gambling industry are both prime targets for fraud and money laundering, there is value in organizations from both sectors implementing a dedicated KYC program to help them comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">Terrorist Financing</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ0KHXidf_AhWCgVwKHacTBaQQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgdpr-info.eu%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1akHzzz224Oq1yU0pd6qSw&amp;opi=89978449">GDPR regulations</a>.</p>



 Blocking new illegal, intertwined paths. 



<p>In April 2023, a first of a kind trial took place in Basildon Crown Court in the UK. <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2023/april/man-jailed-after-betting-fraud/">Jon Howard was found guilty of defrauding Bet365</a>, after the Essex Serious Crime Directorate confirmed he had used more 1,000 identities to abuse bonuses, which, had he been successful, would have netted him £236,000. (Read more about some of the ways that criminals abuse sign-up bonuses in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Exploring bonus abuse in gambling’</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard tried to legitimatize these funds via a mortgage application where he added details of a fake job. He was recently sentenced to a five-year jail sentence. In both gambling and financial services, fraudsters continue to find more creative ways in exposing weaknesses in controls. And, as the latest tricks tend to appear in one sector before the other, there is significant incentive for collaboration between the two industries.</p>



 Desperately seeking a global gambling regulatory framework. 



<p>The gambling industry has encountered fast-paced growth in recent years. Indeed, the proliferation of high-speed internet and mobile devices have made it even easier for individuals to access online gambling platforms from the comfort of their own homes or on the go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This convenience factor has attracted a larger number of people to engage in online gambling activities. COVID-19 and multiple quarantine periods further cemented the expansion of online gambling. Despite the rapid growth, many national authorities and regulatory bodies have been slow off the mark in updating regulations or providing the industry with some much-needed clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the UK’s much delayed revision of the Gambling Act 2005 in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">‘Preparing for the UK gambling white paper’</a> here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry is categorized as a Designated Non-Financial Business and Profession (DNFBP), providing gambling services for entertainment purposes. The gambling industry also engages in similar activities to financial institutions, such as accepting and withdrawing funds. As such, players in both the gambling industry and financial services industry are required to hold a license to operate in most European Union (EU) countries. Traditionally, if you wanted to operate in multiple EU countries, then you would need multiple licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, however, there have been substantial efforts to ease the headache of operating throughout Europe. In fact, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/eu-market/licensing/">multi-licensing has been adopted in 25 out of 29 European countries</a>,&nbsp; introducing full multi-licensing for all regulated online gambling products, according to the European Gaming &amp; Betting Association. In 2018, the EGBA <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2018/12/Manifesto-A-EU-Framework-for-Online-Gambling-2.0.pdf">published a manifesto</a> to appeal for a globalized regulatory framework for online gambling operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recommending a deepened standardization in the business, the Association is pushing for a more comprehensive regulatory framework to avoid “unnecessary compliance and supervision costs” and limit the risks of non-compliance. This would also have a direct impact on the risk exposure to fraud and money laundering. In fact, during its <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en#documents">periodic supra-national risk assessments</a> in 2022, the European Commission said it <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/eu-ups-money-laundering-risk-in-online-gambling-to-highest-level/">considered online gambling</a> “to be especially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing, with this risk categorized as&nbsp; the highest possible risk level.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, gambling operators would be wise to take a few lessons from the financial services industry to better understand its regulations, and the processes they use to protect themselves against fraud, money laundering, and other types of financial crime. As KYC programs are slowly becoming the norm within multiple industries – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> – gambling operators should follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step one should be for all gambling operators to familiarize themselves with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/#:~:text=Terrorism%20financing%20encompasses%20numerous%20actions,instruments%20to%20support%20terrorist%20operations.">Terrorist Financing</a> regulations. Step two is to implement stronger KYC mechanisms. With a robust KYC program in place, gambling operators can anticipate potential regulatory developments and be ready with top notch compliance programs.</p>

 The opportunities that lie ahead. 



<p>Banks encounter significant challenges when collaborating with gambling operators due to the elevated levels of risk and potential for fraud. One of the key challenges is to navigate complex regulatory requirements and AML laws that apply to gambling activities. The cash-intensive nature of the gambling industry further exacerbates the risk, as large financial transactions only increase the potential for illicit funds to be circulated. Understandably, therefore, banks are far more reticent to work with gambling operators, as they represent a higher risk. But there is still value in collaboration, or as mentioned, at least being aware of what is happening in the other&nbsp; industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between credit card fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, price scraping or account takeover, gambling platforms are often at the forefront of fraud trends, and how best to counter them. Additionally, the gambling industry’s ability to deal with multiple means of payments (<a href="https://www.egba.eu/home-page/at-the-forefront-of-online-payments-innovation/">33 different types in 2018 alone for EGBA members</a>) just goes to show how expansive their experience is in tackling online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, it is no secret that gambling operators are leaders in cultivating customer engagement. Many utilize the latest technology and data analytics to provide seamless, personalized customer journeys, enhance the user experience and retain players. Both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintechs</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">traditional banks</a> should learn from gambling operators and take similar steps to improve the customer experience by meeting and even exceeding customer expectations.</p>



 United we stand. 



<p>While the regulatory framework may bear a heavier weight on financial services than gambling operators, the latter can certainly learn from the best controls and monitoring practices of the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To protect against fraud and money laundering, collaboration is a must. As most fraudsters tend to work across multiple industries and targets at any one time, banking and gambling operators can benefit greatly from exchanging information and best practices. For example, by providing feedback on fraud detection systems, secure payment processing or even staff training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professional associations, such as <a href="https://www.egba.eu/">EGBA</a> or <a href="https://www.acfe.com/">Association of Certified Examiner</a>, are two legitimate places to collaborate and exchange. More informal channels like forums or event panels are other valuable channels to gain intelligence on the latest fraud techniques and money laundering trends, and the best ways of identifying criminal and suspicious activities.</p>



 One platform for multiple industries. 



<p>IDnow provides the most powerful, configurable, and secure platform for identity proofing. IDnow’s highly configurable platform for identity proofing works across multiple regulations, use cases, and industries, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eco-conscious movement is unmistakably a global environmental concern that continues to gain momentum as we see the impacts to our daily lives. Consumers and <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">world leaders</a> recognize that carbon footprints must be reduced, requiring and challenging their business partners (vendors, customers, etc.) to make measurable changes now. Many organizations are taking calculated eco-actions in various product segments: everything from electronics, housewares, clothing, and batteries to heavy duty motors and industrial equipment. Careful lifecycle considerations are evaluated at every product stage, from design and concept to end-of-life.</p>
<p>Credit cards are no different. Consumers demand eco-friendly materials, card recycling programs, and even more importantly, the assurance that their bank or credit union is actively engaged in these programs. Increasingly, many products now demonstrate their own unique eco-journey to include these lifecycle eco-considerations along the way – packaging, production efficiency, waste, green-certified buildings, etc. The mere ability to recycle something isn’t enough and even though the term “eco” is many times in absentia of standards or regulations, it’s becoming one of the highest priorities in consumer goods.</p>
<p>What exactly is the scope of eco-cards and why is it important? Traditional credit card materials are typically some variant of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), widely known as the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-climate-the-hidden-costs-of-a-plastic-planet/">biggest contributor to global plastics proliferation</a>. Although the credit card form factor is small, global annual card production is estimated to be 3.3 billion cards in 2023, drawing scrutiny around the total lifecycle, use case, and further debate around physical vs. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/04/trends-in-passport-personalization/">digital card</a> issuance. Purists believe the ultimate form of an environmentally conscious card is a digital one. Realistically, the continuation of hybrid credential issuance (the issuance of both digital and physical credentials to cardholders) will remain steady in the near future as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">consumers demand both alternatives for different use cases</a>.</p>
<p>More and more companies are driving sustainability efforts into their initiatives, with an increasing trend in qualifying eco-materials. The breadth of these green programs is far and wide, varying from a fractional percentage in material reduction to biodegradable, recycled PVC, PLA, PETG, reclaimed ocean plastic, and everything in between. <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/2022/11/30/sustainable-banking-payment-cards/">ABI forecasts an 18% decrease</a> in the use of PVC in global card production by 2026, but the full impact of material changes can only be realized if cards are fully recycled at the end of their life vs. ending up in a landfill. Educated consumers recognize companies who promote their <a href="https://www.entrust.com/legal-compliance/environmental-social-and-governance">sustainability programs</a>, looking to bridge environmental awareness with overall product viability. In the absence of eco standards and regulation, companies are looking to partner with material suppliers, equipment providers, and logistic services who have demonstrable programs in place that can help meet overall sustainability goals. To this end, it’s imperative that vendors, customers, and everyone engaged in product-centric decision-making is aware of eco-friendly initiatives and sustainability programs as well as broader ESG program goals and the related benefits and value proposition.</p>
<p>In a capitalistic world, consumers, world leaders, and companies alike are at the same crossroads, demanding more from eco and sustainability efforts to make the environment we live in safer and cleaner. For their part, organizations are looking for trusted advisors to lead them through materials research, equipment capabilities, or aligning with industry trends ahead of standardization. This critical juncture is where Entrust has invested resources to bridge the gap between technical feasibility and demand for sustainable practice. We’ve dedicated resources − from our R&amp;D, business teams, material suppliers, and equipment suppliers to logistics services − to co-create meaningful solutions to meet these critical goals now and into the future. We are leveraging an eco research and innovation platform that was designed to build the knowledge base for holistic solutions vs. driving product-led materials or features.&nbsp;In simpler terms, eco R&amp;D is the foundation required to build diverse enterprise relationships supporting the broader initiative. The mere existence of an eco-project doesn’t automatically generate “trusted advisors,” but the collective effort will create a roadmap where partners feel comfortable collaborating on technical concepts to support consumer demand.</p>

<p>From inflation and conflict, to rising interest rates and the growth of neo banks, to synthetic identities and deepfakes – banks and credit union leaders are navigating tumultuous times. Yet, through it all, these same leaders recognize the immediate need to meet the demand for an enhanced customer experience to drive loyalty and increase revenue. And it all starts with a streamlined secure onboarding process – one that provides digital-first customer experiences with an accelerated time to value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the quicker a financial institution can move a prospective customer from account opening to card issuance to making their first purchase, the more satisfied the consumer becomes and the faster the financial institution realizes value. And, if that can all happen in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee – all the better! Of course, it’s equally as important to be Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliant, as well as secure through each and every transaction. Fraud is a large and growing problem that can cost banks as much as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4MM per breach (IBM</a>), not to mention the potential reputational damage and lost consumer trust that has the power to seriously damage future growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is a roadmap to navigate this journey.</p>
<p>Enable digital customer onboarding.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many customers that banks and credit unions alike only have a 90-second to 5-minute window of time that consumers are willing to spend verifying their identity and opening an account. Any longer than that and you risk application abandonment – that isn’t a lot of time to provide a great consumer experience that will lead to top-of-wallet status. That’s why it’s critical for banks to adopt technologies that allow them to offer remote customer onboarding enhanced with biometric identity verification; identity and device reputation authentication (also known as Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC); and digital contract signing.</p>
<p>Provide digital and physical payment card options.</p>
<p>Once a new customer account has been approved, it’s time to provide a method to make payments. Traditionally, a customer would need to wait for a physical card to be mailed to their home address after opening their bank account. While this process is still an important part of any bank’s card issuance program, it can be beneficial to offer other methods of card issuance that will help the bank realize time to value more quickly, and to exceed customer expectations.</p>
<p>For those customers that open an account remotely via their mobile device, doesn’t it make sense to instantly issue them a digital card to their newly installed banking app so they can start using it right away? Enhancing existing card programs with digital offerings with functionality like digital card issuance, NFC payment, tokenization, wallet push provisioning, and card controls allows banks to streamline processes, reduce cost of ownership, and provide a boost in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Many banks and credit unions also offer the option to instantly print a card in-branch. This method is a nice addition to any payment card issuance program because it gives branch employees the autonomy to surprise and delight customers by printing them a new replacement card, or a new card for those who choose to open an account in person.</p>
<p>The key to a successful card issuance program is to ensure that your bank can rise to the customer’s immediate challenge and provide the flexibility to open an account and receive their card via the method that works best for them, and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Secure the end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Securing the end-to-end customer experience (from account opening to transacting), is vitally important to mitigate costs and reputational damage resulting from banking fraud or a breach. As mentioned in the consumer onboarding and account opening phase, it’s important to make sure to adhere to the latest eKYC and AML compliance requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting transactions once an account has been opened, banks and credit unions should look for solutions that provide risk-based authentication to proactively identify fraudulent patterns through fraud detection algorithms, device identity scans, and adaptive risk analysis. Applying those solutions across all e-commerce transactions, high-value transactions, and irregular locations will help identify and mitigate potential fraud.</p>

<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a unique alphanumeric code for legal entities, funds and trusts participating in commercial, trade, or general financial transactions. It enables identification across a wide range of financial applications and has the potential to play a significant role in the modern financial system by enabling counterparty bona fides verification. This verification is essential for the know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) processes required in traditional and modernized financial services activities. </p>
<p>Amit Sharma is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://finclusive.com/who-we-are/about-us">FinClusive</a>, a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased compliant and equitable financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails, and financial services providers. FinClusive’s CaaS is a globally orchestrated anti-money laundering/financial crimes compliance toolkit with modernized KYC/KYB- backed digital identity credentialing and LEI issuance and validation.</p>
<p>How are Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) transforming businesses—and emerging markets in particular? What requirements does the LEI meet?</p>
<p>As both traditional and non-traditional financial markets incorporate cross-border transactions, there is a significant need for a uniform identifier across jurisdictions that is precise, digitally verifiable, and interoperable across global regulated financial services providers. The hurdles for verifying identities across the world has resulted in financial fraud, crises, and other abuses, which has become even more complex in the virtual assets space, internet-native financial services applications (web3), and decentralized financial services (DeFi). The LEI has both the necessary infrastructure and simplicity for ubiquitous application across bank and non-bank transactions for businesses around the world.</p>
<p>What are the challenges with know-your-business (KYB) and legal entity verification more broadly? How do we enable businesses to interact seamlessly, transparently, and compliantly in a cross-border world with next generation banking and payments needs?</p>
<p>The biggest challenges for KYB across the industry arise from inconsistent regulatory requirements for identification and compliance across jurisdictions, coupled with the disparate nature in which corporate identities are issued, validated, stored, and accessed. In these cases, entities involved in cross-border transactions often lack the ability to verify that their counterparty is legitimate, non-fraudulent, and not posing a significant business risk. Adding processes like Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) goes a long way in addressing these concerns by systemizing the issuance and validation of legal entities, and further, enabling them to verify each other while ensuring adherence to global financial crimes compliance practices and requirements. Broader compliance solutions that are purpose-built for know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) application, including FinClusive’s full-stack compliance-as-a-service (CaaS) platform, are another way that businesses can take security and compliance into their own hands, while enabling near real-time verification and coverage of essential business/entity verification—including the validation of an entity’s beneficial owners.</p>
<p>How are these changes going to happen? Who is driving the changes? </p>
<p>While the best outcomes are reached collaboratively between the public and private sectors, it is important that industry-focused solutions are carefully considered by lawmakers when debating how to regulate the rapidly evolving financial services industry, including and especially those engaged in cross-border payments and virtual assets. As such, industry associations like Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and companies like FinClusive can work hand-in-hand with government actors to guide policy in order to achieve the safest and most effective results for customers. This collaboration enables efficient due diligence, verification of identity, and applications across multiple jurisdictions, financial services operations, and increasingly between counterparties directly (peer-to-peer/business-to-business).</p>
<p>What timescales are we working towards with adoption and resulting benefits for the areas we’ve discussed? What are some examples of low hanging fruit (use cases)?</p>
<p>Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) have a wide range of use cases, some of which can be actualized more quickly than others. FinClusive already uses LEIs in know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) use cases, allowing organizations to gather key information about a client or counterparty before entering a transaction and conduct the requisite verification of legal entities wherever located. LEIs can also reduce error and friction for banks, creditors, invoicing, and a wide range of other business relationships. For example, organizations often have minor variations in names used across different official platforms, leading to significant confusion when trying to track the financial history of an entity or ensure adherence to global sanctions requirements and individual jurisdiction-based know-your-business and monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>A uniform LEI makes KYC/KYB exercises significantly smoother for all parties. The removal of these hurdles also allows for faster engagement between counterparties and financial transactions around the world. G7 and G20 countries have increasingly looked to LEIs as a strong way to bring global consistency and efficiency to legal entity verification and validation. Coupled with FinClusive’s global KYC/KYB, due diligence, monitoring, and digitally verifiable identity credentials, entities can ensure requisite background checks that mitigate identity fraud, and enable engagement between trading/financial counterparties—and their financial intermediaries—seamlessly and securely, while bringing needed efficiencies to their financial transactions.</p>
<p>How do we drive further adoption and enablement at scale?</p>
<p>Adoption at the international level must come from a coordinated government and private sector approach. FinClusive is one of several organizations globally offering Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services, but there are only a few based in the United States. Additionally, regulatory mandates are yet to be made requirements—although financial services regulators around the globe are increasingly indicating their importance and use. Building broader infrastructure for LEI adoption around the world and coordinating with federal policy is crucial for widespread use. Enabling multiple financial services providers with LEIs alongside the essential monitoring and other controls to combat fraud and illicit finance, will advance know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) modernization, especially as alternative accounts and payments products and services continue to proliferate in the market.</p>
<p>What potential does the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) have for global financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Reliable, easily accessible identification has the potential to transform businesses in developing markets. LEIs give trading partners and their financial institutions a new way to interact with unprecedented efficiency and is expected to have immeasurable benefits for global trade and business-to-business (B2B) money flows in the developing world. Small businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, development organizations, global corporations, and even alternative financial services providers themselves can seek out and receive a fully credentialed LEI through FinClusive or another provider, enabling them to engage meaningfully in the global economy with legitimacy and transparency.</p>
<p>With more than 99% of global growth stemming from small and medium enterprises (including micro enterprises and commercial entities of all types—corporate, LLC, non-profit/public benefit, and others), LEIs can enable seamless engagement and verification alongside financial system controls that can benefit those enterprises struggling to access or maintain their financial services.</p>
<p>Why is FinClusive working with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)? How does the LEI fit into your services?</p>
<p>Thanks to our partnership with Ubisecure, FinClusive is one of the only United States-based GLEIF Validation Agents. This allows us to streamline validation of legal entity data and really speed up the registration of LEIs. We are also the only nonbank/non-financial institution to do this. We have integrated the LEI and our proprietary Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Check utility into one platform for our clients, allowing our customers to confirm their partners’ identity, beneficial owners, know-your-business risk, and financial crimes compliance status in one tool. LEI on its own can lack due diligence and jurisdiction validation, both of which FinClusive can cover by integrating LEIs with our <a href="https://finclusive.com/products/fincid">FinCID</a> solution. Integrating anti-money launder controls, know-your-business capabilities, and compliance into our full-stack platform allows us to maximize our global orchestration of providers and analytics partners, as well as the reliability and efficiency of cross-border payments and business relationships, thereby advancing financial inclusion of businesses around the world.</p>

<p>LinkedIn has joined the ranks of social media platforms offering ID verification badges designed to assure users that the person associated with a profile is in fact who they claim to be. Given <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/">organized fraud on LinkedIn</a>, it’s about time. But, while I applaud the move, it’s important to note what identity verification is and what it means to users like you and me.</p>
 ID Verification: The Good, the Bad &amp; the WTF 
<p>While social media users and brands have long been able to apply for checkmark-style verifications, these badges have traditionally been bestowed by the platforms themselves. But last November, Twitter changed the game by announcing it was replacing its existing verification system with Twitter Blue. The idea: Enable anyone with a profile (and $8 a month) to add Twitter’s coveted checkmark to their profile.</p>
<p>Quite predictably, chaos ensued as pranksters and cybercriminals purchased blue checkmarks and impersonated brands and their executives with abandon. The Eli Lilly and Lockheed Martin impersonations occurred on Twitter during this time. So did an exodus of top advertisers, contributing to an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/twitter-s-revenue-drops-amid-advertisers-concerns-over-elon-musk?leadSource=uverify%20wall">89% drop in ad revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter has since paused, re-launched, and continued to modify its approach to verification. But it’s hardly alone. Impersonation occurs on every platform, including TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even new Twitter rivals like Mastodon. The Bird Network is also no longer an outlier in offering ID verification to all users. Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have rolled out paid verification, and now LinkedIn has announced no-fee verification.</p>
<p>As a B2B marketing leader, it’s LinkedIn that matters most. The platform is expected to capture <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/linkedin-will-capture-nearly-25-of-us-b2b-ad-spending-by-2024">25% of all B2B ad spend</a> by 2024, to the tune of $4.5 billion, for a simple reason: It’s an indispensable channel for brand, direct, and account-based marketing. LinkedIn ID verification can serve an essential role in preventing impersonation. But it should be done in a privacy preserving way. Here’s what I mean.</p>
 LinkedIn: More Reassurance—But Not Without Risk 
<p>LinkedIn’s approach includes options for verifying personal identity and place of employment. In the US, users can confirm their identity by uploading their government-issued ID and phone number and then displaying this verification on their profile. Worldwide, users can verify where they work with their company email address.</p>
<p>But while this is a step in the right direction, there are two significant blind spots in this approach. The first is the requirement to provide a government-issued ID. While this can undoubtedly cut down on fake profiles, it forces users to place the scanned drivers license in the care and control of a 3rd party. As if we haven’t seen enough identity data spread all over the Web and compromised in countless ways.</p>
<p>Consumers (AKA LinkedIn users) should be able to control their own data at all times and have the ability to share it with consent and on demand. The dangers are all too real as thousands of data breaches over the years prove in stark detail.</p>
<p>The second issue is as large or larger. Identity verification somewhere at or after account origination doesn’t prove identity at login. It does nothing to prevent <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/98367-social-media-account-takeovers-increased-over-1000-in-2021">social media account takeover</a> (ATO), which is up more than 1,000%, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). Roughly 40% of all victims of social media ATO reported either having their personal information misused, while half lost funds or sales revenue. More than 70% were permanently locked out of their account while the intruder continued to post new content.</p>
<p>Just imagine the potential damage to victims and the platform itself if (and when) a verified LinkedIn account gets pirated. The good news: It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
 Verification Made Simpler &amp; Safer 
<p>Today, verifying identity at login is not only attainable, but readily achievable. At 1Kosmos we’ve implemented passwordless login with verified identity in a number of different ways. What does this mean?</p>
<p>For the LinkedIn and other social media use cases, user enrollment feels much the same way as it does today, but with identity verification, anti-spoofing and privacy baked in. For starters, when the user scans the front and back of their driver’s license, it is verified against AAMVA records to ensure validity, and more broadly can be verified in 205 countries worldwide. Scanned information is sharded, encrypted and stored in a blockchain under the sole control and management of the user. Importantly, the user never gives up control of their PII.</p>
<p>A facial scan is performed and compared to the likeness on their ID. This is configurable, can include liveness detection and is backed by iBeta PAD-2 certification, verifying identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy.</p>
<p>When it comes to use cases that require higher levels of assurance, many organizations look for NIST 800-63-3 certified Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) identity proofing and authentication (AAL2). This typically requires a passport scan, which is then verified with the Country Signer Certificate Authority (CSCA) .</p>
<p>Here, privacy by design means that personally identifiable information is stored and managed solely by the user who can grant access on demand. Their personal information is never stored in a central server accessible by a 3rd party and can be transferred only with explicit user consent.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, our solution can use LiveID technology, device-level biometrics, one-time passcodes and various other authentication mechanisms all bound to the verified identity to ensure the user at login is who they claim to be. Because the 1Kosmos solution is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a> certified, the user’s biometric can’t be spoofed using a stolen photo, video, or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>For LinkedIn and other social media platforms, it would ensure that all verified user profiles and interactions are legitimate, with more than 99% accuracy. This is a significant improvement over knowing that at one point in time the account was in effect claimed by a verified, legitimate user. It truly identifies the user behind the device ad first and every login.</p>

   The key to secure, seamless experiences

   The key to secure, seamless experiences 

<p>Would you be surprised to learn that 91% of all new car sales in the U.S. are "connected vehicles." Not me. I've been watching the automotive world evolve, creating an ecosystem bristling with distinct entities and relationships that shape the modern driving experience.</p>

<p>The complexity of this ecosystem can be overwhelming. There's the vehicle itself, with its multitude of sensors and software components, plus subscription-based services and smart city infrastructure. And, of course, there are the people involved –&nbsp;car owners, drivers, manufacturers, sales and service personnel, and more. By placing identity at the core of this ecosystem, we can unlock a world of possibilities and ensure secure connections between all entities, with seamless and personalized experiences for all stakeholders involved.</p>

<p>It's not just about any one of these parties or services; it's about the entire web of identities connecting within and around the vehicle – including the head unit in the car that connects to a manufacturer's control systems in the cloud, the sensors and cameras that connect with each other and to the cloud, and even person-to-person and person-to-device connections. With unified identity, we can protect, manage, and govern these entities, while personalizing experiences and supporting sustainable business models. Now that's what I call smart mobility.</p>

 Smart mobility requires identity 

<p>When identity is infused into every part of an automotive manufacturer's connected strategy, it becomes a powerful driver for success.</p>

<p>Consider digital buying journeys. Car manufacturers are shifting towards digital sales models, where customers lead the conversation and have full control over the process – from initial research, to customizing and ordering a vehicle online, to finalizing the purchase at the dealer or directly with the manufacturer. In many ways, this experience is heading towards becoming much like any other retail e-commerce experience.</p>

<p>Once a customer sets up an identity online at the beginning of the buying journey, that identity stays with them through the sales cycle. It lets them receive digital and physical car keys and sign up for in-car services. The vehicle-to-be can be represented with a digital identity, too, ultimately synchronizing its characteristics with its "physical twin" once manufacture is complete.</p>

<p>With a unified approach to identity, the owner can even apply meaningful access controls to other drivers, ensuring safety and personalization – think seat settings for different drivers or automotive performance guardrails for new teen drivers in the family.</p>

 The current reality: identity as an afterthought 

<p>&nbsp;In the absence of a unified identity framework, the integration of physical and digital security measures becomes disjointed and prone to vulnerabilities. The risk of leaking customers' personally identifiable information (PII) increases when each service and application handles identity management independently.</p>

<p>Without an identity-centric approach, it's easier for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. You can see this for yourself when you connect a smart mobile device to a rental car – often, you'll lose control of your entire contact list and driving history. Without proper identity management, the potential for unauthorized or unintentional data sharing becomes a real concern, jeopardizing privacy and leaving individuals vulnerable to unwanted solicitations or misuse of their personal data.</p>

 The vision: identity at the center 

<p>By placing digital identities and relationships between them at the core of the connected car ecosystem, we can solve these challenges from the inside out. Gradually building the security posture over time as digital identities are added, we can ensure a smooth and secure experience for car owners. From tracking the manufacturing process using digital identities to providing real-time updates through a digital key in the owner's phone wallet, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Unified identity requires a powerful, scalable, and flexible solution. It involves storing identity profile information, ensuring synchronization with non-identity data feeds, and delivering a seamless human experience during registration and onboarding. At run time, checking identities and access rights becomes effortless, and reliable communication with various applications and APIs is established.</p>

<p>ForgeRock, a leading provider of identity solutions, drives these powerful, scalable, and flexible solutions. With components that separate policy enforcement from decision-making, ForgeRock empowers enterprises to adopt a Zero Trust architecture for all identities – both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">human</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT "things."</a> By leveraging strong authentication standards like FIDO2 WebAuthn and federation protocols like OAuth and OpenID Connect, identity-related issues, such as impersonation and unauthorized access, can be mitigated effectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the integration of AI-driven technologies, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a>, identity provisioning and authentication become self-driving and adaptive. This automation enables continuous authentication checks, ensuring a secure environment for all connected vehicles.</p>

<p>Putting identity at the center of the connected vehicle ecosystem is the key to unlocking seamless, personalized experiences. By embracing a unified identity, we can overcome challenges, enhance security and privacy, and foster a thriving connected car environment. With ForgeRock's powerful solutions, the future of connected vehicles looks brighter than ever before. So fasten your seat belts and get ready for a journey where identity drives innovation, convenience, and peace of mind on the road.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective — June&nbsp;2023 <p>As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, its allure has expanded to a broader demographic, offering financial services to those unserved or underserved by the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>Indeed, one of the main reasons for DeFi’s existence is to bank the unbanked and provide a platform for moving assets in a decentralized and permissionless way. However, DeFi is not without its own unique set of challenges.</p><p>One of the most glaring problems in the DeFi landscape is the unknown paths the assets travel — the commingling of funds. This issue threatens to significantly hamper the growth and acceptance of DeFi if not addressed promptly and effectively.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson once said, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance and personal responsibility.” It is crucial to recognize that there are many misuses of decentralized finance&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>Malicious actors are abusing DeFi protocols for money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, and scams, among other things. Addressing these issues at the current moment has become paramount for the vitality and growth of the DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Commingling of Funds in DeFi — Ride in the Wild&nbsp;West <p>Commingling of funds in DeFi refers to the pooling of assets from different participants into a single wallet or smart contract. While this helps facilitate transactions and optimizes liquidity, it also blurs the lines of ownership and raises critical questions about the security and accountability of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Such funds, often with a suspicious or unknown origin, create a profound barrier to the sound operation and regulation of the DeFi platforms.</p><p>Envision a scenario where an illicitly obtained large sum of money is deposited into a DeFi liquidity pool. Once mixed with other funds and redistributed through returns, these funds become nearly untraceable, providing a difficult puzzle for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulators.</p><p>The gravity of this issue extends further as it risks ‘polluting’ the liquidity pool with unverified funds, potentially affecting all participants in the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>In an environment that already battles with the problems like lack of oversight, this further compounds the regulatory challenges, potentially putting the entire DeFi space at risk of stringent regulatory measures. As the DeFi space matures, it is crucial to address these pressing concerns.</p> DeFi Investors: Seduced and Often&nbsp;Betrayed <p>Despite all the challenges, many who have tipped their toes in the crypto water perceive DeFi as an attractive and potentially lucrative investment opportunity. But the less adrenalin-tolerant, yet major investment players, are carefully observing the space and waiting for their safe moment to&nbsp;come.</p><p>What’s this irresistible DeFi power of seduction? The yield farming strategies inherent in DeFi platforms, whereby users provide liquidity to earn rewards, are particularly compelling. The DeFi protocols usually offer significantly higher yields than traditional financial instruments, presenting an enticing proposition for investors.</p><p>On top of that, DeFi also introduces a new level of accessibility, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate in high-yield opportunities, regardless of geographical or economic constraints.</p><p>As the allure of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to seduce the highly risk-tolerant investors, a surge of new participants is entering the scene. Enticed by high yields and unparalleled accessibility, they contribute to a significant inflow of capital, defining it as an expansion beyond borders of infinite financial opportunities.</p><p>Amid this growing interest, the importance of Compliant DeFi is coming into sharper focus. However, the adventure in the wild DeFi land might be quite tragic for some, so now the issue at hand is how to be better safe than&nbsp;sorry.</p> Compliant DeFi — Is it Safe to&nbsp;Play? <p>Simply put, compliant DeFi is the innovative fusion of decentralized finance with traditional regulatory standards. It marries the borderless, open-access ethos of DeFi with the security and transparency of conventional compliance measures like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>, and CFT. The goal is to cultivate a more trustworthy and secure DeFi landscape that attracts institutional investors and compliance-friendly users.</p><p>One of the significant areas where Compliant DeFi shines is in dealing with regulatory complexities that wild DeFi land is&nbsp;facing.</p><p>Compliant DeFi is the answer to the misuse of financial freedom in DeFi. It eliminates the wild chaos and introduces a level of order, enhancing the sector’s security while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p> Why Compliant DeFi Matters at&nbsp;All <p>Compliant DeFi has the potential to shine bright in the land of finance and attract institutional investors, including those less or none traveled in crypto&nbsp;land.</p><p>By providing an environment that adheres to preventing the notorious comingling of funds and applying regulatory standards such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), complaint DeFi effectively bridges the divide between the decentralized finance world and the traditional financial ecosystem, creating a symbiotic relationship that mitigates risks substantially.</p><p>As the DeFi space swells with new funds, trust and security become increasingly significant concerns. Traditional DeFi platforms, while operationally efficient, often end up nesting commingled funds, and at any moment, unknown toxic issues might crawl out of this Pandora’s box.</p><p>Though at first glance, Compliant DeFi might be less seductive, it confronts these challenges head-on and secures a safe investment environment. This is the new brave new DeFi world where user interests are guarded, safer, more transparent, and accountable. It is a world where major investors (the non-adrenalin driven) feel comfortable interacting and looking at the long-term prospectives.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the one, and most probably the only, alternative for DeFi, the moment that opens the road to sustainable growth and expansion without the shadows of malpractices or security concerns.</p> Keeping the Books in Check: Accountability in the DeFi Ecosystem <p>The skyrocketing influx of investors in the DeFi space, especially the more traditional institutional ones, calls for a level of accountability. Yet, again, Compliant DeFi stands tall, providing an environment that marries the innovative opportunities of DeFi with the professionalism of conventional financial services.</p><p>By aligning with regulatory standards and ensuring enhanced transparency, Compliant DeFi has the potential to attract an even broader investor base. And logically, such increased and secured participation can foster a robust, sustainable growth trajectory for the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>In this dynamic era of digital finance, for DeFi, balancing high-return prospects with security, trust, and regulations is a tightrope to walk. Compliant DeFi appears as a reliable solution in this balancing act, solidifying its role as an integral part of a maturing DeFi landscape.</p> Final Note <p>Marking a transformative shift, Compliant DeFi indeed emerges as a significant catalyst, spearheading the drive towards expansive growth and wider acceptance within the DeFi landscape. This innovative approach is not just a tool but a comprehensive solution, proficiently harnessing the extraordinary potential of DeFi, while simultaneously addressing its inherent challenges.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of the future, it becomes increasingly apparent that compliant DeFi, with its robust approach to security and regulation, is poised to decisively influence the evolution of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> The Flash &amp; his Love for&nbsp;DeFi <p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.

<p>As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHjl3xMB3o">I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool</a>.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.</p>  
<p>First off, passkeys are so vastly more secure than passwords that you should run — don’t walk — to implement them everywhere that you can. Seriously. Stop reading this blog and go implement some passkeys. One of the notable moments of Identiverse was when Ryan Rowcliffe and Cisa Kurian highlighted that CVS has implemented passkeys on cvs.com faster than Google has deployed passkeys. (Go check out cvs.com and register for a passkey. It’s pretty cool.)</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T98/reports/2023-dbir-executive-summary.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> highlights that more than 50% of breaches come from attackers using credentials and a large number come from phishing attacks. The beauty of passkeys is that they’re not susceptible to phishing and can’t be compromised in the ways that passwords can.</p> 
 The Different Flavors of Passkeys  
<p>However, it’s also worth looking at the question of the security level of different types of passkeys. As a quick refresher, synchronized passkeys (the type that you’re hearing the most about) can be synchronized or passed between devices by features in your operating system (iCloud Keychain, etc) or by your password manager (Dashlane, 1Password, LastPass, etc). Device-bound passkeys are tied to a single device.</p> 
<p>As most security practitioners know, meeting the requirements of multi-factor authentication requires having at least two independent factors of “something you know,” “something you have,” or “something you are.” Synchronized passkeys only meet the requirement of “something you know” or “something you are” depending on whether you verify identity with a PIN or biometric, respectively. Because of how they can be shared and transmitted, they don’t meet the possession requirement. This means that some organizations are looking at how they add multi-factor authentication on top of passkeys. (This feels a little bit like buying the latest Tesla and sticking a 1970’s spoiler on it.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations also need to be comfortable with who will be managing their passkeys. For implementations of synchronized passkeys, organizations need to accept that they won’t know who is managing the passkeys that they’re provided. The passkey could be managed by the iCloud Keychain, Android, Dashlane, 1Password or another solution yet to be identified. Users will be in charge of who manages the passkeys on their devices.</p> 
<p>(Let me reiterate the earlier point: passkeys are so much more secure than passwords that you should absolutely go implement them right now.)</p> 
 Passkeys Built for the Enterprise  
<p>There are several scenarios where enterprises may want an authentication solution that meets the requirements of MFA and doesn’t have the same challenges highlighted above. This is where HYPR’s Enterprise Passkeys come into play. At their core, these are device-bound passkeys and are the same FIDO credential that HYPR has been based on since we were founded nine years ago. Enterprise Passkeys meet the requirements of MFA, are fully under the enterprise’s control, and can be used for other applications that require proof of possession such as digital signing and funds transfer.</p>
