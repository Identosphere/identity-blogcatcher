<p><a href="https://www.nist.gov/">The NIST</a> has published a new draft report that highlights some of the potential advantages of using biometric identification technology in emergency response situations. It then goes on to detail some of the obstacles that could hinder adoption rates.</p>



  



<p>The “<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8334-draft.pdf">Using Mobile Device Biometrics for Authenticating First Responders</a>” report specifically applies to public safety organizations (PSOs), a category that includes firefighters, paramedics, and law enforcement. Those professionals often need to access and handle sensitive information while in the field, and biometric technology enables faster authentication than more traditional methods like passwords. That makes biometrics increasingly appealing as more and more <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-jenetric-unveils-new-smartphone-fingerprint-capture-device-031008/">smartphones</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-launches-biometric-handheld-face-fingerprint-capabilities-042302/">tablets</a> offer built-in support for the technology.</p>



<p>The problem is that emergency responders are often wearing several layers of Personal Protective Equipment that make it impossible to use certain modalities. For example, a paramedic cannot complete a fingerprint scan while wearing a latex glove, and a firefighter cannot use facial recognition while wearing a full mask.</p>



<p>With that in mind, the NIST argues that PSOs need to ensure that there is always a backup authentication option, whether it is a password or some other knowledge factor. Those PSOs should also make a point of choosing biometric authenticators that make sense given their equipment and their professional responsibilities.</p>



<p>The NIST went on to note that emergency responders often used shared devices, which creates additional security concerns. Thankfully, there are ways to overcome that challenge. A single device can often store biometric information for multiple user profiles, and in the future, PSOs may be able to load devices with temporary profiles that are deleted whenever the device gets passed to a new user.</p>



<p>In the meantime, technology advancements could make biometrics more feasible in a wider range of settings. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/duxbury-fire-department-outfits-firefighters-biometric-oura-rings-073107/">Wearable technologies</a> are particularly noteworthy in that regard, though <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-posts-highest-mask-recognition-score-dhs-technology-rally-031005/">facial recognition</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/kettering-health-network-turns-nuance-improve-emergency-room-outcomes-102705/">voice recognition</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-typingdna-advocates-keystroke-dynamics-ahead-psd2-deadline-030509/">keystroke dynamics</a> all have potential utility.</p>

<p><a href="https://biointellisense.com/">BioIntelliSense</a> has found another customer for its wearable healthcare solutions. This time around, the company is partnering with <a href="https://www.airstrip.com/">AirStrip</a>, which will be integrating the BioSticker and the BioButton into its own AirStrip ONE platform to track the health of patients at home.</p>



  



<p><a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biointellisense-unveils-disposable-biobutton-track-patient-symptoms-050604/">The BioButton</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-biosticker-fda-clearance-012902/">the BioSticker</a> both debuted in early 2020, and are able to collect a wealth of patient information. That information can then be consolidated and analyzed through <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-biointellisense-collects-patient-data-new-biohub-030305/">the BioCloud</a>, giving doctors more insight into the status of remote patients.</p>



<p>AirStrip, meanwhile, is best known as a developer of interoperable medical data solutions. The AirStrip ONE platform gathers and analyzes contextual information from multiple sources in near real-time, and doctors can use that information to make better decisions for their patients.</p>



<p>In that regard, the BioIntelliSense data will help serve as a personal baseline. Any deviations from that baseline will be more pronounced, so doctors can respond more quickly and proactively whenever any adverse changes occur. AirStrip noted that the need for good remote patient monitoring solutions increased during the pandemic, since COVID-19 made it riskier for patients and medical staff to interact in-person.</p>



<p>“The pandemic exposed the hospital’s clinical staffing and data deficiencies accelerating the need for new advanced virtual acute care delivery models capable of supporting clinical staff that provide care at a distance,” said&nbsp;AirStrip CEO Alan Portela. “Lessons learned in inpatient care will now need to be applied for virtual care as tele-health incentives at home.”</p>



<p>“Virtual care is driving investment and adoption of continuous health monitoring technologies that are on par with patient data collected in the hospital, to enable medical grade care at home,” added BioIntelliSense CEO&nbsp;James Mault. “AirStrip plays an integral role of bringing together BioIntelliSense continuous vital sign and physiologic data, along with other contextual insight, to optimize clinical workflow and deliver personalized clinical intelligence.”</p>



<p>BioIntelliSense has previously provided remote patient monitoring technology for several other virtual care providers. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/veemed-leverages-biometric-wearables-remote-patient-monitoring-75202104/">VeeMed</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aloe-care-health-embraces-biometric-wearables-remote-care-75202103/">Aloe Care Health</a> are some of the other customers that the company has picked up in the past few months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a> is spearheading a campaign to ban the use of facial recognition technology in restaurants and retail outlets. The appropriately-named <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2021-07-14-civil-rights-groups-call-on-stores-to-reject/">Ban Facial Recognition in Stores</a> campaign has already been backed by more than 35 privacy and civil liberties organizations.</p>



  



<p>The problem, according to Fight for the Future, is that facial recognition can have an extremely adverse effect on both customers and employees, especially if the system is integrated with law enforcement databases. The technology would essentially allow private businesses to conduct background checks of their customers in real time, and deny entry to anyone with an arrest record – or even someone who simply attended a protest at some point in the past.</p>



<p>That raises obvious concerns about racial profiling given the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-nist-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-algorithms-122401/">known biases of facial recognition systems</a>. It would also give law enforcement agencies a way to circumvent existing privacy law. In that regard, Fight for the Future <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.vice.com/en/article/88ng8x/pentagon-americans-surveillance-without-warrant-internet-browsing">cited a letter from Senator Ron Wyden</a> that suggests that the Pentagon is buying access to private surveillance data to get around public facial recognition bans. Under such a system, stores can sell customer data to organizations like ICE, or to the police more generally, as is already happening with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-detroit-law-requires-public-hearing-all-surveillance-contracts-053101/">Project Green Light in Detroit</a>.</p>



<p>Project Green Light gives the Detroit Police Department (DPD) direct access to video footage from more than 700 businesses in the city. The system has facial recognition capabilities, and the DPD has indicated that it plans to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/detroit-makes-controversial-decision-extend-police-facial-recognition-contract-100105/">continue using the technology</a> despite a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/false-arrest-highlights-issues-racial-bias-facial-recognition-062507/">complaint that stems from a false arrest</a> that was the result of a false facial recognition match.</p>



<p>Facial recognition could also affect customer service in ways that go beyond law enforcement. For example, stores could use it to direct customer service resources away from people who have received welfare, thereby creating a tiered system that creates a worse shopping experience for many individuals. The technology could similarly be used to track employees throughout the entire workday, and micromanage activities like bathroom breaks.</p>



<p>Fight for the Future is trying to put pressure on private businesses to swear off any form of facial recognition. The organization identified Albertsons, Lowes, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/macys-hit-bipa-lawsuit-using-clearview-biometric-surveillance-080701/">Macy’s</a> as some of the companies that are currently using the technology. Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Costco, and Dollar Tree are among those that have pledged not to use it, while the positions of Best Buy, 7-11, Walgreens, and McDonald’s remain unclear.</p>



<p>In the United States, most facial recognition bans <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/minneapolis-city-council-considers-public-facial-recognition-ban-012601/">only apply to government organizations</a>. However, the city of Portland, Oregon has passed a bill that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/portland-facial-recognition-ban-extends-across-government-and-private-sector/">bans the use of the technology in commercial establishments</a>.</p>

<p>Another post-password authentication startup has attracted millions in funding from venture capital: Stytch has announced that it has raised $30 million in a Series A funding round led by Thrive Capital. Other funds participating in the round included Coatue Management and existing investors Benchmark and Index Ventures.</p>



<p>The company was founded in June of 2020 by two former employees of Plaid, the financial services IT infrastructure giant. Reed McGinley-Stempel, the company’s CEO and co-founder, was formerly a Product Manager at Plaid, while co-founder and CTO Julianna Lamb served as a Plaid engineer.</p>



<p>Together, the co-founders have been working to build a platform allowing developers to implement simplified, passwordless authentication into their apps, via APIs and SDKs. At the moment, the Stytch team is focused on authentication mechanisms based on things like SMS and Whatsapp passcodes and “magic links”, but the company says that it will use the funding to develop further authentication options based on WebAuthn, OAuth, QR codes, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/solutions/facial/">mobile biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>Commenting in a statement, Thrive Capital Partner Gaurav Ahuja asserted that recent years have demonstrated “the most authentication systems are both outdated and pose a security risk to users,” adding that Stytch’s solutions can tangibly address this issue.</p>



<p>“We talked to many developers using the product and saw firsthand how impressed they were with the best-in-class API docs and speed to go live,” he said. “The product is specifically designed for improving signup conversion and user retention, providing front end tools to get started quickly.”</p>



<p>In addition to ramping up its R&amp;D efforts, Stytch said it will also use the funding to expand its team, with a hiring goal of 20 new team members by the year’s end. Thrive’s Ahuja, meanwhile, will join the company’s board of directors, alongside Benchmark’s Chetan Puttagunta.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idexbiometrics.com/">IDEX Biometrics</a> and Infineon have announced a new, jointly-developed reference design for next-generation payment cards.</p>



<p>The companies have been collaborating in the emerging biometric cards space for some time, having <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-infineon-biometric-card-tech-511271/">first announced a partnership</a> back in the autumn of 2018, aimed at exploring how their respective technologies could be combined to support the development of fingerprint-scanning payment cards.</p>



<p>Their new reference design is based on the combination of Infineon’s SLC38BML800 security controller and IDEX Biometrics’ TrustedBio sensor. Thanks to the speed of the SLC38BML800, the combined solution allows for biometric authorization of transactions in less than 500 milliseconds, the companies say. It also offers other advantages pertaining to energy efficiency and the manufacturing process.</p>



<p>“This new design provides significant improvements at the card system level, which allow easy integration into existing hot lamination card manufacturing processes,” explained Tolgahan Yildiz, the head of Infineon’s Payment and Ticketing Solutions division. “Therefore, the architecture increases card performance, while reducing manufacturing complexity at the same time.”</p>



<p>Yildiz went on to add that the “additional interfaces and the energy efficiency of our security controller allow industrialization of high performance biometric smart cards.”</p>



<p>IDEX is indicating that while TrustedBio samples are already available, mass production of the solution is expected to begin “by the end of the third quarter of 2021,” according to a statement.</p>



<p>Likewise, Infineon’s SLC38BML800 security controller is currently available for preorder, but mass production will not begin until “the end of 2021.”</p>

 Droits et travers en matière de propriété&nbsp;: micro-traités avec la&nbsp;Terre  Repenser nos responsabilités envers la nature grâce à l’intendance des&nbsp;terres <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/property-rights-property-wrongs-micro-treaties-with-the-earth-9b1ca44b4df">[AN ENGLISH VERSION OF THIS TEXT IS AVAILABLE HERE</a></p> Le droit vivant sur une planète vivante — préface de John&nbsp;Borrows <blockquote>Nous devons redonner de la vigueur à nos relations avec la&nbsp;terre.</blockquote><blockquote>Sur la ferme où j’ai grandi, j’ai appris que nous dépendions du monde naturel. Le sol, les semences, l’enneigement, la pluie, la chaleur, les insectes, les oiseaux et une centaine d’autres éléments influaient sur la façon dont les plantes poussaient et les animaux se développaient, ainsi que sur notre mode de&nbsp;vie.</blockquote><blockquote>Les expériences et les enseignements de mes grands-parents sur la réserve n’ont fait que renforcer cette notion. Comme dans d’autres systèmes autochtones, le savoir anishinaabe était alors transmis d’une génération à l’autre pour nous aider à bien vivre. Mes grands-parents nous ont appris que les poissons, les cerfs, les grenouilles, les loutres, les tortues, les lapins, les herbes médicinales, la nourriture et la santé humaine sont inextricablement liés dans une toile complexe, essentielle au maintien de la&nbsp;vie.</blockquote><blockquote>Mon expérience sur la ferme et la réserve m’ont amené à comprendre que nos efforts personnels sont indispensables pour encourager et prendre soin de ces relations. Nous avons un rôle actif à jouer pour favoriser des environnements sains.</blockquote><blockquote>Les renseignements dans la publication ci-dessous nous aident à prendre conscience des travaux qui nous attendent.</blockquote><blockquote>Les codes profonds nécessaires au maintien de la vie demeurent bien présents dans la terre et nous pouvons les intégrer dans nos vies contemporaines. Nos relations juridiques peuvent accommoder les changements qui doivent être apportés pour retrouver une vie riche et diverse sur le plan écologique.</blockquote><blockquote>Mais nous devons agir maintenant. La Terre souffre de notre abus et de notre négligence. La souffrance que nous vivons en tant qu’êtres humains vient de notre échec à vivre selon les leçons apprises par nos ancêtres dans de nombreuses régions du monde. En effet, il est impossible pour nous d’agir comme si nous ne faisions pas partie du monde&nbsp;naturel.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3316">John Borrows<br> </a>Chaire de recherche du Canada sur le droit autochtone <br> <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/law/index.php">Faculté de droit de l’Université de&nbsp;Victoria</a></blockquote> S’autodétruire pour&nbsp;vivre <p>Les nombreuses crises qui marquent notre époque, surtout celles liées au climat et au logement, renvoient à un problème plus profond, celui d’avoir rompu notre lien avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>De nos jours, nous vivons tous selon des paradigmes d’autodestruction, que nous soyons Autochtones ou non. Les peuples autochtones ont été systématiquement marginalisés et ont vécu de grandes souffrances en raison du colonialisme et de la Loi sur les Indiens. Nos façons d’habiter génèrent aujourd’hui des écocides et alimente un système socio-économique de plus en plus gourmand et inégal — et ce tant pour les personnes autochtones que les personnes non autochtones.</p><p>Bien des gens s’entendent pour dire que la COVID-19 ne représente que la pointe de l’iceberg. Alors que la perte d’habitats et de biodiversité se répand partout sur la planète, l’apparition du coronavirus pourrait marquer le début de pandémies de masse répétées. L’émergence de tels virus étant peut-être l’exemple le plus puissant de cette autodestruction (qui atteint maintenant nos&nbsp;corps).</p><p>Il est donc impératif de repenser nos lois et systèmes de gouvernance afin de transformer les liens systémiques et spirituels que nous entretenons avec la terre et la nature. Et nous avons besoin les uns des autres pour y&nbsp;arriver.</p><p>La présente publication repose sur plusieurs ateliers et conversations que nous avons eus avec des leaders autochtones à travers le Canada au cours des deux dernières années. Elle se penche sur la façon de repenser les droits (et responsabilités) de propriété et la protection de l’environnement à la croisée des avenirs civique et autochtone.</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;Du point de vue autochtone, la réconciliation entre les Canadiennes et les Canadiens autochtones et non autochtones exige aussi une réconciliation avec le monde naturel. Si les êtres humains règlent les problèmes qu’il y a entre eux, mais qu’ils continuent à détruire le monde naturel, alors la réconciliation demeurera inachevée.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― Honorer la vérité, réconcilier pour l’avenir&nbsp;: sommaire du rapport final de la Commission de vérité et réconciliation du Canada,&nbsp;2015</blockquote> Les lois sont chargées d’histoire&nbsp;: la relation entre le monde vécu et la&nbsp;loi <p>Les outils que nous avons inventés afin de rendre possible la ‘possession’ de la planète à travers la propriété privée racontent une histoire sur notre vision du monde. Au fil des époques et dans différentes cultures, des traditions juridiques diverses ont été instaurées afin de solidifier cette vision, mais elle raconte toujours cette version originale d’une histoire du monde, de la place de l’être humain et de la nature, et de notre relation avec l‘environnement qui nous&nbsp;entoure.</p><p>Les traditions juridiques ainsi que les lois ou constitutions qu’elles inspirent ne sont pas une source de vérité originelle. Elles ne sont pas divines. Comme le mentionne John Borrows dans son ouvrage <a href="https://utorontopress.com/ca/law-s-indigenous-ethics-1">Law’s Indigenous Ethics</a>, nous ne devrions pas ignorer les demandes «&nbsp;initiales&nbsp;» des lois. Mieux comprendre «&nbsp;l’origine&nbsp;» de nos cadres législatifs permet alors de saisir les visions du monde qu’ils supportent.</p><p>Il est donc important de reconnaître et rendre explicite les histoires, les mondes vécus et les ordres constitutionnels divers qui sous-tendent les perspectives occidentales et autochtones.</p><p>La loi raconte l’histoire d’un monde&nbsp;vécu.</p><p>Lorsqu’il est question de réconciliation, le dialogue entre la résurgence autochtone et la décentralisation des perspectives occidentales doit reconnaître l’existence de mondes vécus radicalement différents. Ce dialogue demeurera ainsi ouvert et&nbsp;continu.</p><p>À la manière du <a href="https://www.onondaganation.org/culture/wampum/two-row-wampum-belt-guswenta/">Traité de la ceinture wampum à deux rangs</a> des Haudenosaunee, nous devons viser une compréhension mutuelle, sans intervenir ou forcer une réconciliation. Nous devons laisser place à l’émergence d’avenirs civiques et autochtones distincts et&nbsp;communs.</p> Analyse de la situation actuelle&nbsp;: qu’y a-t-il derrière les lois occidentales lorsqu’il est question de&nbsp;terres? <p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux comme la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» ou le droit civil puisent leurs racines dans le libéralisme. Ce sont les penseurs des Lumières, notamment Thomas Hobbes, John Locke et Jean-Jacques Rousseau, qui en ont établi les fondements philosophiques. L’origine de la pensée libérale prône que la «&nbsp;loi&nbsp;» doit défendre la liberté, le consentement et l’égalité.</p><p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux reposent sur un assemblage de concepts fondamentaux qui dictent une relation précise avec le monde qui nous entoure&nbsp;:</p>  Si vous ne détenez pas de droits, vous êtes&nbsp;détenu.  La propriété s’exprime par des ententes (écrites) entre des êtres humains souverains et autonomes.  La Terre est «&nbsp;la toile de fond devant laquelle les êtres humains vivent au fil de l’histoire.&nbsp;» (Mills,&nbsp;2016)   Une terre passive&nbsp;: la vision occidentale par défaut de la&nbsp;nature <p>Les différents outils législatifs qui s’intéressent au monde naturel tentent surtout d’encadrer des pratiques humaines, alternant entre protection et exploitation. Pensons aux multiples lois et règlements associés aux industries extractives, agricoles ou touristiques.</p><p>En encadrant des pratiques d’extraction telles que le minage, la fracturation hydraulique et la pollution, l’ensemble de lois environnementales actuel n’est pas réellement conçu pour protéger la nature. Il vise plutôt à réglementer l’utilisation et l’abus de la nature par les êtres&nbsp;humains.</p><p>Dans le meilleur des cas, nos lois défendent une nature à «&nbsp;isoler&nbsp;». Tandis que dans le pire des cas, elles stipulent les règles d’exploitation d’une nature à «&nbsp;utiliser&nbsp;»</p><p>L’ensemble de nos lois définissent donc la nature comme passive, silencieuse et&nbsp;fragile.</p> Une terre abstraite&nbsp;: la vision occidentale par défaut de la propriété <p>Tant la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» que le droit civil encadrent la propriété comme un ensemble de droits. Des terres sont détenues et des titres de propriété sont transférés d’une personne à l’autre. Il s’agit d’une entente entre personnes.</p><p>La terre est perçue comme étant abstraite et dénudée de sens physique. Elle est absente de l’entente légale et donc de la relation.</p> La terre&nbsp;: une histoire de colonisation <p>La propriété privée, comme mécanisme légal et contractuel, a été et demeure un instrument important de colonisation. Le pouvoir colonial de la propriété privée agit comme un moyen de dépossession et comme un mécanisme menant à la disparition des systèmes politiques et juridiques autochtones.</p><p>L’architecture profonde de nos systèmes vient cristalliser les dynamiques de pouvoir. Faire disparaître la colonisation du cœur même de nos systèmes signifie entre autres de redonner une voix à la terre dans nos instruments juridiques et contractuels.</p><p>Reconnaître le fait que la terre et la nature ne sont pas que des toiles de fond, mais bien des acteurs présents qui “parlent”, vient déstabiliser la primauté de l’être humain, un concept au centre de la pensée libérale occidentale. En d’autres mots, cela remet en question les prémisses de base du monde créé par la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» et le droit&nbsp;civil.</p><p>Les systèmes constitutionnels libéraux parviendraient-ils même à survivre à une relation où la nature est considérée comme&nbsp;active?</p><p>À ce moment de notre Histoire, celui de la crise climatique, nous n’avons pas d’autre choix que de découvrir la réponse à cette interrogation.</p><blockquote>Autant d’arpents de terre qu’un homme peut labourer, semer, cultiver, et dont il peut consommer les fruits pour son entretien, autant lui appartient-il en propre. Par son travail, il rend ce bien-là son bien particulier, et le distingue de ce qui est commun à tous. […] Au commencement, tout le monde était comme une Amérique, et même beaucoup plus dans l’état que je viens de supposer que n’est aujourd’hui cette partie de la terre nouvellement découverte. Car alors on ne savait nulle part ce que c’était qu’argent monnayé.</blockquote><blockquote>― John Locke, Deux traités sur le gouvernement, 1689</blockquote><blockquote>«&nbsp;Le but premier du Gouvernement devrait être de donner à tous les Indiens leur propriété individuelle, et ce, dès que possible.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― Lettre du lieutenant-gouverneur et intendant des affaires indiennes, 11 novembre&nbsp;1878</blockquote> Décentraliser la vision occidentale par défaut/Faire le ménage de notre&nbsp;maison <p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux incluent déjà des voies pouvant mener à une relation dynamique avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>En suivant celles-ci, les mondes juridiques occidental et autochtone pourraient amorcer un dialogue productif.</p><p>Pluralisme juridique</p><p>Les ordres juridiques libéraux du monde occidental peuvent donner lieu à un pluralisme juridique. L’interaction du droit civil (au Québec) et de la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» (dans le reste du Canada) est un bon exemple. Toutefois, il faut faire preuve de grande prudence au moment de réfléchir à la façon dont la loi des colonisateurs peut interagir avec les ordres juridiques autochtones, surtout en ce qui concerne la relation à la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>Incommensurabilité juridique</p><p>Les ordres juridiques libéraux du monde occidental peuvent donner lieu à un pluralisme juridique authentique avec des systèmes qui partagent un cadre constitutionnel de base. Toutefois, il est aussi possible que cela crée une incommensurabilité juridique (c’est-à-dire une incompatibilité) entre les lois des colonisateurs et les divers ordres juridiques autochtones, puisqu’ils émanent de familles constitutionnelles et, au bout du compte, de visions du monde radicalement différentes.</p><p>En tentant de décentraliser les points de vue juridiques occidentaux et d’explorer les nouvelles relations avec la terre qui pourraient en découler, nous devons mettre de côté nos attentes relativement à ce à quoi pourrait ressembler le dialogue entre les ordres juridiques autochtones et un cadre juridique occidental «&nbsp;décentralisé&nbsp;».</p><p>Dit autrement, la croisée des avenirs civique et autochtone pourrait ne pas renvoyer à une enquête autonome, mais plutôt à une énigme sans&nbsp;fin.</p> Une autre relation avec la&nbsp;nature <p>L’émergence des Droits de la nature propose une transformation de nos relations avec la nature dans l’ordre légal&nbsp;actuel.</p><p>Cette approche souhaite conférer une identité individuelle juridique à la nature. En donnant à cette dernière un statut juridique actif et autonome, elle constitue un modèle de loi écocentrique qui augmente considérablement la présence de la terre dans notre monde juridique. À cet égard, les Droits de la nature constituent une avancée bien réelle dans la tentative de décentraliser les visions juridiques par défaut du monde occidental.</p><p>Cependant, la nature demeure prise dans un discours de droits qui émane du concept que nous pouvons choisir de conclure une entente légale avec elle. À ce titre, la vision par défaut de l’Occident reste bien&nbsp;vivante.</p><p>L’approche des Droits de la nature souligne également le côté artificiel du concept de cadastres conçu par les êtres humains, puisque les frontières des écosystèmes sont insaisissables&nbsp;: où commence et finit la rivière à qui on a accordé une identité individuelle juridique?</p><p>Comme ces droits doivent néanmoins être gérés par des êtres humains qui agissent comme défenseurs, il est possible de se demander si cela aura une incidence sur le taux de décès des personnes qui se portent déjà à la défense de l’environnement et qui meurent en tentant de protéger leurs terres tellement leurs intérêts vont à l’encontre des forces économiques en place. En effet, 160 personnes ont été tuées en 2018, une réalité qui n’est qu’une des conséquences visibles des gestes abusifs posés partout dans le monde à l’endroit de ceux et celles qui défendent leurs terres pour le bien de leur communauté et des générations futures&nbsp;: criminalisation, harcèlement, etc.</p>Quelques exemples de Droits de la&nbsp;nature<p>Des Droits de la nature n’ont été accordés pour l’instant qu’à de vastes ensembles. Mais que se passerait-il si nous adoptions une approche micromassive pour instaurer des Droits de la&nbsp;nature?</p> Une autre relation avec la propriété <p>Les fiducies foncières communautaires représentent une solution de rechange à la propriété. L’entité juridique prend la forme d’un organisme sans but lucratif qui administre la terre en vertu d’une fiducie perpétuelle afin qu’elle puisse être utilisée en permanence par une communauté.</p><p>Quelques observations&nbsp;:</p>  La terre est réellement présente au sein d’une fiducie foncière communautaire. Il s’agit d’une entente de personne à personne à lieu. Nous y trouvons donc les traces d’un mécanisme contractuel à acteurs et actrices multiples.  Au-delà des droits, il y a une responsabilité envers la préservation et le caractère abordable de la terre à perpétuité.  La terre est présente dans l’entente et les êtres humains ont une responsabilité d’intendance envers celle-ci.  La terre demeure perçue comme quelque chose qui peut être détenu grâce à des ententes&nbsp;écrites.  <p>En tenant compte de ces observations&nbsp;…</p><p>Que se passerait-il si nous donnions une présence active encore plus grande à la terre? Nos mécanismes contractuels de propriété seraient-ils toujours pertinents?</p><p>Que se passerait-il si nous ajoutions des responsabilités envers, notamment, les autres espèces présentes sur ces&nbsp;terres?</p> Qu’est-ce que la propriété de toute façon?&nbsp;: au-delà de l’illusion des droits&nbsp;absolus <p>Les droits de propriété ne sont pas&nbsp;absolus.</p><p>Au Canada, les droits de propriété sont sous compétence provinciale. Ils ont délibérément été exclus de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés (Partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982), ce qui veut dire qu’ils ne bénéficient d’aucune protection constitutionnelle.</p><p>Plus important encore, malgré des histoires largement répandues sur le plan culturel, les droits de propriété ne sont pas absolus. Ils existent conjointement avec d’autres lois et mécanismes, et sont limités par leurs interactions avec ces derniers.</p><p>En d’autres mots, la propriété n’est pas qu’un ensemble de droits, elle est déjà aussi, en théorie, un ensemble de responsabilités&nbsp;: sur les plans municipal, provincial, fédéral, constitutionnel, international et autochtone.</p> Que signifient les titres ancestraux autochtones pour la propriété privée? <p>Qu’est-ce qu’un titre ancestral autochtone?</p>  Une doctrine (constitutionnelle) de la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;».  Le paragraphe 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 reconnaît et confirme les droits ancestraux, sans toutefois définir ou créer de droits autochtones.  Sui generis&nbsp;: c’est un droit inhérent qui découle des systèmes légaux, sociaux et politiques passés ou présents qui maintient une relation avec les terres ancestrales (avant la colonisation).  Il est «&nbsp;reconnu&nbsp;» et non «&nbsp;accordé&nbsp;» (c’est-à-dire qu’il n’est ni défini par le système juridique colonial ni un produit de celui-ci).  Un ensemble de jurisprudence (voir Calder, Delgamuukw-Gisdayway, Campbell, Haida, Mikesew Cree ou Tsilhqot’in) a été produit pour interpréter la nature et l’étendue de ces&nbsp;droits.  C’est l’antithèse de la Loi sur les&nbsp;Indiens.  <p>Ce que la jurisprudence récente peut nous apprendre sur la propriété privée</p><p>La Nation Tsilhqot’in c. la Colombie-Britannique (2014) a obtenu une déclaration attestant que «&nbsp;le titre ancestral confère des droits de propriété semblables à ceux associés à la propriété en fief simple, y compris le droit de déterminer l’utilisation des terres, le droit de jouissance et d’occupation des terres, le droit de posséder les terres, le droit aux avantages économiques que procurent les terres et le droit d’utiliser et de gérer les terres de manière proactive&nbsp;». (Nation Tsilhqot’in, jugement de la Cour Suprême, paragraphe 73.)</p><p>L’ensemble croissant de jurisprudence sur la reconnaissance et la définition des titres ancestraux en vertu du paragraphe 35 (un droit protégé par la Constitution) permet d’avancer vers un point déterminant où les titres ancestraux autochtones et les droits de propriété privée pourraient se croiser, et où les premiers pourraient venir limiter les&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>La question qui suit pourrait alors se poser&nbsp;…</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;Les titres ancestraux autochtones viendront-ils évincer des intérêts bénéficiaires privés relatifs à la terre, ou les terres privées viendront-elles empêcher que des titres ancestraux autochtones soient attribués à ces terres?&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>- John Borrows,&nbsp;2015</blockquote><p>Comme tels, les titres ancestraux autochtones sont une «&nbsp;coquille vide&nbsp;». Dans le paragraphe 35, les ordres juridiques autochtones donnent du contenu et une signification aux titres ancestraux.</p><p>Il existe plus d’une centaine d’ordres juridiques autochtones différentes au Canada qui ont ou qui auront quelque chose à dire sur la «&nbsp;propriété privée&nbsp;», ainsi que sur la relation qu’entretiennent les êtres humains avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>Une plus grande reconnaissance des titres ancestraux au Canada combinée à la résurgence des ordres juridiques autochtones pourraient bien venir transformer ces «&nbsp;coquilles vides&nbsp;» en trous de vers légaux (autrement dit: des raccourcis entre deux univers légaux parallèles).</p>  Parce que la jurisprudence autochtone canadienne nous y mènera un jour ou&nbsp;l’autre…  Parce que le système juridique occidental dominant donne lieu à des paradigmes d’autodestruction…  Et, plus important encore, parce que nous avons une responsabilité en matière de réparation et de réconciliation…  <p>Nous devons renouer notre relation (juridique) avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><a href="https://medium.com/cities-for-people/civic-indigenous-7-0-ec3a9104901b">7 points of convergence: A compass for making&nbsp;kin</a> Des preuves bien enracinées de possibilités <p>L’initiative Civic-Indigenous 7.0 a été pour nous un exercise de base où enraciner une conception renouvelée des initiatives écologiques et socio-économiques, ainsi que les mécanismes financiers et de régulation s’y rapportant, à l’intersection des visions occidentales et autochtones. <br> <br> Dans la suite de ce blogue, nous explorons comment les <a href="https://medium.com/cities-for-people/civic-indigenous-7-0-ec3a9104901b">Seven points of convergence</a>: A compass for making kin peuvent servir d’ancrages pour la mise sur pied de <a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins</a>, une initiative axée sur la réconciliation avec la nature dans les terrains privés en vue de créer une nouvelle forme de micro-traité.</p><p>Alors que nous nous efforçons d’unir des visions passées, présentes et futures du monde grâce à ces preuves de possibilités, nous savons qu’il pourrait y avoir des tensions et même de la dissonance entre des approches plus technocratiques ou relationnelles.</p><p>Si vous avez des idées sur comment aborder ces tensions ou sur la façon dont les sept points de convergence pourraient servir à élaborer une autre initiative, n’hésitez pas à nous en faire&nbsp;part.</p> Nouveaux voisins&nbsp;: la réconciliation avec la nature commence dans notre&nbsp;cour <p>L’organisme Nouveaux voisins travaille actuellement avec un écosystème croissant de partenaires à la régénération de terrains gazonnés pour accroître la biodiversité, atténuer certaines conséquences des changements climatiques et aider à repenser notre relation problématique avec la nature d’un point de vue municipal (villes&lt;&gt; banlieues &lt;&gt; milieux&nbsp;ruraux).</p><p>Jusqu’à maintenant, Nouveaux voisins et quelques partenaires se sont concentrés sur trois choses&nbsp;: 1. la création de discours (étendre la notion de quartier à d’autres êtres vivants et questionner la stigmatisation des terrains à la pelouse parfaite comme l’option de paysagement par défaut); 2. l’élaboration d’autres approches paysagères par l’entremise de projets pilotes; 3. la création d’outils pour appuyer cette transformation socio-écologique (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">plateforme web et trousse d’outils</a>, bacs à sable réglementaires, mécanismes financiers et fiscaux pour tenir compte des services écologiques créés collectivement, etc.).</p><p>La quête de la pelouse parfaite est profondément enracinée dans notre culture occidentale. Il s’agit de la plus grande culture irriguée en Amérique du Nord et ses conséquences néfastes pour l’environnement sont nombreuses. La transformation socio-écologique proposée par Nouveaux voisins et d’autres acteurs similaires pourrait donc avoir un impact de grande envergure.</p><p>Elle nous permettrait aussi de nous éloigner d’une vision où la nature est gérée par les êtres humains pour en venir à reconnaître les avantages de celle-ci et de ses écosystèmes pour les êtres humains et, finalement, comprendre l’auto-souveraineté de la nature au sein de laquelle ont lieu des échanges métaboliques entre les espèces (y compris les êtres humains).</p> Consultation avec la nature&nbsp;: vers 1 million de cours liées les unes aux&nbsp;autres <p>À ce jour, des Droits de la nature ont surtout été attribués à un site en particulier (lac, rivière, etc. + avec une communauté précise) ou par un État (Bolivie+ Équateur + Ouganda), parfois avec peu d’impact sur le terrain. Il est aussi possible de faire un constat similaire quant aux efforts de conservation écologique.</p>Certains scénarios préliminaires et hypothétiques pour chaque étape de mise en&nbsp;œuvre.<p>En commençant par des actions non officielles, cumulatives et de plus petite envergure, des initiatives comme Nouveaux voisins pourraient créer un mouvement collectif ascendant de restauration écologique/Droits de la&nbsp;nature.</p><p>L’impact serait très restreint si seulement quelques propriétaires participaient. Mais cela pourrait devenir un excellent moyen de coopération avec la nature si des millions de gens à travers le Canada décidaient de prendre part à cette transformation, et s’il existait des outils et des infrastructures pour soutenir celle-ci.</p><p>Des instruments pourraient par exemple être conçus pour améliorer la prise de décisions collective sur le genre d’espèces à sauver en premier en fonction du taux d’extinction, ou le genre de services écologiques à soutenir dans un domaine donné, tout ça grâce aux choix que nous faisons et encourageons collectivement dans nos&nbsp;cours.</p><p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">Nous avons explorer les options possibles en ce sens dans ce&nbsp;blogue.</a></p> Redéfinir ensemble la beauté pour valoriser l’utilité <p>De nos jours, la plupart des gens n’ont pas les moyens d’embaucher un ou une spécialiste pour transformer leur cour (p. ex. dans un des projets pilotes de Nouveaux voisins, la régénération d’un terrain de 40 mètres carrés à Outremont [un quartier montréalais] coûtait environ 4000 $). D’un autre côté, se contenter de laisser la pelouse pousser et se régénérer sans intervention humaine peut aussi apporter son lot de défis, comme des risques d’allergie ou un certain nombre d’années pour atteindre un aspect sauvage intéressant et acceptable selon les normes culturelles d’aujourd’hui.</p><p>Pour nous débarrasser des pelouses et retrouver un aspect plus naturel, il pourrait nous falloir une nouvelle génération d’instruments et de modèles financiers civiques capables de tenir compte de formes de valeur multidimensionnelles et longitudinales (séquestration du carbone, hausse de la biodiversité, réduction des îlots de chaleur, etc.), et de mettre à profit les capitaux privés et institutionnels nécessaires pour relever les défis environnementaux liés à la remise à l’état&nbsp;sauvage.</p><p>Il nous faut une meilleure compréhension des différents bénéfices dans une seule cour (séquestration du carbone, hausse de la biodiversité, santé publique, qualité de vie, participation communautaire, sécurité alimentaire, etc.), ainsi que plus d’information sur les valeurs différenciées créées à différentes échelles (une seule cour versus une rue versus un quartier versus une&nbsp;région).</p><p>Les visions du monde autochtones impliquent souvent une philosophie d’interdépendance et d’appartenance, comme l’indique l’expression mohawk Akwe Nia’Tetewá:neren (toutes mes relations). Il est entendu que nous sommes tous liés les uns aux autres et à toute la vie sur Terre. Comment afficher un tel respect pour toutes les espèces vivantes dans notre cour? Comment créer un lien entre la compréhension scientifique des systèmes écologiques acquise au cours des siècles et la sagesse autochtone acquise durant des milliers d’années de relation intime avec le territoire sur lequel nous vivons aujourd’hui?</p>Carte préliminaire des avantages conjoints de Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins Intégrer des responsabilités envers la nature dans les ordres juridiques actuels <p>Selon la recherche et les conversations que nous avons menées avec diverses parties prenantes, il semble que les paliers réglementaires municipaux et provinciaux pourraient être les meilleurs points d’entrée pour reconnaître nos responsabilités envers la nature sur une propriété privée donnée. <br> <br> Sur le plan municipal&nbsp;: Plutôt qu’encourager l’entretien des pelouses (p. ex. une couverture végétale d’une certaine hauteur maximale en cm), les municipalités pourraient déterminer le pourcentage minimum (p. ex. 50 %) de la surface d’une cour qui devrait être réservée à des services écologiques et concevoir des outils pour aider leur communauté à atteindre cet objectif.</p><p>Sur le plan provincial&nbsp;: Les lois actuelles sur le patrimoine semblent un bon point d’entrée, soit en reconnaissant les droits de la nature dans le cadre de servitudes de conservation (comme cela a été fait avec le Community Legal Environmental Defence Fund), soit en proposant des options de conservation juridiques volontaires, comme le fait le Gouvernement du Québec (p. ex. une réserve naturelle, une servitude de conservation, le don ou la vente de propriété, ainsi que la désignation d’un habitat floristique).</p><p>Ces dernières sont accompagnées d’un revenu ou d’une réduction des taxes municipales, mais en général, elles ne s’appliquent qu’à de vastes terrains. Une approche plus collective et démocratique en matière de conservation et de restauration est indispensable. <br> <br> Lois autochtones&nbsp;: Il est possible d’intégrer la sagesse autochtone à d’autres ordres juridiques et, par conséquent, de préparer le terrain pour une éventuelle reconnaissance de la pluralité des ordres légaux. Toutefois, il a été suggéré de commencer par «&nbsp;faire le ménage de notre maison&nbsp;» à court terme avant de prendre part directement à un ordre juridique à titre de personne non autochtone.</p><p>Toutefois, un Autochtone nous a dit que lorsqu’un fonctionnaire de la Ville de Montréal est venu chez lui avec une règle pour mesurer la hauteur de sa pelouse à la suite d’une plainte faite par un voisin, il a mentionné suivre la loi de son peuple et ce qu’elle dit au sujet de la relation avec la terre. Le fonctionnaire a alors reconnu cette loi et quitté la propriété sur-le-champ. Cette anecdote illustre bien la pluralité juridique et la façon dont la négociation entre des traditions juridiques autochtones et coloniales peut se manifester dans le cadre de micro-décisions sur le&nbsp;terrain.</p><p>La prochaine étape&nbsp;: Une conversation avec des représentantes et représentants des différents paliers de gouvernement doit avoir lieu pour clarifier la façon d’intégrer des responsabilités envers la nature dans les ordres juridiques actuels.</p> Travailler à la réconciliation de notre réglementation <p>La réglementation est une des tâches les plus importantes du gouvernement. Elle renvoie à une relation codifiée entre le commerce, l’État, la société civile et la nature, assurant des protections et des terrains d’action adéquats dans tous les domaines. Au moment où nous nous retrouvons à la croisée des chemins face à des défis, mais aussi des possibilités sans précédent, il importe de comprendre que le jeu change et donc, que les règles doivent elles aussi changer, y compris en ce qui concerne les propriétés dont nous sommes locataires ou propriétaires.</p><p>Voici quelques idées de la façon dont cela pourrait se dérouler.</p> La propriété comme un (micro) traité&nbsp;: voir au-delà de la propriété  Sommes-nous capables de voir la propriété comme un traité conclu avec un lieu, plutôt que comme la possession de celui-ci? <p>Pouvons-nous, aux confins de la pensée juridique occidentale, voir la propriété comme un traité plutôt que comme un acte visant la possession privée? Pouvons-nous créer un prototype de microtraité numérique (un traité intelligent) qui pourrait interagir en temps réel avec toutes ses relations et responsabilités, y compris les limites déjà en place qui s’appliquent à la propriété privée en vertu de la loi des colonisateurs?</p><p>Posséder une maison et prendre soin du terrain sur lequel elle est située pourrait alors devenir un acte de réconciliation profonde, ou, au minimum, un acte de «&nbsp;préparation&nbsp;» afin qu’un dialogue puisse avoir lieu entre la notion actuelle de propriété privée et les ordres juridiques autochtones par l’entremise des titres ancestraux. Bien que cela ne garantisse pas une intégration tout en douceur des titres ancestraux et des droits de propriété privée, cela pourrait néanmoins stimuler l’interface… ou notre imagination.</p><p>Les voies qui mènent au-delà de la propriété demeurent insaisissables. Cependant, des éléments d’émerveillement précis issus d’un contact préliminaire avec la pensée juridique autochtone pourraient nous aider à ne plus simplement «&nbsp;faire les choses comme d’habitude&nbsp;» et à participer plus activement à la décentralisation de la vision occidentale par défaut. Voici quelques éléments d’émerveillement pour poursuivre la réflexion&nbsp;:</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;En tant que citadins, une part de notre difficulté est d’apprendre comment vivre avec la force de la Terre et de nous laisser conseiller par celle-ci. Allez parler aux arbres et aux plantes pour comprendre le langage, les histoires, la science et les traités de la nature. Et parce que la Terre est vivante, cela veut dire que l’histoire ne peut pas se résumer à “il était une fois en 1701”. Il s’agit plutôt de ce qui se produit aujourd’hui et de ce qui peut se produire à l’avenir. Le paragraphe 35 fait partie intégrante de la loi canadienne et peut nous aider à créer des lois qui n’émanent pas seulement des parlements ou des assemblées législatives, mais qui émanent aussi de nous, qui font partie de nous. Il n’y a pas que les avocats et les juges qui peuvent pratiquer le droit. Nous pouvons tous et toutes le faire. Et nous pouvons commencer en récréant le lien entre les gens et leurs terres. C’est de nous qu’il s’agit. Nous n’avons pas à l’attendre. Le lien est là. Il nous entoure.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― John Borrows, extrait de son enseignement près de l’étang, Toronto,&nbsp;2019</blockquote> Communiquez avec&nbsp;nous <p>Nous en sommes encore aux premières étapes de la mise sur pied de Civic-Indigenous 7.0, ce qui veut dire que nous sommes ouverts à toute rétroaction qui pourrait éclairer nos travaux futurs.

<p><a href="https://www.incognia.com/">Incognia</a> has published a new report that quantifies the amount of friction that passwords add to mobile apps in the financial industry. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incognia.com/resources/mobile-app-friction-report-login-authentication-password-reset">Mobile App Friction Report</a> called particular attention to the password reset process, and advised financial institutions to replace passwords and SMS one-time passwords (OTP) with stronger forms of multi-factor authentication.</p>



  



<p>Digging into the numbers, the Incognia report examined mobile apps from 27 leading banks and financial services providers, including those from Klover, Coinbase, CapitalOne, and TD Ameritrade, amongst several others. It found that the vast majority (26 of the 27) still use passwords as their primary authentication method, while 17 of 27 still use SMS passcodes as their secondary authentication factor.</p>



<p>That last stat is especially concerning because the SMS passcodes are one of the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/nok-nok-pushes-fido-authentication-financial-industry-042802/">more vulnerable forms of authentication</a>, to the point that the NIST has cautioned against the use of the technology. With that in mind, Incognia argues that the financial industry’s continued reliance on passwords and SMS technology increases the risk of fraud, and does so while saddling customers with a more aggravating user experience.</p>



<p>On that front, Incognia noted that the average password reset process took more than a minute to complete, and forced the user to navigate more than four screens to enter information into another four fields. Unfortunately, that extra friction has not deterred cybercriminals, with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/transunion-reports-higher-fraud-rate-during-covid-10-pandemic-032306/">fraud losses going up</a> $56 billion in the US in 2020.</p>



<p>“Resetting a password on a mobile app is a huge waste of time and can greatly impact customer satisfaction,” said Incognia Founder and CEO André Ferraz. “This is especially important for fintech companies, whose customers seek to simplify their finances and lives.”</p>



<p>According to Incognia, the recent <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-reports-changing-authentication-patterns-during-covid-19-crisis-041408/">increase in remote traffic</a> (mobile financial app use was up 90 percent in 2020) has created an urgent need for stronger forms of authentication. The company went on to pitch its own passive authentication offering, which <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/incognia-introduces-location-based-anti-fraud-tool-mobile-devices-060203/">analyzes device and location information</a> to evaluate the risk level during each interaction. The solution also utilizes behavioral biometrics for an additional layer of security.</p>



<p>Incognia released a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/incognia-releases-free-developer-edition-mobile-authentication-platform-050704/">free developer version</a> of its platform back in May.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a> is inviting more users to try out its wellness-focused app based on behavioral biometrics.</p>



<p>The app, dubbed “TypingDNA Focus”, uses patent-pending AI technology to gauge the mood of an end user based on their typing patterns. According to the company, it can assess when the user is feeling particularly stressed, happy, calm, energetic, or focused.</p>



<p>This data is presented through an infographic dashboard offering end users a snapshot of notable mood trends, flagging 2:00 p.m. on Monday as a time of particular focus, for example, or 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday as a high-stress period.</p>



 TypingDNA Focus presents data through an infographic dashboard, offering end users a snapshot of notable mood trends. 



<p>The app represents an extension of TypingDNA’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/typingdna-explains-what-goes-into-biometric-typing-pattern-050405/">robust behavioral biometrics technology</a> beyond the realm of cybersecurity, which has been its main focus area. By assessing various metrics including typing speed and the duration of keystrokes, TypingDNA’s platform can establish a profile of an end user that can be leveraged for authentication; anomalies in typing behavior, meanwhile, can serve as indications of potential fraud.</p>



<p>The fundamental technology underlying this approach to security can also be used to learn more about the psychological profile of an end user, as TypingDNA is now seeking to demonstrate in its wellness application.</p>



<p>TypingDNA first launched its Focus app in a research phase in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/typinddna-turns-typing-analytics-tech-wellness-applications-121002/">December of 2020</a>. Since then, the company has gathered 2 million data points on which to refine its model. Work on the solution is ongoing. <a href="https://blog.typingdna.com/first-mood-tracking-app-using-typing-biometrics/">In a blog post</a>, Product Manager Victor Pop said that the TypingDNA team “is tinkering away to add even more functionality, moods, actionable insights, and even a mobile version to keep track of your mental health and productivity on the go.”</p>



<p>That’s why the company is now inviting more macOS users to download the free TypingDNA Focus BETA app. The company is also working on a Windows version, which is “coming soon,” according to Pop’s post.</p>

<p>In the wake of our <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a> announcement, I’d like to take a look at the guts of our HoloPort Alpha Program — specifically the separate networks and why they matter.</p><p>(Also, this is the hundredth Dev Pulse! An exciting milestone! 🎉 Huge thanks to Amanda, Micah, Klaye, Paulii, Jarod, Lucas, Mary, the dev teams, and all the other people who’ve ever worked on it.)</p> The Holo network: actually three separate networks <p>The Holo hosting dev team will assign all hosts in the HoloPort Alpha Program to one of three networks:</p>  The alphaNet is an alpha release of the production-ready Holo network. From the HPOS to the centralised infrastructure, it runs on code that’s known to be stable — appropriate for production use, though not necessarily performant, feature-complete, or bug-free. It sees a slow update cycle, only incorporating changes as they’re proven to work right.  The flexNet runs on code that includes features and bugfixes that want to be promoted to the alphaNet but need pre-release testing. This will be a mixture of stable and unproven components that will eventually make it into the release once they’re considered reliable. Components could come from the alphaNet, the devNet, or a special branch of the codebase that focuses on just one feature.  The devNet tracks the current state of development and is very unstable. This is where the daily work shows up, and is only used and tested by Holo team members. Automated tests are run on the devNet each night on new features and bugfixes, as well as to catch ‘regressions’ — previously working features that have been broken by new code.  <p>The networks are almost completely separate, from web browser to HoloPort. All the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-to-break-a-holo-app/#a-look-at-how-a-holo-hosted-happ-can-break">centralised components</a> — the web server that serves up the Chaperone script to the user, the matchmaker service that finds the user a HoloPort to connect to, the Holo router that connects the user to their chosen HoloPort, and the proxy and bootstrap services that connect HoloPorts to each other — are replicated so they isolate the alphaNet from the devNet. This keeps bugs from leaking out into the experience of users on the alphaNet, and it prevents resource-heavy automated tests from slowing the alphaNet down.</p><p>The Holo devs are describing this as a huge improvement in their ability to test changes — not only does it contain bugs, but it also vastly simplifies our testing and deployment setup. Each network can be deployed automatically — from the HoloPort, through the centralised infrastructure, to the scripts that run in the user’s browser. These are the kinds of quality assurance upgrades we need right now as we prepare for public alpha testing.</p> Explaining the requirements for the HoloPort Alpha Program  Remote SSH enabled <p>Because the Holo hosting dev team will be the ones choosing how many HoloPorts they need for each network, SSH will be enabled by default on all HoloPorts for this stage of the program. This is a big departure from our <a href="http://holo-progress-hosted-happs-and-host-console">previous approach</a>, so I want to clarify three things:</p>  This is only for the duration of the HoloPort Alpha Program.  We’ll only be using it to switch your HoloPort between networks and perform support diagnostics.  In the future, you’ll be able to turn SSH off any time you like from the Host Console Settings. If you disable it, your HoloPort will not be used in the program — that is, it won’t be serving hApps to users, and you won’t be eligible to receive HoloFuel.   95% uptime <p>In the future, web users’ <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">source chains</a> will be backed up by multiple HoloPorts with an uptime of at least 90%. We’re aiming for 5× redundancy, which will give a total uptime of 99.999%, allowing users to access their app even in the unlikely event that four of their assigned HoloPorts are offline.</p><p>For now, though, each web user only gets assigned to one HoloPort. If it happens to go offline, all the users it’s serving can no longer access their app. That’s why the HoloPort Alpha Program <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">requires 95% uptime</a> as one of its eligibility criteria. This will be adequate for testing purposes; anything less will give an unpleasant user experience. We think this is worth paying for, which is why you’ll be getting a stipend in HoloFuel if you join the program.</p><p>If you’re eager to get involved, head over to the <a href="https://forum.holo.host">Holo forum</a> and watch for announcements in the coming weeks.</p> An invitation: help improve the developer documentation! <p>The folks at <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a>, a Holochain dev shop that focuses on good user experience (you should check out their <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn hApp</a>), also care a lot about developer experience too. They’ve invited everybody with some technical background to join their 24-hour Documentation Drive, starting today at 12:00 UTC (sorry for the late notice). You don’t need to be a Holochain expert yourself; you just need to be willing to dig a little and improve things just a bit.</p><p>It’s no great secret among hApp developers that the learning journey is a bit rough and wild; there’s a lot that could be improved. And the success of the Holochain ecosystem will rest on hApp developers, so this is a low-commitment, high-impact way to help out!</p><p>Join the documentation effort by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRK45QFtIO749M4ocLX4drKlkGJmxPEIkyzpmbM1l6_mZ7tw/viewform">filling out this form</a>.</p><p>Thanks, Sprillow, for organising this!</p> Dev Camp update: 1000 registrants! <p>We’ve been floored by the level of interest in the upcoming Holochain Dev Camp. That’s a 4× increase over last Dev Camp; interest is accelerating!</p><p>If you haven’t signed up yet, here’s the <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">registration form</a>.</p> Breaking changes in <code>develop</code>: decryption function and <code>must_get</code> <p>If you’re developing your hApp against the <code>develop</code> branch of Holochain, two new breaking changes have landed.</p>  One decryption function, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/x_salsa20_poly1305/fn.x_25519_x_salsa20_poly1305_decrypt.html"><code>x_25519_x_salsa20_poly1305_decrypt</code></a>, had its parameters mistakenly reversed behind the scenes. The fix <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/874">isn’t actually a breaking change</a>; the host function signature and parameter order haven't changed. But if you discovered that you had to swap sender and recipient in order for it to work, you’ll need to swap them back to what the documentation says.  All DHT retrieval functions have been disabled in validation callbacks and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/812">replaced with new deterministic ones</a>. If your validation callbacks need to load dependencies from the DHT, use the new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/2de6183dbeddb0e06d5f7309603bf05d0dfd8bd4/crates/hdk/src/entry.rs#L218-L319"><code>must_get_*</code></a> host functions to protect validation from <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/#guidelines-for-writing-validation-rules">sources of non-determinism</a>. These functions are guaranteed to retrieve something; if there's something wrong with the dependency, they'll short-circuit in the host with the proper error.  <p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@sydneylens?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Paul Carmona</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/spiderwebs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

					 The decentralized identity revolution is powered by machine-readable governance 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Machine-readable governance is the key to making decentralized identity accountable, effective, and trustworthy.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Much is talked, much is written about governance in decentralized identity. “Trust frameworks,” “trust marks,” “transitive trust” all form part of a lexicon that can be confusing to those looking to enter the field, develop a product or service, or find a simple solution to a problem. In part, this is because the word “governance” is used to cover a lot of ground, from corporate structure and network policy, to responsibilities, values, policies, and legal agreements. Corporate and technical governance can overlap to the point where it’s easy to end up thinking that governance is a problem that needs to be solved before we can use the technology.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this isn’t true. From a design perspective, it’s impossible to lay out all the rules of an information ecosystem in advance, and unwise to try and do so, given that an ecosystem must be able to grow organically to become an ecosystem. The architecture of decentralized identity has clear and simple constants defining its essence: privacy by design, security by design, permanent and portable identity for everyone and everything. The key to sustainable innovation is to combine these constants with flexible parameters. This allows a simple set of rules to generate an infinite number of variations. If all these varieties are interoperable, we end up with a network of networks.</p>
<p>All of this is not to understate the value of paperwork—and the need for common agreement around issues like interoperability. Mars will need a constitution—and a great one. But we must get there first.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance enabled by Agents<br>The thing is, we have a way to enable clear, flexible, governance right now through Agents and machine-readable governance. Agents are the software that allow data to be shared and authenticated by consent between parties, and this makes them the most important governance entities in decentralized identity. That’s because they are programmable with governance rules that define how digital information can be accepted, exchanged, verified, updated, and revoked. They enable people and organizations to trust an exchanged credential.</p>
<p>When Indicio deployed its decentralized ecosystem for a pilot on digital COVID credentials in Aruba (the ecosystem is now called <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea</a> and is a project of Linux Foundation Public Health), Agents containing machine readable governance made the whole system work:</p>
 
 Tourists downloaded a “digital wallet” agent to accept a COVID test credential 
 The COVID testing lab used an agent to issue a test credential 
 The government used an agent to verify the test credential and then issue a proof-of-test credential to the tourist. 
 Hospitality businesses across the island used downloadable verifier agents to scan and verify the government issued credential when the tourists showed up 
 
<p>Machine-readable governance allowed the government to implement its COVID test policies quickly within an architecture for privacy-preserving technology. People knew what was needed. People knew that changes could be quickly dialed into the governance if information changed. And above all, people knew who to trust. Instead of starting with top-down rules, the combination of Agents and machine-readable governance enabled bottom up governance to get the job done.</p>
<p>Start local, scale global<br>This is a critically important point. While decentralized identity is a new and unfamiliar concept to many people, most have an intuitive grasp of decentralized governance. In politics, it is synonymous with the view that local knowledge will drive better governance for the governed than a decision taken far away; in the European Union, this is the principle of subsidiarity: Power should be exercised as close to the citizen as possible.</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity, this is. Why figuring out what works at the local or hyperlocal level becomes a powerful source of trust. Because specific, local knowledge is essential to building transparent, competent, and reliable solutions—the three distinguishing features of trustworthiness, according to philosopher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PNX6M_dVsk">Onora O’Neill</a>—the technology is more likely to be trusted and adopted when it can incorporate specific, local knowledge.</p>
<p>When we have learned what works to solve a myriad of local problems, we can then scale up to governance at a global level. The governance frameworks created as we deploy these solutions are not going to be mutually exclusive; but the search for one framework to rule them all is likely to be fruitless at best and a hindrance at worst.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to focus on maximal privacy through minimal rules and let the interplay of agents and machine-readable governance handle all the pre-existing, national, international, sector-specific, and institutional governance frameworks that will need to be accommodated as decentralized identity expands across the globe.</p>

Credit: CIVIC SQUARE — construction of a neighbourhood grow&nbsp;room Finance at the Climate Crossroads <p>Since the signing of the <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf">UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement</a> in 2015, <a href="https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechaos2021/">$3.8 trillion</a> has been invested in fossil fuels, and much of the money set aside to ‘build back better’ will not address climate change. The role of finance in both the causes of climate breakdown and how we pull our societies back from the brink is a crucial and hot topic that many individuals and organizations pursuing a low-carbon, climate-resilient, just, and inclusive future are grappling with.</p><p>While Sustainable Finance has emerged in response and has seen significant expansion over the past decade <a href="https://www.environmentalleader.com/2021/01/sustainable-finance-expected-to-see-55-growth-in-2021-says-credit-agricole-group/">with a further 55% of growth forecast in 2021</a>, the practice of taking environmental, social and governance considerations into account when making investment decisions is unlikely to lead to transformative change of the kind required. Not only do ESG investments manifest mostly as a “do less harm” exercise with a focus on risk reduction instead of value creation, but they also <a href="https://www.theasset.com/wealth-management/44067/sustainability-funds-fail-to-live-up-to-their-name">hardly do better than conventional funds</a> in directing investment to sustainable activities.</p><p>The micro-shifts of ESG investing are a step in the right direction but wholly insufficient in the face of the climate and ecological crisis. Mainstream approaches leave much of the prevailing investment logic — the paradigms, structures, and practices of investing — untouched. Incrementalism and tweaks at the fringes of the finance system leave these sustainable investments steeped in many of the same finance orthodoxies that got us to this point of crisis in the first place. Put bluntly, moving our pensions from companies involved in oil exploration to less carbon-intensive industries such as biotech, financial services, or digital technology is not going to drive the transformational changes we need locally and globally. This is why ESG investing has come <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/22/sustainable-finance-is-rife-with-greenwash-time-for-more-disclosure">under increasing criticism</a> in recent months for failing to deliver on its impact&nbsp;promise.</p> The TransCap&nbsp;Approach <p>The shortcomings of the Sustainable Finance movement have been noted by many already, not least one of the partners in this collaboration: the <a href="https://medium.com/transformation-capital">TransCap Initiative</a>.</p><blockquote>“Transformation capital is an investment logic at the intersection of systems thinking and finance practice. It has been designed to catalyse sustainability transitions in the places that matter most for human prosperity — such as cities, landscapes, and coastal zones — as well as in value chains and other real-economy systems. It recognises the world as a complex adaptive system and embeds systems thinking, human-centred design, and sensemaking in all stages of the investment process.”</blockquote>Credit: TransCap Initiative — transformation capital <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Transformation-Capital-Systemic-Investing-for-Sustainability.pdf">white&nbsp;paper</a><p>This new investment logic presents a critique of the ESG mindset and argues for why we need to push the world of finance to think beyond the singular goal of investment as a means for capital to multiply itself, and instead to focus on increasing the effectiveness by which Sustainable Finance is deployed. It argues that viewing the world through a systems lens and focusing on real assets in the places where we live, work and play — instead of in stock markets — is more aligned with our shared ambition to build not just a low-carbon but also a climate-resilient, just, and inclusive society.</p><blockquote>“Transformation capital intends for investors to deploy capital primarily to create change dynamics that propel a (real-economy) system in a specific direction, both in order to set the system on an environmentally and socially sustainable footing as well as to enable the continued multiplication of capital in the long&nbsp;run.”</blockquote> How this manifests locally <p>But how does that manifest locally? And how does it interact with those who live within the systems these investments seek to change? How can we better connect the financial system to communities in a way that serves them rather than relegates them to a source of value extraction? How can we ensure relationships move beyond the continued multiplication of financial capital as the primary driving force and instead prioritise wellbeing, social justice, and ecological regeneration?</p><p>Conventional investment portfolios systematically avoid opportunities to generate compound value (both private and public) by remaining purposefully divorced from the tangible and intangible assets embedded in communities themselves. Furthermore, they are not composed in a systemic manner through which individual assets can be brought into synergistic relationship with each other so that they generate multiplier effects that amplify their value to the community. A simple example might be a residential fund investing in a rental portfolio in a neighbourhood. The fund manager knows that the attractiveness of the place and their success is partly based on the sense of community and safety as well as the quality of nearby parks, schools, shops and transport connections. But there is no mechanism or incentive for these connections to be&nbsp;made.</p><p>While financial capital is a powerful lever in driving a system’s behaviour, there are other types of capital important to society’s sustainability transition. One of them is ‘community capital’, which manifests in different ways. It can take the form of the relationships of trust within communities that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual and civic benefit. It can be the organisational and institutional infrastructure in which deliberative and decision-making capacity lies within a community and amongst its members. It can even be the combined financial and social investment potential of a community to generate multiple shared value from collective civic&nbsp;action.</p>Credit: CIVIC SQUARE— #TheBigLunch weekender at <a href="http://www.thefrontroom.cc">The Front Room</a>, South Loop Park, Birmingham<p>These types of community capital are rarely aligned in a purposeful way with financial capital flows, sustainable or otherwise. And yet these types of capital and human-to-human interactions are the bedrock of real value creation in our neighbourhoods and communities. Worse yet, there has been a historic and turbulent relationship between financial capital and the people and places it shapes. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/research/economic-rents">Extractive models of financial investment</a> have bred distrust and often directly contributed to the inequities at the heart of the crises we face. Whether it’s through housing developments that privilege profits over affordable, green and comfortable living for all, or high-street chains motivated by shareholder interests over those of the community, the long term risks associated with these investments are socialised and the rewards are privatised — the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis serving as a powerful reminder.</p>Credit: CIVIC SQUARE — exploring modern construction &amp; renovation methods<p>As technology advances, these harmful power imbalances risk being replicated further and faster. The incentives, values and ownership models baked into finance will play crucial roles in <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657">the means of creation and distribution</a>: how behavioural data from mobile phones, public spaces and smart homes is owned and used; or how Artificial Intelligence is developed and applied to our everyday lives; how gene editing is applied and owned in our food system; or even how social media and other online platform that breed polarising content, unsustainable consumption patterns and mass disinformation structure their business models. Whatever the scope of the transition, how it is financed&nbsp;matters.</p><p>This makes it all the more crucial to see sustainability transitions and the finance that drives them through an economic, political, cultural and social justice lens and recognize that these transitions happen alongside — and not isolated from — other structural shifts in society. In other words, sustainability transitions are not just about carbon neutrality, but rather a need to move away from the prevailing logic of an environmentally and socially extractive economy towards a regenerative and inclusive economy capable of fundamentally addressing the most tangible and pressing challenges of the 21st century. As the <a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/#:~:text=Just%20Transition%20is%20a%20vision,cycles%20holistically%20and%20waste%2Dfree.">Climate Justice Alliance</a> puts&nbsp;it,</p><blockquote>“The transition itself must be just and equitable; redressing past harms and creating new relationships of power for the future through reparations. If the process of transition is not just, the outcome will never be. Just Transition describes both where we are going and how we get&nbsp;there.”</blockquote> Rewiring capital and&nbsp;value <p>Rebalancing this relationship between communities and finance requires more than just new capital formations, new funds and new grant structures. It requires the systemic rewiring of capital itself, away from asymmetric power, control and value extraction, towards more distributed and democratised forms.</p><p>It also requires a rewiring of how we see value. Reconfiguring the relationships between financial capital and community capital can unleash the multiplicity of equitable returns and co-benefits, recognising that value flows from investments can take many forms, but too few are incorporated into conventional financing models. Reductions in liabilities, for instance the health risks associated with fuel poverty, are rarely accounted for fully. Longitudinal and intangible outcomes, such as increased social resilience from one generation to another, fail to be valued fully when investment decisions are made. The failure to capture these values reinforces a warped view of what constitutes a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ investment.</p>Credit: Dark Matter Labs — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">Bridging the Impact Investment Gap: Infrastructuring Tomorrow</a><p>If our finance systems are to go beyond capital formations motivated largely by short term, narrow economic returns alone (financial ROI / social ROI that use conventionally static or negatively biased discount rates), and begin to recognise the multiple civic returns possible, there is a need to explore new ways of measuring, accounting and financing for civic value creation for a new symmetry of power and mutuality. It is in this rewiring of capital and value that we can create the systemic conditions for just transitions.</p> Our TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap exploration <p>The intersection of new investment logics (transformation capital), new forms and flows of value (civic value) and the tangible and intangible assets in our communities (community capital) is where our shared exploration sits. It is where we seek to further unpack and explore the tensions and contradictions that their combination surfaces by testing and validating key components of each, and how they intersect.</p><p>The aim is to generate insights and learnings relevant to a diverse range of place-based transitions. While the transitioning of, for example, urban neighbourhoods towards a just carbon neutrality and universal wellbeing will be different to transitioning rural land systems towards sustainable and ecologically enriching uses, there will be common challenges and relevant points of connection to draw&nbsp;from.</p><p>We have purposefully brought together a collaboration that spans a diverse set of vantage points, knowing that diversity is strength and that to work in complexity is to embrace entanglements and often conflicting perspectives.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/transformation-capital/transformation-capital-systemic-investing-for-sustainability-693cb1190da?sk=c7a5cc7f3e8da34c37d9dd0466dbc38c">TransCap Initiative</a> is a collaborative space for developing, demonstrating, and scaling systemic investing in some of the places that matter most for human prosperity — such as cities, landscapes, and coastal zones — as well as in value chains and other real-economy systems.

How can we best build the capacity for change amongst communities, intermediaries and investors that address historical tensions between capital and societal interests, as well as legacy lock-ins that remain deep-rooted causes of the&nbsp;crisis?  How can we best develop new financial, technical and participatory innovations, which not only systemically rebalance the agency of change from financial capital towards community capital, but are transferable / translatable across multiple different boundaries and scales of ownership (e.g. urban neighbourhoods but also rural land / bio-regions)?  <p>What sits behind these three leading enquiries are a set of cascading enquiries that represent our collective ‘hunches’ for where further work could have&nbsp;value.</p>  How might we best build the capacity for change amongst communities, intermediaries and investors that address historical tensions between capital and societal interests, as well as legacy lock-ins that remain deep-rooted causes of the crises we&nbsp;face?  How might we navigate the tension between urgency for action and the deeper shifts required to deliver equitable systemic change that is grounded in historic and cultural inequities?  How might an ecosystem of investors be nurtured to provide different types of capital that serve local, just climate transitions in different ways?  How might new investment logics address ownership, wealth and power concentrations that drive extractive models of financing, while supporting new economic thinking relating to revenue, risks and&nbsp;returns?  How might ‘participatory imagining’ practices help establish investments with shared intention, in a way that builds legitimacy across all stakeholders involved?  How can new ways of measuring the quality of investments drive rigour and legitimacy (and comprehensively account for its multiple benefits beyond financial ROI)?  How can minimum viable prototypes, proxies and proofs of possibilities help make abstract concepts and ideas around new investment logics tangible to a diverse group of stakeholders?   Towards tangible actions and longer-term proofs of possibility <p>As a collective, we are committed to working towards concrete action in the near term, while maintaining a broader perspective for ‘movement-building’. Our principles for implementation are set out&nbsp;below:</p><p>Short term impact with long term&nbsp;horizons</p><p>This initial exploratory phase will inform what can be implemented in the next 12–18 months. This recognises that the time to make the transformational investments necessary is long overdue and urgent, and also that communities want to see positive changes sooner rather than later. But these short term actions must also be deliberate in how they act as steps towards a radically different future, rather than extending the status&nbsp;quo.</p><p>Testing approaches at multiple layers of&nbsp;systems</p><p>Emerging ideas and actions will focus around investment logics and fund structures, but also institutions and people. Crucially, to support innovation at those levels, ideas will also include innovation of the technical instruments that can enable these new&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Place-focus</p><p>Given the very broad ambitions for this collaboration, we plan to initially focus on one place — Ladywood in Birmingham — to help ground our thinking. This is in part because CIVIC SQUARE is rooted here, is working alongside neighbours in the area and has long term commitments to exploring new models of social infrastructure, community retrofit and more in the area, but also because as with many neighbourhoods facing the challenges it is, the transition needs are great. That’s not to say that we won’t be considering other local contexts and types of transitions concurrently and over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Matching top-down and bottom-up</p><p>We must find better ways of linking finance — which typically wants a standardised model to which large amounts of investment can be applied — with communities, who typically require a bespoke approach tailored to their needs and may need relatively small amounts of capital at a time. We will explore other examples of how this challenge has been overcome and that have been able to deliver meaningful, scaled outcomes.</p><p>Creating a long-lasting platform for sustainability transitions</p><p>In times of adversity, community capital has a direct relationship to the ability of neighbourhoods to adapt and cope with change. Therefore, implementing the changes required to make sustainability transitions happen will require accountable, empowered and securely-resourced local partnerships or even new institutions to be established. We will explore how these institutions might emerge and also be sustainable over the long term and not be entirely dependent on potentially changeable political agendas.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you’re interested to learn more from this collaboration, or are exploring similar themes and issues relating to the topics outlined above, please feel free to reach out to our designated points of&nbsp;contact:</p><p>Dominic Hofstetter, TransCap Initiative <a href="http://dh@transformation.capital/">dh@transformation.capital</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhofstetter_x">@dhofstetter_x</a></p><p>Immy Kaur, CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE</p><p><a href="http://immy@civicsquare.cc">immy@civicsquare.cc</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ImmyKaur">@ImmyKaur</a></p><p>Tom Beresford, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</p><p><a href="http://tom@darkmatterlabs.org">tom@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/t_bez12">@t_bez12</a></p><p>Jen Hooke, Thirty Percy Foundation</p><p><a href="http://jen@thirtypercy.org">jen@thirtypercy.org</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jenhooke">@jenhooke</a></p><p>Dominic Burke, Lankelly Chase Foundation</p><p><a href="http://dominic@lankellychase.org.uk">dominic@lankellychase.org.uk</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/_dominicburke">@_dominicburke</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/financing-sustainability-transitions-in-search-of-a-new-civic-led-orthodoxy-1e615288309f">Financing sustainability transitions: in search of a new, civic-led orthodoxy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You must have heard the words “cryptography” and “public-private key” in the context of data security. But what are they really? And why should you&nbsp;care?</p><p>To answer these questions, let’s get a bit into the basics of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and its application in a digital identity framework called <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-sovereign-identity-whats-the-big-deal-6i1a37z3">Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI).</a></p> What is Public Key Infrastructure? <p>In simple terms, public key infrastructure is a framework for encryption and digital signatures that ensure secure communication between two entities. The use of encryption algorithms and private-public key pair make this framework highly conducive for the secure transfer of&nbsp;data.</p> Encryption <p>Encryption is done with a mathematical algorithm that takes a typed text as its input and runs it through mathematical permutations to create a long output with alphanumeric characters, thereby making it difficult to break or <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">hack</a>&nbsp;into.</p><p>Asymmetric encryption is a kind of encryption implemented with a private-public key&nbsp;pair.</p> Public and Private&nbsp;Keys <p>A pair of keys, called the public-private key pair, work in tandem with each other, such that you can’t use one without the&nbsp;other.</p><p>As the name suggests, the private key is kept private by an entity while the public key is shared with the recipient(s).</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example where John and Mary are communicating with each&nbsp;other.</p>  John initiates a conversation with Mary and asks for her public key, which Mary shares with&nbsp;him.  John writes a message and encrypts it with Mary’s public key and sends it to&nbsp;her.  Since Mary has the associated private key, she decrypts John’s message using her private key and reads&nbsp;it.  To respond, she asks for John’s public key, which he&nbsp;shares  Mary encrypts the message with John’s public key and sends it to&nbsp;him.  John decrypts the message with his private key and reads the&nbsp;message.  <p>Since it’s impossible to decrypt a message without the associated private key, there’s no motivation for hackers to intercept it. This is what makes PKI a secure way of communicating over open networks like the Internet.</p> Role of PKI in&nbsp;SSI <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is a philosophy where you own your data, store it in a place of your choosing like a digital identity wallet, and share it with just the entities you want&nbsp;to.</p><p>There are many ways to implement SSI using cryptographic keys, and in this article, let’s look at two&nbsp;methods.</p> Using a Unique Digital Identifier <p>In this implementation, a unique digital identifier (typically a large number) is also generated along with your private-public key pair. You must register the public key and the unique digital identifier on the blockchain while the private key can be stored in a digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>At the time of authentication, the system looks up the unique identifier and the associated public key while you prove the ownership of this identifier with your private&nbsp;key.</p> Using Digital Signatures <p>Another implementation is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>There are three parties to this process and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — The entity issuing a credential such as a government ID  Holder — The owner of the credential, i.e., the entity on whom the issuer generates the credential.  Verifier — The entity that checks the validity and authenticity of the credential presented by the&nbsp;holder.  <p>The issuer signs a verifiable credential with its private key, encrypts it with the holder’s public key, and sends it to the holder. Next, the holder stores this VC in an identity wallet and can decrypt it using his or her private key to access the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>At the time of verification, the holder creates a verifiable presentation that can include one or more credentials and digitally signs it with his or her private key, and encrypts it with the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.</p><p>The verifier decrypts the VC and checks for authenticity using the public keys of both the holder and the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Thus, these are how the public key infrastructure framework is used for implementing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">SSI-based applications</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

Annie Bailey,  Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole, will host the Artificial Intelligence stream at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Annie some questions about the future of AI.</p>
 
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>What is AI's future? </p>
<p>
We can think about the future of AI in three different ways. So we could of course think about it from the technological advancements, which are happening right now, and really speeding up at a rate that we haven't seen before. So there are advancements in AI in conversation and cognitive use cases, towards analytical use cases, towards integration and automation for all sorts of moving things: into cars, into robots, into drones, and then of course connecting all of these together in the processing side of these. In just about any industry you can think of, there are really strong and sometimes surprising advancements here in AI. And so that future is really driving forward at a rate that's quite exciting. We could think about the future AI from the regulations standpoint too, and that's really going to have a huge effect on what AI will become and how it's going to be integrated into our businesses and our lives.</p>
<p>There are of course, many different frameworks around the world. There's not all that much legally binding regulation that's out there, but on the horizon, there is a recommendation for a regulation which has been put out by the European commission. We'll talk about that a bit more in depth later. We can think about the future of AI as it's being shaped by business. There are so many use cases here that are really working towards the process optimization side and assisting in decision-making, assisting in transferring information into a way that can support fast decision-making. So these three things are really creating the future of AI - so we could say technology, their regulations and its applications in business.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What do the regulations indicate about AI's future?  </p>
<p>
If we consider the journey that AI has been on and the journey that regulation has been on concerning AI, it's gone from frameworks and ethical statements about how AI should relate to and be a part of human society to where we are now. And today, there is a clear cut proposal for regulation from the European commission, and this could be adopted sometime in the next year to two years, so we're of course not in the place where we have legally binding regulation in the European union yet, but it's on the table. If we think about what this regulation is actually trying to do, it's working to harmonize the use of AI, and its development across the European union. So it's very typical of EU regulations. There needs to be a standard and interoperability between all member states.</p>
<p>What's quite interesting is they go into a tier based system on the risk that any AI system could potentially give to any of its users or any stakeholders around it. It breaks it down into regulations for systems, which have an unacceptable risk and how to deal with those, and what counts as an unacceptable risk and then down to high risk, limited risk, and then finally to minimal risk. And so we're moving towards a little more clear cut understanding of how AI is going to be used in our societies, and what's going to be acceptable and not, and what the penalties for that will be. So that's obviously very good in terms of removing uncertainty, but that's of course, laying down some boundaries, and with boundaries its going to bring oversight, need for governance and accountability here. So both sides of this you can argue are going to swing wide the gates without so much uncertainty, the future of AI as much brighter because it's clear what is acceptable and what is not. On the other hand, [there’s] a more limited take on the future of AI, because of course there are horizons and boundaries, which should not be crossed.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How are enterprises getting AI into their business?  </p>
<p>
Businesses have a few options for bringing AI into their systems and processes. The first could be point solutions, and these are AI systems that have been developed and trained to do one very clear, specific job, or to meet one very clear, specific use case. This could be anything from the health industry detecting malignant tumors in images and scans to supply chain management, to anomaly detection for a specific use case. These are all wonderful and great and meet a very specific and defined need, but of course, if you think about the spread of companies, which will need to be developing these solutions, it's endless and every situation, every scenario that a company may encounter, would like AI to solve that problem or to step in or to support these uniqueness factors are so great that we're never going to come to the end of different point solutions. </p>
<p>Another option has turned up in what we're calling AI service clouds. Now these are cloud solutions that deliver the whole range of machine learning development and governance tools, as well as the computing power and the cloud power behind it. These options tend to be really good for organizations which want to create their own point solution for their own scenario, and so these are becoming quite interesting. AI is being brought into the product itself to help automate and structure the process of selecting a model and going through training and validation, then through the lifecycle management and the ML ops [Machine Learning Operations] side. With that, businesses are able to either go for the point solution, something which is already designed for a very clear, specific use case, or they can be a bit more creative and design it themselves with the support of an AI service cloud.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flip the script, what does AI mean for our future?  </p>
<p>
We've been talking about what the future of AI is, and of course what's impacting that, but we have to think about this as a relationship. What does the impact of AI mean for our future? And for us, it's going to mean a much higher dependence on data, and we're already in this data-driven world. Every day it's bringing us closer to having more data-driven insights, to being able to collect data from across the organization to break down silos and use this in really smart ways. AI is going to accelerate that and bring quite measurable benefits from that, which is only going to speed up the process. With that higher dependence on data, we have to have more resilient data value chains and governance around data. This is absolutely essential and will be even more so as we speed up this process.</p>
<p>And of course, AI is many, many things, and it's such an ambiguous term, but you can think of it as a form of communication because AI is bringing information into a form which can be used to make decisions. And so that's a form of communication, or of course you have the natural language aspects where you're being able to communicate your needs in a more natural way, rather than coding, querying or just using keyword searches. All of these methods of communication and bringing communication more into our daily business processes is going to bring to light the need for transparency. There's going to be more opportunities to ask the questions of how was that data collected, or why was that decision made, or why does this impact me in the way that it does?   Those aspects, the dependence on data, the need for then governance and security of that data, and then transparency into our heightened ability to communicate, are going to be some outcomes of AI in our lives. </p>

<p>Though most wallets focus on the private keys used to unlock their cryptocurrency transactions, Gordian Seed Tool takes a step back and allows you to manage the fundamentals upon which private keys are built: entropy and seeds. You can use coin flips, die rolls, card draws, or iOS randomness as the entropy to generate your seeds, or you can import them from other applications. Using those seeds, Gordian Seed Tool can then derive unique, non-correlatable public and private keys as you need them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The focus of Gordian Seed Tool is to protect your seeds. It does so by supporting new approaches to security such as QR-based airgaps, where you store your secrets on a closely held device that isn’t fully networked, such as an offline device in airplane mode, or a strongly protected device like the sure enclave in Apple’s iPhone and more modern Macinotoshes. You then communicate with that device primarily through QR codes or text that can easily be transmitted across that gap of air. Your seeds are thus protected by modern mobile-device security such as data encryption, trusted hardware, and biometric access protection.</p>

<p>That data encryption comes about through Apple’s trusted encryption routines. Seed Tool then adds resilience through integration with iCloud. If your choose for your mobile iOS device to have a network connection, its seeds will be stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption. If you lose your device, you can retrieve those seeds with a replacement device logged into the same Apple account. (If you prefer, you can also use a cellular networked device, such as an iPod Touch or wifi-only iPad, leveraging airplane mode, to entirely ensure that your seeds never leave your device.)</p>

<p>You’ll be able to easily identify your seeds using the Blockchain Commons <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block">object identity block</a>, which includes a visual lifehash, a human-readable name, an icon, and an abbreviated digest. Put them together and you should be able to recognize each seed at a glance.</p>

<p>Besides generating seeds, storing them, and backing them up, Gordian Seed Tool can also transform your seeds. It can derive popular Bitcoin and Ethereum public and private keys from your seeds, answer requests for other derivations,  encode seeds as bytewords, BIP39 words, or hex, or shard them into SSKR shares and save them to different locations or as social recovery with your family, friends and close colleagues. Your seed is the basis for a whole tree of secure data, and Gordian Seed Tool gives you access to all of it.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool is just one of several Blockchain Commons apps that demonstrate the Gordian principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> offers a way to store confidential QRs such as 2FA seeds, SSKR shares, and (for that matter) cryptoseeds. Our forthcoming Gordian Cosigner will demonstrate how to easily manage Bitcoin transactions across an Airgap.</p>

<p>Options for Nano&nbsp;Backers</p><p>We’ve made the difficult decision to offer all Nano backers either a full refund or the possibility to upgrade to a HoloPort or HoloPort+. This decision comes in the aftermath of a global shortage of the component we need to manufacture the Nano. After exploring various scenarios, we’ve come to the conclusion that it is simply not workable in the short term, nor to the benefit of our backers to continue waiting. Further, to put our attention on an alternate option for the Nano at this time would pull our focus from delivering the Holo hosting network along with our key applications.</p><p>Over the past week, we were able to secure components for another limited batch of HoloPorts and HoloPorts+, which means that Nano backers who choose to upgrade now will have the chance to join Alpha testing later this year. The HoloPort and HoloPort+ are proven units on the Holo network and they keep our testing and support focused on delivery of Beta mainet. Also, we can provide an estimated timeframe of delivery for these&nbsp;ports.</p> What are my options if I purchased a&nbsp;Nano? <p>Since the earliest days of the Indiegogo campaign, it has been our policy to give refunds upon request for any order not yet shipped, inclusive of shipping fees. That is still the case and we want to start by offering you a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>We will send emails to all Nano backers, which will allow you to tell us if you’d like to upgrade to a HoloPort or HoloPort+, or receive a refund. For those who wish to upgrade, we’ll begin sending invitations to upgrade along with Nano-credit details, ensuring that those who supported us in the Indiegogo Campaign get the earliest option to upgrade. For those who prefer to receive a refund, we’ll begin processing those requests within a&nbsp;week.</p><p>So, if you’re a Nano backer: Check your email and let us know which option you prefer. If you didn’t receive an email, please reach out to help@holo.host and we’ll be sure to get you a link so we know your preference.</p> The Backstory &amp;&nbsp;Details <p>Over the last months and years there has been a lot of hard work put into the Holo hosting infrastructure, and the HoloPort operating system (HPOS), and if you have been watching closely, it shows. HoloPorts are reliably upgrading and performing for the majority of our early testers, our new HoloPort Alpha Program will bring many new people into the testing process, and we’re expanding the Hosted Elemental Chat testing to over 100 HoloPorts and more than 250 people in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Throughout the design process for our infrastructure, we’ve simultaneously worked to ensure that it supports the lean hardware of the Nanos. This has been challenging but rewarding, as we were the first people in the world to get the Nano’s motherboard working with the Linux kernel we used to build HPOS (the HoloPorts Operating System). This progress will prove useful down the road with regards to future Nano projects.</p><p>While we had our heads down hard at work during the pandemic, however, there were many changes in the electronics hardware industry that included extreme shortages, price shifts, and major delays. This has meant larger players in the market are stockpiling chips to ensure their ongoing supply chains, and chip suppliers are giving preference to those customers. The specific processor that the Nano was designed around has been unavailable to our motherboard manufacturer since before our initial tests late last year, and we’ve now been told it is unlikely it would be supplied until the very end of this year. So despite being ready to manufacture the Nano since Q4 2020, we would have been unable to deliver until 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>When considering the changing landscape around Nano manufacturing, as well as changes to the hardware and compatibility with the HoloPort operating system, it became clear that pushing to ship Nanos that late could negatively impact the Holo project timeline as it would inevitably slow down the release of the Holo infrastructure and require additional testing of HoloFuel, the Host Console, and the Publisher Portal. We further believe that better lightweight options will be designed for the network as the supply chains ease up and more chips and processors become available again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>While there are some similar dynamics at play for the HoloPort and HoloPort+, we were able to coordinate with our manufacturing partners to secure the components required for additional limited supply of HoloPorts that could be delivered this calendar&nbsp;year.</p> Why this was a Difficult Decision <p>1) We don’t hold the commitments we’ve made to our community lightly.</p><p>The majority of our Nano backers joined us during the Indiegogo campaign. You have been incredibly supportive and patient for years. By demonstrating your support, you have helped show the world that there is deep interest in creating a more distributed world and accessible internet infrastructure.</p><p>Later, others of you purchased Nanos on our online store. Many have followed the project first, through periods of design and testing as well as crypto market swings and then, throughout a global pandemic. The continued acceleration of interest in this work demonstrates a demand for cooperative and collaborative technologies that function peer-to-peer. Your continued support has kept us motivated and strong in our resolve as we began delivering apps and infrastructure to bring this vision to fruition.</p><p>Our intention has always been to deliver the Nanos to you. And we think that pivoting at this juncture will mean greater success for the project on the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>2) Demonstrating Holochain working on lightweight devices will show the possibility of P2P apps connected to the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nano’s remain an important strategy for Holo. They demonstrate the capacity of micro devices working in the Holochain P2P ecosystem, which we believe is central to its disruptive potential. A great example of that is RedGrid’s plans for Holochain in their clean energy grids. Lightweight devices lay the foundations of Holochain as a major player in the Internet of Things (IoT) space with massive opportunities for partnerships with governments, universities, and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In fact, that is why we wanted to make Nanos available — to spread the seeds of small computers using Holochain around the world. So while we are adjusting course for this moment, know that the lightweight, micro device as a strategy is not gone, but simply moved to a later milestone on the Holo&nbsp;journey.</p> To sum it&nbsp;up <p>A sincere thank you. Specifically to all of our Nano backers. We know it hasn’t been an easy wait for many of you and that this news might be, well, a bit of a bummer. But we hope you take comfort in knowing that your support has made a true difference in demonstrating a long-term demand for people to host P2P applications on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Also, join us at tomorrow’s AMA (15 July 2021) as we talk about what is next for Holo infrastructure testing and Holochain P2P apps. <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/RFsluzvz">Submit your questions</a> ahead of&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holoport-nano-update-afa053f17ba6">HoloPort Nano Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago we took the shorter week of June 28 - July 2nd as an internal hackathon, with the typical hackathon rules:</p>  work on projects and ideas that are small in scope, and that have been on the back burner for a while  always be on the look-out for bugs or UX issues as you work through building things using Fission  try to stretch things a bit from what the platform can currently do  have fun!  <p>The results were pretty great!</p> Moon Garden <p>Boris, Brooke and Phillip collaborated on a new note-taking app built using Fission called Moon Garden:</p><p>A simple digital garden / second brain, powered by <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/webnative">Fission's Webnative SDK</a>. Includes <code>[[wikilinks]]</code> for linking to other pages.</p><p>Features:</p>  [[wikilinks]] for linking to other pages - excellent for writing documents and including references to other documents, even if they don't exist yet!  <a href="https://fission.codes">Fission</a> powered authentication and storage.  <p>Notes created in Moon Garden are stored in the public webnative filesystem. My notes are automagically available at <a href="https://drive.fission.codes/#/jeffg/public/Documents/Notes"><code>drive.fission.codes/#/jeffg/public/Documents/Notes</code></a></p><p>You can check out a live demo of <a href="https://moon-garden.fission.app/">here</a>; Moon Garden is built using Elm, and the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/moon-garden">Github</a>.</p> Lil Patchy <p>A little while ago I wrote up a document musing about how we might go about building a browser extension that integrates with Fission to allow people to save pages as they browse. In our discussions with folks from the <a href="https://www.forthought.tools/">Tools For Thought</a> ecosystem there has been a consistent use case around saving and annotating web content as part of people's workflows. Browser extensions offer a powerful way to not only make it easier to save web content but also to save more data about the web content instead of just URLs.</p><p>During the hack week Brian and I decided to tackle this and see how difficult it was to do. Thus the Lil' Patchy was born - a web extension and companion app that allow people to save urls as well as metadata and a screenshot from a page directly to web native.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/therealjeffg/lil-patchy">Lil' Patchy extension</a><br><a href="https://github.com/bgins/lil-patchy-saver">Lil' Patchy Saver web app</a></p><p>Lil' Patchy is now being worked on as a side hustle, and we hope to demo basic page saving and app communication in a Fission demo day soon.</p> Unnamed Blogging Engine project <p>James used the week to get started on something we've been wanting to see on the Fission platform for a long time - a fully functional blogging platform. This is a larger project that will occupy more team member's time in the future and serve as a reference implementation for people that are interested in using Fission and webnative to build content management systems. The initial work is <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/blog">here on Github</a> if you want to follow along.</p> <p>Ready to try out Fission?

<p><a href="https://www.alcatraz.ai/">Alcatraz AI</a> is beginning to find more customers for its face-based access control solution. The company has revealed that its facial recognition technology is being installed at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles, which serves as the home field for the city’s Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).</p>



  



<p>Once installed, Alcatraz will enable contactless access control for employees working at LAFC facilities. Facial recognition will serve as a replacement for more traditional employee badges, though in some cases it may be <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-strengthens-rock-with-three-factor-authentication-021201/">deployed in conjunction with badges</a> in areas that require a higher level of security.</p>



<p>The solution is being rolled out to improve hygiene and make employees feel more comfortable as they return to work. Alcatraz noted that two-thirds of employees have expressed concerns about the safety of physical venues, and contactless access control will reduce the number of shared touchpoints while simplifying the venue’s access control procedures.</p>



<p>In that regard, Alcatraz uses facial recognition to verify the identities of registered individuals. It then grants access to those with the proper clearance, while denying access to tailgaters and anyone else that it does not recognize. The solution will eventually be installed at all LAFC sites.</p>



<p>“Touchless access using facial authentication increases building security and user convenience,” said Alcatraz CEO Tina D’Agostin. “In today’s operational reality, it also enhances health and safety measures by reducing touchpoints and enabling robust contact tracing programs. We are here to help companies confidently resume on-site operations, and we are excited to support LAFC in their efforts.”</p>



<p>Alcatraz has spent much of the past year <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-business-development-director-biometric-access-909212/">trying to boost sales</a> for its facial recognition technology. The partnership with LAFC suggests that those efforts are starting to pay dividends.

<p>Microsoft has released a new security patch to address a major vulnerability in the Windows Hello authentication system. The flaw allows hackers to bypass the Windows Hello system using custom USB cameras, and was first uncovered by <a href="https://labs.cyberark.com/">CyberArk Labs</a> back in March.</p>



  



<p>Windows Hello is a passwordless authentication system that allows people to use face or fingerprint recognition to unlock a Windows device, or to log into <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/chrome-users-can-now-authenticate-with-windows-hello-biometrics-905267/">various digital applications</a>. In most cases, that utility is delivered through a built-in camera or fingerprint sensor, which sends the user’s biometric information to the Windows operating system for authentication.</p>



<p>Fraudsters can spoof Windows Hello if they can find a way to manipulate that biometric information, or the sensor used to collect it. Thankfully, it is relatively difficult to do so <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-launches-surface-book-3-windows-hello-integration-050801/">when that sensor comes built-in</a>, and is fully integrated into the design of the device.</p>



<p>The problem, according to CyberArk, comes from the fact that Windows Hello allows people to use <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/matras-fingerprint-scanners-now-compatible-windows-hello-012504/">third-party plug-in devices</a> instead of those built-in sensors. A separate USB camera is much easier to manipulate, and can be modified to send a spoof tailored to a specific device. For example, a hacker could pull a photo of their target off the internet, and then use their custom USB camera to send that photo to the Windows OS to bypass Windows Hello entirely.</p>



<p>The hack is difficult to execute at scale, largely because the attacker needs to have direct physical access to the target device in order to pull it off. However, it would be highly effective against high-profile targets, since the hacker could use a photo to complete the spoof. In that case, they would not need to beat a password or obtain any other secrets, and could instead rely on public (and readily available) information.</p>



<p>For its part, CyberArk completed an attack using an accurate infrared image of its target, even though that IR image was paired with RGB frames of SpongeBob SquarePants. The firm notified Microsoft about the vulnerability (which is why the tech giant was able to push an update), but warned that the patch may not fully address the problem, which stems from the fact that the system implicitly trusts peripheral devices. To close the gap, the company would need a way to confirm the integrity of those peripherals before accepting data transmitted from them.</p>



<p>CyberArk acknowledged that the Patch is a security improvement. The exploit works against both the consumer and enterprise versions of Windows Hello, though it does not work against those who use the Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security feature, which requires specialized hardware, drivers, and firmware. As it stands, roughly 85 percent of Windows 10 users currently take advantage of Windows Hello for authentication.</p>

He estimates that companies are losing “$1 billion due to fraudulent &amp; manual transaction tracking.”</p><p>By securely integrating with major crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and Uniswap so far), Skytale aggregates a business’s crypto portfolio in one central place. They then classify your crypto transactions in different categories — like <a href="http://mint.com">Mint</a> does for personal spending — and export the data to Quickbooks or another accounting software of&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Finally, Skytale provides a business analytics platform for SMEs to visualize their crypto activities — also accessible via API for customers to build custom data analytics tools.</p> Shipping auth 10X&nbsp;faster <p>Ever since first hearing about Magic from a friend, Enrico told&nbsp;me:</p><blockquote>“I fell in love with Magic links immediately”.</blockquote><p>With a tight goal to launch their MVP in Q2 of 2021, Skytale was looking for a simple auth solution and realized that Magic was exactly what they were looking for, and then some: an auth solution, but also a backend, with integrations with modern blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Binance and&nbsp;Celo.</p><blockquote>“In a matter of days, we were able to authenticate users without writing almost any lines of code, offering enterprise-grade security.”</blockquote><p>Since implementing auth with Magic, Enrico tells me they’ve seen a 25% increase in successful signups and user activation.</p><p>Here’s what the login flow looks&nbsp;like:</p><blockquote>“This is a specific tangible example of a great partnership in which we could be focused on our core features, while very important features could be delegated to our partner.”</blockquote><p>Skytale’s vision is to create a world of open finance where there will be no difference between transacting with fiat or crypto assets, both for corporations and individuals.</p><p>And thanks to Magic, that vision is approaching very&nbsp;quickly.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/skytale-sees-25-better-signup-and-activation-after-adding-auth-with-magic-43c8c8f0d284">Skytale sees 25% better signup and activation after adding auth with Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDnow makes onboarding even easier with automated KYC combined with real-time AML screening and monitoring</p>
<p>Munich, July 15th 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, introduces automated AML (anti-money laundering) screening to its comprehensive platform. This feature enables a combined screening of users against certain global watchlists to make a risk assessment and to avoid violating various sanctions. The solution is able to screen a person’s identity against PEP (politically exposed person) lists, sanctions lists, global watchlists and adverse media at regular and self-selected time intervals. This allows the IDnow platform to monitor thousands of AML lists concurrently and in real-time.</p>
<p>IDnow integrates this additional step into its platform in order to reduce complexity and to make the KYC (know your customer) flow smoother, quicker and even more secure. The highly automated process spares companies from uploading data for the monitoring as the information was already collected during the identity check. With the option of ongoing monitoring, based on an individually set rhythm, businesses can maintain current risk profiles of their customers and perform the customer due diligence.</p>
<p>“The new streamlined process accelerates the onboarding flow and offers a better user experience”, says Vikas Seth CPO at IDnow. “The addition of AML screening and monitoring is further expanding the IDnow platform and marks another strategic step on our way to become the leading European platform for all identity needs.”</p>
<p>As a first step, AML screening and monitoring will be offered for IDnow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, the automated identity verification solution within IDnow’s platform. Furthermore, it will be offered for all our identification methods in the future.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021, IDnow acquired French identity technology provider ARIADNEXT as well as German identity Trust Management AG. This enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Europe.</p>

To discuss this significant milestone, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was interviewed in Global Banking and Finance. According to Li jun, since our MainNet launch three years ago, decentralized identity solutions and secure data management have become increasingly important. Every day, individuals make millions of transactions online. Despite increased dependence on online services, privacy and security have not advanced in tandem. Every day, we see new data breaches involving the exposure of millions of users’ sensitive personal information, yet people rarely stop to question how companies and services are collecting and using their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At Ontology, we want to empower users to take back control of how their digital identity is managed online, where their data is stored, and how it is protected. Our mission is to provide a decentralized identity framework that uses blockchain technology to redefine trust and challenge the status&nbsp;quo.</p> KOREA IT Times — <a href="http://www.koreaittimes.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=106900">Exclusive Interview, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology: Public Blockchain Specializing in Decentralized Identity</a> <p>McDonald’s customers in South Korea and Taiwan recently had their personal data exposed after hackers accessed internal files. In a statement, McDonald’s said it would work with security experts to identify ways to further enhance its existing security measures. Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, who was interviewed in Korea IT Times this week, believes that breaches such as this lay bare the need for companies to invest in decentralized blockchain solutions to ensure the highest levels of privacy and security when it comes to sensitive customer data. Individuals can protect themselves using Ontology’s decentralized digital identity solutions that allow them to control how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

 Our Harbingers highlight Ontology’s growth since the launch of our MainNet, three years&nbsp;ago. <p>Ontology has become a truly global <a href="https://ont.io/community">community</a>, covering 30 languages across multiple countries and continents. Ontology’s global reach is, in part, thanks to our Harbingers, the exceptional leaders that help Ontology continue to grow its community and ecosystem, making it a leading blockchain for management of decentralized identities and data. Currently, we have 10+ Harbingers helping manage our communities across several platforms including Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Line, and&nbsp;Kakao.</p><p>Let’s take a tour of Ontology’s ecosystem with our Harbingers.</p><p>On June 30, 2018, Ontology MainNet <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/an-open-letter-to-the-ontology-community-ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched-3f08185bec">version 1.0</a> officially launched. It represented a new generation of high-performance public blockchain, including complete distributed ledgers and smart contract systems support, supporting public chain customization and chain network collaboration, and continues to provide common modules in various distributed applications. Thirty-three candidate Ontology Triones Nodes from six continents facilitated the launch, promoting the establishment of an open-source collaborative distributed trust ecosystem.</p><p>On June 30, 2019, Ontology’s <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-klein-bottle-contest-opens-today-a-chance-to-win-up-to-100-000-ong-9f77caf7967c">sharding</a> design was completed and we were the first to launch a cross-chain <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-testnet-released-86b34352aa42">TestNet</a>. We launched a grand “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-klein-bottle-contest-opens-today-a-chance-to-win-up-to-100-000-ong-9f77caf7967c">Klein Bottle</a>” technology challenge for the global community, attracting the attention of many developers at home and abroad. At that time, we had begun to take a global view and participated in the formulation of a number of international standards including IEEE, ISO and ITU-T. Adhering to the principle of trust first, we established a trust collaboration platform supporting a wide range of business scenarios, and continued to expand our global community.</p><p>On June 30, 2020, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-celebrates-two-years-since-mainnet-launch-b58ff682fa54">Ontology MainNet 2.0</a> launched, designed to support robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability whilst enabling developers to provide solutions for enterprises. ONTO Wallet version 3.0.0 also launched, integrating Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID, with its mobile data client, enabling users to verify credentials and manage their identities, independently. Meanwhile, details regarding Add-on Store, SAGA and OpenKG were announced, one million<a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1275941780232589313"> NFTs</a> were distributed to global communities, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/strengthening-ontologys-governance-and-staking-economic-model-245faf02107a">new governance and staking economic models</a> were introduced, all of which have brought more choice and greater benefits for node parties and staking&nbsp;users.</p><blockquote>Ontology has matured a lot since I became a Harbinger. The development of Ontology’s tech has coincided with growth and enthusiasm within the global community that has blossomed in recent&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>—— <a href="https://twitter.com/dilipishara1990">Dilip</a>, Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySrilankan">Sri Lanka</a> Community</blockquote><p>Ontology recently celebrated the third anniversary of its MainNet (current version 2.2.0) launch. When the team discussed the theme for the third anniversary, two keywords stood out: DID and Data. Some people are still confused by these terms. In the following sections, our Harbingers outline Ontology’s mission from three facets: user, business and developer.</p> Part 1: User-oriented <p>Focusing on users’ needs and real&nbsp;data</p><p>Ontology centers around identity. As early as 2018, “identity” was still a relatively unpopular niche in the blockchain industry. Many people were confused by Ontology’s focus on identity: “Why do we need to pay attention to identity?”, “Don’t we have our own identities, already?” With the concept of decentralized identity becoming more and more popular, technology giants such as Microsoft have begun developing their own decentralized identity protocols. Decentralized identity solutions address the pain points in various industries by using on-chain identity solutions, whilst fostering trust and cooperation. Credit cards and credit scores have become an important part of social life. Good credit can bring many conveniences and even immeasurable value, and can effectively reduce the high cost of dealing with people. At this time, the public’s attention to identity is not limited to ID card, passport, driver’s license and other information, but more concerned about whether they have a universal, glittering and properly protected “pass” in the virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>Personal data has become immensely valuable in the digital age. Centralized media platforms compete to gather as much user data as they can. The problem is that users are not always aware of how their data are being used (or the kinds of data that are being collected). Centralized storage of private data also invites security risks from bad actors. Ontology’s decentralized identity system, ONT ID, enables users to create a self-sovereign identity on the blockchain. ONT ID, based on the W3C decentralized identification specification, blockchain and cryptography, can quickly identify and connect people, financial assets, and objects. Most importantly, ONT ID is not subject to any centralized authority and gives users complete control over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>A decentralized identity encompasses myriad forms of data. Every day, our activities on the Internet produce a digital footprint. Some data remain secure whereas others may be leaked. It is getting harder and harder to protect data from online attacks. Even the largest multinational corporations and social media platforms are not immune to data theft. At Ontology, we believe that everyone’s data is their most precious resource. Your data constitutes your identity and your portrait. In this context, our goal is to empower users by providing them tools to obtain self-sovereign control of their data. Ontology does not save users’ data like centralized technology companies. Instead, it offers users full control over if and when to share their data with third-parties.</p> Part 2: Business-oriented <p>Ontology’s roadmap and solutions for enterprises</p><p>In April 2018, we released our first <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/elaborating-on-the-ontology-roadmaps-18100c449402">roadmap</a>, which described the principles of our “chain network system” and “trust ecosystem”.</p><p>At that time, we wrote: Ontology has two strategic lines: one is a new generation of high-performance public chain and chain network system, and the other is the distributed trust cooperation platform and ecosystem. Blockchain solves the problem of trust, but its underlying layer cannot satisfy the needs of all participating entities. In order to support business scenarios in the real world, it also needs a large number of common modules to provide various types of distributed trust services that can support real business scenarios, such as a decentralized identity framework (ONT ID), distributed data exchange protocol (DDXF), and distributed credit evaluation system (OScore). Only when these two components are integrated together can we have a distributed collaboration platform that can support real businesses.</p><p>We remain committed to this core vision to provide effective solutions in combination with various real business scenarios. At present, we offer solutions in several sectors including <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">mobile travel</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----12-----------------------">inventory and logistics</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-microworkers-partner-to-enhance-global-freelancing-marketplaces-adef34dbe2f9">job market</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/on-the-move-new-adoption-of-ontology-in-the-new-energy-logistics-vehicle-industry-9f46c1da0c4">enterprise data certification</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/250-million-pieces-of-ogq-digital-asset-content-to-be-housed-on-the-ontology-blockchain-428d385092ba">digital content</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">music copyright</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">KYC &amp; identity</a>.</p><p>Commenting on Ontology’s breadth of service offerings, our Ontology Harbinger from <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyTradingOfficial">Trading</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySlovakCzech">Czech and Slovak</a> Community, <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>Ontology has become a global leader in decentralized identity and data management solutions. It has remained committed to its overarching vision and continues to advance its roadmap. I expect the Ontologyecosystem to continue expanding, incorporating more use-cases and partners, whilst remaining attentive to its online communities.</blockquote> Part 3: Developer-oriented <p>Ontology infrastructure and technology</p><p>We are committed to building an underlying infrastructure platform to provide developers with efficient and easy-to-use practical technology.</p><p>Ontology 2.0, released last year, has the leading advantage of enabling developers to provide complete solutions for enterprises. Wasm-JIT, Multi-VM and Layer 2 technologies are deeply integrated in this version as well as ONT ID 2.0. Based on these cutting-edge technologies, the problems of capacity expansion, performance, compatibility and personal data privacy can be solved easily. The Add-on Store for developers is provided in this version, which enables developers without previous experience in blockchain to start building&nbsp;easily.</p><p>In this year’s MainNet version, after several months of EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) research, design and development, our technology team has introduced an Ontology virtual machine compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It features an account system, virtual machine and Web 3 API. Users can use applications and wallets all-in-one place, based on Ethereum, and developers can use contract development tools such as Truffle and Remix to realize seamless connection and ecosystem expansion of the chain. So far, our Multi-VM supports four kinds of smart contracts (NeoVM, Native, Wasm, EVM), an industry-first. Developers can enjoy Ethereum ecosystem on Ontology chain, with lower gas fees and faster block production.</p><p>In the past three years, we have published technical articles through our social media channels, and continue to educate, helping more community partners understand blockchain technology.</p><blockquote>It has been a pleasure to help Ontology grow over the years. We have cultivated an open and encouraging community that is welcoming of new members and happy to provide support to those with questions about recent developments. I’m excited to see where Ontology goes in the second half of 2021 and&nbsp;beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>——<a href="https://twitter.com/EmilioburFdez">Emilio</a>, Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Spanish</a> Community</blockquote><p>Facing users, enterprises and developers, we believe that technology and ideas can enhance all aspects of life. We remain committed to this belief and continue to move forward on the road toward mass adoptions of blockchain and decentralized identity and data management solutions.</p><p>We are very grateful to the Ontology Harbingers for their dedication and enthusiasm towards fostering an open and welcoming global community. We are always looking for passionate people to join us in spreading Ontology’s vision. Recently, we detailed our Harbinger Program v2 to further expand and grow Ontology’s community and ecosystem around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Learn what it takes to become the next Ontology Harbinger with our updated <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">guide</a> and become part of our global community, today!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

   The HTTP protocol powers the web. Traditionally, HTTP is a request-response protocol. This means that a client requests data from a server, and the server responds to that request. In this model, a server will never send data to a client without having been queried first. 

 This approach is suitable for many use cases that the web is used for. It allows loose coupling between clients and servers

  <p>The HTTP protocol powers the web. Traditionally, HTTP is a request-response protocol. This means that a client requests data from a server, and the server responds to that request. In this model, a server will never send data to a client without having been queried first.</p>

<p>This approach is suitable for many use cases that the web is used for. It allows loose coupling between clients and servers without the need to keep a persistent connection. But for real-time applications, the request-response model has its drawbacks. When some state on the server changes, the client isn’t informed immediately. Within the HTTP protocol, the client needs to use regular polling to request data from the server. This is not ideal because the data will not arrive at the server in real-time, and shorter polling intervals will increase network traffic.</p>

<p>Most modern browsers nowadays support WebSockets. The WebSocket protocol builds on top of the HTTP protocol to provide a persistent bi-directional connection between the client and the server. Websockets can be used directly using JavaScript in the browser, but the API is low-level, making it complicated to create even a simple application.</p>

<p>Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that provides a high-level API around WebSockets. This makes it easy to create real-time web applications with only a few lines of code. As an additional extra, Socket.IO falls back to a technique called long-polling in case a WebSocket connection can’t be established between the client and the server.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to create a simple chat application using Socket.IO, React for the front-end, and Node/Express for the back-end. I won’t assume any prior knowledge except some familiarity with JavaScript. I will assume that you have an up-to-date version of Node installed on your system.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>

 Create a Chat Server with Express and Socket.IO 

<p>I will start by showing you how to implement the server. In a folder of your choice, open a terminal. Execute the following command to create a chat server project.</p>

   <code>npx express-generator --no-view chat-server
</code>   

<p>The <code>npx</code> command is part of your Node.js installation and lets you run scripts from the npmjs repository. The <code>express-generator</code> script creates a new Express-based server project. The command above will create a new folder <code>chat-server</code>. In the terminal, navigate into that folder and install the dependencies and then some additional packages by running the following two commands.</p>

   <code>npm install
npm install -E socket.io@4.1.2 uuid@8.3.2 cors@2.8.5
</code>   

<p>The one dependency to note here is <code>socket.io</code>. This is the Socket.IO library that you will be using to provide the communication between client and server. Now, open up an editor of your choice and create a new file <code>chat.js</code> in the project folder. Paste the following contents into the file.</p>

   <code>const uuidv4 = require('uuid').v4;

const messages = new Set();
const users = new Map();

const defaultUser = {
  id: 'anon',
  name: 'Anonymous',
};

const messageExpirationTimeMS = 5*60 * 1000;

class Connection {
  constructor(io, socket) {
    this.socket = socket;
    this.io = io;

    socket.on('getMessages', () =&gt; this.getMessages());
    socket.on('message', (value) =&gt; this.handleMessage(value));
    socket.on('disconnect', () =&gt; this.disconnect());
    socket.on('connect_error', (err) =&gt; {
      console.log(`connect_error due to ${err.message}`);
    });
  }
  
  sendMessage(message) {
      this.io.sockets.emit('message', message);
  }
  
  getMessages() {
    messages.forEach((message) =&gt; this.sendMessage(message));
  }

  handleMessage(value) {
    const message = {
      id: uuidv4(),
      user: users.get(this.socket) || defaultUser,
      value,
      time: Date.now()
    };

    messages.add(message);
    this.sendMessage(message);

    setTimeout(
      () =&gt; {
        messages.delete(message);
        this.io.sockets.emit('deleteMessage', message.id);
      },
      messageExpirationTimeMS,
    );
  }

  disconnect() {
    users.delete(this.socket);
  }
}

function chat(io) {
  io.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {
    new Connection(io, socket);   
  });
};

module.exports = chat;
</code>   

<p>To understand this module, it is probably best to start at the bottom. The module exports a single function <code>chat</code> that takes the Socket.IO server instance as a parameter. When a client requests a connection, the callback will create a new <code>Collection</code> instance and pass the Socket.IO server instance and the new <code>socket</code> to the constructor. The constructor of the <code>Connection</code> class sets up callbacks on events coming from the socket. The <code>disconnect</code> and <code>connection_error</code> are predefined events that are triggered when the socket disconnects, or when an error happens during the connection. The <code>message</code> event will be triggered by the client whenever a new message has been posted in the chat. The <code>getMessages</code> event will be used by new clients to retrieve all existing messages from the server.</p>

<p>The chat room holds two global data structures, <code>messages</code> and <code>users</code>. The <code>users</code> map is intended to hold user information indexed by the socket connection. At the moment, users are never added to this map. I will come back to this later when I show you how to implement user management. The <code>messages</code> object is a set that simply contains all messages together with some metadata.</p>

<p>When a new message arrives, <code>handleMessage()</code> creates a message object and adds it to <code>messages</code>. It will then call <code>sendMessage()</code> which uses the Socket.IO server to send the message to all sockets that are currently connected. It is this call that will update all clients simultaneously. <code>handleMessage()</code> also creates a time-out callback that will delete the message again after some fixed time has elapsed.</p>

<p>To use the <code>chat</code> module, open the <code>bin/www</code> file in your editor. At the top of the file, add the following two imports.</p>

   <code>var chat = require('../chat');
var socketio = require('socket.io');
</code>   

<p>Now modify the section under the comment <code>Create HTTP Server</code> to look like the code below.</p>

   <code>/**
 * Create HTTP server.
 */

var server = http.createServer(app);
var io = socketio(server,{
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST']
  }
});
chat(io);
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to add CORS support to the Express server. Open <code>app.js</code> and add the <code>cors</code> import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>var cors = require('cors');
</code>   

<p>Then, add the <code>cors</code> middleware to the Express server by adding the following line directly after the <code>app</code> instance has been created.</p>

   <code>var app = express();
app.use(cors()); // add this line
</code>   

<p>You can now start the server in the terminal by running the following command in the project folder.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>You should not receive any error messages but you also will not see much at this point because the server is not connecting to any client yet.</p>

 Implement the Socket.IO Client Using React 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create the client for the chat application. I will be using React to implement the front-end. In a folder of your choice, open the terminal and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app chat-client
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder <code>chat-client</code> and initialize a React application inside it. Navigate into the new folder and install the Socket.IO client library.</p>

   <code>cd chat-client
npm install -E socket.io-client@4.1.2
</code>   

<p>In the editor of your choice, open the file <code>src/App.js</code> and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';
import Messages from './Messages';
import MessageInput from './MessageInput';

import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const newSocket = io(`http://${window.location.hostname}:3000`);
    setSocket(newSocket);
    return () =&gt; newSocket.close();
  }, [setSocket]);

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;header className="app-header"&gt;
        React Chat
      &lt;/header&gt;
      { socket ? (
        &lt;div className="chat-container"&gt;
          &lt;Messages socket={socket} /&gt;
          &lt;MessageInput socket={socket} /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      ) : (
        &lt;div&gt;Not Connected&lt;/div&gt;
      )}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>The main application connects to the server using the Socket.IO client library. Inside the <code>useEffect()</code> hook a connection is established. Once connected, the <code>socket</code> state is updated via the <code>setSocket</code> function. The component then renders a page that contains a header. If a socket has already been established, it will also render two components <code>Messages</code> and <code>MessageInput</code>. Both of these components need the socket to work so it is being passed in as a parameter.</p>

<p>To give the component some styling, open <code>src/App.css</code> and replace its contents with the CSS below.</p>

   <code>.app-header {
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #282c34;
  color: white;
}

.app-header &gt; div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.chat-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 16px;
}
</code>   

<p>Now it’s time to start creating the <code>Messages</code> and <code>MessageInput</code> components. Start by creating a file <code>src/Messages.js</code>. Paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './Messages.css';

function Messages({ socket }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState({});

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const messageListener = (message) =&gt; {
      setMessages((prevMessages) =&gt; {
        const newMessages = {...prevMessages};
        newMessages[message.id] = message;
        return newMessages;
      });
    };
  
    const deleteMessageListener = (messageID) =&gt; {
      setMessages((prevMessages) =&gt; {
        const newMessages = {...prevMessages};
        delete newMessages[messageID];
        return newMessages;
      });
    };
  
    socket.on('message', messageListener);
    socket.on('deleteMessage', deleteMessageListener);
    socket.emit('getMessages');

    return () =&gt; {
      socket.off('message', messageListener);
      socket.off('deleteMessage', deleteMessageListener);
    };
  }, [socket]);

  return (
    &lt;div className="message-list"&gt;
      {[...Object.values(messages)]
        .sort((a, b) =&gt; a.time - b.time)
        .map((message) =&gt; (
          &lt;div
            key={message.id}
            className="message-container"
            title={`Sent at ${new Date(message.time).toLocaleTimeString()}`}
          &gt;
            &lt;span className="user"&gt;{message.user.name}:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span className="message"&gt;{message.value}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span className="date"&gt;{new Date(message.time).toLocaleTimeString()}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        ))
      }
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Messages;
</code>   

<p>When the component is created, event handlers for the <code>message</code> and the <code>deleteMessage</code> events are set up for the Socket.IO connection. The <code>messages</code> state is a plain object that contains each message indexed by the message ID. Using React hooks, this state is updated inside the event handlers to reflect the changes provided by the server. The component then displays all messages sorted by the timestamp at which they were created.</p>

<p>This component also needs some styling. Create a new file <code>src/Messages.css</code> with the following CSS code.</p>

   <code>.message-list {
  max-width: 500px;
  width: 100%;
}

.message-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #eeeeee;
}

.user, .date {
  font-size: 0.625rem;
  color: #888888;
}

.user {
  min-width: 120px;
}

.message {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
</code>   

<p>The last component is the <code>MessageInput</code> component. This will be the text input you can use to send messages. Create a file <code>src/MessageInput.js</code> and add the code below.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './MessageInput.css';

const NewMessage = ({socket}) =&gt; {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const submitForm = (e) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    socket.emit('message', value);
    setValue('');
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={submitForm}&gt;
      &lt;input
        autoFocus
        value={value}
        placeholder="Type your message"
        onChange={(e) =&gt; {
          setValue(e.currentTarget.value);
        }}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};

export default NewMessage;
</code>   

<p>This is a simple form with only one <code>input</code> element. Submission of the form triggers the <code>submitForm()</code> handler. The handler emits a <code>message</code> event on the socket, passing the field value. Finally, add some styling to this component. Create a file <code>src/MessageInput.css</code> and paste the following CSS into it.</p>

   <code>form {
  max-width: 500px;
  width: 100%;
}

input {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
</code>   

<p>This completes the implementation of the client.</p>

<p>Before you can test the client together with the chat server, you will need to override the default port for the client development server. By default, both the Express server from the previous section and the React testing server run on port 3000. To change the port for the client, create a file <code>.env</code> in your client project folder and copy the following line into it.</p>

   <code>PORT=8080
</code>   

<p>Now you can run the client by opening the terminal running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>If you also run the server as described in the previous section, you should see the chat application opening up in your browser. You can test it by typing messages into the input field and pressing enter. The message should show up immediately in the area above the input but disappear after a few minutes. If you open multiple tabs, you can see that messages are always kept up-to-date in all tabs.</p>

<p>So far, all messages appear to be written by Anonymous and not by the current user. This will be fixed in the following sections, where you will learn how to add user authentication to the chat app.</p>

 Add User Authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>To manage users in your chat application, you will need to register the application with Okta.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>You will also need to generate a token so that your chat server can communicate with the Okta authentication service. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the resulting URL in your browser, sign-in, and navigate to Security &gt; API.</p>

<p>Select the Tokens tab. Click on Create Token and type in a name for the token. In the following popup, you will be shown the token that has been generated. Copy it to a secure place; you will need it later.</p>

 Add Okta to the Socket.IO Chat Server 

<p>The next step is to add user management with Okta to the server of the chat application. Open a terminal in the project folder of the chat server and install the packages that you will need to interface with Okta.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.1.0 @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@4.6.0
</code>   

<p>Open your editor in the project folder and open <code>chat.js</code>. Add the following code after the imports at the top of the file.</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs');

const jwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
});

const oktaClient = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: '',
  token: '{yourOktaAPIToken}',
});

async function authHandler(socket, next) {
  const {token = null} = socket.handshake.query || {};
  if (token) {
    try {
      const [authType, tokenValue] = token.trim().split(' ');
      if (authType !== 'Bearer') {
        throw new Error('Expected a Bearer token');
      }

      const {claims: {sub}} = await jwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(tokenValue, 'api://default');
      const user = await oktaClient.getUser(sub);

      users.set(socket, {
        id: user.id,
        name: [user.profile.firstName, user.profile.lastName].filter(Boolean).join(' '),
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }

  next();
}
</code>   

<p>This defines the <code>authHandler()</code> middleware for the Socket.IO connection. In this code, <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained from the Okta admin console. Similarly, <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is the Okta domain and <code>{yourOktaAPIToken}</code> is the Okta API token you obtained earlier.</p>

<p>The authentication handler first checks for a JWT token and then verifies it using the <code>OktaJwtVerifier</code>. After this, the information contained in the JWT token is used to obtain the user information using the Okta client. To use the authentication handler add the following command as the first line in the <code>chat</code> function in the same file.</p>

   <code>io.use(authHandler);
</code>   

<p>This tells Socket.IO to use the authentication handler whenever a connection from the client is requested. Just as before, you can start the server by running <code>npm start</code> in the project folder.</p>

 Add Okta to the Socket.IO Client 

<p>Now that you have added user management to the server, it is time to add it to the client as well. In the terminal, navigate to the client project folder and install the following dependencies.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.0.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.1.1 react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Since the React application is already configured to use a <code>.env</code> file, open it and add the following two key-value pairs.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
</code>   

<p>Any definitions here starting with <code>REACT_APP_</code> will become available in the client code through the <code>process.env</code> global. Make sure you don’t add the API token here. The token should be kept secret, and these properties will be visible to the client. Now, open <code>src/index.js</code> and add the following code just after the existing module imports.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: `${process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL}/oauth2/default`,
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/login/callback`,
});

function SecuredRoutes(props) {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };
  
  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" exact component={App} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the call to <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> with the code below.</p>

   <code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;SecuredRoutes /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
</code>   

<p>The <code>Security</code> component wraps any components that want to use Okta authentication. A <code>/login/callback</code> route has been added. This route will be called after a user has logged in on the Okta website and is responsible for setting any application data related to the user’s identity.</p>

<p>Next, create a new file <code>src/auth.js</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export const useAuth = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [token, setToken] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      if (!user) {
        oktaAuth.getUser().then(setUser);
      }
      setToken(`Bearer ${authState.accessToken.accessToken}`);
    } else {
      setUser(null);
      setToken(null);
    }
  }, [authState, authState, user, oktaAuth]);

  return [user, token];
};
</code>   

<p>The function <code>useAuth()</code> will be used as a React hook in the main application component to set the user information and the JWT token value. Now, open the <code>App.js</code> file and import the handler at the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { useAuth } from './auth';
</code>   

<p>In the same file, at the start of the <code>App</code> function add the following code.</p>

   <code>const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect('/');
const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

const [user, token] = useAuth();
</code>   

<p>The function <code>useOktaAuth()</code> is a hook provided by the <code>okta-react</code> package. It manages the authentication state of the user. This hook is only available for components that live within the <code>Security</code> component.</p>

<p>Now, modify the <code>useEffect()</code> hook to send the token when connecting to the server. The code should look as follows.</p>

   <code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const newSocket = io(`http://${window.location.hostname}:3000`, token &amp;&amp; { query: { token } });
    setSocket(newSocket);
    return () =&gt; newSocket.close();
  }, [setSocket, token]);
</code>   

<p>Finally, replace the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> component with the following code.</p>

   <code>&lt;header className="app-header"&gt;
{ !authState? (
    &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;
) : (user ? (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Signed in as {user.name}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={logout}&gt;Sign out&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
) : (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Not signed in&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={login}&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
)
)}
&lt;/header&gt;
</code>   

<p>The header shows the authentication state. If a user is logged on, it will show the user’s name, and a Sign out button; otherwise, it will show that the user is not signed in and show a Sign in button that lets the user log in. You are ready to test the application. Start the server as described above, then open a terminal in the client project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you created a simple real-time chat application! Your browser should open with the chat application, and you should see something similar to the screenshot below.</p>

 Learn More About WebSockets and JavaScript 

<p>This tutorial shows you how to create a simple real-time chat application using JavaScript and Socket.IO. In contrast to the traditional request-response model of communication that has powered the web, Socket.IO makes use of WebSockets. These provide a bi-directional persistent connection between the client and the server. The server can push data to the client and up-to-date information can be shown to the user without having to wait for the client to request data from the server. Socket.IO has many use-cases apart from chat applications, ranging from real-time financial applications to multiplayer games.</p>

<p>The chat application in this tutorial is split into two parts. The client makes use of React for rendering the user interface. The server uses Express to manage connections and configure the HTTP server. The use of Express shows that you can combine Socket.IO based communication with traditional REST-style APIs in the same server.

 The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.3: Securing Provenance and Trade of Cultural Artifacts, with Dr. James&nbsp;Hester <p>Can blockchain help us maintain and secure the storied value of what we bring into the world? Let’s ask Dr. James Hester, Head of Ontology at Mattereum.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>For this episode, I invited Mattereum’s Head of Ontology, Dr. James Hester, former museum curator and medieval arms and armor expert, to discuss a unique area of the Mattereum project with the curatorial side of things. We discuss the use of Mattereum Asset Passports to secure provenance and trade of cultural artifacts, starting with the launch of passports and NFTs for three distinct historical and cultural artifacts.</p><p>Assets Live on OpenSea: <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr</a></p><p>Track: “Optimist” by Zoe&nbsp;Keating</p>  James Hester’s Journey From the Humanities to Crypto [00:01:02]  The Storied Value of Things [00:03:57]  The Dark Seedy Underbelly of the Art &amp; Antiquities World [00:06:43]  Asset Passports in the World of Antiquities [00:11:13]  Asset Passports Bring Composability to Trade [00:20:47]  Tokenizing Cultural Artifacts [00:22:01]  From Static Inventories to Liquid Markets [00:28:36]  Launch of Three Cultural/Historical Artifact NFTs [00:30:30]  Artifact NFTs in the Marketplace [00:34:51]  The Importance of Innovating Within the Material World [00:36:55]   JAMES HESTER’S JOURNEY FROM THE HUMANITIES TO CRYPTO [00:01:02] <p>Garrison: I’ve been really looking forward to talking to you about the curatorial side of the Mattereum project and the Asset Passports. Would you mind introducing yourself to the listeners and giving a little detail on your background?</p><p>James: Sure. Sure. I’m James Hester I’m Head of Ontology for Mattereum which is a very fancy inflated way of saying I’m in charge of the department that gathers together all of the information about the objects that we onboard and figures out how that information is best presented in the Asset Passport.</p><p>And I came about this position and came to Mattereum through a very kind of roundabout way. I’ve known Vinay for quite some time, for over a decade. And prior to coming here my career was primarily in the museums and heritage world. I’m a historian by training and most of my previous roles have been either in education in museums or in the curatorial collections management side of&nbsp;things.</p><p>My primary role prior to coming on board with Mattereum is I worked in the curatorial department for the Royal Armories museum here in the UK. And the role that I finished up with them is pretty much a dream job if you’re a medieval nerd like myself, which was, I was their curator of collections looking after their collection at the Tower of London. Just a bit of extra background, my particular area of specialty that I trained up in is arms and armor. A lot of my previous work is with antique weapons and armor and that sort of thing. So working at a gig like the tower is pretty much the holy grail of museum gigs for someone such as&nbsp;myself.</p><p>But I then wrapped up a PhD again working with medieval swords, documenting and trying to figure out what we can learn by examining the objects more closely and see what that can tell us about how they were actually&nbsp;used.</p><p>And so on the other end of that, Vinay invited me to come on board with Mattereum because they were looking for somebody who was basically an objects guy. In a company that’s entirely populated by tech types and lawyers and crypto folk, having somebody that had a very firm grounding in how to work with objects, what’s important about them, how to gather and organize the information about them. Vinay saw my skill set as being ideally suited for that. So he brought me on board. So it’s the absolute, last thing I would have expected to do at the other end of a PhD, dealing with medieval swords, but it’s been quite a ride these last three years and it’s been quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s amazing. Having someone who’s like a genuine expert on the kind of museum curatorial side of things that has an eye for historical detail&nbsp;,and detail about these objects, and important information to secure about them moving&nbsp;forward.</p> THE STORIED VALUE OF THINGS [00:03:57] <p>James: Yeah. Because essentially the way I always say it is that a historian at the most basic level is basically a storyteller. It just so happens with the stories they tell happened to be true for the most part. It’s often said that history is an art rather than a science cause it’s not just the kind of gathering and reporting of facts, but it’s the interpretation of them, understanding connections and causality and all that stuff as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And you could really apply the same thing when it comes to working with objects. I’m not a, I’m not a typical kind of hitting the archives, looking at financial records from the 14th century kind of historian. I’ve worked with things. Things are what interests me. And really, what makes things interesting to me and presumably I hope to others is the stories that are behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>It’s what makes something more interesting than say, another exact copy of the same thing that didn’t have the same story. Paper napkins could be exactly the same, come out at the same factory, but one of them suddenly becomes much more significant because once upon a time, Picasso drew a little doodle on one of them and didn’t on the&nbsp;other.</p><p>And so as a result that napkin has an aspect of its story that makes it just a little bit more interesting to many people. And personally, I think all objects when it comes to trying to understand them and in the case of what we do here, trying to document them, it’s a matter of teasing out that&nbsp;story.</p><p>What is it about these objects that makes them interesting. Obviously from a commercial standpoint, what is it about these interesting facts that could perhaps make them more valuable than other examples of the same thing? And so it’s this process of chipping away and teasing out that story and then learning how to build it in a way that you can present it properly to other&nbsp;people.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. And it’s the challenge of maintaining that story or protecting that story around these objects over time. That’s at the heart of a lot of friction in the arts and antiquities trade. You hear stories all the time. There’s a story that you sent me of a small museum in France where over half of its collection were forgeries and they spent like almost $200,000 to acquire those paintings. And you hear stories like that all the&nbsp;time.</p><p>It’s a challenge to keep a track of the story around any object, whether it’s a cultural artifact or&nbsp;not.</p><p>James: Yeah, absolutely. As you say, you have situations where unless people are really carefully maintaining a record about an object, then, it may be very well-documented as to its past, but then yeah just no one keeps up that process. And so over time it’s it’s later history falls through the cracks and then falls to other people later down the line to have to backtrack and try to rediscover this because people didn’t keep the fire burning, so to&nbsp;speak.</p> THE DARK SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF THE ART &amp; ANTIQUITIES WORLD [00:06:43] <p>And then also you’re absolutely right. That in a world where it is the stories that make an item valuable there’s of course the temptation to make up stories about things in order to artificially create value for things that aren’t actually valuable in the same way as ones where those stories are&nbsp;true.</p><p>And this is the great seedy underbelly of the kind of art and antiquities worlds that’s just gone on forever. Like so many things it’s an arms race, it’s a constant back and forth of the industry finding ways in order to better authenticate and deter fraud and prevent fraud to happen. And as soon as these new measures are released and put into play, people are already well underway of trying to figure out ways to undermine them and get around them and that just goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And up until now a good deal what cuts through that essentially amounts to what an old mentor of mine just used to refer to as connoisseurship, the ability in this world, which has historically been very traditional and I wouldn’t go so far as to say neophobic because they do make use of new technologies when they come up. They take their time in kind of fully appreciating them because they’re very old establishment. They’re used to doing things in a certain way. “Thank you very much. And it’s been just fine for centuries.”</p><p>They’re used to doing things the kind ofslow, tried and true way. And so in that world, a good deal of the what cuts through the dross and tries to arrive at the truth is essentially informed scholarly opinion about these things. These are your great experts and your great dealers and your specialists in these areas that your art historians who make very considered informed pronouncements about objects. And these are pretty much held to be gospel until new information comes to light that might either update or upend it. It’s very similar process to I suppose the sciences or academia where it kind of trickles ahead as new information comes to light and as kind of specialists stand on the shoulders of giants and build up more of an understanding about things. Which it works quite well, but we are human and humans are fallible.</p><p>So at times even the most skilled expert can make a bad call or not have all the information to hand. It’s a good system, but it’s not a perfect one. And unfortunately we’re getting into a world where we’re dealing in these objects in a much more fast paced environment. The online sale world compared to your trusted local dealer or the auction house having the ability to have a solid understanding about what could potentially be dodgy and what seems right. Having the ability to make that call right then and there, as opposed to having to take the time to seek out an expert and rely upon their assessments and everything becomes trickier. And even for things such as the illicit trade and in art and artifacts, there are very well established mechanisms in place, but they’re not&nbsp;perfect.</p><p>So for example, the two kind of paragons of the criminal activity revolving around the art and antiques trade is the art loss register on one hand and the Interpol art theft database on the other. And so these are the two go-to places where most museums and galleries and auction houses, if anything comes through there as part of their due diligence checks to make sure that everything’s above board with the objects, they’ll typically run it through one or both of these databases to see whether or not a flag comes back saying this is recorded as stolen, or this has been recorded as having some suspicious provenance where could have been, say, spoils of war or illegally trafficked or this has been flagged as a known forgery and that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So that’s usually the first port of call and they’re very comprehensive. They’re very well-trusted. They’re industry standards. But they’re not perfect because all they’re able to do is give people a certificate saying that at the time that they were asked to check, there were no red flags about the subject in their database.</p><p>Something could flag up the day after and it would be, it wouldn’t necessarily have an impact on that because it will have fell out of that immediate purview. So there’s little things like this that make it not a perfect system. And it’s all the more prone to failure in a very fast paced environment.</p> ASSET PASSPORTS IN THE WORLD OF ANTIQUITIES [00:11:13] <p>Garrison: So that brings us to new solutions that are designed with existing institutions in mind in terms of how they think and the details that would be necessary for them to actually use such a system. With Mattereum, we have the Asset Passports, the bedrock that everything else has kind of built on top of. And there are many use cases that arise from that. Could you describe what an asset passport&nbsp;is?</p><p>James: I guess the easiest way to describe an asset passport is essentially container for batches of information about an object, all of which are backed by warranties provided by the people who give that information. So it draws information from as many different sources as can be found and as are able to offer up information. So it allows you to get a completely comprehensive view of what an object is. Not just in terms of its description, but every relevant bit of information related to the object. So things like compliance standards, authenticity paperwork, research records, you name it. If there’s something that’s connected to an object, it can be represented in the Asset Passport and we can draw that information from as many different sources as there&nbsp;are.</p><p>So what that allows us to do is build not only a very comprehensive picture about the object, but also a very — I’m gonna use the magic blockchain word, decentralized — picture about this object, because we’re able to draw it from multiple parties. Not all of which will necessarily be the seller who has a financial interest in bigging up the&nbsp;object.</p><p>So it allows us to kind of source information from loads and loads of neutral parties which greatly reduces the possibility of bias or outright fraud sneaking into the object’s record. The people that provide this information we refer to as Certifiers. So every Certifier who weighs in on some aspect of the object presents their information in the form of a warranty on the accuracy of that information. And they set all their different terms of their warranty, and they can customize that however they want. So they set what the maximum liability they’re willing to assume connected to the warranty. So in the event that there’s a dispute about it, this is how much they’re willing to pay up to in damages if the information causes consequential loss. They’re of course able to ask a fee in exchange for providing this warranty. So they set that, and then all the other terms, like how long the warranty is good for before it needs renewing, et cetera, et cetera. So we gather together all of these warranty backed bits of information, and we stick them all in the passport each in their own&nbsp;section.</p><p>And somebody who has some kind of interaction with the object, whether it’s a buyer, but not just a buyer, this could easily be say a courier for the object who needs to be certain about certain aspects of it as part of their paperwork or insurance and stuff. Or if someone wants to securitize it or tokenize it or do any other number of things where part of doing whatever it is they’re doing they need to be certain about certain bits of the object. They then can subscribe to any or all of these warranties on the information before they either buy or otherwise interact with the object. And so when they do, they’re protected by these for any of their for their activities. And then down the line, if something comes to light where some of the information turns out to be inaccurate, then there’s a dispute resolution system that kicks in where we have arbitration panel at the highest end that will examine all of the evidence and come to a decision as to whether or not either party was in the wrong, or the claim had merit or not, and then decides whether or not there’s any kind of recompense that’s to be dealt out as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>And so our hope is that mechanism does two things. One, by virtue of it being as rigorous as it is — because we try to be very rigorous in terms of the standards by which the information is gathered — we hope that acts to deter attempts to bring fraudulent information into the system, just because people know from the outset that they’re taking responsibility, and indeed financial responsibility for this stuff for anything they put down in there. So we hope that’s enough to deter people from trying to play a funny business with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Skin in the&nbsp;game.</p><p>James: Exactly, Exactly. But at the same time, unfortunately, we can put up a universe of deterrants and people are still gonna try to jump the fence and try to pull a fast one now and again. So when that happens and it is discovered, the other mechanism kicks in, which is our rock solid lines of accountability, as far as who is responsible for what in terms of the information.</p><p>So if somebody does remain undeterred by our standards and still tries to sneak faulty or fraudulent information into the system. When that is found out they’re on a hook they can’t wriggle off of and they’re going to be responsible for that quite possibly financially. Our hope is that that combination has sufficient teeth that it will deter and reduce kind of fraud in the system for objects that go through our ecosystem.</p><p>I can relate a couple — we were very pleased about a month ago that our system seems to be functioning properly. I won’t go into specific details of course, but we had two customers who initially came to us with some very interesting objects of quite high value. One a museum grade piece of natural history and the other was an old master painting that was valued at at least eight&nbsp;figures.</p><p>Garrison: Wow.</p><p>James: yeah, so it was both of which were like nontrivial objects and we gave them the general rundown of: okay here’s the information we need, here’s how we need it to be packaged for us. Go away and gather this and this under these standards, here are going to be the terms. And so they went away to start gathering the information. And within a few days, both of them wrote to us very cordially of course saying that unfortunately they were going to have to back out because in the process of doing the work we asked them to&nbsp;, information came to light that cast some doubt on to the authenticity of the objects. They were, out of a sense of discretion, decided okay, we’re not going to take a chance on these so sadly, we’re going to have to bow&nbsp;out.</p><p>Obviously that’s unfortunate because, they’re two customers that we would like to have worked with, but at the same time I’d be lying if I didn’t say it was quite exciting because it means our mechanisms are actually working. It’s making people, making people really do the work where I think in some other cases, people motivated by the potential kind of commercial value of it might just be tempted to cut some quarters or phone in and be like, “Oh yeah, I’m sure it’ll be&nbsp;fine.”</p><p>It made them stop and think twice about: is this really worth it? And they decided it wasn’t. So to me, in a way that kind of proves that at least to a limited extent, the standards that we’re trying to establish are doing their&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s great. I like how within the Asset Passport creation process and how it functions — because it’s basically like a living document. It’s not a static thing. around it can change the information within it can change, but there’s a cryptographically secure evidence chain of any alterations or new developments around&nbsp;it.</p><p>James: Exactly. So you can never change the records in there. You can just add on to them and amend them. And because it goes up on the blockchain, you have a nice clean kind of digital paper trail as to what information was added when, and by whom and all of that. So you can see when information was added, which from a kind of collections management standpoint is really quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>And this is a point that I talk about with my museum colleagues a lot is the use of the blockchain in this function is that kind of like records management could potentially be hugely useful for people in the museums or the kind of the antiques trade for doing their due diligence checks, which is usually an extraordinarily tedious and lengthy task because the typical rules, for museums and dealers and auction houses at any, anytime an object comes into their possession, even if for museums, it’s a loan. So it’s not even a new acquisition. The receiving body is required to do a due diligence check, which is basically to track the thing’s provenance from now as far back as humanly possible, ideally to the things creation. Which obviously for super old objects is just a nonstarter, but it’s to go back as far as we have reasonable records to&nbsp;go.</p><p>And that process, even if it’s well understood, even if these are very high-profile objects, that process has to be repeated in some way shape or form every single time this object changes hands. Just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s the bane of curators. Just to do this&nbsp;task.</p><p>So the possibility of having an objects provenance record to date securely stored somewhere like a blockchain means that for due diligence checks, you could simply produce the evidence of the existence of that record on the blockchain up to a certain date, along with the warranties or the vouchers that it’s accurate and well-documented information. So at that point, the remainder of the due diligence check is just filling in any potential gap from then to now, which makes the job significantly easier. So usually when I tell my colleagues about this, their eyes start to grow very large and excited cause it would really be quite a huge improvement to what is otherwise at the moment a very tiring&nbsp;task.</p> ASSET PASSPORTS BRING COMPOSABILITY TO TRADE [00:20:47] <p>Beyond just the kind of the selling of objects, the passporting technology and the use of the blockchain for object records management has so many wide wider implications that would be really useful just in the field in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Garrison: And something that I find really interesting is how the asset passport it’s not a singular thing. There’s many different facets to it. But the way you’re able to kind of program value flows around an object as well as social interaction. So like the social protocols around certification and trade and vaulting all this stuff, has a nexus from which it operates. To kind of dig into things you can build on top of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We covered one: there’s the more decentralized version of expert certification you mentioned earlier. One phrase that’s come up to describe that is a Trust Communities, which to people who are familiar with blockchain and some blockchain concepts. You can think of it as like a mini DAO but it’s a mini DAO around certifying the authenticity of an object over So it’d be really interesting to see how that kind of evolves. And the use cases that surround&nbsp;that.</p> TOKENIZING CULTURAL ARTIFACTS [00:22:01] <p>And then there’s another thing that’s really important to mention is the tokenization. You also mentioned that briefly. Could you describe how an object, once an Asset Passport has been generated, how does it become tokenized? How does it become an NFT that you can see on a marketplace?</p><p>James: Sure, Sure. A bit of history first: the original incarnation, if you will, of Mattereum, the Asset Passport was essentially the standalone creation. We were aware of the existence of obviously of tokenization and another things that were kicking around in the ecosystem at the time but our plan at that point was to allow the Asset Passport to become this base foundation layer that really just nails down what an underlying object is. And then people could then take that and do all sorts of other clever stuff on top of that. And they could do the tokenization, securitization and everything, having a lot more solid confidence and understanding as to what the underlying object beneath all of that actually&nbsp;was.</p><p>So originally our plan was to leave all that other clever stuff to other people and we would just provide that nice solid foundation underlayer. And it’s only been more recently that we’ve taken another look at the notion of the NFT and thought about the possibilities that it could have being made a slightly more integral part of the process. So that’s in the kind of, I guess you’d call it the MK II version of the Asset Passport, where it is now a more integrated part of the process rather than this extra things that aside. Because we’re dealing with actual, real physical objects, as opposed to a kind of digital objects, which most of the NFTs that people are hearing about that are all the rage at the moment, it’s mainly kind of digital property that’s being represented by these things. For us, the underlying properties, actual, tangible, physical objects, we took a slightly different approach to conceiving what the NFT is and how it functions. The easiest way I tend to explain it is, for us an NFT functions as kind of something like a cross between a warehouse receipt and a vault key, if you&nbsp;will.</p><p>As you said, first, we create the Asset Passport for the object, it’s complete, comprehensive definition of what the thing is in all respects. So once we have that foundational layer, then we create, we mint the NFT which is paired to that object. And the fact that act has been done becomes yet another warranty in the passport. So there’s a whole separate warranty about the NFT creation saying a unique non fungible token has been created that is paired to this object, and only this object, and we have all the details about the NFT and the mechanisms that we’ve designed in order to verify that this entity corresponds to exactly this object and vice versa. So that’s all into that warranty. And then, one of our requirements is that in order for that NFT to be live, that is, to be able to be sold and transferred, what have you. The object itself has to actually be out of circulation. It has to be securely vaulted in a neutral suitably secure facility.</p><p>So for a lot of the objects that we’re dealing with this tends to be things like specialized art storage warehouses of which there are many around the world that fulfill this service. These same places will house other types of objects: wine, luxury goods, pretty much anything within reason of certain exceptions, of course. And there’s loads of different places that provide that service for different classes of objects. Once we have evidence from the object’s owner that the object has been securely vaulted essentially out of their immediate custody, then we activate the NFT. And the reason we do that is it in a way it’s just as much for their kind of protection and reduction of risk as it is for the potential buyers, because what it takes off the table is any possibilities of either side either accusing or being accused of trying to pull a bait and switch saying, this isn’t the object that it’s supposed to be, that was delivered to me. Or reduces any accusations of NFT owners saying, “I went to try to claim the actual object and the owner refused to give it to me.” And all these potential headaches that could come from redeeming a digital item in order to take possession of a physical&nbsp;item.</p><p>While the NFT is out in the world, being sold or transferred, the object itself is safely stored somewhere that greatly reduces if not eliminates the possibility of the owner trying to pull a fast one at the last minute. So once somebody purchases that NFT, what that entitles them to most of the time — because the advantages, because the NFT business is such a new thing we have the ability to basically customize what the terms of the NFT are to whatever people want which is quite nice. But generally speaking, our default is that a possession of the NFT entitles that person to take physical custody of the object if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>So the NFT owner has two things that they can do with the NFT. They can continue to sell on the NFT which is obviously more liquid than trying to sell the physical object. So it can pass around as many hands on various auction sites. Basically it can travel at the speed of the internet through as many hands as you can imagine. Until at one point, somebody who has the thing decides that they actually want the physical object. At which point they redeem the NFT, at which point it is frozen and rendered unable to be transferred around.</p><p>And then that person can either walk up to wherever it’s being stored and pick it up in person or arrange to have it delivered or what have you. So they take control of the object. You can think of it as a one in one out scenario where, if you imagine this dichotomy between the object and its corresponding NFT, whenever one of them is out in the world, the other one is safely stored away or rendered dormant. So then later down the line, if our person who has picked up their object decides that they want to sell the NFT again, they simply repeat the exact same process. They vault the object, notify us that it has been done so, at which point we then can reactivate the NFT and the whole process can repeat itself&nbsp;again.</p><p>And that can go back and forth for the entire life of the&nbsp;object.</p> FROM STATIC INVENTORIES TO LIQUID MARKETS [00:28:36] <p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s great. And it also seems like there’s a, a pretty good value proposition here for museums and galleries um, to Turn like they’re illiquid inventory and stock, and actually be able to create a market for&nbsp;it.</p><p>James: Yeah, I’ve been hearing kind of early noises about this from some of the big museums. Especially with the pandemic, a lot of museums are quite in dire straits in terms of funding and stuff. So they’re all looking for ways to try to replenish their coffers. And I have heard that there are some that are trying to dip their toes into the NFT pool to see what kind of possibilities could exist. And so there are some who are essentially selling either individual one-off or kind of small batch, limited edition runs of NFTs that are somehow tied to say a very prominent work of art. And obviously it doesn’t grant the NFT owner the ability to take ownership of the work of art, but it grants them kind of certain rights to say reproduce images of it or&nbsp;display.</p><p>In other ways it almost acts as basically a kind of sexy digital, new version of the kind of patronage system where they become a better factor towards the well-being of that work of art. And perhaps they’re recognized somewhere as a result of that. And as a result of all that being tied to an NFT, that person has the ability to sell on that benefit package much more easily than if say they were a trustee or, a normal kind of donor to a museum. So Yeah. There’s a lot of exploration being done apart from just NFT equals you being able to take possession of the object as far as some of the other kind of rights and benefits that can be conferred that places like museums are looking into. So yeah, there’s a universe of possibilities that this could be of immense benefit to the industry.</p> LAUNCH OF THREE CULTURAL/HISTORICAL ARTIFACT NFTS [00:30:30] <p>Garrison: Coming up here as soon, Mattereum is launching an NFT collection. Three very distinctive and diverse artifacts. Could you go into detail about&nbsp;that?</p><p>James: Yes. Yes. Everyone has those moments when you know even if you enjoy your job, everyone has those tasks that are given you as part of work where you get to really just truly play. And this was that for me is essentially Vinay gave me a very generous budget and told me to go shopping. He says, “James, you know the art and antiques market, you have a, decent tastes and decent kind of breadth of knowledge of different things. Here’s a generous chunk of money. Go and acquire three cool objects for the company for us to passport and use as Guinea pigs for you know, applying the Asset Passport to this&nbsp;sector.</p><p>I get to go on a shopping spree and it was marvelous. And I was quite happy with the objects that I came across. So as you say, there were three&nbsp;objects.</p><p>One of them is a limited edition. I believe this one is number three of a run of 20 etching signed and numbered by none other than Salvador Dali, very famous modern&nbsp;artist.</p><p>Another was a bronze statuette of the Tibetan Buddhist wrathful deity Acala. That one was dating from we reckon the turn of the 19th century, early 20th century. So it was a really spectacular piece of this wrathful Buddhist deity. I’m sure there’ll be pictures available so you can take a closer look at it yourself, or indeed you can see the Asset Passports when they&nbsp;launch.</p><p>And then the third one, which I think has everybody quite excited, was a stone hand axe. Like a prehistoric flint chipped axe that’s meant to be grasped in the hand and is used as a basic tool that was found in an excavation I believe sometime in the early 20th century if memory serves in France, in Southern France that is dated to roughly we reckon somewhere between 350 and 500,000 years old. And it’s a truly spectacular piece. It’s an amazing condition. The workmanship is truly impressive. And these things came to my house before they were brought off, sent off to art storage. So I get the chance to do like a proper inspection and to hold them myself. And that was the one that really kind of made my hair stand up on end, like actually holding this tool. That’s, you know, some of our earliest hominid ancestors and someone had made this thing almost half a million years ago in France. It’s quite a spectacular piece.</p><p>Garrison: It’s also crazy to think about. A weird way to frame it, but like the atoms that make up that hand axe are older than probably any other material that surrounds you, whether it’s apartment or the neighborhood, it’s just this object from a very long, distant past that’s, impossible for us to even, you know, conceptualize like kind of timeline.</p><p>James: And when you stop and think about it, when you have something that’s like capital O old like that, and you hold that in your hands and you think, Okay, on the one hand, half a million years is a long time, but when you also stop and think about it, the fact that we’ve gone from a half a million years to building rather impressive but far from primitive stone tools, to space travel, being fairly routine, computers in our pockets that are millions of times more powerful than than anything even our parents generations could have imagined growing up. Going from there to where we are now in the space of half a million years from the wider picture of things, that’s the blink of an&nbsp;eye.</p><p>That’s a rather impressive to think. And I’m very fond of saying to Vinay that I find this whole process quite cool that we’re taking what is arguably one of mankind’s oldest and earliest kind of tools and we’re onboarding it and presenting it to the world through the medium of one of mankind’s most current kind of cutting edge tools and technologies.</p><p>So in a way it’s like book-ending human ingenuity really.</p> ARTIFACT NFTS IN THE MARKETPLACE [00:34:51] <p>Garrison: How will people interact with these NFTs and these Asset Passports, like in practice once these are launched and active. How do people actually interface with&nbsp;them?</p><p>James: Most people will be familiar with where you go to find listings for NFT sales and auctions. Most notably places like OpenSea, for example. So the NFTs themselves will be listed in the normal marketplaces for these things. And once you go to the listing for these objects, in the description you will find explanation to the fact that this object has also been issued with a Mattereum Asset Passport, and it provides a link where you can go and visit the passport.</p><p>And that’s actually an important part of ensuring the security of making sure that the passport is forever tied to that specific NFT and vice versa. So we use what we call a bi-directional link mechanism. As I said, if you go to the NFT listing for the object, you will find the link to that object’s Asset Passport. So you click on it from there and it’ll take you to the Asset Passport and in the Asset Passport, in addition to as I mentioned before the warranty asserting that the NFT has been created and here’s the terms of the NFT and all of that, there is also a link in the passport, which takes you to where the NFT is listed. So a way of verifying that you’re not dealing with either a fraudulent NFT or a fraudulent Asset Passport is to go through that whole loop. So say from the NFT listing, you click on the link to the passport, you go to the passport and then from the passport, you click on the link to go to the NFT listing. It should take you back right where you started. And we do that so it prevents the ability to try to slot a shoddy NFT or passport in between that process, because it’s baked in from the start. Both are created at the same time at the point of launch. So that’s the way we verify that this NFT is inextricably tied to this Asset Passport and its&nbsp;object.</p> THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATING WITHIN THE MATERIAL WORLD [00:36:55] <p>Garrison: Yeah so we’re coming up on the hour here. I think we covered quite a bit. I think this is a very exciting use case for NFTs and a lot of people focus on like the digital art side things, and there’s some, you know, multimedia with music and stuff that are quite interesting, but having something that deals with the material world which is something this show is very, particularly focused on. New ways to kind of program value flows and structure social interaction — these protocols around goods and services, to secure trade and make it more efficient, more accessible, more ethical production and consumption and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>All of this stuff arises from this kind of, infrastructure that’s being laid out. So it’s really exciting.</p><p>James: Yeah, I agree because, I maybe I’m biased having spent my life working with tangible things, but I have the sense that we have this new this new technology, which has immense potential, but I think the danger is if we fall into the trap of allowing this technology to allow us to become even more, I suppose ethereal in our lives than we already&nbsp;are.</p><p>There’s so much of our lives that already that’s intangible and not basically just exists as bits in a computer. And of course that has its uses, but it’s also, to me, it’s a point of weakness at times, because it means that, when you come right down to it, it’s&nbsp;air.</p><p>So to me, I think it’s while it’s important that we use the technologies in those areas in order to improve it, I think it’s also important that we use this in order to perhaps better ground ourselves in our physical world. Because, until we start uploading our brains to computers, we exist in Terra firma and we better get used to&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so I think using it in order to better our relationship with the physical world and the physical things around us is I think an equally important use for this than just making things more digital and more ephemeral. I think that’s a side of things that until recently has become, has been underappreciated. One of the reasons that I’ve felt so drawn to Mattereum is Mattereum seems to recognize that’s just as important. So it’s a banner that I’m prepared to&nbsp;carry.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, I agree. Designer David Rudnick calls this Digital Prime versus Physical Prime thinking, and in crypto is largely Digital Prime mentality. It’s all about digital value around these different assets, but, you know, projects such as, you know, Mattereum and others that are emerging are trying to leverage this technology to improve, you know, physical conditions and secure physical trade of goods, which is the vast majority of all the value on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>James: It’s the single most human activity and it’s not going anywhere anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Garrison: yeah, it’s a really exciting to see what people build moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>James: Thanks. Yes, definitely.</p><p>Garrison: All right. It was a pleasure to have you on the&nbsp;show.</p><p>James: Oh, it was a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me Garrison.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. And I’ll definitely poke you to come back on down the line your, yeah. Your perspective is very unique um in terms of your uh, in terms of your background.</p><p>James: The token humanities refugee in a sea of tech and crypto people.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. Fantastic.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-3-161aaa2b1937">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.3:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

All music courtesy of Zoe&nbsp;Keating.</p><p>For this episode, I am joined by Michael Parenti, also known as Exiled Surfer. He’s the comms strategist at Mattereum and core contributor to the Bitcoin DeFi Platform, Sovryn.</p><p>I’m also joined by Penguin Heilman, founder of Defiant Pixel Society and Never Touch Fiat Again, an art project that uses Mattereum Passports to bind gold bars to digital art NFTs. In this conversation, we cover a wide variety of topics, from the value of gold to the prospect of bringing gold and other commodities to the blockhain. We then get into the form, function, and philosophy of the NTFA project. As well as the transformative potential of NFTs and blockchain in the art&nbsp;world.</p> On the Value of This Yellow Rock [00:00:56] <p>Once upon a time, there was an explosion. Two neutron rich stars collided in a death-spiral dance, creating a supernova. Within the cosmic dust clouds and gamma ray burst from the celestial explosion were neutron rich heavy elements, including an elemental dust. Shiny, yellowish in color, and malleable.</p><p>In time this dust found its way across the universe and was woven into the masses of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. On one particular planet this shiny yellow rock caught the eye of a curious and crafty homosapien, thus beginning our strange relationship and affinity to&nbsp;gold.</p><p>For millennia cultures across the world have ascribed value to gold in numerous forms: from collectibles fashioned into jewelry, to physical coinage, to global reserve currency,to inflation hedge in turbulent economic times. Before the abandonment of the gold standard gold reserves held by central banks formed a much larger portion of the monetary base, the backing value of issued fiat currency. Since then the proportion of fiat issue to gold with held collectively by banks has risen dramatically.</p><p>In December 2019, the amount of money issued above the value of gold held in reserve reached $25.25 trillion.</p><p>So I just wanted to set the stage. Short history of gold from, big bang to the present day. It’s a very interesting subject that you can tie into global monetary policy to inflation hedge in a pandemic.</p><p>Penguin: So if I may kind kick off the question about some of the important use of gold aside from what you stated the most obvious to me as a computer user is the use of gold in electronics. And the fact that we’ve got 48 billion connected devices this year, and each one of them has about $2 worth of gold in it. Gold is so critical for making all the electronics for the lack of corrosion, the way that the efficiency of the conductors is critical to pretty much every connected device, as well as any regular device, even without a connection. So TVs, smartphones, even the ATM machine that you get paper currency out of has a dependency on gold and gold is also extremely used in the industrial space. So every space rocket that we send out there, every space mission is dependent upon gold for aerospace parts. So aside from just looking pretty, the material properties of gold have limitless applications to our everyday lives that we can’t live without. So, it’s understandable that it was such a critical part of monetary policy, even before we understood how to use it fully, because we can’t create more of&nbsp;it.</p><p>The uses are pretty much limitless and it’s really hard to replicate. So those are some of the key reasons it’s been valued since we started digging it out of the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah I think it’s fascinating that it has so many uses or that we’ve found so many uses for it over literally thousands of years. That kind of scale and variety is something that not many elements actually&nbsp;share.</p><p>The Bretton Woods Agreement was an attempt to establish like the first global monetary system. It was post-WWII, the idea was that the USD would be the main currency establishing foreign exchange rates. The idea at the time was that the USD was backed by gold and that was kind of part of the negotiation around that. And then in seventies you have this kind of deviation from the gold standard, and this might move away from a more asset backed economy to a debt based one. So I was wondering if you Michael or you Penguin have any thoughts on that kind of shift in terms of it being kind of like a very fundamental seismic change in the systems that inform our lives&nbsp;today.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: I don’t think that gold is ever going to go away as a means of exchange or a store of value because of all the properties that Penguin listed first of all. But I think the use case can, find alternatives with technological solutions like we see with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>I don’t think that Bitcoin will ever replace gold as well. Because of all of the properties that, that we’re familiar with: the scarcity of supply, the deflationary aspect of it. We can’t really say that gold is deflationary. It’s really an economic question of how much is being, mined which is also controlled by cartels and eventually we’ll get off the planet and there’ll be other gold. It’s not the only gold in the universe. So I think that both have their use cases. Monetary value is like any other value, it’s a consensus, right? So it’s a shared, it’s a shared consensus. It’s a shared illusion. And I think what’s interesting about cryptocurrency now is you can “Choose Your Illusion” basically to quote the Guns ‘n Roses album so to speak, right. Not use your illusion, but choose your illusion. So the question becomes what things are gold good for, what things cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin good for? What are the specific use cases for&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think that gold will always have a cultural relevance across the planet. We’re experiencing the building of a new social consensus which has been enabled by electronic technology. What is really interesting about that is that ability to mine Bitcoin, or to create a hash or call a hash or do a Bitcoin transaction also depends on gold, so to speak&nbsp;,because this it’s a technological solution that depends on computers which use&nbsp;gold.</p> Asset vs. Debt-based Economy | Challenge of Deflationary Financial Systems [00:07:54] <p>Penguin: I also want to kind of touch on the asset versus debt-based relationship&nbsp;, basically a trust-based economy versus an asset based economy provides. So with a asset-based economy, it’s naturally deflationary, right? We’re not making more gold. We can dig more of the gold, but there’s a finite amount. And the amount in circulation is dependent upon how much people have done, but things like a debt based economy is entirely based on trust. So the World Bank prints money. They say, this is how much money we think you can reliably pay back. And the payback mechanism is also based on trust. You get a credit rating based on how reliably you’re able to maintain your&nbsp;debt.</p><p>So if we’re talking about Ethereum and crypto and Bitcoin, it’s really critical for it to be trustless and to not have someone telling you the value of it because everyone needs to use it. Everyone needs to establish that marking and basis for what they say is the asset value. So where something like gold, it’s a hard asset. You actually have to transfer a physical item or rights to that physical item. It’s not simply changing bits on a spreadsheet. Hard assets are unique in the fact that they’re non fungible a lot of times. Like this specific gold bar, when we’re pairing it with art, is going to be like this specific gold bar. It’s weight is not reflective, but they are still fungible in the fact that a hundred grams of gold is a hundred grams of&nbsp;gold.</p><p>And so we’ll have that kind of standard for value by using gold versus if I give you a hundred dollars in 10 years there’s no telling how much that a hundred dollars is going to be due to inflation.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So I think that brings up an interesting point when we’re talking about asset-based or debt-based economics. Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary currency, a deflationary asset. And this puts it in direct contrast with inflation in terms of borrowing.</p><p>So in addition to working at Mattereum I work together with a decentralized finance platform called Sovryn. And we were talking yesterday about how it is that we could increase people borrowing Bitcoin in a bull market because people like to borrow Bitcoin in a bear market because it’s going to go up. But they don’t really want to borrow it in a bull market because you might have to pay back more and nobody’s really solved this I think yet in the crypto space: how it is borrowing a deflationary asset is going to work. The models aren’t there yet. I guess there’ll be some sort of derivative token that you’re borrowing that’s backed by your Bitcoin would probably be the most logical solution. So kind of things that like BlockFi does. They’re essentially paying yield on loans based on stable coins, centralized stable&nbsp;coins.</p><p>So, so that’s sort of like a stop gap solution. And, if you, I guess we’re talking about how to get to Bitcoin backed stable coins to solve that issue, but I don’t know. What do you think Penguin? How do you think that, that borrowing can work with a deflationary base money standard?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. So when we get into really complex things like that, there’s a lot of kind of moving parts, especially with like arbitrage opportunities in different platforms, having the same kind of assets. So we kind of see that the market naturally find an equilibrium and that arbitrage is like really critical to keeping everything fair and balanced.</p><p>So, when prices go up, people will see the gap in other places and want to buy there because they know it’s cheaper here. It should actually be this price. And so as that programmatic balance gets established, I think things like deflationary tokens they increase over time. It’s not a great idea to borrow a deflationary token when you could use your holding in the deflationary token to borrow a stable token. And so in that way, usually I will peg my holdings and then you can borrow based on if you think that the assets are going to go up and down. There’s a whole bunch of different DeFi tools for things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: I think one of the most interesting things that I’m seeing in the DeFi space is that people are borrowing now just enough on their crypto holdings to be in debt so that they have no capital gains to be paid, which is a very, savvy approach and pretty much how it is that oligarchic money continues to exist through generations is that we have this debt-based economy and debt-based taxation. We’re not doing something like Tobin taxation, which would be much more logical, just a micro taxation on every transaction, whatever currency or asset it was. At the point of transaction there’s still this, intention that people’s gains should be taxed. And that’s also part of the roots of Bitcoin, the libertarian ideals of anti taxation and things like that. So I think these sort of developments in the space really interesting.</p> Bringing Gold and Other Commodities to Crypto Using Real-World Asset NFTs [00:13:37] <p>But what we should probably be talking about Penguin you and I, is we started the dialogue I guess at the beginning of the year on how it is that we could use Mattereum’s Asset Passport technology to, enable the frictionless movement of gold together with Lohko. And now that’s come to fruition. But let’s talk about the essential underpinnings of why it is that we’re attempting to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>And what’s the logic behind&nbsp;it?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. So, I mean real-world assets being governed and managed by smart contracts is the main thing that kind of brought us together and is like an application for owning data. So Bitcoin itself has a limited use case. We’re using like Ethereum for a lot of our tokenization and rights managements, specifically using the Mattereum Passports to help control the warranty and claims process and kind of all the legal process is established in the passports, which do the legal paperwork for saying: this NFT and this wallet are now the owner of these real world assets. So by using the technology and ownership that cryptography and like Bitcoin kind of revolutionized, we’re now taking that ownership to the Ethereum layer and like wrapping Bitcoin and we can then purchase usable ownable tokens that we’re pairing with gold in this instance.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Yeah. And so the reason behind that Garrison is, we can go back to the “all boats rise and fall with the price of Bitcoin in crypto,” right? So Bitcoin is supposedly an uncorrelated asset to the degree to which that’s actually true or not has a lot to do with perception of Bitcoin at any given&nbsp;moment.</p><p>But essentially Bitcoin has also its own oligarchy of people that got in from the beginning, who got it free on Bitcoin faucets or got it when it was at 12 cents or 32 cents and were foresightful enough to hold it for the years where they have 30%, 30000% gains and whatever. So we call them whales in the space, people who have large holdings and Ethereum was the first ICO actually in the cryptocurrency space, it was launched on&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>You had to be able to use Bitcoin and have Bitcoin to buy into the genesis sale of Ethereum. So all of the early Ethereum people were essentially Bitcoiners. Some outsiders came in and outside investment as well, made their way through Bitcoin and able to get Ethereum.. But still everything rises and falls on Bitcoin’s performance and how it is that whales and large holders are arbitraging in the market against stable coins or against Ethereum or other assets as well. I mean, there’s numerous ones now that are available for people to, to, play the big casino with. So the logic behind bringing gold into the system is pairing the two hardest money assets that we have right now on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>So solid physical gold, Bitcoin with its capped supply, and it’s hash rate from proof of work security securing the network. It’s taking those two use cases and qualities of money and pairing them together on a second layer solution which is the metadata that’s tied to an NFT that resides on the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>And so it’s a very hybrid construction. You have the hard money of gold. You have the hard money qualities of Bitcoin, and you have the programmable money layer of Ethereum. And you bring all those three things together. And what you’re doing is you’re creating a frictionless, permissionless, borderless ability to arbitrage in and out of fiat, into crypto and between&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>And so it brings essentially gold as a commodity into the crypto space. And hopefully over time reduces volatility is essentially the argument. If the only commodity in crypto is Bitcoin, then of course, there’s these fluctuations. But if you bring gold into the equation, then we’re reducing volatility of cryptocurrency and making it something that’s more, more attractive to&nbsp;people.</p><p>Further on, Mattereum Asset Passports can obviously be used for real estate. So this is probably the most important commodity to bring into the ecosystem into the sector, is real estate and gold. If that makes any&nbsp;sense.</p><p>Garrison: Absolutely. The physical asset economy is like trillions of dollars. It’s absolutely massive. currently dwarfs the market cap of crypto as a whole quite a bit. So like the prospect of being able to bridge those two, we’re able to bring, real estate on chain, gold on chain. The way that will kind of manifest in DeFi maturing DeFi, bringing more stability. It will be amazing to see that happen. And I think at this point, and especially with the work that Mattereum is doing and the growth of the DeFi space at large. It’s kind of inevitable that these two worlds are going to just become enmeshed.</p><p>Penguin: think one of the other key takeaways is that what’s the utility of your NFT? Is it purely aesthetic value? Is it purely based on the reputation of the artist? And so we are kind of combining those two because we’re using the hard real assets and also the aesthetic value of the art. So that, when you buy the art say your favorite artists that you really like gets canceled in the future. At the very least you’ve got the gold value backing his NFT and there is an actual hard utility for the NFT that you bought aside from just you like the picture that’s on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Well, I think it goes even further than that. I mean, if you want to talk about being on the cutting edge. With Never Touch Fiat Again as a meme, as a message for people to disconnect from the current financial paradigm. These first NFTs, regardless of how good or how bad the art is, or how known or how unknown the artist is, they are gonna have just by virtue of being the first one are going to have a value in the future. They’re a scarce asset, the first 10 gold backed NFTs tied with art and it’s interesting watching nobody really ever had a clue what is going to be the first use case post currency for blockchain tech and all of a sudden in the last year,&nbsp;boom.</p><p>I mean, NFTs have been around since the beginning of Bitcoin Bitcoin can even be called the first NFT in a certain way. We had Mastercoin, color coins, Namecoin was probably the first actual NFT in the space. But here it is that we have this whole economy now, which is disintermediated. Rights organizations, right? No copyright holders has disintermediated distribution networks disintermediated galleries. All of these things that are happening around NFTs are happening because of artists finding a new way to monetize their creative stream on a peer-to-peer level where there’s always been a a mediator between&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so if you take that like a step forward, gold is probably the most anonymous currency on the planet. Gold sellers, the gold network have, maintained the ability to just to buy and sell gold without any idea. You don’t need an ID. If I go into a jewelry shop here in Vienna, they don’t ask me for an ID to buy gold or to give me cash back for the gold. There’s no KYC on that. And so the interesting aspect of the Never Touch Fiat Again implementation of gold backed NFTs is it enables you to move in and out of fiat currency in the most anonymous way possible globally. Very interesting in terms of remittances, right?</p><p>Garrison: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So if I want to send a Gold NFT to a guy in Morocco, right. And makes the claim, gets the gold, and goes and goes into a shop, in the bizaar and gets his fiat money in whatever currency is local and the same way in the other direction. So it’s a very, very interesting and very legal, so maliciously compliant a way of moving in and out of fiat and crypto via gold is a phenomenal advance in the space, I&nbsp;think.</p> E-gold: A Chapter in the History of (Gold-Backed) Digital Currency [00:22:40] <p>Garrison: Yeah. The Gold NFT is the latest iteration of trying to digitize gold ownership, access to gold online. People have been trying to crack the code on this for decades&nbsp;now.</p><p>One interesting case study is E-gold in the late nineties. Anonymous digital currency backed by gold, denominated in grams of gold, that was secured and various faults around the world. And it worked. In fact, Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta, his first time transacting in a digital currency or quote unquote cryptocurrency before Bitcoin was E-gold. And some of the technology used for that, uh, the contracting around E-gold was built by Ian Grigg, inventor of the Ricardian Contract, which is the mechanism for how you basically bind a digital asset or a contract with a piece of software and have it to where there’s dispute resolution and all the legal warranties were kind of coupled together.</p><p>But it’s interesting is that the frameworks that were used in creating that between E-gold itself and the contracting system that Ian Grigg built on top of it is now being kind of revitalized in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency and smart contracts and Ricardian smart contracts. We’re in the just most recent chapter of the interesting story in the history of cryptocurrency.</p> Crypto: Civilizational History in the Making [00:24:15] <p>Michael&nbsp;: So, I guess the hardest thing for me in being involved in the space from the beginning and having been on the mailing lists where bitcoin was being discussed and E-gold and Liberty Dollars, all of these different things being involved with cryptographers. And then being in the day-to-day pace of working in crypto, which is like rocket speed, you know, is everything here just moves so&nbsp;fast.</p><p>There’s this churn of new people coming into the space. Who’re getting interested in the narrative, getting interested in the tech are starting to wrap their heads around the ideas and the concepts is having to go back then always and be at. So wherever the cutting edge is where we’re at, right is always have to go back and say, Hey, this is 30 years of history. Bitcoin is now 12, 12 years old. And it came out of distinctly the experience with BitGold. It was a response to that. And all of the things, other things that were happening, Adam back writing Hashcash. All of these things being accepted now at the base layer of Bitcoin and the base layer of Ethereum with programmable money has a very long history of trial and error and adversarial thinking.</p><p>And it is the most secure network to date for state level threat. I don’t see how, if, when, or where Bitcoin will ever not exist or any of the other chains that have been started. Once they’ve been started, there’ll be some guy in a garage with a 20 19 mining rig who will keep&nbsp;??? Coin alive by running it on three computers, just the way that people keep old cars&nbsp;alive.</p><p>We’re just at the beginning of a civilizational history taking place and developing around money that is as old as, the original reference, the Rai stones themselves. It’s just the current implementation of protecting your assets or securing your assets or having some efficient way of determining what value is. Right now, we live in an adversarial environment between the state and the individual. I don’t anticipate that society is going to stay this way. Civilization is a wave that goes up and down. And I do think that we’ll come back to an era where the individual has more rights and the state has less rights and corporations have less&nbsp;rights.</p><p>I think we’ll reach a better equilibrium and the hope of hardcore, OG Bitcoiners and cryptographers is that the state and institutions co-opt what Bitcoin is and use it to make society fairer. Not co-opt it the way that entities like Coinbase do with seeking regulatory approval to be a custodian in between people and their assets in the same surveillance capitalism model that we’ve had for the last 50&nbsp;years.</p><p>Those are the true enemies, the ones that are looking for using the power of the state to enforce a custodial relationship, rent-seeking relationship between people and their assets. I don’t think that’s always going to be the case though. And my hope is that all the things that we’re working on and now with gold, right. Pairing these things together in these models are gonna empower people and eventually power, empower the state again to serve the the interest of people more than they have been in the last half&nbsp;century.</p><p>Garrison: With blockchain we have the first credibly neutral system for value transfer. And it can allow a combination of institutional transparency, but also maintaining individual privacy.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: That’s the old, that’s the old cypherpunk value. Right? So, so transparency for institutions, privacy for individuals. And it’s actually exactly the opposite right now. Institutions have privacy and individuals are forced to be transparent. If you want to talk about a flippening, that should be the true flippening. Not between Bitcoin or Ethereum or between Tron and Ethereum or between, whatever flavor of anything.</p><p>The true flipping should be the crypto approach as a whole versus thefiat by decree approach. Right? So I like to talk about fiat not only as a currency, but as the institutional structures that we’re living under. The governance structures, thereby decree, you’re born at a certain place on the planet and you have no choice as to what it is are the rules that govern the rest of your life. If you stay in that country. It’s by decree, it’s not by&nbsp;choice.</p><p>So non fungible systems, let’s talk about the DAOs as well, right? That have governance tokens that don’t necessarily have a value. These are consensus rule sets that people can, that people opt into. It’s by choice. And this is probably the most exciting thing for me, aside from the permissionless of it is, as we started the top of the episode, it’s “Choose Your Illusion,”, right? Which set of consensus rules do I want to live under? And whether they have a real world asset that’s tied to them as they are with the the Mattereum Passports or not, they’re just completely virtual representation, I have the choice and everybody else has a choice. It’s pretty phenomenal development actually.</p><p>Penguin: Definitely.</p> Programmable Value with NFTs [00:29:36] <p>Garrison: So it’s something that we kind of, we mentioned briefly, I’d like to kind of dig into it a little bit more, this notion of kind of creating like a hybrid asset. If I had talked to an artist friend of mine about like the prospect of minting a gold backed NFT attached to his or her art, that’s a lot of new, that’s a lot of new concept and language kind of being thrown at them if they’re not too savvy with crypto or with&nbsp;gold.</p><p>So I was wondering, what would be the process of kind of binding an actual, gold bullion with a digital art. What that would look like in practice.</p><p>Penguin: So, I’ve been dealing a lot with like mainstream artists and onboarding them into crypto outside of this particular gold project that I’m doing now. And one of the big things that I’ve found is that NFTs are like an additional paint brush and they give an artist a new way to express themselves and explore ways that they can add value to their creations, and adding something like hard asset to back your creations, as well as further their additional tools that we provide to creators to provide value and understand kind of how their paint brushes and tools are working. What does it mean to own data and what kind of data can you provide in that ownership? How can you manage your&nbsp;rights?</p><p>And so we see a lot of that, right? People assume that they might have commercial rights over it. And it’s up to the artist to define what is the rights guaranteed by their works. And I think this is an evolution of exploring what’s possible with digital ownership.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So, so this provenance. Not only the provenance, but the programmable aspect of the smart contracts, the Ricardian contracts that it offers people is — so I like to use the example: I sold the first tweet about Ethereum on a platform called Cent for $21,000. And the way that Cent is programmed is that I get a percentage of every successive sale every time that NFT gets sold in the future, I get 10%. And so let’s say it gets sold for $210, I’m going to get another 21 and let’s say it gets sold then by the next guy for half a mil, I’m going to get another 50 grand. Every time I’m going to get 10%. We haven’t even seen the beginning of granularity of all the proofs of concepts that are out&nbsp;there.</p><p>You have streaming payments, you have rights splits. All of the different ways that people have split income, either for shares in a company. You can look at each individual NFT if it’s started programmatically as literally like as if it was a company. And we’re exploring this as well at Mattereum, is that each individual object that’s tied to a passport can be essentially a corporate entity that at its inception has ways to fractionalize its ownership and the income that’s generated from it. And then to have the automated arbitration system and warranties. The future is very exciting. We haven’t even beginning to see the use cases. We’re just exploring them and doing MVPs at the&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Kind of exciting stuff actually.</p><p>Penguin: Very exciting.</p><p>Garrison: Is there anything else you guys want to cover? Is there kind of coming up on the hour&nbsp;here?</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Unfortunately I have another call right at the top of the hour. I could just drop off and you guys just continue recording.</p><p>Penguin: Thank you so much, Michael. I think your input has been critical to the podcast. So thank you and your help along with the project in general. So I really appreciate your perspective and everything. So thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Well. Proof is in the pudding. Right. Okay. So yeah, you guys just go ahead and continue on. I’m going to drop off and get over to the other&nbsp;calls.</p><p>Penguin: Great. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;:&nbsp;Okay.</p> The Never Touch Fiat Again Project by Defiant Pixel Society [00:33:47] <p>Penguin: So I’d like to specifically talk a little bit about the NTFA and Never Touch Fiat Again project if that’s all right. And kind of describe some of the ideas behind some of the art and also kind of where it’s coming from. Obviously this is more about the art side of things than the gold side of things, but I think that would be a really cool side of the story to tell as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>Penguin: So the idea behind NTFA’s art style, as we look back a far dystopian kind of view of the world, and we specifically like Idiocracy and like what happens to society? It falls down to kind of the wealth and w what, like, I see gold still being an important part of the world, even when everything’s falling&nbsp;apart.</p><p>So we use kind of be the symbology of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” a dystopian future. So our lowest denomination is actually the Piggy Bank. And so The Wall and Pink Floyd used a pink floating pig balloon. And so I also, and I’ve adopted that as like this menacing balloon that has the figure of a child’s piggybank as something that we’re all kind of like really familiar with but you know, when it’s floating over like a factory that’s producing a whole bunch of smoke. It’s got a little bit of a different context. And so we use that as like the smallest space for our gold, because, as one ounce, because essentially you break your Piggy Banksy as we call it, and you would claim your one ounce of gold. So that’s kinda like the base level value that we have in this&nbsp;one.</p><p>And then the second idea is instead of breaking their piggy bank. We have the space cowboy. So in that one it’s a guy walking around in an astronaut outfit covered in bling. He’s sitting on a rock and he’s got his gold chains and it’s well, what would a street astronaut be doing in the future? Is he protecting himself because he doesn’t want people to see his face? Is it because, he’s so baller he went to the moon and just kind of like in the future, there’s still like gonna be like this whale kind of guy, even when things fall apart. I felt that it was much more like street friendly. So even though he’s worth 50 grams of gold, he’s still a character rather than&nbsp;a</p><p>Garrison: So is this like a collection of like discrete works of art that are tokenized and they’re going to have gold backing them, like each of these things that you mentioned?</p><p>Penguin: We have specific allocated bars of gold. So the actual video and NFT will have your specific gold bar on the side with your serial number. So each one, each NFT is unique and specifically references the asset and then has the link to the Asset Passport, which has the guarantee over rights for it. So all of the data that contains: which gold, where is it stored, who owns it, how does it transfer, how do you get it out? Those are all baked into the metadata and whoever is the current owner will have paid the fees for the Mattereum Passport to update the owner. So that is how those are&nbsp;linked.</p><p>And then the top dog NFT that I have is called the Vector 777. And so that NFT specifically came from a poster that I remember as a kid growing up. And so does Vector car, as you probably do not know, was a clone of the Lamborghini Diablo from the nineties. And so use all the same parts in the same engines, but it was made by like a sister factory to Lambo. They only made 20 to 40 of them a year and Lamborghini had a big licensing disagreement with them where they didn’t want it to look exactly like a Lambo. So they had to like make a super custom version of the Lambo with all the Lambo parts handmade every year, so completely unsustainable. But, and it was a V12 engine. So I remember as a kid, I had a friend that had a poster of one of these cars and right above the headlights, they had machine guns. So it was like a super-modified one like that. And it was just like this super futuristic car, like when I was a kid and I’ve never really seen it in a poster like&nbsp;it.</p><p>So what we did with the Vector 777 was we took it an upgrade further. Instead of having machine guns above the lights, we put a Soviet rocket launcher on the back of a Vector. And so we figured, When you’re driving around with a hundred grams of gold, you need a little bit more protection.</p><p>And so actually on our website, we made a really funny, cute animation where if you press the button, it says “Click to Win.” Animated version of the Vector will drive across the screen and shoot a whole bunch of rockets, which then take out a&nbsp;city.</p><p>Garrison: Okay.</p><p>Penguin: So we had a lot of fun with kind of the art ideas and I had an amazing team that helped me so I had some famous artists graphic artists, some pixel artists, some people that were really great at videography. and we all worked together to build this project. And it was a lot of fun doing it. And w we definitely tried to reflect that fun in our art style. So each one of these NFTs that I’ve described is like a 3d spinning card. We’ve paired music with them as well. And we’ve timed the music. So there’s like a loop animation and yeah, that’s the art style and kind of idea behind the NTFA arts and the specific amounts of gold that we are offering for those&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Garrison: And where can people interact with&nbsp;these?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah, So right now we have not minted the NFTs. We are doing the final minting right now. So you can view a preview of what the NFTs would look like and the website at NTFA.io. That’s Never Touch Fiat Again dot IO. So, yeah, and we are targeting July 4th for having all the Asset Passports finalized and the minting done. So, July 4th is the official launch where we will take down the previews and add the NFTs available for purchase.</p><p>Garrison: How many are there in the collection?</p><p>Penguin: So there’s a single a 100 gram Vector. There are two 50 gram Space Cowboys, and there are four Piggy Banksies at 1 oz. Total of&nbsp;six.</p><p>Garrison: It just goes to show like the amount of like experimentation that’s happening on the NFT front right now. Cause like, taken out of context, like what we just described a lot of people would be scratching their heads. But you’re basically describing tying an art project that is also a technological project that has like some social commentary woven into it and it’s backed by gold. It’s such an interesting kind of blend of various things. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it cause like the kind of experimentation in terms of like future art projects or, how people do merchandising for their albums or their books or&nbsp;movies.</p><p>This kind of multimedia type of thing. I think that’s also tying in physical assets. It just it’s, the possibilities are.</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. Also for future releases, we’re looking to bring in other top name crypto artists. So I’ve got a whole bunch of connections in the scene. And so I I don’t want to put anyone on the spot, but we’ve got two other artists that should be releasing bars with this as well. So that ties directly into what you’re&nbsp;saying.</p><p>It’s more about the experience and the blending of the technology with the monetary policy than it is any one aspect of it. And it really is kind of like that value proposition for NFTs as well as really providing an experience to owning these tokens. So, a lot of them were kind of like fast art and for some platforms and we made sure not to do that where we’re artists, and we pretty much took as much time as we could to get them done in an effective manner. As I said, we had famous artists. So this specific set Marco, MLIBTY is his acronym, “My life is better than yours” helped out with some of the art and then the rest of the team are from Defiant Pixel Society, which is my art collective that I&nbsp;run.</p> NFTs: A Powerful Medium for Patronage and Provenance of Art [00:43:47] <p>NFTs has been a really powerful way, and even just Web3, to enable creators to get control over their community and not let major corporations or people to exploit them, because that’s the way the system&nbsp;works.</p><p>Specifically. If you consider something like an artist, traditionally an art house or a rapper — there’s so much paperwork and control that go into their works that they get such a small fraction of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, there’s a lot of gatekeeping. And so much of the value that they create is siphoned away from them because there’s so many intermediaries.</p><p>Penguin: And they’re lucky if they get any percentage of their sales and if they do, they’re not looking at over 10%, they’re looking at 1 or 2% of sales and we have the complete opposite approach in Web3. I try and give them as much money as they can. And so like Defiant Pixel Society, they keep 90% of it and 10% of it goes to the organization, that they are also part of, so they get a share of that money as well. And then that way, like anything that we do together also enhances the group. So yeah it’s completely flipping it on its head. Now the creators get all the value and there’s no one in between them and their audience. So it’s been a huge paradigm shift that really has helped compel me to make this my life&nbsp;now.</p><p>Yeah. I think even one of the bigger things that we’ve seen is that people that were mainstream artists are realizing that they can capture their secondary market as well. I think about all the bands that sold CDs, right? And then we had businesses that popped up to do secondary sales, none of those bands back, any money for&nbsp;them.</p><p>Imagine every time someone sold their CD at Amazon or Discogs, they got 10% of that sales or how much they defined their worth royalties. So we’re seeing that people that even existing creators and new creators are having revenue streams from their work that they would have otherwise missed, complete upside&nbsp;for.</p><p>When you sell your work originally, you don’t get the full value of it at the auction value because, it’s like the primary source. I can imagine like Picasso. What did he sell his works for. He’d go to a place. And he said, “I’m Picasso I’m going to paint you this thing and maybe it’ll be free. Right. But so at that time, the cost of Picasso’s work is the price of a dinner, but now you take it and the Picasso estate doesn’t get anything if you sell a Picasso, you know what I mean? And there’s even like these copyright laws that after a certain time your work’s now public domain, anyone can make your work,&nbsp;Picasso.</p><p>And in this way the original artists and the original creators will still get value. Even if it enters public domain a hundred years from now, if they’re using this NFT contract, the royalties are such that part of that sale will go to their wallet for royalties. So a hundred years later, you sell a Picasso for $100 million and 1% of that still goes to the PIcasso&nbsp;fund.</p><p>Garrison: The possibility here is being able to program value flows and social interaction around goods and services. The combination of NFTs and Asset Passports allow you to do this with gold bars or a Picasso painting or a gold bar attached to a painting. Like there’s so many kind of combinatorial possibilities there.</p><p>Penguin: Well even like going back to the provenance issue, right? Like to prove that a Picasso was made by Picasso. It’s going to take a whole bunch of experts, it’s going to take chemical analysis. It’s going to take all these things to try and disprove this is not Picasso. Picasso didn’t do this. Your paint was from the wrong age and with provenance and it being on chain, you could say no this was made by Picasso’s wallet.</p><p>Even like the Mona Lisa, right? One of the most famous pieces of that. I mean, there’s a rumor that it was destroyed by the Nazis in WWII. We don’t have any way of verifying that the Mona Lisa that we have isn’t a copy of the Mona Lisa. That this is the original one. We all assume that it is a true one because it’s the accepted understanding.</p><p>And that’s also something that isn’t something that we would have to trust with the blockchain. If she had a hardware wallet ingrained in her frame that identified this is the asset it’s in this wallet. There’s a distinct difference between having the Mona Lisa and having a knockoff. So in this way, we’ve never really had that in history: to be able to identify with certainty antiquities and place where exactly they came from, when, who made them, like the entire history of them, where did it go from here? And I think that’s one of the huge innovations that NFTs have that is not apparently obvious. People think it’s the same as downloading a picture on the internet and the picture is on the internet, but there’s a distinct owner of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a combination of provenance and patronage. The NFT itself has a programmable agreement like a contract, if you will, to be like equity splits when it’s bought and sold in the market, percentage goes back to the creator or even anyone else. Really looking forward to seeing like what, people like yourself and everyone else in the NFT community build in the years&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Penguin: Great. Yeah, Thank you for having me in this opportunity to work with Mattereum and also present my project today. Now it’s been amazing bringing the gold and NFT projects together. So I’m having a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to another amazing&nbsp;year.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Take care&nbsp;Penguin.</p><p>Penguin: Thank you.&nbsp;Bye.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-2-from-asset-backed-finance-to-art-with-a-message-2faa1538b4bc">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep. 2: From Asset-Backed Finance to Art with a Message</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is Smart Property? Join us as we explore the radical and perhaps inevitable idea of smart property in our&nbsp;world.</p> EPISODE SUMMARY <p>What is Smart Property? This impromptu discussion between Garrison Breckenridge (@gbharlequin) and Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta (@leashless) explores the idea of smart property as an inevitable evolution of digital commerce. We explore what smart property is in practice, some widely different use cases (wedding planning?), the relationship with the sharing economy, the distribution of power in such a system, some privacy and security concerns, and the prospect of programming social interaction and value flows around goods and services.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>Outline</p>  What is Smart Property?  What Makes Smart Property Viable&nbsp;Now?  The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding&nbsp;Planning  Why Blockchain?  On the Risk of Corporate Dystopia  Smart Property as Technology for Structuring Social Interaction  Smart Property: A Software Update for the Sharing&nbsp;Economy  Smart Property Privacy &amp; Security | Cultural Differences in&nbsp;Adoption  Three Smart Property Use&nbsp;Cases  Ownership in a Smart Property World: Rental vs.&nbsp;Sale  Smart Property and Gold NFTs: A Starting&nbsp;Point   What is Smart Property? [00:00:00] <p>Garrison: So let’s talk about smart property. It’s something that’s been brought up, throughout the Mattereum project at various points. Mattereum is very focused on creating new ways to access, utilize property or under utilized property. So that it’s more, more widely utilized and not sitting dormant. There has been a lot of use cases in the supply chain business to business type of thing, but even like intellectual property rights around like music and stuff like that. But the idea of smart property is kind of fluid, you know, it’s kind of a, more of a mental model, the thing that the project is building towards. So I wonder if you could describe your definition, what you think smart property&nbsp;is.</p><p>Vinay: So smart property is property where you can buy it, sell it, collateralize it, and most importantly use it using software APIs and specifically search. So if you think of something like Uber or Airbnb, these things are rudimentary forms of smart property. You take your apartment, you bind it to an app. The app lets people rent it. And the app takes care of the payment and the availability of the bookings and pre-commitments and the identity and the insurance and all the rest of that stuff. Critical things about smart property is you have to be able to search and you have to be able to actually close the contract for being able to do it&nbsp;online.</p><p>And then what the contract allows you do — a typical thing is rental, but that’s only the very, very thin end of the wedge. That’s just the beginning of what smart property makes possible.</p> What Makes Smart Property Viable Now? [00:01:39] <p>Garrison: When people hear smart property, they may think of like, smart city. They may have some kind of semantic web between smart city, internet of things. People have been talking about it since the nineties, different machines, different systems ubiquitously connected over the internet sharing information and value in some&nbsp;way.</p><p>What makes smart property a possibility now?</p><p>Vinay: Doing anything that involves real property, you need a legal framework. So smart property, to function, has to also involve smart contracts. And it has to involve specifically smart contracts which are seen as being legally enforceable. So if I create a legal commitment to pay for a house that I’m going to rent on Airbnb, there’s force of law behind that everybody understands a contract has been formed and the fact that they don’t give you the house that’s a breach of contract on their end. And the enforceability of these contracts is critical. You can’t have smart property without there being enforceable smart contracts. And now that we have enforcement of smart contracts from Mattereum, then you can build smart property as a layer of applications on top of those enforceable Ricardian smart contracts.</p> The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding Planning [00:02:55] <p>Garrison: And so the listeners have an idea, like what smart property would be in action. What would be an example you would&nbsp;give?</p><p>Vinay: So the example that I give is wedding planning. So wedding planning is one of the most nightmarish activities in the entire world. Because if a single thing goes wrong, it’s the end of civilization, right? Full-scale chaos will result and it’s a million moving parts. And all of those parts are very emotionally important to somebody and there are a whole bunch of different stakeholders that have to be satisfied.</p><p>So it’s a very complicated thing. And professional wedding planners are getting paid a sodding fortune for solving that problem. So what happens if you’re trying to do wedding planning and you’ve got smart property is you could basically build up a multipath matrix of possible solutions. Here’s venue A, here’s venue B, here’s venue C. In venue A, we want to rent these tables, these chairs, we want this caterer, we want this transport solution. We want this hotel booking. We want so many rooms from this one, and then this other hotel, we want so many rooms&nbsp;there.</p><p>You can secure an option on every single thing that you want. So you basically say I’m going to give you 25 bucks for every day until I make a decision about this, but you have to hold this slot open for me. So you option everything you need for pathway A, everything you need for venue B, everything you need for venue C. And if you hit a point where you can’t option the stuff that you need because venue C it just turns out there’s no way to sort out the transport arrangements, then you say, okay, I’m going to execute the options that I took on venue A. Now everything will lock together. So the ability here is to build up interactions between different contracts when you need all of them to come into place before something has utility. And this happens all the time, right? A huge amount of the stress of doing anything that looks like wedding planning is the fact that we don’t have the ability to pay for options. You want to maybe go and visit your uncle who lives in Paris, right? You need to basically option a flight now. Can pay 25 dollars to option this flight. And if he confirms that his vacation days came through when he thought they were going to come through, you execute the option on the fight, and now you’re booked and everything’s great,&nbsp;right?</p><p>It’s this ability to take processes where there are tons and tons of dependencies, turn the dependencies into option contracts, group the option contracts together until you have a solution, and then once you have a solution, execute all of the options. Bringing that kind of capability out of like heavy engineering and finance into ordinary everyday people’s lives will be completely revolutionary.</p><p>And it’s particularly true in anything that involves a whole bunch of people trying to do anything together. We want to go on some trip — seven people want to go rafting in the Yukon. If only five of the people can make it that time, then you know like you’re not going to take the&nbsp;trip.</p><p>So implicitly, everybody is taking out options on everything. And it’s a huge social disaster if three people have bought their tickets and then two people drop out and the whole thing goes to hell in a hand basket, because we don’t have this ability to take out options to secure the possibility of doing something and then later to execute your options once everybody else has booked their tickets and we know that it’s on. So one of the things that smart property gets to is optionality. And that’s only one of half a dozen fundamental operators that we get in a smart property environment that we don’t have in the real world right now, except inside of esoteric corners of engineering and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, I’m just imagining things that are usually like a logistical nightmare, whether it’s like a film production or a band going on tour where there’s a lot of different kind of points of interaction, different, agreements imagining what it would look like if all of those kind of just happens seamlessly where you knew exactly what the available options&nbsp;were.</p> Why Blockchain? [00:06:43] <p>So a great basic question for people who aren’t familiar with blockchain or cryptocurrency or smart contracts: what is it about these particular sets of technologies that make it suitable for building these smart property systems, as opposed to just, you know, more centralized databases and programmable scripts that run on&nbsp;those?</p><p>Vinay: So the critical thing about this is it’s just a complexity problem, right? If every vendor that you want to work with has their own API running on their own database, then your software, whatever agent you’re using, has to know all those different APIs for all of those different pieces of software before it’s able to go out and successfully do something like booking for a hotel room. The thing about the blockchain is, once you’ve gotten the capability to connect properly to the blockchain within that, it’s very simple to then trigger actions. So the blockchain forms a kind of shared backbone which all of these things interconnect to rather than having every single thing be configured differently in a way that just makes life difficult when you’re trying to get things done. It’s complexity control on the software side that is really the advantage of the blockchain here. Plus the ability to do things like escrow payments. Now that’s a very simple thing to do in a blockchain. Like literally escrow is one of the first things that the blockchain gives you. And that’s fundamentally useful when you start trying to do these kinds of very complex transactions in a much smoother and cleaner&nbsp;way.</p> On the Risk of Corporate Dystopia [00:08:12] <p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s also a, certainly a security thing, having a shared credibly neutral system for not only, recording transaction data, but also being able to facilitate transactions. The idea of a smart property system, that’s used widely in a lot of different contexts, different industries, all over the world. If it was run by Google or Facebook or Amazon, that’d be an incredible amount of, you know, centralized corporate power over how we create value or interact with our stuff. And that will be almost like a cyberpunk corporate dystopia situation right&nbsp;there.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah. Yeah. I think that’s a fair way of describing the risk. Smart property is an inevitability, everything is heading in that direction because it’s just what happens when you take software, and you take property, and the two things connect to each other. And, there’s an enormous screaming demand for it, it’s just not a demand that has found it’s language.</p><p>Garrison: It’s what Mattereum has been doing is like building a lexicon, shared language to be able to unpack these really complicated ideas.</p><p>Vinay: Absolutely. And I can’t remember whether it’s Kevin Kelly or Stewart Brand, one of the old great godfathers of the internet culture basically said, look, if you’re interested in discovering new things what to invest in, you go where they’re forming new language. Where things are happening that require you to create new words, that’s usually a fundamental, profound innovation because they’re having to invent new language to talk about what they’re doing. You know that something new is happening.</p><p>So the smart property thing is there is a dystopian version of it. And the dystopian version of it is things like Android phones: constantly reporting back to Google, gives you a bunch of services, takes all of your data, doesn’t really works for you, works for them. And they can arbitrarily decide what does or doesn’t stay on your phone. That thing where Amazon was taking copies of 1984 off people’s Kindles. Yeah. That’s an example of like smart property done wrong, but this is not what we’re trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>This actually happened, there was some kind of contractual problem with that edition of 1984 and they pulled it right off people’s Kindles. That’s&nbsp;amazing.</p> Smart Property as Technology for Structuring Social Interaction [00:10:27] <p>I want to talk about the historical inevitability side of this, right? One of the Mattereum team has a service which holds his physical things in boxes in their warehouse, and when he needs something, they’ll just deliver it to wherever he is for a price. And this is perfect tooling for a&nbsp;nomad.</p><p>I bought a new printer. The printer, as far as I can tell is in continuous communication with headquarters and it will probably do things like sell me ink when it begins to run out of ink. I’m fairly sure that every time it gets a paper jam, this has been reported to HQ like, “Oh, I have a paper jam.” This is smart property, but it’s not really what we want from smart property. What I want from my smart property is I can say to my friends, “Hey, you can print things at my house. And it has an interface where I can extend you the right to print something in my house and if you’ve got something you want to show me that’s better shown on paper, it just appears boom, it comes out of my printer that morning. And to get that to work, I need to be able to give you the right to talk to my property. I need my property to be able to tell you whether it’s got the right kind of paper in it. I need to be able to indicate to my property that I’m using it for something else. It shouldn’t run your print job right now. That’s what we want.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>You want to be able to fix your grandma’s computer. You want to be able to borrow your friend’s car, and the way that we do all this stuff right now, it’s very hands-on, it’s uninsured, it’s complex, and it takes a lot of things which are machine to machine jobs and turns them into human social jobs. If you want to borrow somebody’s car, you could spend two hours going around and talking to them and having dinner with them. And then just somewhere at the end of that, you’re like, “Hey, can I borrow your car, man?” And it’s, “ Oh, why didn’t you just ask?” Or you could punch into the app, “I want to borrow your car: 35 bucks for the insurance, $200 for the mileage and gas.” “Hey, you want to borrow the car? Yeah, no problem. Fantastic. We just hit the option and I’ll get you turned on. Beep. Like the software supports the sociability because it provides us with a nice framework for the exchange. So we don’t have to try and construct the framework from the exchange in a society that doesn’t really have that as a&nbsp;norm.</p><p>This smart property becomes a thing that supports social interaction around goods rather than things that substitutes or removes the social interaction. A good example of that is like electronic dating sites. Tinder or whatever it was, there are a whole bunch of people that could theoretically been going out to bars, getting into relationships, to put it mildly. But Tinder provided them with a framework for doing that, which previously didn’t exist, and as a result it just lowered the necessary activation threshold for people to be able to go out there and have some&nbsp;fun.</p><p>Garrison: They were able to like filter their experience in a way, like it wasn’t like in the same way that, you know, filter search results when you’re looking for information online, online dating sites, you filter it through various settings or bits of information.</p><p>Vinay: But also it also gave them like institutional support. It provided a certain amount of structure in the interaction like eBay provides structure in the interaction. People can just post on their blogs what they’ve got for sale in their garages, and it would be equivalent to eBay once you combine it with Google search. But people sort of need a little bit of help getting over the social awkwardness of doing these kinds of&nbsp;things.</p><p>And that’s what the platforms fundamentally provide is they provide a little bit of social help by structuring the transactions between people. They provide a structure for interaction and with a structure for interaction, people are much more willing to interact with each other than without it. It’s actually a big support and a big help for people to have a little bit of a structure to work inside of and I think all cultures use this kind of semi-formal setting as a way of stabilizing human interaction.</p><p>Think of like formal dances. You go back 50, 100 years, formal dances go, “May I please have this dance?” That kind of structured interaction was a way of basically managing the risk of people interacting with each other. It reduced social anxiety and it’s the same thing with buying and&nbsp;selling.</p><p>Think of street markets, right? The street markets, you have a structured format, which is somebody rents a booth at a street market, they come down, they put all the crap out of their garage on a table. And then people knew that the purpose that they’re there for is to buy, right? The person knows that the purpose of that there is to&nbsp;sell.</p><p>So when it comes to the social interaction, picking the thing up and saying how much becomes very easy, right? But I come round to your house and I pick something up and say “How much?” it’s going to get weird, you see what I’m saying? So the formalism of this is a street market and the structures, the interaction between people to make it commercial is exactly like if you were on Tinder, you are here to go on dates, that means that we can talk to each other. If you’re on eBay, we’re here to sell something. If you’re on Chat Roulette, you’re here to have random interactions with weirdos on the internet or something like that. I’ve never used Chat Roulette. But what I’m trying to say is that the need for structures to lower the anxiety in doing something new socially is one of the critical things that the app economy has really&nbsp;gotten.</p><p>If you and I have an interaction through the car rental app, even if we are friends and we go skiing together, I know that the topic of conversation is I want to rent your car for a week. And I know that you’re interested in discussing that or you wouldn’t have it listed in the app. So the way that I see smart property is that smart property will basically take a set of social interactions between people, right? Social interactions between people about things, and it will lower the anxiety and the complexity and the risk — legal risk, insurance risk, all the rest of these kinds of risks. It will lower those risks to the point where people are willing to have conversations with each other about property. “Can I borrow your tent?” “Hey, do you have a microphone?” Obviously if you’re on the other side of the world, this is less useful, but for most people, if you’re in a city, anything that you can imagine needing is probably in your apartment building if you have the ability to ask somebody for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, like borrowing a specific tool instead of, just ordering on the first link you find on Amazon and it’s being shipped in a container, like all of those resources that went into summoning an object to you, you could just, if you had the means, you could just have it in your hands in an hour within a quarter of an hour where where&nbsp;live.</p><p>Vinay: And gone again after you stop needing it. The critical thing is getting rid of the stuff afterwards. You need a colander right. You have six people coming over for dinner and you’re going to cook a bunch of spinach. Your colander is not really big enough. It’s going to make a heck of a mess so you want to use it for the presentation of the dinner. The spinach is in the big colander. “ Anybody in my apartment have a colander?” “Oh yeah. Flat 37. They got a colander.” You go down and you’d knock on the door. They hand you the colander. You have a two minute conversation with them. You go, you use it, you wash it, you bring it back. Their life has slightly improved. Your life has substantially improved. You pay them $1.50 for the privilege of using their colander.</p><p>Sounds ridiculous right now. Sounds ridiculous right now. But you’re an American. The older generation, right? The kind of Americans over probably 70, 60, grandparents’ age, they’ve got like two metric tons, three metric tons of stuff in their garages and attics right. Ubiquitous. And the older Americans are the more physical things they own, and a lot of it’s in boxes that haven’t been opened for 20 years. Industrial mass production, advertising, but no automated inventory management. They own so much stuff they can’t even remember what they own. And the result is chaos. If that generation had smart property, where they could just have borrowed these things from their neighbors when they needed them one time. You want to trim your hedges, how many hedge trimmers does a neighborhood need?</p><p>Garrison: Just&nbsp;one.</p><p>Vinay: Just one. And so for our generation the place where this really comes into its own is things like video projectors. Half a dozen times a year, you probably would quite like having access to a $3,000 video projector. And if you could get access to a $3,000 video projector for 30 bucks a night or something like that, you’d probably do it fairly casually, and it gets delivered just like the pizza and the beer get delivered.</p> Smart Property: A Software Update for the Sharing Economy [00:18:37] <p>Garrison: Yeah, this kind of like communal inventory management example that we had there, it reminds me of the sharing economy. What’s the link&nbsp;there?</p><p>Vinay: The thing with the sharing economy is the sharing economy never really worked and it never worked because it had an inventory problem. You needed to manually list all of your stuff inside of the sharing economy databases. They weren’t interoperable. And there was always this question of who owns the data. The way that smart property will work is the manufacturers will provide the initial asset passports for the physical objects that you’re buying. So I go to Amazon, I buy a chainsaw, right? They ship me the chainsaw to my house. And into my wallet they also ship an NFT, which has a connection to an asset passport, which has all of the attributes of the chainsaw: what it is, how powerful it is, where you get spares for it, how it has to be maintained, safety instructions, all of that stuff arrives in a bundle attached to the NFT that’s now in my wallet. If I decide that I’ve used this chainsaw for a season, then actually what I need is an electric one, not a gasoline one. I just take my chain chainsaw and I drag it onto the eBay icon on my phone. I take my chainsaw NFT, I drag it onto the Ebay icon in my wallet. Are you sure you want to sell this&nbsp;item?</p><p>Yes. Auto creates a listing. Makes me go through a quick questionnaire. Whether the thing is in the condition that it was when I bought it from, how often I’ve used it. Twice. How long did you use it for? Two days each time. Have you ever had to change any of the components? No. Go through the little inventory check. Boom. Sold. So if I have to go and put all of the attributes of the chainsaw into the system in the first place, the inconvenience is enormous. Selling the thing becomes work. But if all the information is prepackaged with the chainsaw, we don’t have to take responsibility for creating the asset identity for the chainsaw. All we’re doing is passing the asset on. So we take all the labor of creating the initial asset passport to define the thing and all that goes to the manufacturers because they’re going to do it once for every chainsaw they make. And this is the critical thing that was missing in the sharing economy model. All the labor that had to be done to document what was for sale is the thing that killed the sharing economy. It was the hardship of trying to figure out what was going on. Whereas if I have something that simply digs through your email box and pulls out every single thing that you’ve bought from Amazon and asset passports it for you automatically if there’s already a template for that object, it’s just reduce the inconvenience and reduce the inconvenience and reduce convenience. We make it easier and easier for people to get paid. And at some point there’s a crossing where suddenly smart property is a&nbsp;thing.</p> Smart Property Privacy &amp; Security | Cultural Differences in Adoption [00:21:23] <p>Garrison: Yeah. I’m just imagining like in video games, like MMO RPGs, like when you drag your inventory, you hold click and drag it to someone. And then that character, who’s an actual person behind that avatar has that digital artifact. Thinking of almost like the same thing but with actual, like actual ownership of the physical object being transferred in that interaction is really interesting.</p><p>Because I like to always explore the you know the kind of light and dark or the complex things that will inevitably arise around these things. I’m really interested. If you have a global inventory management system, obviously the notion of privacy — if someone had like a profile use the MMO RPG, as an example, some games, you can go walk up to another character and you actually see what they have. You can literally see their inventory and negotiate a trade or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Now the parallel with the smart property system, if you’re able to do that, then you would know what everyone owns or at least the things that they own, which is part of the smart property system that could potentially lead to some people, depending on objects that they have, as vulnerable to theft or potentially violence. For example, using like the gold-backed NFTs for example, if you knew that someone had tokenized gold bullion with the capability of literally taking physical custody that’s obviously kind of a&nbsp;target.</p><p>Vinay: Somebody come around to your house and steal it from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. Looking at like, you know, the parts of the system that would need some particular attention in terms of like security. Have you thought about how do you protect people? Obviously there’s an open participatory nature and there’s a lot of communities that would like thrive on that. I’m thinking like co-ops for example, different cooperatives around the world because that social structure by by its nature is already in tune to that idea of sharing what we have for the betterment of everyone in the co-op. But there’s other contexts where people will look at that as opportunity to prey upon people. So I wonder if what would have to be built to safeguard. I guess it’s like radical transparency versus radical privacy in relation to smart property. What are your thoughts on&nbsp;that?</p><p>Vinay: This is going to be very culturally dependent, culturally sensitive. Norway for example, till pretty recently, you could recently inspect the tax register to figure out what everybody in Norway was paid. It’s only very recently that they stopped doing that. Whereas if you did that in America, that would be an unthinkable invasion of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Japan, a super low crime society. Dubai, super low crime society. These systems could be pretty transparent. You try and do this stuff in Brooklyn, you’re going to have a whole different set of problems. Gary, Indiana. It’s like, hmm, okay. Maybe I don’t want to tell my neighbors quite so much about what I have for sale. So the way that I would see it working in tougher societies is that you’re going to do this with intermediaries, right? I say, “Hey, I need a colander. Or take something like a diesel generator. I need a diesel generator for three days. System says somebody has a diesel generator. We can have it delivered to your house. Yes or no. Yes: a courier arrives, hands me the diesel generator, I use the diesel generator, a courier arrives, picks it up, takes it away. End of story. Simple as that. Simple as&nbsp;that.</p> Three Smart Property Use Cases [00:24:46] <p>Garrison: Yeah, the smart property thing there’s so many ways to look at that topic, examine it. For you personally, are there like use cases that you find very interesting? Obviously there’s everything from the business- to- business and supply chain side of things. There’s friendly neighborhood inventory management with colanders. But is there anything in particular that you find interesting?</p> 1. PARENTAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT [00:25:11] <p>Vinay: So the places where I think this is completely revolutionary are basically three things. The first is everything to do with parents, right? Parents are just the most burdened-by-stuff people in society. The kids constantly grow out of everything that they’re wearing and they get bored with their toys. And the kids have no notion that things need to be new and special and fancy. They’re not like teenagers, they’re not whiny about that stuff. You get them pair of pants they’re going to put the pants on. So pretty much everything for children under about the age of 10 should be smart property. The clothes, the toys, the push chairs, all the rest of that stuff. All of it ought to be just a free floating pool that parents just pull things out of, use, and then get rid of when their kid grows out of it or gets bored with it. And that alone. Think of the quality of life difference if you can constantly lease for your kids new things and all it costs you is getting rid of the old things and having to pay 20p. Because it could be incredibly cheap. If you have some squeaky rubber duck, that thing is going to be in good shape for 15 years. The cost per hour of play with the squeaky rubber duck by a three-year-old kid is like a millionth of a cent. Whereas the cost of buying it, storing it when the kid gets bored, negotiating with the kid about getting rid of it, and then finally get rid of it, dumping it in a charity shop. It’s twenty-five dollars in addition to the price of buying the thing. So everything to do with kids, just a seamless surface of smart property and an enormous pool, sterilize it with UV light or whatever it is before it’s given to the new parent. No problem. So that’s pool number&nbsp;one.</p> 2. PROFESSIONAL TOOLING [00:26:56] <p>Pool number two is what I would call prosumer tooling. I quite like the idea of screwing around with a 3d printer. I don’t want to spend two grand on a 3d printer. If somebody would rent me a 3d printer for a month, with all the bits that go with the 3d printer for $200, I would probably have to have $200 worth of fun with the 3d printer, and then somebody would come and take it away again. You want a chainsaw. You want a router. You want a big printer. You want a video projector. The ability to casually rent high-end equipment for one-off occasions or for experiments or for projects. If you live in a big city and you could get hold of basically everything manufactured by capitalism for say 1% or 2% of its cost per day of&nbsp;use?</p><p>$6,000 camera, right? If you have a $6,000 camera and it costs you $60 a day to rent that camera, that might be worthwhile at the one percent point. it went from the 1% point to the tenth of a percent point, right? If the camera is going to be used solidly for five years, the camera per day could be rented for thousandth of its value. Five years would be 1800 days. The camera’s being rented every day. Somebody going to pay a thousandth of a percent of the camera for using it. So at that point, maybe it’s $6 a day to get access to a $6,000 camera. And at that point, for sure, this is worthwhile</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a tighter coupling of the use of a thing and the value of the&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Vinay: Exactly. And at that point, like how much more experimenting around would you do with high-end systems if you could rent them for somewhere between a tenth of a percent and one percent of their asset value? You want to do some mountain biking, you’ll have the best mountain bike, then you get rid of it. You want to watch some movies? Hey, my cousin’s coming over. My cousin’s a film buff and he’s going to be here for three days and we’re going to watch the whole Star Wars trilogy. Boom. We’re going to rent a high end projector. You’re having a party, we’re going to have a real PA,&nbsp;right?</p><p>You want to brew beer, right? But he’s going to come round with 3,000 bucks worth of brewing equipment and they’re going to charge you $42 for the six weeks. You’re going to pay a few hundred bucks for high-end equipment or brewing&nbsp;beer.</p><p>Point is we want to try things. We want to do experiments. We want to reach out. We want to do things which are novel. And right now the only model that we have is you buy all the equipment, you don’t know whether you’ve got everything you need, you try and use it, and at the end of that process, you either get stuck with it or you have to resell it. And it’s a pain in the butt. It’s almost like turning stuff into part of the experience economy. I want the experience of owning a laser cutter. I don’t want to own a laser cutter. I want the experience of owning the laser cutter. Then I want the laser cutter to go away. Unless I suddenly discovered that I’m a laser cutter hobbyist and I really want to have one, and then I buy it. And this is just a different way of relating to the fruit of capitalism.</p><p>Garrison: The design space around all this, all, this is really fascinating because it’s so embedded in not just objects, but like the social structures around them and the spaces in between objects, not necessarily the objects themselves. A book I started reading recently, Medium Design by Keller Easterling, is about that very thing. How, like there’s a whole, you know, design space around how we structure like infrastructure or build cities. And there’s actual like, you know, power relationships that are woven into how things are built. It’s almost like a call to action to, look at interdependency of things within a system and building in such a way that you account for that. It’s a very like cognizant thing that you’re doing. So I imagine smart property is like a building block towards building these things is you can kind of, to put it one way, program interactions around objects depending on what your goal&nbsp;is.</p><p>You set the parameters and it’s this, digital, physical artifact. It’s this object that has like a digital counterpart you know, exchanging hands. Yeah, it’s just super fascinating. Like the use cases around that are basically limitless.</p><p>And then you get into intangible property because we’ve talked a lot about physical property in this conversation, but intangible, like intellectual property, for example, could use the same&nbsp;tooling</p><p>Vinay: It certainly could. I’m obsessive about physical property because physical property is the nut that we have to crack if we’re going to fix our environmental problems. But you can certainly imagine doing this for intangibles.</p> 3. SPECIAL PROJECTS [00:31:41] <p>I want to talk about the third thing. I said there were three big areas of use, right? So everything to do with kids, everything to do with access to pro equipment, the third category is everything to do with special events. And I don’t just mean special events like weddings, funerals, this kind of stuff. I also mean special events, like projects. You’re going to move house. For the first six months in a new house, you want a big box of tools to fix all the things in your new house. You want a drill. You want a saw, you want some saw horses. You want a big ladder. You might want plastering kit. All the rest of that stuff, new house stuff, six months of being in a new house and having all that stuff. You’ve done everything you’re going to do to that place, you’ve painted and you’ve waxed and you’ve polished and all the rest of that stuff. And at that point, you don’t need the new house kit anymore. All you can use one small toolbox with a screwdriver and a&nbsp;spanner.</p><p>So there are large projects in people’s lives. I am going to build a deck. Bring to me the deck kit. You use the deck kit for three months. You have successfully built a deck. Everything is done. Get rid of the deck kit. And that model, right? You’re going to build a garden shed, right? You’re going to need a bunch of garden shed tools. You’re going to build a deck. You’re going to do a bunch of deck tools. You’re going to paint the outside of your house. You’re going to need a bunch of stuff there. So a human makes an intention to do a big, special, complicated thing. The human is then going to do that big, complicated thing in exactly the same damn way that every other human did&nbsp;it.</p><p>You’re going to go to YouTube. You’re going to watch the same video that everybody else does, they’re going to tell you how to do it the same way everybody else does, and then you’re going to be left buying the same things that everybody else bought. Just close the damn loop. I am Bob. I’m going to show you how to build a deck, by the way, you can get Bob’s deck building kit from any of the following places. They’ll deliver it to your house. You will use it. When you’re done, they’ll take it back again. Boom, boom. So we take the knowledge, the tools, the raw materials, and we integrate these into new class of services.</p><p>Garrison: And you’re able to bundle these services in a way — not only the services, but the resources underlying them — in a way that it’s more efficient. You’re not, there’s people that undergo like a bunch of, projects like building a deck or something. And they, they either buy, because they’re not experts, they buy too much or they buy so many different tools. They may not even end up using them, but they still have them. And there’s just laying&nbsp;dormant.</p><p>Vinay: Oh, you finished the job. And at that point you’re not going to build another deck. Why do you need the professional screw gun? And if eBay worked the way that we want it to work, all this stuff would just go to eBay and it would vanish and there’d be no problem. That’d be fine. But it doesn’t work that way because we don’t trust the condition of the things we buy on eBay. And eBay doesn’t think in systems. And yet when we do things, most of the things we do much like the way other people do them. We need most of the same things that we need. How hard can it be? You’re going to fix your bike. You’re going to need the bicycle repair kit. It has all the things you would require to disassemble and reassemble a bike. At the end of that process, you know that the oil has run out almost on the bike repair kit, the next person to rent that kit, the oil has been replaced by the time they rent it. And if this stuff is available in the short delivery time, like three hours, next day at worst, but let’s say three hours, you’re out your bike breaks, walk home with your bike, and by the time you’ve arrived home, the bike kit is already ordered, and it will be there in an hour and a half, and now you can fix your&nbsp;bike.</p><p>It requires population density to be able to do this. We’re not going to be able to get this kind of relationship with matter in rural areas until you’ve got like magic drone delivery, but in a big city, how easy is life if it works this way? And then you also get spaces. So suppose that you’ve got something like car repair, car repair, you might need more stuff than anybody is going to deliver to your house, and you might need things like those kind of lifting jack things that you use for things like pulling out an&nbsp;engine.</p><p>If you take smart property and you extend it to the notion of smart locations… I need to do the following thing to this car. What are the places I can rent where they have the tooling to allow me to do this? I want to rent a place where I can make a dress, right? Lots of women into dressmaking. They’d like to do it. They don’t want to keep all the stuff in their house. They only do it once in a while. They decided they’re going to do that. You rent 16 hours of dressmaking time over three or four weeks in a place where everything is there, right? Rentable, shareable studios and workshops: smart property.</p><p>Sharing economy looked at doing all of this. Sharing economy just didn’t have the necessary technologies and platforms. Too much complexity, too much cost. The overheads are too high. It was just too hard. Blockchain, asset passports, NFTs, smart contracts, enforceable smart contracts, blockchain based insurance. I can make my way down the list of all of the new things that we’ve got now we didn’t have 10 years ago in the first run to talk about sharing economy. There just wasn’t the infrastructure. Now there is. As a result, dramatically easier to do this. It’s still going to be one of these things where we’re going to start and we’ll do a bit and do a bit, do it, do a bit, but if you ask me where we’re going, we’re moving into a relationship with physical matter which is almost as fluid as our relationship with information.</p><p>And what we’re talking about is something that looks like streaming property rather than having to buy property.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, really interesting. I never heard that framed that way. New language. We’ve come up with new language.</p> Ownership in a Smart Property World: Rental vs. Sale [00:37:18] <p>But one thing I want to dig into because I think it’s really important is the idea of ownership in this sort of, kind of fluid property system where everything’s circular and very efficient, but who owns this stuff? It could be worrisome if somehow you know, for example, if like Amazon looked at it like a growing smart property system and was like, “ Oh, why don’t we just buy all this stuff? And then we’ll earn profits on what everyone’s doing. You understand what I’m&nbsp;saying?</p><p>Vinay: Right. What happens if the people own nothing and everything is rented. So what you have is a constant concentration of wealth in the hands of the people that actually own the property.</p><p>Garrison: Yup.</p><p>Vinay: What is the price of renting everything? Do you wind up in a position where you just don’t have any access to stuff because you don’t own any stuff? This is why it’s critically important that these systems are peer to&nbsp;peer.</p><p>If we’re in a position where the only way that you could get access to the vendor side of these smart property systems is by being a big corporation with massive insurance and regulation all the rest of that stuff, you wind up in a kind of dystopia where nobody can afford to buy anything and everything is rented all the time where people are constantly poor because the property bills are impoverishing them. Think of our camera example, right? A high-end DSLR is certainly good for five years. I think all of my camera units, at least 10 or 12 years old. I bought it very secondhand on Amazon. It’s fantastically durable, nothing wears out. It’s solid state. As old as the lenses aren’t broke, they last&nbsp;forever.</p><p>So how much should it cost to rent a camera? 10% of the camera’s value a day? 1% of the camera’s value a day. A tenth of a percent of the camera’s value a day? Somewhere in there, there is the real costs of renting a camera. Let’s add 10% to that for profit. Hell, let’s add 30% to that for profit. So 5,000, $6,000 of camera, five years of use, five years worth of days. You know, what is that? Just about 2000 days, right? 2000 days, $6,000, $3 per day, profit call it two dollars, 40% profit margin. Actually one dollar 30% profit margin. So now it costs $4 a day to rent a $6,000&nbsp;camera.</p><p>The only reason that’s not how the world works is because we keep losing the cameras or they get stolen or people treat them badly and so on. So all those things create problems. There is another way of structuring the smart property economy that doesn’t have these problems, and I’ll come to that for a second, but I want to talk through the price thing for a second. So right now if you look at professional camera rental, it’s not $4 a day for a $6,000 camera, right? It’s brutally expensive. So if you’ve got a situation where there’s very little regulation of these markets and people can just do what they like, the prices will be kept low because people that have equipment will rent the equipment. Competition will keep the prices down and the quality up and the systems will be reliable. That’s basically the hope. That what you don’t wind up with these monopolies and oligarchies that are artificially inflating the price of rental for physical equipment.</p><p>Garrison: Less distortions.</p><p>Vinay: Less distortions. Now, the other way of doing this is we actually don’t do rental at all. And this is my preferred way of doing smart property. My preferred way of doing smart property is not to have rental markets at all, and to have everything be sale. And this is really where we close the loop on where the blockchain comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>This part is real important. So I want to get access to a $6,000 camera. I could rent it. The problem then is if I break it, I now owe $6,000 to the person that I was borrowing the camera from and we’ve got insurance claims and complexity and so on. And I might be careless because it’s not mine. I’m just renting it. It’s just a rental. Drive it like a rental. So the alternate model here is that I don’t drive like a rental because I bought it. I see a camera. It’s had 53 previous owners. It’s got a recent condition report from somebody that runs a camera shop. I buy the camera for $6,000. I use it for three weeks. I sell it again for $6,000. Why? It’s a $6,000 camera with three more weeks of wear on it. Maybe it depreciates by $3 a day for that period. So I bought it for $6,000 and I sold it for $5,900, having used the camera for three weeks. $3 a day depreciation. If the camera has a life span of five&nbsp;years.</p><p>So if we turn it that way around, where everything is being bought, used, and then sold again. And we have perfectly efficient markets for buying and selling these things, then we don’t lose a bunch of value because eBay charges 10% and because people doubt the goods on eBay and the doubt discount is 20% because you’re going to get ripped off once in a while. If we correct for all of those systems so the resale value is very approximately the same as the purchase value plus appreciation plus wear and tear, then you can build this entire model of this kind of streaming asset economy without having to take the step of turning everything into rental. And it massively simplifies the legals. It massively simplifies the politics. You don’t wind up with nearly the same opportunities for exploitation. And at the end of that process, you just wind up with secondhand markets which are so efficient they replace the rental markets. And the only way that we could get that kind of efficiency that I’m aware of is to use the blockchain for this stuff. Scaled blockchains will make this possible.</p><p>Garrison: Sounds&nbsp;good.</p><p>Is there anything else we want to&nbsp;cover?</p> Smart Property and Gold NFTs [00:43:09] <p>Vinay: The first piece of smart property that we have believe it or not is gold bars which are being sold by our partner Lohko from a vault in Singapore. And what you buy is an NFT on OpenSea for an ounce or a 10g gold bar. And pretty soon it will be a kilogram gold bar. And after that will be a 400oz gold bar. But what you buy when you buy the NFT is the right to have the physical bar delivered to you or equivalent value, if you choose. And it’s a numbered, allocated bar, so when you buy the bar, you own the bar. Your bar with your number is in the vault and they owe you that&nbsp;bar.</p><p>Now that is an approach, right? That is the simplest form of smart property because the smart property never leaves the vault except one time then it’s no longer smart property. It’s just plain old property. So if we were in a position where we were doing this at scale, the thing in the vault it might not be a gold bar. It might be a Rolls Royce or a caravan or a jet pack. And, you buy and sell the NFT. “Hey, I might need this jet pack, so I’m going to buy the NFT for the jet pack, and I’m going to rent the NFT to other people that might want to use the jet pack, but I’m going to be the owner. And then when I need the jet pack I’m just not going to rent it in the days when I need it and then I’m going to go down there and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>And the line between the gold bar that sits in the vault and the jet pack that is constantly being taken in and out of storage and maintenance. It’s literally just some escrow contracts and some storage and maintenance. Legal frameworks. The semantics. Everything else. It’s exactly the same model. Here’s the NFT. Here’s the physical object. The NFT gives you the right to use the physical object. It’s just we start with the simplest example, which is gold where it stays in the vault and people tend not to take it out. Over time, more and more, it will be things which are moving in and out of storage, and then things which have no storage they’re just always in the hands of somebody who currently uses&nbsp;them.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/achieving-financial-resilience-with-gold-and-crypto-70f7a7ea91c3?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/achieving-financial-resilience-with-gold-and-crypto-70f7a7ea91c3?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-1-what-is-smart-property-with-vinay-gupta-b1b42793e57">The Future of Stuff Podcast: Ep.1 What is Smart Property? with Vinay Gupta</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While the chaos of 2020 wreaked havoc in many industries, the housing and mortgage markets boomed. Mortgage rates <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/refinance-demand-jumps-105percent-annually-as-mortgage-rates-set-record-low.html">set 15 records</a> in a single year as they dropped, encouraging equally record-breaking volume. In mid-December, mortgage applications were 26% higher than the previous year, while refinancing applications were up 105% from 2019. With rates still low, demand remains high, even with climbing costs and low inventory. On top of all the widespread adaptation required last year across the board, lenders have been sprinting to keep up with this high demand. The solution? Accelerated digitization of the lending process.</p>
<p>And artificial intelligence (AI) is opening the door to even more possibilities.</p>
 New Trends In The Mortgage Lending Market 
<p>Volume trends in the mortgage lending market are continuing in 2021. <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/housing-trends/">Bankrate reported</a> that the slowdown usually experienced by the market in the winter was far less noticeable this year, which implies that the first quarters of ‘21 will continue to see high demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low rates haven’t been the only factor driving high mortgage lending volume. As social distancing became the norm across much of the economy, employees worked from home. And even as coronavirus cases dropped in some areas, <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">many companies</a> announced a transition to long-term and even permanent work-from-home. This transformation has encouraged some employees, who were previously restrained by a daily commute, to move into a new home. As Bankrate puts it, “demand is especially high in neighborhoods outside of downtown city cores, as increasing work from home and virtual learning requirements have driven many homeowners to favor space over on-the-doorstep amenities.”</p>
<p>High demand, for all its reasons, is butting up against rising costs and low inventory. Low rates appear to be sufficient to encourage continued sales, despite <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/december-2020-data/">median home prices</a> now rising above $340,000. This combination of factors means that we’re likely to see a competitive housing market persist over the coming months.</p>
<p>On top of factors driving high demand, other trends in the mortgage lending market are fostering change. For example, social distancing, quarantines, and lockdowns increased consumer adoption of digital and remote solutions. US <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">ecommerce sales</a> jumped 37% by Q3 2020. Utilization of telemedicine and remote diagnostics increased. Remote education relied on digital learning solutions, as well as virtual communication tools like Zoom. Consumers, especially digital natives, were already expecting and becoming accustomed to digital solutions in many industries. Why wouldn’t they expect the same in mortgage lending?</p>
 The Digital Mortgage: How Mortgage Companies Are Adapting 
<p>With demand and market competition so hot, lenders are looking for ways to streamline their processes and keep up with consumers and potential homebuyers. The solution? Digital adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this high-demand mortgage lending market, mortgage companies may need one thing above all else: time. They need to cut cycle times, allowing for more loans to be processed. They need to save borrowers time to keep them satisfied. Traditional paper-based mortgage processes tend to take more time and involve more friction. Digital mortgages, on the other hand, streamline not only the mortgage application, but the entire lending process, removing high-friction back-and-forth with borrowers through digital verification solutions.</p>
<p>Digital verification solutions enable mortgage companies to adapt to high volumes and empower consumers along the way. Where paper-based verifications require borrowers to dig up old documents to verify creditworthiness, digital solutions powered by open banking, AI, and consumer-permissioned data, allow borrowers to quickly and securely share all the financial data necessary to get them a loan. Digital verifications enable mortgage lenders to automate and streamline workflows, all while delivering borrowers with a convenient, simple, digital-first experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to challenges revolving around time, today’s mortgage lenders are facing another issue in a physically-distanced world: trust. Borrowers are frequently navigating the mortgage application process or refinancing remotely, without meeting agents, sellers, buyers, and loan originators. Lenders can empower borrowers with a consumer-centric experience that enables them to control and benefit from their financial data. Layer that with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/data-aggregators-cra-fcra/">secure, consumer-centric data sharing principles and protocols</a> and lenders can build with borrowers valuable relationships founded on trust.</p>
<p>Some mortgage companies implement a digital solution here and there, but there’s a difference between doing digital and being digital. Any digital solution will of course help streamline processes and update workflows, but a completely digital workflow informed by a company-wide digital-first strategy enhances mortgage companies with consumer-first experiences that accelerate growth and increase ROI.&nbsp;</p>
 Why High Demand For Mortgages Needs A Digital Mortgage Solution 
<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Digital mortgage solutions</a> streamline the verification process and, by extension, the entire origination process. That streamlining cuts time from the origination and leaves more time to process more loans. A necessity in today’s high-demand market. As Allen Taylor of <a href="https://lending-times.com/2019/09/27/digital-lending-how-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-are-making-a-difference/">Lending Times </a>notes, leveraging digital solutions and AI models will “likely drive the greatest overall efficiencies, both reducing costs and boosting revenues. This enhanced efficiency can be used to drive competitive position and ultimately higher profits.”</p>
<p>As purchase volume and demand rises, <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/news/corelogic-reports-a-26.3-year-over-year-decrease-in-mortgage-fraud-risk-in-second-quarter-of-2020.aspx">so do chances of fraud and risk</a>. Fortunately, digital mortgage solutions reduce fraud and overall risk by connecting directly to secure financial institutions and getting the most accurate data from the most reliable sources.&nbsp;</p>
 How Digital Verification Is Facilitated By AI<br>
 
<p>The digital verification enabling streamlined digital mortgage owes part of its efficiency to artificial intelligence. This doesn’t mean that Watson or Alexa are performing your digital income verification. Instead, artificial intelligence leverages machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to mimic human intelligence and predict, optimize, and automate tasks that were once performed manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks">IBM explains</a>, “Perhaps the easiest way to think about artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning is to think of them like Russian nesting dolls. Each is essentially a component of the prior term.” In brief, fundamental terms, here’s more on each AI component:</p>
 
 Neural network – Algorithms that mimic the neurons of a human brain. Consist of an input, weights (how correct or incorrect the input is relative to the task), a bias (or a threshold), and an output.&nbsp; 
 Deep learning&nbsp; – A multi-layered neural network. With more layers, artificial intelligence can produce a more accurate output from data fed into the network’s input.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Machine learning – Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is fundamentally the “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/">practice of using algorithms</a> to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.” The machine learns to perform a task instead of being run through hand-coded software routines. “Classical” machine learning involves training the machine learning model to learn based on specific, labeled datasets fed in so the AI can distinguish between data inputs. This is also called “supervised learning.” “Deep” or “unsupervised” machine learning, on the other hand, involves AI learning without a labeled dataset by identifying patterns in data inputs. 
 
  
<p>In mortgage lending specifically, AI performs income, employment, and asset verification after a lender connects to a borrower’s bank accounts following a consumer permissioning experience. Once the consumer gives the borrower permission to access their financial data, that data enters the AI’s machine learning algorithm and the AI outputs information based on the task. For example, digital income verification involves the AI recognizing an income stream from financial transactions, and cleaning and categorizing data for a clear output that displays a borrower’s income situation.</p>
<p>Digital verification, powered by AI, automates what loan officers and underwriters once had to do manually. That automation enables lenders to, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2019/10/30/three-ways-ai-will-impact-the-lending-industry/?sh=523134816899">Forbes</a>, “reduce underwriting overhead and delays, which increases profits per loan.” In fact, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">Fannie Mae</a> has found that digital, AI solutions save up to 8 days for asset validation and up to 12 days for income and employment validation. Ultimately, AI-powered digital verification enhances the entire lending process, delivering a more streamlined experience for customers, and reducing risk while increasing ROI for lenders.</p>
 Finicity Can Help Your Mortgage Company Improve Their Process: Here’s How 
<p>Through our Finicity Lend solution set, we leverage AI capabilities to help lenders meet high demand. Our open banking platform, powered in part by artificial intelligence, identifies tradestreams in consumer-permissioned financial data and delivers cleaned data, ranked by confidence, in easy-to-read reports to lenders. Finicity Lend delivers valuable real-time data insights on:</p>
 
 Income 
 Employment 
 Assets 
 Cash Flow 
 Transactions 
 Statements 
 Scoring Attributes 
 
<p>These data solutions not only streamline the lending process and better enable lenders to meet high demand, but they also reduce risk and improve loans by enhancing decisioning. Finicity’s real-time data connections ensure high accuracy so that you get the clearest picture of a borrower’s financial situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in addition to the standard verification of income, employment, and assets, lenders can also get a more comprehensive view of a borrower with Cash Flow analytics. Cash Flow leverages artificial intelligence to identify tradestreams not traditionally considered in risk assessment, but that enhance a lender’s understanding of a borrower’s financial habits with a clear view of how money moves in and out of borrower accounts.</p>
<p>We want to make sure you get the most out of Finicity Lend and that your mortgage company can help its lending process reach its greatest potential. To that end, we offer best practices training to facilitate a smooth integration of Finicity solutions into mortgage platforms and an effective transition to a fully-digital mortgage process.

By many measures, America is badly in need of competition <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/briefing/us-economy-biden-competition-order.html">According to the NYtimes’ David Leonhardt</a>, a boost in competition is badly&nbsp;needed:</p><blockquote>The U.S. economy has been less dynamic in the 21st century, by many measures, than it was in the late 20th&nbsp;century.</blockquote><blockquote>Fewer new businesses are starting. Existing businesses have slowed the pace at which they hire new workers (as the chart here shows). Workers are less likely to switch jobs or move to a new city. Companies are investing in new buildings and equipment at a lower rate. And small businesses make up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/opinion/big-business-mergers.html">a shrinking share of the&nbsp;economy</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Together, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160916_searle_conference_competition_furman_cea.pdf">these trends</a> suggest that the economy suffers from a lack of fair competition, many economists believe. Large corporations are often able to increase profits not by providing better products than their rivals but instead by being so big that they exercise power over workers and consumers. The government also plays a role, through policies that protect existing companies at the expense of start-ups and new entrants into an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The lack of competitive dynamism plays a role in many of the U.S. economy’s biggest problems: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/opinion/us-economy-stagnation-growth.html">the disappointing economic growth</a> of the past two decades; <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W270RE1A156NBEA">the declining share</a> of output going to workers; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/opinion/income-inequality-upper-middle-class.html">rising income inequality</a>. It also helps explain the new concern — among both Republicans (like Josh Hawley and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22561157/ken-buck-antitrust-apple-amazon-facebook-google-cicilline-jim-jordan">Ken Buck</a>) and Democrats (like Elizabeth Warren and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/books/review/antitrust-amy-klobuchar.html">Amy Klobuchar</a>) — about the power of big business.</blockquote> 3. A bunch of those initiatives are aimed at Big&nbsp;Tech <p>Some relevant bits from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">the Fact&nbsp;Sheet</a>:</p>  Announces an Administration policy of greater scrutiny of mergers, especially by dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by “free” products, and the effect on user&nbsp;privacy.  Encourages the FTC to establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of&nbsp;data.  Encourages the FTC to establish rules barring unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces.  <p>Also, we talk a lot about data portability and being able to easily switch platforms and providers. The Biden administration wants to apply that to banking as&nbsp;well:</p>  Encourages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with&nbsp;them.   4. Chart of the&nbsp;week  5. “The collapse of American identity/democracy” <p>On the topic of America needing a bit of a boost, here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-collapse-of-american-identity">a great interview w/the New Yorker’s George Packer</a> and his new book about a divided America (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In his new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374603669?ots=1&amp;tag=thneyo0f-20&amp;linkCode=w50">Last Best Hope: America in Crisis and Renewal</a>,” George Packer writes that the United States is in a state of disrepair, brought about primarily by the fact that “inequality undermined the common faith that Americans need to create a successful multi-everything democracy.” The book opens with an essay on the state of the U.S. during the pandemic, and then offers sketches of four different visions of the country: Free America, of Reaganism; Smart America, of Silicon Valley and other professional élites; Real America, of Trumpist reaction; and Just America, of a new generation of leftists. “I don’t much want to live in the republic of any of them,” Packer writes. He proposes a different vision, which he thinks offers brighter possibilities, centered around the concept of equality and non-demagogic appeals to patriotism.</blockquote> 6.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hegde">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>
Michele Nati,  Head of Telco and Infrastructure Development at the IOTA Foundation, will participate in panels on Decentralized Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Michele some questions about what he will bring to the panels.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Are we entering a new era of identity with decentralized identity?</p>
<p>
Absolutely. Yes, we are changing the way we generate identities, we manage identities and we verify identities and we access services. So the European Commission is already looking forward on how to change this. There are new regulations, that are currently under discussion on how to reform the identity space, especially, state identities moving from a centralized approach toward a more decentralized approach where identities can be issued by government, but also be verified across different government without direct interaction of offices, adding bureaucracy, adding administrational burden. And on top of that collect credentials and attributes that allow people to show who actually they are in a trusted way, what attributes their identity brings forward to access services, i.e., to be verified for age restriction whenever it's needed. So this can happen now in a much more decentralized way rather than centralized.</p>
<p>So the European Commission itself is looking at how to expand and adapt the initial eIDAS network, which was a network between member states to create and issue state identity for digital services that was still relying on a centralized concept. And now it's moving towards a decentralized view. Now they start to look into employing ledgers – as they call them, where we know there are distributed ledger or blockchain technologies – to be the underlying trust rather than the members themselves, that guarantee a person is who they claim to be when they travel, when they move, when they try to access services across different states in Europe. </p>
<p>And that's just the start. We see this way of people moving and being trusted across a border as well across countries, across oceans hopefully. Things like this are happening also in other countries, in other continents. And one of these reforms of eIDAS will also culminate with what is the introduction of actually digital wallets. Digital wallets that people will carry with them with their mobile phone, to carry not any more currency, not any more credit cards, debit cards, or tokens like somebody is doing for payments, but carrying their identities, their identity credential that they can present, that they can use to access services. </p>
<p>So, imagine I go to a doctor and I want to show what I actually need assistance for in a foreign country. There is no more need for the doctor to go and look for this in my origin countries, to make phone calls but get this from my wallet as a credential that everybody can trust because it's been issued by central trusted authority in my country and verified using a ledger (like IOTA).   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current status quo revolves around centralized, federated identities. As decentralized identity initiatives gain momentum, do you see the two forms of identity coexisting? How do you see this confrontation playing out? </p>
<p>
So that's a very good point. And it’s also actually one of the reasons we still see a bit of a delay in the new concept of decentralized identities moving forward. Because the idea before was all or nothing. So one identity or the other, and that's not actually the way I see this going forward. The way it's a complementarity. Of course, there will be cases and scenarios where identities like this concept of self-sovereign identities can be self-issued. So identities decentralized now self-sovereign is basically an identifier that is immutable on a ledger and a public key in terms of cryptography. </p>
<p>A private key is always controlled by the subject who created the identity. So there is no more need for a government – let's say – to create that identifier, it’s the number of my passport let’s say. So anybody can create that and can start to collect credentials, but there will be use cases in which it will be enough to collect a credential that states: “It's me.” And they have some features or attributes like: “I live in a country” or “another country” that can come from other identities that can sum up and say: “I can say that Michele lives in this country or that country because of interaction with him”. </p>
<p>But there will be also use cases where I need some other authority that have done proper KYC of me that have verified all the aspect of my identities or legal or any other position like state identity that can say: “Actually, Michele is who he claims to be”. Credit card issuer, debit card issuer that will do KYC. So this will create not a different identity. It will create a credential that sits on top of this decentralized system that adds more value to my attributes because it comes from an established authority that have done controls, have done proper KYC. It’s a bit more value, a bigger value. So it's a different level of assurance when I interact with a third-party. </p>
<p>So long story short, there is no competition, in my opinion. There is a complementarity, there is integration of this technology and what the identity was in the past, and new identity will be in the future with a central point being the person controlling it. But there will be still a role for centralized identity providers to start to issue new credentials and empower citizens and people to manage them and present them. So, there will be the need of course, to re-invent some of the business models that exist in the domain. But of course, I see this as a complimentary landscape that will come together for a greater good. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be part of a panel discussion at EIC – centered around the application of decentralized identity in eCommerce. Could you provide a sneak peek into the topic of discussion? </p>
<p>
Absolutely. We [IOTA Foundation] are working on this project called ENSURESEC. It's a European project founded under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/what-horizon-2020">Horizon 2020</a> Framework. It's an innovation action. So you actually try to establish new technology and test their viability in the market for creating innovation and creating also better processes. And we are actually tackling the eCommerce infrastructure having in mind also to create a more seamless way for the digital single market infrastructure that Europe is building up in a way that is trusted across countries. And the one way that we see one of the barriers – basically the difficulties – for small and medium companies to basically be part of an eCommerce marketplace, because they have either to rely on third party and they have to build their customer base. When this comes, they bring also a lot of data about their customers, especially if you think about small and medium enterprises selling age-restricted items or items that are only being sold (like drugs and medicine) and dispatched [only] to people that have the right requirements. That all of this requires the small company to either be with a bigger player, or be able to evolve a new infrastructure that is secure to maintain all this personal data, all this sort of information that exposes the risk of cybersecurity [threats] for them. </p>
<p>So with decentralized identity, we are exploring the opportunity for them to still have the same knowledge of their customers, still able to verify age still able to verify any other feature before providing whatever the customer is aiming to buy with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. So this knowledge, this information is not anymore a burden for them to create, so they can speed up and lower the body of friction to be part of a digital single marketplace. So this is one example.  </p>
<p>We are also testing decentralized identity, not only for persons, but also for a company itself. So if a company has to open up an eCommerce store, again they [will] need to prove they have enough cover of any liability. This information also requires checks and what is best then a bank – that also has a knowledge of the logging book, accounting book of an SME – [to] issue a credential toward the marketplace operator for the company to operate in a way that's seamless and the proof that a company can receive finance credit and trade finance, and so on and so forth.   </p>
<p>So, there are a few ways we are exploring this to use decentralized identity in creating a more, let's say dynamic, frictionless eCommerce infrastructure, and still maintain the security that eCommerce should provide. Because these days more than before with the COVID experience, lockdown, we rely on eCommerce much more than before and more and more will be in the future. </p>

 By Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and&nbsp;data <p>We see that it was the third anniversary of your mainnet launch at the end of June, congratulations! Could you tell us a bit about why decentralized identity and data solutions have been the focus of Ontology’s vision over the past three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Since our MainNet launch three years ago, decentralized identity solutions and secure data management have become increasingly important. Every day, individuals make millions of transactions online, whether they be related to social media, banking, ecommerce, or work. Despite this increased digital migration, privacy and security have not advanced in tandem. Every day we see new data breaches involving the exposure of millions of users’ sensitive personal information, yet people rarely stop to question how companies and services are collecting and using their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At Ontology, we want to empower users to take back control of how their digital identity is managed online, where their data is stored, and how it is protected. Our mission is to facilitate a decentralized identity framework that uses blockchain technology to redefine trust and challenge the status&nbsp;quo.</p><p>What are some of the strategic partnerships that have informed your success over the&nbsp;years?</p><p>Strategic partnerships have been highly valuable for creating technical use cases of our decentralized solutions over the last few years and in reflecting buy-in from key industry players. We were proud to partner with Mercedes manufacturer Daimler last year to launch the “Welcome Home” app for automobiles, which uses Ontology’s bespoke digital identity and decentralized solutions through a personalized identity management system.</p><p>In the blockchain world, we have been delighted to see the integration of Ontology’s solutions on other public chains including Ethereum and other mainstream public blockchains.</p><p>What are Ontology’s plans for the future and how does your development of an Ethereum Virtual Machine feed into&nbsp;this?</p><p>Decentralized identity and data will remain the key focus of Ontology’s offering as we move forward. As well as this, we recently announced the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which will connect our trusted decentralized identity solutions with millions of developers and users in the EVM-based blockchain ecosystem upon completion, later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our goal is to establish seamless interoperability between the Ontology and Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. This is a big step towards allowing all blockchain projects to easily adopt Ontology’s DID solutions into their products.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Munich and Jersey, July 13th 2021. Jersey-based fintech company and provider of secure due diligence document management MYCDD has partnered with IDnow, a leading European identity verification platform provider. IDnow enables MYCDD to offer enhanced and comprehensive identity verification solutions to its global client base.</p>
<p>Through the new solution, MYCDD will be able to offer clients an outstanding and convenient onboarding experience for all their due diligence documentation, while at the same time ensuring high security standards.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which is fully integrated into MYCDD’s cloud-based framework, will enable MYCDD to offer a simple and quick way for clients to securely prove their identity. The solution checks ID documents and their security features and verifies via biometric checks if the documents and the people match. The full process only takes a few minutes and ensures seamless usability.</p>
<p>Formally launched in April this year, MYCDD aims to revolutionise how financial services firms, including fiduciary services firms, law firms, and service providers in leading international finance centres, manage their ongoing and wide-ranging client due diligence requirements.</p>
<p>Commenting, Stephane Gimenez, CEO of MYCDD, said: “MYCDD was launched in response to a rise in demand for cutting-edge digital due diligence solutions, with a vision to save financial services businesses time and money by revolutionizing the way due diligence is gathered, managed and shared. Working with IDnow represents a big step in doing that – through the IDnow platform we can offer users a better experience, efficient onboarding and best in class security.”</p>
<p>“User requirements have changed over the past year and fully digital solutions have become more and more important”, added Oliver Obitayo, CSO at IDnow. “It’s great to support companies like MYCDD in balancing high security standards with user friendly, digital processes”, he said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021 IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification and French market leader ARIADNEXT. Those acquisitions represent important milestones for IDnow on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe.</p>

Este programa ha tenido éxito al ayudarnos a construir una presencia comunitaria global más&nbsp;sólida.</p><p>Para celebrar el tercer aniversario del lanzamiento de nuestra MainNet, nos complace lanzar nuestro Programa Harbinger v2 para expandir y hacer crecer aún más la comunidad y el ecosistema de Ontology en todo el&nbsp;mundo.</p> ¿Qué es un Ontology Harginber? <p>Los Harbingers son líderes excepcionales que ayudan a Ontology a continuar haciendo crecer su comunidad y el ecosistema, convirtiéndola en una cadena de bloques cada vez más fuerte, contribuyendo a ser líder descentralizado de identidad y&nbsp;datos.</p> ¿Cómo llegar a ser un Ontology Harbinger? <p>Nuestro objetivo es elegir miembros que hayan demostrado ser invaluables para Ontology y nuestra comunidad. Los precursores son embajadores de la visión de Ontology, respondiendo constantemente a las preguntas de la comunidad y abogando por Ontology en las redes sociales y más&nbsp;allá.</p><p>Los precursores deben ser apasionados por la Blockchain, Criptografía, identidad y datos descentralizados y, por supuesto, ya deberían ser partidarios de Ontology y preocuparse por su desarrollo.</p><p>Si ya es un administrador de nivel 1 de Ontology activo, leal y de&nbsp;apoyo:</p><p>¡Fácil! Simplemente complete las tareas a continuación y gane 200 puntos para calificar para convertirse en un Harginber.

<p>As you likely already know, the UK Gambling Commission set out to put in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/new-gaming-regulations/">new regulations in the gaming industry</a> with a focus on online gambling in May 2019. These new regulations aimed to make gambling safer and fairer, with one of the key changes being increased strictness around age verification.</p>
<p>Gambling operators must now verify customer age before the customer is able to deposit funds, gamble using their money, use a free bet bonus, or access any ‘free to play’ versions of gambling games. This comes as a rather large shift, as operators could previously take 72 hours to verify customer age, and, while the operators could not issue pay-outs during that time, the user could still use the platform while waiting for a verification result.</p>
<p>This, among other changes, has had a huge impact on website operations, creating several issues that may be very difficult to overcome. Let us take a look at some of the biggest changes from the new regulations and their impact on gambling operations in the UK.</p>
 Increased Barrier to Entry 
<p>One of the biggest issues in gaming in the UK was caused by the new regulations is an increased barrier to entry for customers. Previously, potential users could sign up to a website and instantly place bets, play games, or partake in any other activity.</p>
<p>However, operators are now required to verify age before providing access, meaning it is impossible for users to instantly play. This causes multiple problems for the user, from struggling to provide the required information, to simply getting bored of waiting for verification or even forgetting a website they signed up for altogether, as they must now wait for verification.</p>
<p>This will no doubt hurt the number of users signing up, as well as the overall conversion rate of signup to bets placed or games played.</p>
 Higher Operating Costs 
<p>With these new regulatory requirements comes an increase in the UK gaming industry’s operating costs. Players will no doubt flock to websites that can verify their information the quickest, meaning speed will be key to attracting new customers.</p>
<p>With every customer having to be verified on signup before they can place a deposit, it will be in every operator’s best interest to make the process as quick and painless as possible.</p>
<p>Whether this means hiring staff to manually validate data or investing in a verification platform, costs will rise.</p>
 How IDnow’s AutoIdent Solves New UK Gambling Regulation Issues 
<p>Along with providing a new set of regulations, the UK Gambling Commission also recommended for operators to consider using AI or biometric applications to identify players. These ID-Powered identification tools would provide a seamless onboarding system, reducing verification times and lowering the threshold of human error.</p>
<p>IDnow’s AI-Powered ID verification tool, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, is the perfect solution to the issues created by the newest gaming regulations in the UK. IDnow uses artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents, with a key focus on round security and uncomplicated application for the customer. It makes the process as straightforward as following simple on-screen prompts and completing verification within minutes, boasting a conversion rate of over 90%.</p>
<p>IDnow is also very proud to be recognised by winning the EGR Awards 2021 and we were also in the Headline Category Compliance &amp; KYC Supplier.</p>
<p>“A very impressive entry and a good submission. They understand the potential of technology but also that human instinct is important is key to successful solutions.”</p>
<p>This would both greatly reduce the barrier to entry, as well as overall costs. Users could sign up and be verified by AutoIdent in minutes, all while being guided every step of the way by the program. There would also be no need to use staff to manually check documents, as the AI-Powered ID verification tool would do just that, and IDnow specialists are always available for a manual review, in the unlikely case it is needed.

<p>KILT Protocol aims to secure an initial Kusama parachain slot, planning to bid for slots in the 6–10 range. KILT’s team has been hard at work building and testing our technology so that we can launch with significant functionality, rather than adding core elements later. Here’s an update on KILT’s strategies towards network&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The long-awaited parachain auctions have started and, like all of you, we’ve been watching with interest.</p><p>Behind the scenes we’ve been focused on building and auditing our technology, and fine-tuning a token economy that could enable and incentivise functionalities in the network while aiming to avoid the pitfalls of high inflation. Here’s a brief outline of what we’ve been up&nbsp;to.</p> The Tech <p>As promised by Kusama, we can all expect chaos. However, we also like mitigating risk! So we decided to take the time to test our parachain in close to real-life scenarios, doing load testing, figuring out edge cases of the token economy and trying to break the Relay Chain. We surely were the project spending most time on the Westend testnet — thanks to Parity for all the time and engagement!</p><p>As a result of this preparation, at launch KILT’s parachain will already include significant activated functionality: staking and our initial token&nbsp;economy.</p><p>This means staking will be possible on KILT from genesis. To enable this, we selected and set up the first group of collators who are being onboarded now. We are thrilled by their commitment to KILT and enthusiasm for the protocol at this early stage. Further details on the KILT’s Initial Collator Programme to follow&nbsp;soon.</p><p>After the successful golive of the network, the number of Collators will be increased gradually and becoming a Collator will become permissionless.</p><p>As we <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">announced last week</a>, KILT will launch as a Limited Delegated Proof of Stake (LDPoS) network. This variation of proof of stake will allow token holders to delegate their stake to the collators. We chose this mechanism as part of a carefully-considered token economy that aims to have relatively low inflation, promoting the efficient use of resources and contributing to the long-term economic stability of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We have engaged external security firms to audit and test our token economy implementation, so it’s ready for the early days of KILT’s parachain. We look forward to sharing a detailed outline of our token economy in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Obtaining Our Parachain Slot <p>To date the crowdloans have been extremely successful, with the first five slots anticipated to capture close to 10% of the current KSM supply, which is approximately 11M tokens. In reality the supply is much lower, because half (5.5M of the 11M) of the current distribution is needed for staking to secure the network. So 20% of the available 5.5M KSM in circulation is now locked up by the first five slots, not taking into account some free float and&nbsp;hodlers.</p><p>Watching the auctions over the past four weeks, we came to the following conclusions:</p><p>We anticipate the momentum with crowdloans to continue through the next few slots and have created a strategy for how to best optimise our entry point while building for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We want KILT to be decentralised and run by community governance. We believe that the stability of the KILT network is best reached by independence from market fluctuations and from short-term adoption.</p><p>An important factor for this is the ability of the network to fund all its necessary resources itself, in the long run. These are the options we are currently reflecting on:</p> Self-funding <p>As preparation for our launch on Kusama, months ago we accumulated an amount of KSM we believe will be a reasonable long-term average price for a slot. By self-funding this amount, KILT would ideally have the resources to bid for any subsequent slot without further crowdfunding, as the locked KSM is returned at the end of a lease. In addition to generating stability and low inflation, this would make KILT independent of short-term market fluctuations.</p> Crowdloans <p>There are two things to consider regarding crowdloans.</p><p>First, the momentum in the price of Kusama parachain slots may continue in the short term, making it unwise to over-commit self-funding, and sensible to create a crowdloan.</p><p>Even more importantly, crowdloans provide a way for the community to participate and therefore we could begin the process of decentralisation — even before KILT’s mainnet launch. To accommodate this option without introducing extra inflation into the system, we have reserved 3% of the initial distribution of KILT Coins for a crowdloan boost for our first&nbsp;slot.</p> Future Kusama&nbsp;Auctions <p>In the Kusama ecosystem, when the first round of 48-week slots ends, we assume that the number of total slots will have greatly increased while the total distribution of KSM will have increased much less, due to the KSM inflation. So we expect that the slot price will be at reasonable levels at that time, and may be comfortably achieved by our self-funding provision, allowing greater freedom to KILT governance.</p> Entering Polkadot <p>Additionally, we have worked out a Treasury scheme that we envision will create a secure source of self-funding for KILT’s future parachain slots on Polkadot, as determined by community governance. Stated simply: KILT Coins will be minted into the Treasury on chain over a long period of time. The blockchain’s governance mechanism shall potentially be able to trade these KILT Coins for DOT, building up a DOT treasury on the KILT blockchain that could be held and used for subsequent community-initiated biddings for Polkadot parachain slots. We are continuing to refine this concept, which would add another utility and interesting use case for DOT as well as a new approach for our ecosystem. More details will be outlined in our forthcoming token economy document.</p><p>Note that there will be only one KILT Coin. If KILT’s blockchain governance bids on a Polkadot slot, the new Polkadot blockchain will hold the same balances.</p> The Way&nbsp;Forward <p>At this point in time, the duration of the pause between Kusama auctions 5 and 6 is yet to be communicated. And we realise it may be a matter of weeks or even months, depending on how much chaos will be observed. While we (and other projects!) are anxious for auctions to proceed so we can launch, we will use any additional time to add even more functionality to KILT’s blockchain on Day&nbsp;One.</p><p>As ever, we are extremely grateful for your continued support and patience, and look forward to bringing KILT to the world as soon as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">KILT’s Parachain Plans: An Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In more good news for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">data privacy legislation</a>&nbsp;in the US, the Colorado Legislature&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/colorado-privacy-act-passes-professionals-ponder-effects/">passed the&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;(CPA) on June 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colorado joins&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">California and Virginia</a>&nbsp;in having comprehensive privacy legislation.</p>



<p>Like the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>, the CPA gives consumers some significant rights to control their personal data:</p>



  Consumers will be able to opt out of the sale of personal data and the processing of their data for targeted advertising and profiling purposes. Consumers will also be able to authorize another person to opt out on their behalf.&nbsp;  Consumers will need to consent (opt in) to companies processing “sensitive” personal data, which may include information about their&nbsp;religious&nbsp;beliefs, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and physical or mental health.  Consumers will be able to request that companies delete their personal information or correct it for inaccuracies.&nbsp;  



<p>But Colorado goes further than California and Virginia in some areas; for example, by providing for:&nbsp;</p>



  Rigorous limitations on secondary uses of data and the requirement for opt-in on those uses. Companies will have to state the purposes for which they’re collecting information and not change purposes later.  Banning companies from using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>, which are intentional UX features of websites and apps designed to make it harder for users to do what they want, either through complexity or deception. Dark patterns are like traps to get more of users’ personal information and to tempt users into buying products and services.&nbsp;  A&nbsp;“universal” opt-out mechanism which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/06/10/why-colorado-s-privacy-bill-may-be-big-mountain-climb-marketers">commentators</a>&nbsp;say is like the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/global-privacy-control?r=US&amp;IR=T">Global Privacy Control</a>solution. This means consumers can opt out of data collection for advertising purposes across all services at once rather than opt out separately at each site or company they access.&nbsp;  A 60-day cure period in which companies can fix any mistakes in compliance. This cure period will be phased out in January 2025.  



<p>The CPA will apply to any organization doing business in Colorado or targeting Colorado residents with their products and services, which processes or controls the personal data of more than 100,000 consumers a year or derives revenue from selling personal data and processing or controlling the personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.</p>



<p>Fines for non-compliance can be up to $500,000.The CPA will come into effect on July 1, 2023.</p>

			 Public Blockchains Are Now Suitable for Financial Institutions<br>
 
<p>A blockchain is a network, it is an ecosystem. It is a group of people who agree to safeguard a ledger and validate digital transactions with the same technical consensus. A blockchain is a shared infrastructure that users can access at any time and use on demand.</p>
<p>Launching a new or private blockchain means that you need to start a whole ecosystem from scratch, where all participants must trust the node owners, and the consensus mechanism.&nbsp;Private blockchains are like intranets. Public blockchains are the new internet of value.</p>
<p>We understand that public blockchains can be scary for financial institutions, as they are used to controlling and securing their own infrastructure. But we need to understand, a blockchain is inherently more secure than any centralized server. That’s why we launched Tokeny almost 4 years ago, to create a decentralized system where our users can benefit from the best of both worlds:&nbsp;the security and interoperability of public blockchains and the control from private blockchains.</p>
<p>We have made public blockchains suitable for financial institutions:</p>
 
 Control:&nbsp;if it is decentralized enough, you don’t need to control the nodes of the blockchain, you need to control your token smart contracts. We allow this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">T-REX protocol</a>. Rules are encoded in the tokens and you can perform actions at any moment on the tokens you issued, even if they are not in your wallet. 
 Compliance:&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">ONCHAINID,</a>&nbsp;all your stakeholders are pseudonymously identified on the blockchain. You can therefore encode transfer rules, give permissions, manage authorizations the way you want in order to apply compliance rules. 
 Security:&nbsp;with no incident in years, public networks like Ethereum are now recognized as secure and decentralized by the majority of large financial institutions, service providers and regulators. 
 Gas fees: public blockchains are on demand, but you need to pay when you use it. For this, you usually need some crypto-tokens in your wallet, and the price per transaction depends on several factors that you cannot control or anticipate. With our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">Gas Tank</a>&nbsp;feature, you don’t need crypto in your wallet anymore. And, we even pay the gas fees for you on Polygon! 
 Privacy:&nbsp;blockchain data is pseudonyms, you can see addresses, but no names. Thanks to our identity system ONCHAINID, you can change your wallets easily without losing your assets, making your identity harder to trace. Mostly, investors want more transparency, they want proof of the total supply, they want to know if there are many movements or not, they want proof they can trust the issuer, especially when you reach a global audience of investors. 
 
<p>We are ready to help you benefit from this new infrastructure enabling digital transfer of value.</p>

<p>In today’s society, everyone has experienced the need to rely on third party agents to handle matters for us. For instance, you may authorise lawyers and real estate agents to act on your behalf when buying a beachfront villa (lucky you!). When travelling to Mongolia, you may also authorise a local travel agent to book a yurt for your stargazing trip.</p><p>However, it is difficult to authenticate whether a third party agent has the proper authorisation, or will only conduct themselves within the instructions given to them. Trust has always been an issue — relying on an agent comes with risks — forgery of signatures, overuse of authority, and uncertainty about an agent’s real authority are classic risks that we are all familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>One way to overcome these problems is for the person or entity seeking to authorise a proxy (for the purpose of this article, let’s call them “Principal”) to use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> to appoint verifiable proxies. This is called “proxy issuance”</p> How Verifiable Credentials are Used for Proxy Issuance? <p>In proxy issuance, the issuer is an entity (individual/organization) that authorizes another person or entity to act on its behalf by issuing a verifiable credential (VC) to that person or entity (called the “holder”). The holder is the party who has the authority to act on behalf of the issuer. The verifier is the entity that checks the validity and legality of the holder to act on behalf of the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Let’s understand the workflow&nbsp;here.</p>  Firstly, the issuer (Principal) and the holder (agent) create a unique set of private-public key pairs. The issuer generates a VC, digitally signs using its private key, and encrypts the data using the holder’s public&nbsp;key.  This VC is sent to the holder who can decrypt it using his or her private&nbsp;key.  Next, the holder can choose to save the VC in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital identity&nbsp;wallet</a>.  When needed, the holder compiles a set of VCs like date of birth, government ID, etc, along with the proxy authorization, into a verifiable presentation that is digitally signed with the holder’s private key and encrypted using the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  The verifier can decrypt [the verifiable presentation] using its private key and validates the digital signature of both the issuer and the holder using their respective public keys to ensure the authenticity of the issuer and the holder. Once verified, the holder becomes eligible to act, and disclose limited and pre-approved information, on behalf of the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Here is a real-world example.</p>  John is an American individual who has traveled to Singapore and is unable to return to the US in time for a board&nbsp;meeting.  He decides to authorize his brother Sam to vote on his behalf, and issues a verifiable credential for this authorization  On the day of the board meeting, Sam creates a verifiable presentation with John’s authorization VC and his identity proof. The same is verified by the board chair who approves the proxy. Finally, Sam casts a vote on John’s&nbsp;behalf.  <p>In this example, John is the issuer, Sam is the holder, and the board chair is the verifier.</p><p>Here’s how a possible VC could look like. This VC was generated from Affinidi’s <a href="https://vc-generator.com/">VC Generator app</a>.</p> {<br>  "type": "MetaCredentialPersonV1",<br>  "data": {<br>    "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": [<br>      "Person",<br>      "PersonE",<br>      "MetaPerson"<br>    ],<br>    "name": "Bob Belcher",<br>    "receivedCredentials": {<br>      "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": [<br>        "Role",<br>        "ReceivedCredentialRole"<br>      ],<br>      "startDate": "start",<br>      "endDate": "end",<br>      "aggregatorDID": "did:elem:...",<br>      "typesSome": [<br>        "type 1"<br>      ],<br>      "typesAll": [<br>        "type 2"<br>      ],<br>      "typesNot": [<br>        "type 3"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsSome": [<br>        "context 1"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsAll": [<br>        "context 2"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsNot": [<br>        "context 3"<br>      ],<br>      "issuerDIDIn": [<br>        "did 1"<br>      ],<br>      "issuerDIDNotIn": [<br>        "did 2"<br>      ],<br>      "receivedCredentials": [<br>        "vc 1",<br>        "vc 2"<br>      ]<br>    }<br>  },<br>  "holderDid": ""<br>}  Benefits of Using Verifiable Credentials for Proxy&nbsp;Issuance <p>The big question is, should you use verifiable credentials for proxy issuance?</p><p>Yes, because it addresses many of the problems that come with the traditional principal-agent problem.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the benefits that come with using verifiable credentials for issuing&nbsp;proxies.</p> Reduces Forgery <p>One of the biggest problems with appointing agents the traditional way is forgery. An agent can easily forge a principal’s signature. Verifying parties may simply choose to rely on the signature presented to them. Any additional authentication methods may require the verifying party to contact the principal — which may not be possible, or time and cost intensive.</p><p>VCs overcome this problem with digital signatures that are secured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>, where a pair of private and public keys are used to ensure that the verifiable credential was issued by the principal to the agent, and not by a person purporting to act as the principal.</p> Creates Trustable Data <p>Many times, verifying entities like banks and financial institutions do not have trust in the proxy appointment process and may not trust agents for important transactions. This causes inconvenience to both the issuer and the verifier, as the issuer may not be able to travel personally to meet the verifying entity.</p><p>VCs may overcome this impediment by creating a reliable way to verify that a proxy has been validly appointed, through the process of securing the credential with the digital signature of both the issuer and the holder, so the verifier can be assured of the authenticity of the proxy’s credentials.</p> Quick and&nbsp;Easy <p>Sharing and authenticating VCs are quick and easy, and take less than a couple of minutes to verify. Since the VCs are machine-readable data, they can be read quickly by the verifying authority’s machine and verified almost instantaneously.</p><p>There are no more long wait times and background checks with VC-based appointment of&nbsp;proxies.</p><p>Overall, using VCs for proxy issuance is easy,&nbsp;, promotes trust, and follows the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> principles of control over one’s data and selective disclosure.</p><p>Here’s an example of a VC-based proxy issuance <a href="https://devpost.com/software/daver-proxy">implementation</a> that was submitted for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Affinidi’s PoCathon&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

  <p>We know unit testing is a vital part of the software development process. We also know us developers love to debate techniques, frameworks, strategies, and how different layers and components need testing. Unit tests are the most valuable when they are stable, fast, and reproducible.</p>

<p>Spring Boot is known to reduce boilerplate code and make development extremely efficient, but it can come with a cost when it comes down to the testing. Without prior optimization, tests can run for a considerable time—most of it is wasted on unnecessary initialization of the application, significantly delaying the feedback loop.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn about Spring Boot testing capabilities to optimize integration tests.</p>

 Write Tests with the <code>@SpringBootTest</code> Annotation 

<p>The <code>@SpringBootTest</code> annotation automagically spins up your application with all dependencies instrumenting it for use in tests. It can replace dependencies and provide customized properties for the application context. This annotation is a great tool and an easy way to get your application ready for testing.</p>

 When to Avoid <code>@SpringBootTest</code> Annotation 

<p>Say you want to test an HTTP layer (controller, authentification, <code>@ControllerAdvice</code>, etc.) At first, it might look like the <code>@SpringBootTest</code> annotation would be an appropriate choice here - it bootstraps the whole application the same way as it would be running otherwise. I’ve seen this is a default option for most of the Spring Boot integration tests.</p>

<p>While it works, there are several downsides:</p>

 
   Integration tests with <code>@SpringBootTest</code> can take a very long time to start—most of it related to database initialization, the configuration of remote sources, and other IO (input/output). 
   Although you intend to check the HTTP layer, all other components are created, even not in use. That causes unnecessary dependencies, causes flakiness, and could be challenging to run on the CI pipeline due to a restricted environment. 
   External test data becomes a hard dependency, and it must be either provisioned before the application starts or shared. In many cases, such a setup can cause many nuances that make it hard to work with. 
 

 Where Can <code>@SpringBootTest</code> Be a Good Fit? 

<p>End-to-end tests would be the best place for the tests with <code>@SpringBootTest</code>, assuming the whole application is a black box.
Test Slices is a solution for the slowly running tests. Most of the unit tests don’t require complete application bootstrap but rather some slices (layers of the application):</p>

 
   Most MVC layers 
   Database / repositories 
   Whole application 
 

 Spring Boot Test Slices Overview 

<p>In this tutorial, you will use Spring Boot Test Slices to test components that require complex Spring Context and therefore aren’t easy to construct manually. I focus on the three most vital parts of any Spring Boot-based service: Controller, Service, Repository. Most of the applications have authentication functionality in the real world, and its testing could be very complex, especially without <code>@SpringBootTest</code> annotation.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>+ 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI 0.8.0+</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker &amp; Docker-Compose (for development environment)</a> 
 

<p>Start with cloning this repo: <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-slices-example">oktadev/okta-spring-boot-slices-example</a></p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-slices-example.git
cd okta-spring-boot-slices-example
</code>   

<p>This example application is a Spring Boot service that counts page visits of different users. It uses Okta configured with Spring Security to distinguish between users and secure your service. For database storage, I use PostgreSQL with Spring JPA, Mustache for templating, and the project is done in Kotlin programming language.</p>

 Test the Spring Boot Controller Layer 

<p>As with any genuine web service, this application depends on external services which need provisioning before the application starts.</p>

 Add Authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>At this step, your application has configuration done, and the properties file contains credentials.</p>

<p>⚠️ You should never commit your credentials to your version control system.</p>

 Start PostgreSQL Database with Docker Compose 

<p>Since the application is dependent on PostgreSQL, you need to have it running. I’ve prepared a Docker Compose file for development purposes—it’s an easy way to spin up a local database instance.</p>

<p>In the project’s root directory, run:</p>

   <code>docker-compose -f docker-compose.devenv.yml up
</code>   

<p>Open another terminal window and start the app.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Open <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and should see something like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Run Test Suite with Gradle 

<p>To run all tests execute in the project’s root directory:</p>

   <code>./gradlew clean test
</code>   

<p>This command displays outcome:</p>

   <code>&gt; Task :test
 
 ViewersServiceIntegrationTest
 
   ✔ insertOrIncrementViews creates a new visitor record when need()
   ✔ insertOrIncrementViews increments counter for existing visitor()
 
 ViewersRepositoryIntegrationTest
 
   ✔ insert two visitors and find all()
   ✔ incrementVisit adds single visit()
   ✔ compute average amount of visits per user()
 
 VisitCounterControllerIntegrationTest
 
   ✔ signin redirect works()
   ✔ greet authenticated user()
   ✔ renders provided data from the viewersService visiting as a guest()
   ✔ greet guest()
 
 9 passing (11.3s)
 
 
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 26s
</code>   

 Test Controllers with <code>@WebMvcTest</code> 

<p>In a Spring MVC application, controllers often guard the HTTP layer. For instance, it is responsible for parsing request parameters from URL, headers, and body, performing deserialization where needed, selecting the right handler, and performing routing.</p>

<p>When used with Spring Security, it can perform user authorization seamlessly.
Take a look at <code>src/main/kotlin/com/example/okta/testslices/controller/VisitCounterController.kt</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.example.okta.testslices.controller

import com.example.okta.testslices.service.ViewersService
import org.springframework.security.core.AuthenticatedPrincipal
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView
import org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView

@Controller
class VisitCounterController(
    private val viewersService: ViewersService
) {

    @GetMapping("/")
    fun index(@AuthenticationPrincipal user: AuthenticatedPrincipal?): ModelAndView { 
        val myUsername = user?.name ?: "guest" // ❶

        viewersService.insertOrIncrementViews(myUsername) // ❷

        return ModelAndView( // ❸
            "index",
            mapOf(
                "avgVisitsPerUser" to viewersService.averagesViewsPerUser().toInt(),
                "username" to myUsername,
                "visitors" to viewersService.allViewers(),
                "isGuest" to user?.name.isNullOrBlank()
            )
        )
    }

    @GetMapping("/signin")
    fun loginRedirector(): RedirectView =
        RedirectView("/oauth2/authorization/okta")
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>index()</code> method:</p>

 
   Gets user login if a user is signed in 
   Counts current visit of the user 
   Retrieves data for rendering from the services 
 

<p>The second endpoint <code>loginRedirector</code> simply provides a convenience method that redirects the user to start OAuth 2.0 flow for the identity provider - in my application, it’s Okta.</p>

 Test Controllers with <code>MockMvc</code> 

<p>The corresponding test is located in the <code>src/test/kotlin/.../controller/VisitCounterControllerIntegrationTest.kt</code> file. Note, I added <code>Integration</code> to the name of the file and class to indicate that it isn’t a simple unit test to set expectations right.</p>

   <code>package com.example.okta.testslices.controller

import com.example.okta.testslices.entity.ViewerModel
import com.example.okta.testslices.service.ViewersService
import org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsStringIgnoringCase
import org.hamcrest.Matchers.stringContainsInOrder
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import org.mockito.Mockito.*
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean
import org.springframework.http.MediaType.TEXT_HTML
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.user.OAuth2User
import org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.oauth2Login
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.get

@WebMvcTest(VisitCounterController::class)
internal class VisitCounterControllerIntegrationTest {
    @Autowired
    private lateinit var mockMvc: MockMvc

    @MockBean
    private lateinit var viewersService: ViewersService
    // your tests here
}
</code>   

<p>This test injects a mock of the service the controller depends on - <code>ViewersService</code> using annotation <code>@MockBean</code>. You should always provide dependencies for your controller; otherwise, it can’t be instantiated.</p>

<p>Look at the simple test for URL handling redirection to the specific authorization page.</p>

   <code>@Test
fun `signin redirect works`() {
    // when
    mockMvc.get("/signin") {
        accept = TEXT_HTML
    }.andExpect {
        // then
        status { is3xxRedirection() }
        status { redirectedUrlPattern("**/oauth2/**") }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Spring Boot provides neat Kotlin DSL extensions making it easy to write and read tests. From the example above, it’s pretty clear what is being tested in this test.</p>

 Test User Authentication 

<p>The application renders the main page differently depending on if the user is logged in. In the following two tests, it verifies that the correct user name is used on the page.</p>

   <code>@Test
fun `greet guest`() {
    // when
    mockMvc.get("/") {
        accept = TEXT_HTML
    }.andExpect {
        // then
        status { isOk() }
        content {
            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("G'day, guest"))
        }
    }
}

@Test
fun `greet authenticated user`() {
    // given
    val oauth2User = mock(OAuth2User::class.java).also {
        doReturn("Nikolay").`when`(it).name
    }

    // when
    mockMvc.get("/") {
        accept = TEXT_HTML
        with(oauth2Login().oauth2User(oauth2User))
    }.andExpect {
        // then
        status { isOk() }
        content {
            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("G'day, Nikolay"))
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note how easy it is to inject <code>OAuth2User</code> with the <code>oauth2Login()</code> helper function available from the <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency.</p>

 Test Rendered Data from the Mocked Service 

<p>The <code>ViewersService</code> returns user and statistics data which is rendered in the template. The test below validates that data is mapped correctly.</p>

   <code>@Test
fun `renders provided data from the viewersService visiting as a guest`() {
    // given
    `when`(viewersService.averagesViewsPerUser()).thenReturn(42.0)
    `when`(viewersService.allViewers()).thenReturn(
        listOf(
            ViewerModel(1, "Olga", 100),
            ViewerModel(2, "Ketty", 200),
        )
    )

    // when
    mockMvc.get("/") {
        accept = TEXT_HTML
    }.andExpect {
        // then
        status { isOk() }
        content {
            contentTypeCompatibleWith(TEXT_HTML)
            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("G'day, guest"))
            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("there are 42 visits per user"))

            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("Ketty: 200"))
            string(containsStringIgnoringCase("Olga: 100"))
            string(stringContainsInOrder("Olga", "Ketty"))
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Test Your Database Layer with <code>@DataJpaTest</code> 

<p>Often, the database layer is done with Spring Data JPA, which I use in my sample project. Here each visit of the user is recorded in the database. That makes it possible to count the total number of visits overall.</p>

<p>This example uses Spring JPA + PostgreSQL. Truthfully, a specific database doesn’t make much difference as layers of abstractions hide an actual implementation. The database layer contains a single repository definition:</p>

   <code>package com.example.okta.testslices.repository

import com.example.okta.testslices.entity.ViewerModel
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Modifying
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository

@Repository
interface ViewersRepository : JpaRepository&lt;ViewerModel, Long&gt; {
    fun findByUsername(username: String): ViewerModel?

    @Modifying(clearAutomatically = true)
    @Query("UPDATE ViewerModel SET visits = visits + 1 WHERE username = ?1")
    fun incrementVisit(username: String)

    @Query("SELECT AVG(visits) FROM ViewerModel")
    fun averageViewsPerUser(): Double
}
</code>   

<p>This is very much a standard repository with few automagically generated queries.</p>

 Test Spring Boot Database Layer Example 

<p>It’s easy to substitute an actual database with pre-configured in-memory H2 database using <code>@DataJpaTest</code> annotation, and that would work for most cases as long as vendor-specific features aren’t in use.</p>

<p>You’d need two database dependencies—H2 driver for test runtime and fully fledged PostgreSQL driver for default runtime. For that reason <code>build.gradle.kts</code> contains these two lines:</p>

   <code>runtimeOnly("org.postgresql:postgresql")
testRuntimeOnly("com.h2database:h2")
</code>   

<p>That would be sufficient for Spring Boot to discover database dependencies. Note that you don’t override beans manually to provide an additional configuration, as it would be necessary with <code>@SpringBootTest</code> annotation. <code>@DataJpaTest</code> along with <code>@AutoConfigureTestDatabase</code> automatically prepare the context for the repository component and configure the H2 database engine to mimic an actual PostgreSQL instance.</p>

<p>Look at the database level test which is verifying behaviour of the SQL queries in the repository.</p>

            .extracting&lt;Int&gt; { it?.visits }
            .isEqualTo(1001)
    }
}
</code>   

 Integration Test for the Service Layer 

<p>In most instances, service components dependencies are reasonably easy to mock to verify business logic flow. However, having an integration test for the service layer would add extra peace of mind and can help when dealing with complex logic.</p>

<p>Next, look at the integration test implementation for <code>ViewersService</code>, which depends solely on the <code>ViewersRepository</code>. In this setup, <code>ViewersService</code> is actually being tested against the actual database instance.</p>

   <code>package com.example.okta.testslices.service

import com.example.okta.testslices.entity.ViewerModel
import com.example.okta.testslices.repository.ViewersRepository
import org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.jdbc.AutoConfigureTestDatabase
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.jdbc.AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.ANY
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan
import org.springframework.context.annotation.FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE

@DataJpaTest(
    includeFilters = [
        ComponentScan.Filter(ViewersService::class, type = ASSIGNABLE_TYPE)
    ]
)
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = ANY)
internal class ViewersServiceIntegrationTest {
    @Autowired
    private lateinit var viewersService: ViewersService

    @Autowired
    private lateinit var viewersRepository: ViewersRepository

    @Test
    fun `insertOrIncrementViews creates a new visitor record when need`() {
        // when
        viewersService.insertOrIncrementViews("Jafari")

        // then
        assertThat(viewersService.allViewers())
            .hasSize(1)
            .first()
            .satisfies {
                assertThat(it.username).isEqualTo("Jafari")
                assertThat(it.visits).isEqualTo(1)
            }
    }

    @Test
    fun `insertOrIncrementViews increments counter for existing visitor`() {
        // given
        viewersRepository.save(ViewerModel(0, "Karzi", 100))

        // when
        viewersService.insertOrIncrementViews("Karzi")

        // then
        assertThat(viewersService.allViewers())
            .hasSize(1)
            .first()
            .satisfies {
                assertThat(it.username).isEqualTo("Karzi")
                assertThat(it.visits).isEqualTo(101)
            }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The test itself is pretty straightforward; the only caveat is to configure context. That’s done with:</p>

   <code>@DataJpaTest(
 includeFilters = [
     ComponentScan.Filter(ViewersService::class, type = ASSIGNABLE_TYPE)
 ]
)
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = ANY)
</code>   

<p>In this example, <code>@DataJpaTest</code> is instructed to instantiate an additional component, <code>ViewersService</code>.</p>

 Learn More About Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Testing 

<p>In this article, you learned the challenges with integration tests and how to address these problems using Spring Boot Test Slices. You’ve learned the foundations of efficient integration tests implementation using test slices annotations such as <code>@DataJpaData</code> and <code>@WebMvcTest</code>, including authentication with OpenID Connect. Test slices annotations are particular to what they test, and that help to keep code less coupled and easy to maintain.</p>

 Centralized data management is outdated and vulnerable to hacking, says Li Jun of Ontology. Here’s how blockchain can make data more&nbsp;secure. <p>A recent <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/">study</a> on cybersecurity statistics revealed that data breaches exposed 36 billion records in the first half of 2020 alone. If we stop and think about that for a second, it is truly staggering. Users are currently the most vulnerable they have ever been, with the global pandemic exacerbating the risks of fraud as people are forced to increasingly operate online. With the migration of services online has come an increased responsibility to manage the way data is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Traditionally, different sectors have used centralized paper or spreadsheets on internal computers to house information and data sets. However, as we have seen, increasingly sophisticated technology has led to a higher risk of threats to private information, especially when housed on centralized systems. Moving forward, it is essential that businesses and individuals invest in decentralized solutions to store and manage data. On a macro scale, end-to-end technology run on blockchain enables private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. From an individual perspective, investment in decentralized digital identity solutions can help users take back control of how and when their data is shared, especially when the current systems are not taking adequate precautions to protect their&nbsp;privacy.</p> The risks of centralized data <p>Despite unprecedented developments in technology over the past 30 years, many of the systems that underpin the way we share and manage data are frighteningly outdated. Within the healthcare sphere, it is still common practice for hospitals to store patient data on centralized systems. This means that large portions of sensitive patient information are too often stored on computers and spreadsheets with limited security.</p><p>Recent <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/to-pay-or-not-to-pay-hse-faces-a-choice-between-two-evils-following-cyberattack-1.4568665">events</a> within Ireland showcased the inherent risks of housing data like this, as hackers infiltrated the Irish Health Service Executive’s (HSE) centralized systems and stole significant quantities of patients’ personal information. Screenshots and files of patient information were then posted online in a bid to extract a ransom from the government. Reflecting the significant dangers of ineffective data management, the national healthcare service was forced to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13d33a08-ce83-4f8a-8d93-a60a5e097ed8">suspend</a> the majority of its IT systems, causing significant delays and issues for millions of patients at a time when the country was trying to curb its Covid-19 cases. The issue has remained high on the political agenda, with the fallout still being felt by patients, healthcare professionals and the government more than a month&nbsp;later.</p><p>From a security point of view, the implications of this breach were huge. Thousands of people reported receiving <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/hse-hack-scammers-5443123-May2021/">scam</a> texts and emails in the weeks after, suggesting that their information had been shared or sold online. Indeed, sensitive data is a highly valuable resource and can be used to blackmail and discriminate when placed in the wrong hands. On a more global scale, the housing of personal information on centralized social media platforms has led to devastating data breaches over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>Most recently, tech giant Facebook exposed the private emails and numbers of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/04/06/facebook-data-breach-heres-what-to-do-now/?sh=6e91234b5708">533 million users</a> by making changes to its security systems. Since then, there has been a proliferation in scam calls and texts to people across the world, as well as reports of identity <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20345/its-time-to-address-your-data-security-the-same-goes-for-your-bank">theft</a>. In this age, where the fabric of our civilization is underpinned by technology and online interactions, it is more important than ever that companies and individuals work to ensure their private information remains secure and&nbsp;private.</p><p>Without the correct protections in place, centralized systems become dangerous houses of sensitive information. Reflecting this, a study by the <a href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/money/2021/05/24/what-you-should-shredding-and-why/5162830001/">National Association of Information Destruction</a> found that 40% of resold electronic devices contain personally identifiable information including usernames, passwords and credit card information.</p><p>As it stands, consumers have limited knowledge of the huge risks inherent in inputting personal data without any oversight of where it is stored or who can access it. Elsewhere, a study by the Pew Research Center found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81% of participants</a> said that t<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">he potential risks they face because of data collection on the internet outweigh the benefits</a>. Despite this, users still have to provide sensitive personal information to websites which then house their information on ineffective centralized systems that are highly susceptible to breaches.</p> How decentralization can protect data&nbsp;privacy <p>As people increasingly conduct business, socialize, and communicate through the internet, greater checks must be in place to ensure that their privacy is protected and that they control what information they share online. Going forward, a move to decentralized identity solutions is essential to ensure data privacy and security. By facilitating end-to-end technology run on blockchain, decentralized solutions enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. In contrast to centralized solutions, decentralized systems ensure private data remains immutable and secure and is only able to be shared when outlined users consent to provide information.</p><p>Moving forward, any system that is required to store significant swathes of data, whether that’s in healthcare, finance, or the media, must invest in this technology. But it must work both ways and it is also important that individuals take personal responsibility for protecting their own sensitive data. By investing in digital identity solutions, users can take back control of how and when their data is shared, limiting the capacity of hackers and large corporations to collect information that is not authorized. There are many applications that allow users to securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a platform or mobile with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p><p>With the proliferation of the online world and the internet economy, privacy and effective data storage have become all the more important. Current centralized systems cannot protect user information and ensure privacy and data security. To remedy our current vulnerability, it is essential that businesses and individuals invest in decentralized solutions in order to ensure that their most personal information is protected. Decentralized data platforms and digital identity solutions are essential in the fight to protect user data and must be leveraged in order to create a more safe and sustainable data driven ecosystem.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With the Mattereum Protocol <p>The global fine art and antiquities trade is struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model. To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in this space, we have vaulted, passported, and tokenized three distinct artifacts, securing their provenance and trade so their storied value is never&nbsp;lost.</p><p>A story goes that the eccentric master painter Salvador Dalí would — in lieu of paying his restaurant bill with cash — draw a quick sketch on a napkin or one-dollar bill to hand to the staff instead. While this can be seen as certainly odd (true to form) or perhaps even rude (doesn’t help pay the waiter’s bills), one thing is certain: Dalí’s personal brand was and still is capable of a strange alchemy of turning a mundane material into an object of historical and cultural&nbsp;value.</p><p>Which begs the question: If the story of a thing is essential to its value, how do we chronicle this story? How do we ensure that a Dalí piece doesn’t become separated from its history, and consequently, it’s value? Not only for fine art, but for all manner of cultural artifacts?</p><p>The caretakers and curators of works of art, who are often wary of incorporating new technologies into their practice, are struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model around their stock. To work, the solution must be designed with the realities and particularities of their profession in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Enter Mattereum</p><p>To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in the global art and antiquities trade, Mattereum Head of Ontology and former museum curator Dr. James Hester acquired three different cultural artifacts to be vaulted, passported, and tokenized:</p>  A 350,000 year-old stone hand axe excavated from&nbsp;France  A 19th-20th century bronze statue of Buddhist protector deity&nbsp;Acala  A signed and numbered etching by Dalí&nbsp;himself  <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0</a><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Trust Communities, and Real-World Asset&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p><p>Let’s walk through how these three objects were onboarded onto this system. By doing so, we will also unpack the value propositions for the $60 billion fine art and antiquities market.</p> Asset Passports: Securing Identity and Provenance <p>In short, an Asset Passport is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification (with core data points provided by the owner, such as vaulting&nbsp;status).</p><p>Other warranties that may accompany an asset may include a reference to the particular tagging system used for in-person authentication of the item (such as scannable NFC chips affixed to the object) or the token smart contract if the object has been tokenized and “uploaded” to an NFT marketplace.</p><p>For example, the warranties tied to the passported and tokenized etching of Dali’s “Le fuite de Satan” (The Flight of Satan) can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.ph.dali.fuitesatan.1974.129773.3.20/#02_NFT">here</a>:</p><p>Using the Ricardian framework designed by Mattereum Chief Scientist Ian Grigg, all of the legal and digital agreements around these objects are bundled together, signed on the blockchain and stored on IPFS, establishing a secure record of provenance.</p><p>In practice, the Asset Passport aggregates warranties and object data using established best practices. Designed by a former museum curator, experts in the field will appreciate the attention to detail that goes into generating these passports. The dispute resolution and insurance baked in also provides peace of mind for professionals outside&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>It is important to note that the Asset Passport is not a singular or static thing, but an integrated structure composed of software and legal elements which will evolve over time along the object’s journey: a living document.</p><p>An incredible utility of an asset passport is in its composability, the capability of programming value flows and social interactions around the object. Let’s take a look at what we can build on this foundation.</p> Trust Communities: Crowdsourcing Expert Certification <p>In 2018, the Terrus museum in Southern France discovered that over half of its collection — around $190,000 worth — were in fact forgeries.</p><p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd</a></p><p>Unfortunately, stories like this are common in the arts and antiquities world. The sophistication of forgery has only improved over time, and institutions are having to adapt their practice accordingly with methods such as chemical analysis. But despite best efforts, if there is even the slightest chink in the armor, the system will remain vulnerable.</p><p>The prevailing method for certifying fine art and antiquities is a disconnected, patchwork process of consulting specialist firms with data logged in separate silos around the world. This lack of a shared inventory database presents a fundamental flaw at the infrastructure level. There is no single source of truth or a collective means of aggregating this data over time. Until&nbsp;now.</p><p>Once an Asset Passport has been generated, it can give rise to some interesting applications: such as Trust Communities, a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized expert certification that elegantly brings assets from zero history to storied value with built-in legal warranties, insurance, and dispute resolution.</p>Trust Communities<p>By bringing together multiple third-party sources of information on objects, it is possible for an object’s Asset Passport to contain several independent assessments of its authenticity, provenance, and condition. This would enable buyers to get a broader perspective not limited to centralized firms. Experts can also hold each other to account to safeguard against erroneous claims. Through this distributed framework of crowdsourcing expertise, trust becomes a feature powered by community, not simply a risk to be mitigated.</p><p>To further secure this peer-produced, multiplayer approach, all expert certification is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Even if they are not employed by one of the main firms (and wouldn’t this be great for former curators to leverage their experience?), the fact that these experts are willing to put skin in the game and put their own money behind their assessments will not be overlooked by serious curators and collectors.</p><p>The Trust Communities model can aggregate individual expertise with institutional expertise over time, allowing an unprecedented level of trust in the trade of these objects and an ongoing revenue stream for curators, caretakers, and other professionals in the&nbsp;field.</p> NFTs: Bringing Liquidity to Static Inventories <p>In many cases, most of a gallery’s assets are not on display for the public but rather secured in vaults on location or somewhere else entirely. In this state, these objects cannot generate any value. They remain illiquid, static&nbsp;stock.</p><p>Enter Physical Asset&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>A Physical Asset NFT is a unique digital token that denotes the right to take physical delivery of an object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an actual object, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability.</p><p>Turning the NFT into an actual warranty claim within the Asset Passport allows it to denote true ownership of an underlying good in a systemic way rather than what would amount to a mere promise by a stranger on the Internet. The token contract becomes a fundamental part of the deal, with execution of the agreement now deferred to the smart contract. Also, in the case of systemic fallout (software exploits on the protocol or application level) the legal agreement within the passport provides a source of truth for all parties and arbitrators to refer&nbsp;to.</p><p>NFTs connected to an Asset Passport allow any vaulted object to become a liquid, globally-tradable asset. Like the aforementioned <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">artifact collection</a> now live on&nbsp;OpenSea:</p>Live on the OpenSea Marketplace<p>The ease through which these NFTs can be traded allows for truly liquid ownership of otherwise static stock, opening access to cultural capital and providing museums and galleries with a compelling new business&nbsp;model.</p> From Zero History to Storied&nbsp;Value <p>It is our hope that by taking these objects through the full Mattereum Protocol — from assigning an Asset Passport, to vaulting in a secure art storage facility, to generating an NFT to be sold online — dealers and galleries will see how this new technology can benefit their own work and adopt it is an industry standard for the global inventory management of cultural artifacts</p><p>With blockchain-based cryptographic authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, the Mattereum Protocol can resolve the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued the fine art and antiquities markets for generations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/from-zero-history-to-storied-value-securing-and-unlocking-the-art-and-antiquities-markets-with-355e1c3c318">From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Building Civic Tech: A new frontier of our&nbsp;work <p>This is the fourth in a series of DM notes that we write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #4 is a reflection on a new frontier of our work: civic technology development, or how to make things in a complex&nbsp;world.</p> DM’s trajectory: becoming practical strategists and experimental developers <p>When Dark Matter Labs started in 2016, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">our provocation page</a> presenting various visions around the future of civic infrastructures was the core of what we did, which made many people believe we were essentially a think tank. We are not not that, but we are a lot more too, especially as we grew and started crafting these civic infrastructures that we had first only imagined with various partners around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Today, Dark Matter Labs is building a sort of ship, whose form and parts are being imagined, designed and assembled around the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Sometimes, we start by making the systems we work with visible in order to analyse the pain points, underlying drivers and strategic risks of each domain. We build portfolios of experiments to show all the various interconnected ways we could intervene in that system. Out of all of them, we identify the experimental probes to which we can best contribute and work from these starting points to develop and iterate the best initiatives for the targeted domain as well as learn from the system we intervene in.</p><p>Most of our work fall into shared civic infrastructure missions (nature based solutions, spatial justice, mental wealth, etc.) around which we organize internally, in order to maximize our shared value internationally. And beyond each initiative and mission are the shared deep code innovations that we are designing across finance, contracting, data, policy, governance and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This is the dark matter our name refers to; the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the environment around&nbsp;us.</p><p>At that point of the process, our focus shifts from system overview to minimal viable products (MVP), which requires a totally different mindset, posture and process, to rediscover how systems work by now acting within them. This last part is a new frontier for us. It raises questions internally such&nbsp;as:</p>  How do we go from from system change mapping to&nbsp;MVP?  How does this fit within and change our current practices?  What is our added value in this sphere globally?  What are the challenges with the rest of our work (different business model, ways of working,&nbsp;etc.)?   Civic technology development at&nbsp;DML <p>During our DM download on civic technology development, we discussed the need to build the right thing, as well as building the thing right. That is to say: making sure we are setting up partnerships, projects and explorations as places to answer key, difficult questions (as opposed to making a thing our research and modelling tell us we need to make). We talked about how this currently requires an organisational transition as opposed to purely looking at how to set up teams to build digital products. It is a mindset shift that we‘ll have to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>The complex future states, theories and potential answers that we have been communicating to you in blogs and reports are just a starting point for us. We use these starting points to explore, test and iteratively build products/systems, based on the insights we gather as we go. And we’re not precious about whether our original theory was right as long as we achieve the outcome we desire. We look for commonalities that make our products/systems scalable and transferrable.</p><p>You’ve been reading about our theories and provocations in blogs. More and more, you’ll be able to see how we experiment with them and reshape them until they become actual things that you can see in the world around&nbsp;you.</p> What we are learning from some of the civic technologies in the&nbsp;making <p>Proof of concept or proof of possibility, prototype, experimental probe, pilot, MVP — what’s in a name? We are still exploring which methods of testing and developing are best suited for the kind of work we want to accomplish, and so these terms are being used here loosely for the moment. While we clarify our own glossary of terms. Y<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/proof-of-concept-prototype-pilot-mvp-whats-in-a-name/">ou can find how Nesta defines them&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Futurefit — Proof of&nbsp;concept <p>This body of work looks at how we can encourage more collective forms of retrofit and energy efficiency measures, as a vehicle for Covid recovery and a more just, democratic climate transition</p><p>One of the key challenges of retrofit is a distinct lack of open and available building data — both in terms of basic information and in its energy performance. Here our ambition was to make an early proof of concept for an open retrofit data map, combining and cleaning existing public datasets, to show potential places for focus in a retrofit&nbsp;scheme.</p><p>Rather than viewing this as a top-down analytical tool, the aim was to give citizens more information about their buildings, and create a first step in encouraging the self-selection of groups of residents to upgrade their homes. Alongside this process we outlined a new collective service model for a multi-family apartment block to be able to retrofit their homes, reimagining the role of the administration de condominio could play in facilitating this&nbsp;process.</p><p>We’re currently working on the potential next steps of this tool with the Comune di&nbsp;Milano.</p> Nouveaux voisins — Prototype +&nbsp;Pilot <p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p><p>We worked with <a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> to develop the prototype of a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. Many of the functions were inspired by their pilot projects on the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Doing completely analog pilot projects, no matter how small, can help inform the sort of civic infrastructure required to support a broader movement and scaling model for the initiative (see example below from Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins)  No matter how detailed your complex paper prototype is, moving it toward a minimum viable product requires to take a step back and test many assumptions in order to move from what felt like a complex integrated platform to what seems like a very basic one. And that’s&nbsp;ok.   Amsterdam CE — Experimental probe + pilot (in progress) <p>Understanding and unfolding existing legal structure of Dutch law and visualizing the articles and different connections to make them more transparent and easier to understand. With goal to make it easier for lawmakers to make the needed change and transition towards a just circular economy in effective time.</p><p>One of the aims of this initiative is to make laws and their articles to be machine readable and indexable, so it can be easier for lawmakers to see connections and people associated with each law. We are also exploring the needed culture and way of working to use and maintain the tool and its&nbsp;data.</p><p>Learning about the system by trying to change it through an experimental probe of what could be is the stage we are at&nbsp;here.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Laws are tend to be complex and nuanced, it is difficult to label and index to a particular category. We have a created a decision tree to add the needed structure and using degrees and threshold measures to encode the minute&nbsp;details  A regulatory dashboard is only one tool towards a broader cultural shift in how the administration functions, it cannot stand&nbsp;alone  This is not the kind of project that can be done all at once; it requires a team to develop it iteratively to maintain&nbsp;it   TreesAI — MVP (in progress) <p><a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">Trees as Infrastructure</a> establishes nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure, alongside bridges, roads and rail, enabling investment, profitability and sustainability.</p><p>Currently trees and urban nature are just seen as maintenance costs in city budget sheets. We are trying to establish urban nature’s true value in terms of all the benefits they bring and their associated financial value so they can be maintained systematically.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  We better understand which data parameters are needed to give accurate calculations of tree benefits, and cities have completely different data landscape.  There is big need for data informed decision making when it comes to nature based solutions  Cities lack the budget and capacity to create and maintain the needed digital civic infrastructure required  There is an abundance of existing open source tools, however the challenge is how to integrate them best to our needs and for the long term without reinventing the&nbsp;wheel  Open source project does not mean that you just plug and play with it for your needs; it requires significant work and skill capacity in order to adapt it to the intended&nbsp;use   Moving Forward — Key Questions <p>As DM moves into the development of key civic technologies such as the ones presented above, it will require not only that we organize differently internally, but that we also work collaboratively internationally around some of the key following questions:</p>  Because they will need to exist outside the specific domain of market and state, how do you preserve the public good independently of where the capital comes from? How do we subordinate capital to the governance for public&nbsp;good?  Public investments for this work are typically focused on what exactly is needed to do be accomplished. However, many of the challenges we face are too complex to know how to address them at the outset. How do we invent investment mechanisms for the discovery of the public good as we&nbsp;go?  We need very clear do no harm principles of how these civic technologies are developed, used, what frameworks they create and what the implications are. How do we do&nbsp;that?  It has been shown how many AI technologies replicate the biases from the data it was based out of. If we want more power in the hands of communities, how do we create UX and transparency to avoid creating unconscious biases in the behavioural economics it&nbsp;creates?  Maintenance of civic tech when it doesn’t have the security of the state of large private investment is a big challenge. How do we create open and transparent maintenance friendly tech without increasing rent seeking infrastructures for private&nbsp;capital?  How do we insure the sustainability and longevity of these services outside traditional institutional models of&nbsp;support?  How can we be open and declarative assumptions &amp; references so as to create the hypothesis that the decision making can be interrogated and challenged and create accountability for stakeholders?  How do we construct new frameworks of accountability to all stakeholders, both future and&nbsp;present.  How do we build civic tech with open unitary modular blocks of value, adopting a modular design principle in which we subdivide a future system into smaller parts, which can and should be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with other modules or between different systems.

<p>Lack of great user experiences is often raised as one of decentralized identity’s (and public blockchain’s) missing ingredients for ubiquitous adoption. However to arrive at usable experiences across the industry, we first need to reach consensus around basic user personas and mental models, then design and build interoperable system accordingly.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-internets-missing-identity-layer-3934b23b6c22">the internet’s missing identity layer</a>” we took a stab at an acceptable set of personas and solution criteria for this self described identity&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we also observed how users already interact with identity concepts in their day-to-day economic activities, and the artifacts they use as tools to accomplish them.</p><p>This article explores the different aspects of how a typical user understands concepts related to identity through the use of economic, cognitive, and design lenses, as well as through historical observation and application of first principles.</p> Summary <p>No typical human explicitly understand abstract terms like “identity”. They may intuitively understand some well-defined concepts without ability to articulate what they are, while other terms they will understand explicitly. We start by defining a few abstract terms such as digital identity, identity systems, social contexts, etc and move on to more explicitly understood terms.</p><p>As a result of exploring a typical user’s mental models of identity-related concepts, and historical patterns of human economic activities, we identify more innate concepts such as self-identities, perceived identities, accounts, conversations, messages, etc.</p><p>We then explore how multiple identities play a part of a user’s cognitive understanding of their place within multiple social contexts as well as task-based contexts with anonymous and pseudonymous identities.</p><p>Then we explore how identity-related tools and artifacts have historically been used and understood by people, including how they use artifacts that function as IDs, credentials, and/or keys, as well as how for managing large numbers of artifacts we use complementary organization and storage&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Building systems and applications that operate based on concepts parallel to a typical user’s mental models, will inherently result in better user experiences, as well as more intuitive understanding of underlying processes.</p> Definitions <p>As explained in “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/what-identity-means-e998291668f9">What identity means</a>” the word “identity” is overloaded on many levels. Few regular users understand abstract words like identity, authentication, credentials, or authorization. So here, let’s reiterate the key terms and concepts that will be reused throughout this article to discuss users’ consciously or subconsciously understanding.</p><p>Identity systems — The identity industry is built upon the building, maintaining and usage of identity systems, that ultimately help us be more efficient and secure our daily transactions against undesired outcomes.</p><p>Identity instances — Any virtual representation of persons or organizations in any system be they digital, paper-based, or&nbsp;mental.</p><p>Cognitive realm — The sometimes oversimplified approach of looking at our cognition as systems and processes, can result in valuable insights. As such the cognitive realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto our mental information space.</p><p>Digital realm — As a subject of interest and source of great societal impact, digital systems are of growing importance in our lives, highlighted by the prominence of internet, web and so called “cyberspace”. The digital realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto digital systems in the form of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Digital identities — a sub-type of identity instance — within the context of digital identity systems these are specific instances of an an entity’s representation, a digital twin so to speak. In other words, digital identities, are records of a person or organization within digital systems that are uniquely secured for common operations such as lookup, authentication, recovery, sharing,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Social context —aka Social circle — Is both a mental and sociological context that is defined within a well-known social circle. For example, close friends and professional social circles are two completely different contexts with different rules. Accordingly, we mentally identify as separate (yet related) beings depending on this&nbsp;context.</p><p>Self-identity —aka Self — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies the “self” within a given social context. For example the “self” of personal relationships is different than that of professional social&nbsp;circles.</p><p>Perceived-identity —aka Identity — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies other people or organizations, again within the context of a given social&nbsp;context.</p><p>Identity information (fragment) — Additional information associated with an identity that further describes a person, organization or thing, and possibly helps identify it through language, visual or other sensory&nbsp;input.</p>Identity in the cognitive domain<p>Our goals in designing intuitive identity systems for consumers, will often require us to align the concepts and taxonomy used to that of our natural mental&nbsp;models.</p> Economic activities and mental&nbsp;models <p>As subjects of life evolution, we are inherently economic individuals and societies. As such our mental models have evolved with significant influence from the economic activities that most help sustain us and our societies. With this view we can look at human mental model of specific types of activities, artifacts, tools and mental contexts that are closely related to our use of identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>You can argue that our minds come equipped with a cognitive identity system, one that intuitively interoperates with the real world, and is sometimes aided by external identity systems such as digital or paper-based ones, ultimately forming a hybrid&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we touched on the frequent and high-value activities that help us support transactions.</p>Transaction support activities<p>These activities point to five distinct mental contexts involved in said supporting activities, namely:</p>  Information (or data) — Is the generalized form of information about the real world, and how we organize and make sense of&nbsp;it.  Identities (self and perceived) — Are the representation instances of self and others within various and specific social contexts, enhanced by trust information.  Money (or valuables) — Is the mental monetary understanding of valuables natural to our evaluation of property, transactions and&nbsp;surplus.  Connections (or contacts and relationships) — Is the mental social understanding around the state and protocols of belonging to specific groups or relationships, and the mutual expectations that go with building relationships.  Messages (or conversations) — Is the mental orientation having to do with communication and the mechanics of conversations in terms of single or fragmented messages and their&nbsp;replies.  Transaction support activities and mental&nbsp;contexts<p>The above root level concepts are generally well understood by typical users. In addition, the following extended list of core concepts are expected to be explicitly understood by typical users, as they seem to represent innate cognitive constructs:</p>  Information (fragment) — Given the composability of information, humans intuitively understand and handle fragments of information for the purposes of mental storing, organizing and retrieving. A typical user however may be unable to articulate what an information fragment They can however intuitively navigate information systems such as libraries, books, newspapers, etc. Information systems such as the world wide web provide functionality of digitally publishing, addressing, organizing and consuming public information.  Social circle (or context) —As detailed in our definitions, as humans we intuitively and explicitly aware of social circles or contexts we are a part of. These contexts vary across different groups, common goals and interests, as well as particular relationships with individuals.  Self-identity —Depending on a given social context, we take on dynamic roles which manifests in separate but related self-identities. Simple examples are our roles and identities as parents, siblings, citizens, team members,&nbsp;etc.  Self-identity information (fragment)—For each given social context and self-identity there may be unique fragments of information that we associate with ourselves and potentially present to others. For example we may take on a special nickname for designated social contexts such amongst close friends, or amongst our extended&nbsp;family.  (Perceived) Identity — High level information about another person (or organization’s) is mentally stored for the purposes of identifying that person in future interactions. This is different than that person’s self- identity which belongs to them, however it is deeply affected by how that person presents themselves, and asks to be remembered. Humans may not explicitly know they are dealing with a perceived identity but they can intuitively navigate it, even with help of external tools such as directories and address books&nbsp;etc.  (Perceived) Identity information (fragment) —Each given perceived identity is mentally associated with possibly unique fragments of information. For example we may remember a friend’s phone number, as well as a secret handshake between&nbsp;us.  Connection (or contacts and relationships) —Perceived identities can be mentally stored even without an actual connection or relationship existing. Connections suggest the existence of some state of trust or long term understanding between two parties or an individual and a group. As such connections often require varying levels of maintenance.  Account (or perceived connection) —When dealing with businesses who keep track of customers, we often perform the equivalent of opening up an account with them. This is essentially the other party’s record or mental store of their connection with us. The goal is often for that business and us to help maintain the state of that account in good standing.  Conversation —As part of connections with others we may perform long-term and short term conversations with them. We may mentally store and recall the state of these conversations, or use external tools such as letters or digital messages to keep track of&nbsp;them.  Message —Messages are the atomic sub-component of conversations, that can be mentally tracked individually. As humans we can intuitively recall specific messages and their contexts, as well as navigate external tools such as IM or email that enhance&nbsp;them.  <p>As a result of the users’ explicit understanding of these concepts, they are expected to be intuitive to deal with as digitally represented artifacts.</p> Multi-identity <p>As mentioned in the previous sections, a person’s self-identity is not one static thing, it morphs depending on the context of the social circle or context it is embedded in. Each of these multiple identities take on a well-defined role within their target social context, and may be associated with separate identity information fragments.</p>Cognitive multi-identity<p>A list of some well known social contexts include but are not limited&nbsp;to:</p><p>Core — this is what a person means to themselves. It represent ones relationship to themselves and the core of one’s identity.</p>  Public (social) — This is the most public aspect of our self identities there for all to see. This context has not commonly existed before the advent of internet and social networks. An example of the digital representation of our identity in this context is our facebook public&nbsp;profile.  Social (within a given circle) — A context meant mainly for general socializing and forming medium strength social connections within a social group bound by factors such as class, geography, beliefs, or other&nbsp;factors.  Professional (in a given field) — The context represented by professionals working within a given group with the same company, organization, career path, specialization, etc. LinkedIn is a typical professional social&nbsp;network.  Intellectual (general and/or in a given intellectual field)— A social arena where people pursue thought leadership or patronage in order to share or add to their intellectual prowess. Specific fields of academia fit this context. Also twitter can be typically identified as an intellectual-based social&nbsp;network.  Sports (general and/or a specific sport)— A social community where people may share and consume sports news, reactions and trivia as well as participate in actual sport competitions. The team a person plays sports on, or the office’s sport tournament bracket are examples of such contexts.  Romance (and/or sexuality)— Social networks or mutual relationships based on romance or possibility of finding it. Dating networks or events, as well as people’s romantic relationships are examples of such contexts.  Family (core and/or extended)— Social groups based on family relations be they small and intimate or larger and more extended. A person’s immediate family including partner and children, or extended family such as grandparents and cousins are examples of such contexts.  Friends (core and/or extended) — A group of mutual friends, a pair of best friends, or the larger circle of past friends can make up the friends social&nbsp;context.  Acquaintances — The larger circle of temporary or relatively weak social relationship that we maintain in case they become advantageous at a later time. Networking activities and events are one of the way people gain new acquaintances.  Retail (or other consumption)— The relationships we have with brands and companies we transact with to purchase goods, products and services. These relationship contexts are often isolated and transactional, although they may be persistent across sessions of interaction.  Citizenship (local, state and/or national)— The social context of belonging and feeling allegiance to a given locality, state or nation. This often comes with a sense of community and loyalty to the larger&nbsp;entity.  Common interest (or hobby)— A social group brought together by common interests such as a hobby, technology, activity or topic. Such social contexts often benefit from a sense of community due to the fringe nature of the participants’ interests.  <p>There are certain task-based relationships where one’s self identity is not consequential. Often such tasks can be completed using a completely or partially anonymous identity, at other times they can be accomplished using a synonymous identity that is correlated across sessions yet unidentified and uncorrelated to other identities.</p>  Anonymous — A completely unidentified and un-correlate-able one-time-use identity. This type of identity offers maximum privacy benefits.  Incognito —aka partially anonymous — Mostly anonymous with some correlate-able or identifiable information out of necessity. It is essentially a partially anonymous identity for when complete anonymity cannot be achieved due to technical or environmental limitations.  Pseudonymous — An unidentified persona that is correlate-able across sessions. It is used when anonymity is desired but some state across sessions is required for things to go smoothly.  <p>For example buying a pack of cigarettes from a convenience store using cash can be done mostly anonymously, however creating content and building reputation in social media can be done pseudonymously. Browsing the internet can be performed in incognito mode which is mostly anonymous but leaks information such as your IP&nbsp;address.</p> Identity as a&nbsp;tool <p>Often the way identity concept manifest themselves in the external physical or virtual worlds has to do with how we use “identity” as a tool for accomplishing everyday&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">The economics of identity systems</a>” we take an in depth look at how we historically use identity-related artifacts and tools, and reveal the insight that despite going various waves of technologies, we have been using them to accomplish the same set of activity&nbsp;verbs.</p><p>Artifacts we tend to use by the name ID, identification card, or identity, across different technology waves have historically performed a combination of one, some or all of the following functions:</p>  Identification artifact —aka ID (or identification document)— Act as a medium for the user to communicate identifying information such as name, address, etc to another party in order to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.  Credential — Is used to present a claim and/or to promote the user’s perceived level of trustworthiness to a transaction participant, by demonstrating verification by a trusted third&nbsp;party.  Key — Is used to securely interact with a system and access its functions, as the system prevents unauthorized parties from access. This is typically done by authenticating the key artifact used and trusting that the holder was originally granted that key, or is authorized by the&nbsp;grantee.  ID functions mapped to tools and&nbsp;verbs<p>When dealing with a large number of these artifacts and tools, we often resort to using additional organization and access of tools. These tools in turn seem to naturally function in parallel to how we mentally organize and access the related concepts.</p><p>For example for physical tools like hammers and wrenches, we use complementary tools such as tool-belts and toolboxes to either temporarily store and immediately access them, or store them for longer term storage and&nbsp;access.</p><p>For artifacts such as ID (identification document) cards, keys, payment cards, or contact cards we utilize similar storage and organization tools such as wallets, keychains, and rolodexes.</p>Tool, tool-belt, toolbox analogy for identity system artifacts Conclusion <p>Our ultimate goal of understanding the mental models of typical users is building intuitive identity systems and applications. They need to operate based on parallel concepts to said mental models in order to achieve better user experiences and intuitive processes.</p><p>This article takes a good stab at identifying concepts that are likely to be innate to human cognitive constructs, and how multiple identities innately make up people’s understanding of themselves. It also touches on the common patterns of artifact and tool usage, as well as complementary storage and organization tools.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/how-humans-understand-identity-367200ae9591">How humans understand identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity">Universal Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					<p>In 2019, Trinsic launched the first verifiable credentials platform, enabling developers to easily implement digital trust into any application for the first time. Since then, our APIs have been used by more than 2,000 developers and supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through this period of growth and by working closely with our customers, we’ve learned what is needed to take our platform to the next level, and we’re thrilled to announce the largest upgrade to our platform since its launch. The next version of the Trinsic platform is 10x as accessible, 100x more performant, and 1,000x more scalable. And it is available now. Keep reading to see how you can start using it.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing Trinsic Core 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Before diving into the specifics of the platform upgrade, we need to introduce a new term. Up to this point, we have referred to Trinsic’s APIs for verifiable credential exchange as simply the Trinsic platform. Moving forward, we will refer to these APIs as Trinsic Core. We decided to name our API platform Core because it underpins all of our current and future products. Trinsic Core is infrastructure for digital trust in the same way that Stripe is infrastructure for payments or Twilio is infrastructure for communications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our original tech stack, Trinsic Core v1, is what our customers use today and as mentioned above, supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world. Core v1 uses JSON credentials, CL signatures native to the Hyperledger Indy SDK, Hyperledger Aries exchange protocols, and DIDComm v1.¹</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, as the size and complexity of our customers’ use cases grew, there were scaling and performance requirements that the original open source codebases for verifiable credential exchange listed above were not able to meet. And that is why we have built Trinsic Core v2—the largest upgrade to our digital trust infrastructure to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, we will continue to support Trinsic Core v1 which is generally available now by signing up for a free <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> account. With that said, we invite all current and new customers to try out Trinsic Core v2 and experience the future of digital trust infrastructure.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What's new with Trinsic Core v2 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Trinsic Core v2 meets the scaling, interoperability, and performance enhancements our customers, and the world at large, need to deploy verifiable credentials in production. It uses the latest standards that are emerging as the de facto, next-generation standards for verifiable credential exchange. These include JSON-LD credentials, BBS+ signatures, and decentralized identifiers. To learn a little more about each of these specifications, click on the drop-down below.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>JSON-LD credentials</a>
					 
					 <p>We follow the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#json-ld">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, so there’s no vendor lock-in when using the Trinsic. We use an encoding format called JSON Linked Data so that the data within a credential can be described using self-contained URIs.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>BBS+ signatures</a>
					 
					 <p>The BBS+ Signature Suite provides the capability to perform zero-knowledge proof disclosures on datasets. When used in tandem with a verifiable credential, these signatures empower individuals to prove things about themselves with minimal data disclosure.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Decentralized identifiers</a>
					 
					 <p>Taken from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, a decentralized identifier is “a portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef”.</p> 
				 
								 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					The chart above lists out the open source specifications that make up Trinsic Core. The specifications that are included in Trinsic Core v1 is in the "Current, in production" column. You can use Trinsic Core v1 today by signing up for a free Trinsic Studio account at studio.trinsic.id. Trinsic Core v2 is in the highlighted yellow area. Our beta release of Trinsic Core v2 (the second column) is available for customers to start using now.

					<p>For verifiable credentials to achieve adoption at scale, they need to be easy to implement for developers and easy to adopt for end users. As we move forward with Trinsic Core v2, we are getting closer to making the user experience of sharing verifiable credentials as seamless as using Apple Pay. Trinsic Core v2 has the following advantages that will help make this a reality:<br><br></p>  Scalability: Trinsic Core v2 can support tens of millions of people using their credentials several times per day.  Performance: Trinsic Core v2 enables near-instant verifications (&lt;200 milliseconds).  Accessibility: Trinsic Core v2 makes it so that digital wallets are available across devices, browsers, and platforms. People will be able to access their credentials from any device, and developers no longer have to write an entirely new framework from scratch to integrate digital wallet capabilities using their preferred language.  Built for Ecosystems: Trinsic Core v2 was developed from the beginning to integrate with <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>, the only product developed specifically for providers of digital trust ecosystems.  Unopinionated technology: While our initial beta release supports the latest standards such as JSON-LD verifiable credential data model, BBS+ signatures, and DIDComm v2 messaging formats, Trinsic Core v2 is architected from the beginning to be agnostic to ledger, transport, payload, signature scheme, etc. That means over time, Trinsic Core will easily allow developers to tailor their preferred technical standards to their ecosystems.

         Tokeny Has Solved the Problem of Gas Fees  8 July 2021             
	 
		 
			<p>For a long time, gas fees have been a huge issue for public blockchain users; especially within the Ethereum mainnet in the past 12 months. While crypto users complain about the high and unstable gas fees preventing them access to DeFi, financial institutions are struggling to quantify their future costs and how they will add crypto tokens to their balance sheet if they enter the public blockchain space.</p>
 What are gas fees? 
<p>First, let’s walk you through some basic knowledge of gas fees. Gas fees are the cost of transactions on the blockchain. More precisely, they are the fees you pay as a blockchain user to reward the individuals and companies securing the network.</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum uses a consensus protocol called Proof-of-Work (PoW). It is an algorithm that sets mathematical computations for miners to solve. Once those puzzles are solved by miners, new transactions will be encoded into a block and added to the blockchain. When a miner finds the correct answer, they can produce a block and receive gas fees as a reward. Miners are the individuals and companies that participate in this process with powerful computers. Furthermore, their computers often conduct the ‘trial and error’ method to find the solutions. It requires strong computation power that runs day and night, all around the world.</p>
 Gas fees are unpredictable and complex 
<p>As each block space is finite, miners will obviously pick the highest gas fee bid transactions to prioritize. Therefore, you will need to overbid on gas fees to get the transactions validated quickly. Your transaction is therefore in competition with others, and also depends on the value of the crypto token you must use to pay (e.g. ETH on Ethereum). Paying for the infrastructure only when you use it is great, but not being able to predict how much you will have to pay is obviously an issue. It is difficult to define operational costs and how to recharge them to clients. Basically, it requires a whole process for institutions to buy crypto at a reasonable price, store them in secure wallets, and, at the same time, make them available for their employees when they perform actions on security tokens. On the other hand, some institutions are not even allowed to buy and keep crypto due to regulation or their own risk policies, or accounting difficulties.</p>
 Tokeny made gas fees disappear 
<p>For a long time, we’ve been looking for solutions to solve the gas fee issues. Because we believe that public blockchains are valuable as ecosystems, we didn’t want to start issuing security tokens on private or nascent blockchains. Obviously, our customers were not alone in facing these gas fees issues, millions of users and developers needed to fix this as well. That’s mostly why amazing new solutions came up recently in the market, such as sidechains, layer 2 solutions and other technical improvements, leveraging the decentralization of Ethereum but validating transactions differently, mostly with Proof-of-Stake mechanisms.</p>
<p>After long research, tests and discussions with people involved in the industry, we decided to make our EVM compatible platform evolved in order to issue, manage and transfer security tokens on the Polygon network. In April, we <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-solutions-and-polygon-enter-a-partnership-to-improve-accessibility-of-security-tokens/">partnered with Polygon</a>, a layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-​compatible blockchain networks. With Polygon, the gas fee has been reduced by over 10,000 times. It now costs less than $0.01 per transaction.</p>
<p>While the cost of transactions is no longer the issue as the gas fees become so low, the complexity of the process remains. Users still need to go to cryptocurrency exchanges to buy MATIC – the crypto token used to pay the gas fees on Polygon. The problem with this process becomes more complicated for financial institutions, as some don’t even know how or where their balance sheets will include these crypto-costs going forward.</p>
<p>It was therefore clear to us that the key to getting traditional players and investors to embrace tokenized securities is to provide them with a better user experience by making the gas fee process disappear. To achieve this goal, we have developed a solution called the “Polygon Gas Tank”. Basically, the system monitors the balance of MATIC tokens in issuer’, agents’ and investors’ wallets. When it falls below the balance threshold, the Polygon Gas Tank will top up the wallet with more MATIC tokens automatically, and for free. As a result, our users always have enough MATIC tokens to cover their gas fees. In other words, we’ve got this covered, users don’t need to pay any blockchain transaction fees anymore.</p>

		 
	 
          
	 
		 
			<p>With the Polygon Gas Tank, performing operations and transferring security tokens becomes easier, faster, and free. By making the complexity of blockchain disappear for all stakeholders, true financial inclusion and mainstream adoption of tokenization is on the horizon.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/resch">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>
Patrick Parker, innovation-driven entrepreneur as well as founder and CEO at Identity Management and Cloud Security firm EmpowerID, will deliver a keynote presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4605" title="Patrick Parker Keynote">Complexity Has Reached a Tipping Point in IT – What Can We Do About It?</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Patrick some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do you think that complexity has reached a tipping point in IT?</p>
<p>
From our experience, large customers typically have 3,000 to 5,000 different applications that the IT staff have to manage, provision, control access. And end-users in these organizations interact with hundreds of these applications. So really the IT staff being able to be properly trained and understand the security models and how to grant and manage security in these thousands of applications has become overwhelming. Most of these organizations have outsourced this role to staff in other countries, that have a high turnover rate. So it's always a new employee and the new employees coming in and they're managing access requests for hundreds of systems, for which they're not trained. For each of these systems, they have to have native permissions, which is a huge risk as they are going into these systems as a superuser.&nbsp; They're not very well-trained. They may not be in this job for very long, and they have to make sense of these access requests to try to grant the user permission in these systems. It has really become an impossible task. The turnaround time has become extremely slow. The frustration for end-users and often at errors on the side of just over permissioning and giving the users too much access to try to just close the ticket.</p>
<p>It also makes it extremely difficult for managers, because managers are business users. They know what the users should be able to do as part of their job, but translating that into the technical entitlements that they are prevented from these systems and enabling them to make a decision is often just a guessing game. The technical entitlements have no real relation or meaning as to how they, what they grant the user, the ability to do on a day-to-day basis and what would be the risk of that, and whether it's appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the same thing goes for auditors. They are investigating to see our people within our risk policies. Do they just have the access they need? What have they been doing? Again, looking at low-level technical audit logs of transactions, looking at these technical entitlements – there is too much data for it to be humanly possible for them to accurately assess risk compliance and to keep this all in check. It is just becoming overwhelming and it's only growing more complex as we move to the cloud. As digital transformation causes an outsourcing of best of breed for each area of the enterprise to different applications, this is an ever-expanding universe of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the risks of complexity in our IT Infrastructure?</p>
<p>
One of the major risks of the over ever-growing complexity within our IT organizations is over permissioning. This has become dramatically worse as we've moved to the cloud. Cloud platforms have extremely elaborate and idiosyncratic security models, which are specific to each of the platforms. Google GCP has a different model than AWS than Azure and the various systems like SAP. Each one has an ever-expanding set of services they offer. So the typical cloud administrator for these platforms only actually utilizes less than 1% of the permissions, which they hold at all times. This creates a very large population of super users, which are always on, always armed, and open to attack. So this large amount of standing privileges is a huge security risk for organizations who are hackers have access to these publicly available systems, where if they compromise any of these accounts, they have God-like permissions and could do very destructive actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, another major risk is just end-user frustration, what might lead to something called the great IT slowdown where end-users and managers are overwhelmed by the complexity of dealing with IT systems. They really want to do the business work in their job, but the percentage of their time that they spend interacting with IT, making requests, dealing with permissions, recertifying access is only increasing. So the end-user frustration will lead to rubber stamping, which will avoid and bypass all of our organization's compliance and security policies. And at some point, the complexity will just reach a limit to where it's really impossible for certain roles to understand as many systems as they're being required to manage, which will lead to breakdowns, human error and vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you solve the challenges imposed by an IT infrastructure that has become too complex?</p>
<p>
I think the one thing we can assume is that the IT infrastructure is only going to increasingly grow complex and to continue its velocity or its path. So the solution to that is really the solution that's been used in many other industries over time. Developers no longer deal with machine-level code. They have abstracted it out so that they're dealing with higher-level objects, functions, the low code movement, allowing users who are less technical to automate processes without actually writing code. If we borrow a term used in business intelligence and data analytics - what we really need is a semantic layer. In business intelligence, a semantic layer is the mapping for your complex data in different heterogeneous systems into a single set of easily understandable business concepts for users. So it really transforms data into meaning and insight. The same thing could be applied here for IT and identity and access management specifically. The complex permissions and actions and activities that users perform in all these various systems, whether they're cloud or on-premise, we really need a mapping layer, a semantic layer so that the business users, the help desk users, the operational staff, and the auditors can deal with a single set of recognizable terminologies so that you can see what a user wants to do and who has access on understandable terms.</p>
<p>As an example, creating a purchase order in various systems, Microsoft Dynamics, SAP, and others, &nbsp;would be delivered by technical entitlements, granting complex and cryptic low-level transactions. If we are dealing at that level, the auditors and the users will have to understand the low-level complexity. But if we're dealing with a semantic layer, then you'll be able to see, I want to create a purchase order, and that's all you interact with. Or if I'm at help desk, I can see in grant the ability to create a purchase order. And then the IAM system is what translates that last-mile delivery of the technical entitlement. So we're dealing with business terms that are readily understandable, that we can categorize the risk that we can recertify. Everything makes sense. And the actual technical mapping of these semantics of these terminology down to the system-specific is hidden from us because we shouldn't have to learn that because it is not really a value add for our job.</p>
<p>Now, this is also a good from a zero-trust perspective because you're pulling users out of having direct interaction with those systems and native permissions and granting them access to a single interface, which hides that complexity. So it reduces the training time. It drastically reduces the amount of information and knowledge that a user has to have to perform their day-to-day duties, which reduces the cost to an organization. It helps on turnover and re-education, and it lowers risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The semantic layer you describe – Is that the Place where AI will come into play?</p>
<p>
Yes. So, so that's another point I had on here. So in AI, there is something called intention analysis and intention mappings, where for a user to be able to talk to AI, it has to be able to say human recognizable terms like “I would like this”. Or if the AI is analyzing activities, it can prevent the low-level information it has to bubble up into something that means something to the user. So it's the same type of mapping that happens on the AI to produce intelligible results and for AI assistance, to understand that human recognizable terms and translate that into the action that it needs to perform.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You propose a semantic layer to simplify IT.&nbsp; Would this model support multi-cloud or hybrid environments?</p>
<p>
Yes, actually, since it is a layer that's outside of anyone's system, it's really what is even more needed for multi-cloud. So if you have a multi-cloud environment, you have Google GCP, which has a very different security model, &nbsp;very complex, that takes someone a long time to learn, which is very different than AWS that has a Jason policy-based model, which is even very different from Azure's role-based and scope based model that the users that are on the front line requesting access, delivering access, fulfilling access, auditing access. They shouldn't have to be an expert in every system. So this layer for a multi-cloud is really even more important to bubble it up into intelligible, understandable results, and also to hide the complexity so that users are doing these tasks in the native interfaces, where they would require extensive training and have native direct unproxied permissions. You're giving them a zero-trust interface where they can perform their activities without having native access and with having a monitoring layer in the middle, which makes it easier for them. But it also adds security for the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Have you already been working on such a layer?</p>
<p>Yes. We've been working on it for about a year and a half now, so we have the mapping layer. One of the key trends is that organizations are trying to get down to activity-based access. So monitoring activities, understanding who's actually using privileges, what are the activities they perform? What are the activities they could perform, where they have access to, but actually never do. That way You can have more of an autonomous access system, which is decreasing the risk profile by trimming out automatically activities that you actually don't do. It can also propose new rules based upon activities of similar cohorts. And if the activities map to technical entitlements that can propose new roles or reshaping of the access policies. So we have the layer in place to be able to have the finest fine-grain permissions, the SAPT codes, authorization object, field values, the Azure, rights and role assignments, everything at the fine grain, to be able to map that up into this semantic layer so that you can immediately look at a person and see that this user can create a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that if I look at that, I could also see if they could create it in Google or AWS, instead of these being distinct technical entitlements that have no relationship, now I can see an activity, create Kubernetes cluster and see exactly who has it across our enterprise landscape, how they're getting it and also activity usage tracking. So if they're executing transactions using those fine-grain permissions, it has meaning now that they are creating it, that meant they created a Kubernetes cluster, and here's the risk associated with that. So, yes, we have that mapping layer built into the product right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Right now it looks like platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow are taking over more and more Identity &amp; Access related processes. If this trend prevails – how would it&nbsp; influence your approach?</p>
<p>
So the rise of the platforms, as far as ServiceNow extending into identity and access management functions, Salesforce and others, these platforms are great general-purpose platforms. They're great for workflow processes, for human-to-human automation and approvals and tracking, for compliance change requests, et cetera, but where they typically fall short, what isn't within their scope, is fulfillment. So we have customers right now, like one example that is fully ServiceNow. They have access requests processes for SAP and other systems, but just to fulfill the access request for SAP, and they have 800 staff in India, which is an extremely huge expense, because ServiceNow can automate the approvals. It can go through different levels, but these systems typically don't handle fulfillment of the technical access. So once it goes to the system owners or these outsource staff, then they have to deal with the complexity of what did the user really mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because users don't know the entitlements. They don't really know what they need. They don't understand the technical aspect and they shouldn't. So this person is responsible for somehow fulfilling this request. And most of that is manual where they have super privileged access. And so the platform vendors aren't extending down to where they really automate fulfillment. Typically that's something they leave out. So you still have the risk, you still have the human factor. And I see these platform products being probably the biggest consumer of the semantic layer, because you need a system that's specialized that can understand and get the fine-grained permission. So it knows who can do which of these human activities. It can track this, but then in the platform system, that semantic layer would ease the process for them. So when users are remaking access requests in a semantic layer integrated approach, they would be able to request the things they want to do and not just service catalog items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They'd be able to tell the system what they want to do. Tell the virtual assistant or the AI, what they're trying to do. If the AI ask them, who shows them users who have the same job function, it could show them not technical entitlements, but the activities these users perform. And they can say, that's what they're trying to get access to do. And then the mapping layer would translate that after the access request was fulfilled into that last mile fulfillment, which the platform products typically do not provide and which increases complexity and costs. So I see a synergy here where they will be major consumers of this new technology.</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>KILT Protocol is designed to be a fully decentralised permissionless blockchain network. That means we are building KILT to evolve into a blockchain that is run by the community, with decisions being made transparently on chain by KILT token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>As is often the case with cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, things can change even before they manifest! <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/consensus-through-collators-kilt-as-a-nominated-proof-of-stake-network-e58c8c4cf8a2">Previously I wrote about</a> how I envisioned the KILT Protocol as a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) network. Since then, we have decided to adopt a different mechanism that better supports KILT in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>There are three major factors we considered:</p>  Since we plan to run in the Polkadot ecosystem (initially as a parachain on Kusama), security is provided by the Relay Chain on the&nbsp;network  We want to recognise the importance of the work of the collators on the KILT blockchain  We want to keep inflation low.  <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, we decided to launch KILT’s parachain on the Kusama network using Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS).</p> Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS) <p>Limited Delegated Proof of Stake (LDPoS) is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism that limits the number of delegators and the number of collators to whom they can delegate their&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In LDPoS, the network will have collators (similar to validators in the Polkadot ecosystem), as outlined in my previous blog. The network will also have delegators. Similar to nominators in the NPoS system, delegators use their KILT tokens to back collators that they trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>In this way, collators can be supported by token holders in the community while they build up their own&nbsp;stake.</p> Collators <p>Collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collecting transactions and building blocks. The blocks of data they verify are passed via the validators to the Relay Chain of the wider network (Kusama or Polkadot) to be finalised and become the state of&nbsp;truth.</p><p>Running as a collator requires some technical skill, hardware and commitment to the project. Collators will be rewarded for every block they verify. The first group of collators for KILT has been selected, and we will have around 16 active collators at launch. This number will increase in the months after mainnet launch, as the network matures. Stay tuned for more news about the members of this Initial KILT Collator Programme.</p> Delegators <p>Delegators would be KILT token holders who choose to back collators with their tokens.

<p>IDnow joins IDunion, the network initiative for digital identities funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, July 8th 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, announces its participation in the IDunion network, which aims to build an open ecosystem for decentralised identity management.</p>
<p>For the IDunion network, central aspects of implementation are security, cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness and privacy compliant use of identity data. IDnow has joined forces with other industry experts through IDunion to drive a shared vision of digital identities that is aligned with European values and regulations.</p>
<p>“We are excited to play a key role in shaping the future of digital identities in Europe with our partners at IDunion and looking forward to working together on secure and economical solutions,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology and Co-Founder of IDnow. “The introduction of a digital identity solution is an important and necessary step for Europe. After the publication of the EU decision on the EU Digital Identity Wallet, we now need to think about a unified infrastructure,” adds Armin Bauer.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, IDnow has been working closely with various regulatory authorities across Europe and supporting standardisation working groups such as the FIDO Alliance or ETSI’s Special Task Force 588 to develop new standards with its expertise.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow is working on a technology to implement digital wallets. With this technology, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. By means of fingerprint or facial recognition (touch or face ID), the data is released for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. As a certified identification service (“Registration Authority”) according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future. Within IDunion, IDnow’s goal is to make the wallet technology compatible with the standards of the IDunion network.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader in identity technology, ARIADNEXT as well as German identity Trust Management AG. This enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Europe.</p>

<p>I clienti vodafone potranno ottenere lo SPID per Professionisti targato InfoCert con Riconoscimento Web o in bundle con SecureDrive nella versione da 75GB, la cassaforte digitale in cloud di InfoCert.</p>



<p>Sono più di&nbsp;21 milioni le identità digitali SPID rilasciate in Italia. Un dato che continuerà a crescere grazie anche all’aumento esponenziale dei servizi online messi a disposizione dalle Pubbliche Amministrazioni.</p>



<p>Per i cittadini è ormai uno&nbsp;strumento indispensabile&nbsp;per richiedere bonus governativi, consultare posizioni previdenziali e contributive, ottenere il&nbsp;Cashback di Stato, accedere all’&nbsp;APP IO&nbsp;e molto altro, ma&nbsp;a partire dal 17 maggio, InfoCert mette a disposizione dei suoi clienti anche&nbsp;SPID Uso Professionale&nbsp;– il cosiddetto SPID di tipo 3 – l’identità digitale dedicata a chi deve utilizzare l’account SPID prevalentemente per scopi lavorativi, magari per esigenza dell’eventuale organizzazione di appartenenza.</p>



<p>SPID per Professionisti è accettato da tutti i portali della Pubblica Amministrazione&nbsp;e dai siti privati che già consentono l’accesso con SPID Persona Fisica – ossia lo SPID di tipo 1 rilasciato ai cittadini per l’utilizzo personale.</p>



 INFOCERT ID PROFESSIONALE SUL MARKETPLACE VODAFONE, LO RICHIEDI DA CASA O DAL TUO UFFICIO 



<p>Grazie al consolidarsi di una pluriennale partnership commerciale, nata con l’inserimento sul marketplace Vodafone di&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infocert.it/securedrive/">SecureDrive</a>, la cassaforte digitale in cloud di InfoCert, Vodafone mette a disposizione dei suoi clienti business anche l’acquisto tramite e-commerce delle credenziali SPID ad uso professionale. I clienti Vodafone Business potranno ottenere l’Identità Digitale per il lavoro&nbsp;direttamente da casa o dal loro ufficio grazie al&nbsp;Riconoscimento Web. Sarà sufficiente una webcam e una connessione internet per collegarsi con un operatore InfoCert che procederà al riconoscimento e al rilascio delle credenziali nel giro di pochi minuti.</p>



<p>Infine, sarà anche possibile ottenere le proprie credenziali SPID per Professionisti in&nbsp;bundle gratuitamente&nbsp;con SecureDrive75GB, abbinando alla propria ID ad uso Professionale un Cloud Storage sicuro dove conservare o condividere i propri file in totale sicurezza con tutta la garanzia InfoCert.</p>

   Introduction 

<p>Jenkins is a free and open-source application that makes it easy to create CI/CD pipelines in almost any language or environment. Jenkins features a vast number of plugs to help create a CI/CD environment that is tailored to your technologies.</p>

<p>In this application, you will create a .NET5 MVC web application and check it into a git repository. You will secure this application with Okta. Finally, you will set up a Jenkins project to fetch the code from your git repository, publish the project, apply configuration values, and run the application. Combining these three technologies you’ll see how quick and easy it is to set up a modern CI/CD environment for a web application that is properly secured with a great single sign-on provider.</p>

 What you’ll need 

 
   Your favorite IDE. I will be using Visual Studio but Visual Studio Code is another great option 
   A git repository 
   .NET 5 
   Jenkins 
   A Web Browser to Access Jenkins 
   An Okta Developer Account 
   The Okta CLI tool 
 

 Create your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you want to do is create your Okta application. To do this you can use the new <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI tool</a>. Download the Okta CLI tool if you haven’t already and run <code>okta login</code> to log into your account. Next run <code>okta apps create</code> and follow the prompts you receive. First, select <code>web</code> as your application type. Next, for your Redirect URI type in your web application’s development location and append <code>/okta/callback</code> to it. For Post Logout RedirectURI use your same base domain and append <code>/signout/callback</code> as this is the route Okta will use by default. If you have multiple authorization services the CLI tool will prompt you to select one. For this project you can select default however in a production environment you should create a custom server. After a moment the CLI tool will return your ClientId. Be sure to note this as you will need it in your application.</p>

<p>Next, navigate to your Okta admin portal. The first thing you want to do is note your Client Secret. Next, press Edit under the General Settings tab and scroll down to the Login subsection. Add a value under Sign-in redirect URIs with the same path as before but use <code>https://locahost:5001</code> instead of your development domain. This URI will be used when you publish and run your application with Jenkins. Similarly, under Sign-out redirect URIs add a value with the same route as your development route but using <code>https://localhost:5001</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your .NET Application 

<p>Open Visual Studio and select Create a New Project. Use the template for ASP.NET Core Web App(Model-View-Controller). Give your application a meaningful name click Create. Visual Studio will scaffold your application. Once it is complete you can begin making the necessary changes.</p>

<p>First, install the Okta.AspNetCore package from nuget using the command:</p>

<p><code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0</code></p>

<p>Next, modify your <code>Startup.cs</code> file with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_Jenkins
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
            })
            .AddCookie()
            .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
            {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
                OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
                ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
                ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
                CallbackPath = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:CallbackPath") 
            });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this 
                // for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In your new <code>Startup.cs</code> file you are configuring the application to use authentication. In addition, you are also configuring your application to use the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> library you added a moment ago.</p>

<p>Next, add a new controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code>. This will handle your login and logout methods.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Logout()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[]
            {
                OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the code in your <code>HomeController</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Okta_Jenkins.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if(User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Profile");
            }

            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Your new <code>HomeController</code> will now check for authenticated users before dropping them on the home page. If the user is authenticated, you will redirect them to their profile page. To do that you will need to add <code>ProfileController.cs</code> to your controllers.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class ProfileController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; _logger;

        public ProfileController(ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Authorize]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Index</code> method here has the <code>Authorize</code> attribute. This will prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the page. They will be redirected back to the home page where they will need to log in.</p>

<p>Next, you will want to work on your views. Open <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;

                            else
                            {

                                &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" asp-action="Login" asp-controller="Account"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
                            }

                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;main role="main" class="pb-3"&gt;
            @RenderBody()
        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The only difference here is that you have added a Login button for unauthenticated users and a logout button for authenticated ones.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the razor code with this.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="display-4"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief tutorial on using &lt;a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenkins CI/CD&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;.Net 5&lt;/a&gt;, Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, create a new view for <code>Profile/Index.cshtml</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    Welcome to your Profile
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The last thing you will need to do is add your application settings. By default you should have a file called <code>appsettings.json</code> and one called <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>. If you don’t, create one and add the following code to <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This file should be listed in your <code>.gitignore</code> file because it contains sensitive information. You should never check client secrets or any other sensitive data into your git repository. Next, add the following configuration to <code>appsettings.json</code>.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "ClientId": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You will notice that this is the same structure as <code>appsettings.development.json</code> but without the sensitive values. When you create your Jenkins project, you will pull this file and publish it then you will override the settings in this file with environment variables.</p>

 Create your Jenkins Project 

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is installing Jenkins. You can <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/download/">do that here on their site</a>; Just make sure you get the appropriate version for your operating system.</p>

<p>Once Jenkins is installed on your machine you will be present with a screen for the first time login. Follow the instructions to get your admin password and log in. Jenkins will then offer to install recommended plugins. If this is your first time you can use that option. More advanced users may want to install the plugins they want manually. Note, you will need at least the <code>Git</code> plugin.</p>

<p>After that is complete you can begin to set up your project. However, if you are working on a windows machine you will want to change your Git to <code>JGit</code>. First, click on <code>Manage Jenkins</code> then click on <code>Global Configuration Tool</code>. Delete the default Git that was added there and click on Add Git. Select JGit then hit Save at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate back to Dashboard and click on Create a Job. Select Freestyle Project and give your project a meaningful name. I called mine <code>Okta_Jenkins</code>. Click Ok and you will be brought to your project page. Navigate to Source Code Management and select Git. Enter the path for your project from your git repository. Add your credentials using the Jenkins Credentials Provider. Specify which branch your want to build.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, under the Build section add a new task with the Execute Windows batch command option. Add the following lines of code.</p>

   <code>dotnet publish
cd Okta_Jenkins\bin\Debug\net5.0\publish
set Okta:Domain={yourOktaDomain}
set Okta:ClientId={yourClientId}
set Okta:ClientSecret={yourClientSecret}
set Okta:CallbackPath=/okta/callback
dotnet Okta_Jenkins.dll
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>The first line of code here will publish your application. Next, you want to switch your working directory to the publish directory. Next, you need to set your environment variables. There are a few different ways you can do this but the idea is that your <code>appsettings.json</code> in your git repository will not be populated with your sensitive values. Therefore you will need to set them on your server. The environment variables will override any values in the <code>appsettings</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to run your application by calling <code>dotnet</code> with the dll.</p>

<p>Navigate back to your project dashboard and click Build Now. After a moment you should be able to click on the build on the left pane. In there click Console Output and you should see a message telling you that the application is now running on <code>http://localhost:5000</code> and <code>https://localhost:5001</code>. Open your browser and navigate to either URL and you should see your application running.</p>

 Conclusions 

<p>By combining .NET5 and Okta you can quickly and easily build a secure web application on the latest framework from Microsoft. By adding Jenkins you have now created a modern and powerful CI/CD pipeline that can set up multiple environments in a flash, run automated testing, and publish your project.</p>

<p>You can find all the code from this tutorial on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jenkins-ci-app-secrets-dotnet">okta-jenkins-ci-app-secrets-dotnet</a> repository.</p>

<p>Introduction: Blockchain Technology Exacerbate Climate&nbsp;Change?</p>Aergo Intends On Being A Net-Zero Carbon Blockchain By 2030, With A Mandate That Block Producers Must Be Net-Carbon Zero.<p>It is evident that the utilization of energy has become a focal, social and political issue that has become a topic of discussion for the last half-century and has expanded well into the 21st century. Recently, there has been massive argument surrounding the efficiency of blockchain and how/if Proof-Of-Work exacerbates an already fragile climate. Blockchain has unfortunately utilized the same amount of energy as 159 individual nations; from a global perspective, that is roughly 75% of all nations that exist on the Earth: a staggering statistic indeed.</p><p>AERGO is looking to solve this issue through its Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake consensus model. AERGO’s blockchain operability isn’t accompanied by centralized mining farms that contribute to energy inefficiencies and non-friendly environmental tactics to create blocks. AERGO utilizes a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake model that mandates block-producers become net-carbon zero and will consistently give preference the corporate entities that perpetuate this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The method of centralized mining farms to mine Bitcoin has become a prominent topic of discussion, as mining is the consequence of this blossoming technology. As the evolution of blockchain has expanded tremendously in the last five years, energy consumption conceived by competing miners and mining farms has also increased as Bitcoin reaches inconceivable prices, which has drawn entities to garner an insatiable desire to mine Bitcoin in large quantities for massive profits. Miners are unfortunately at the heart of this issue that must be resolved to combat climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>Miners: The Life's-Blood Of Blockchain Inefficient Energy&nbsp;Output</p>Is Bitcoin To Blame; Or The Method Of&nbsp;Mining?<p>During the first few years of Bitcoin’s life, its value against the dollar was inherently worthless. Over the last eight years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies valuation as a whole, has skyrocketed tremendously, thus leading larger groups of centralized entities to build mining farms that utilize immense amounts of energy that has lead to this topic of discussion. Imagine, for a second, how much energy output it must take for tens of thousands of miners to solve complex mathematical equations to garner Bitcoin. The underlying technology, blockchain, unfortunately perpetuates this notion because the cost of running a blockchain is passed on through transaction fees. Fortunately, environmentally friendly blockchain entities are emerging such as the Crypto Climate Accord, which AERGO has joined and how plans to become a net-zero carbon blockchain through the transition of net-zero carbon mining through its DPOS consensus paradigm.</p><p>Green Energy Blockchain Mining: Proof-Of-Work vs. Proof Of&nbsp;Stake</p>Green Blockchain Energy Paradigms Are Now Emerging Through DPOS: But How Do POW And POS&nbsp;Differ?<p>There are many methods on how blockchain mining can become environmentally friendly and practically efficient. Solar panels and allowing for mining via the cloud (such as what company Genesis Mining does) are efficient fixes to solve the crypto climate dilemma. Energy efficient blockchain systems have now come to the forefront by eliminating the competition of Proof-Of-Work consensus models by implementing Proof-Of-Stake/Delegated Proof-Of-Stake models like&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>In Proof-Of-Work consensus algorithms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners compete with each-other to problem-solve at a faster rate than the other to mine blocks. A plethora of machines operating consistently, competing with one another, with lead to a plethora of problems, and energy consumption highlights such a notion. In Proof-Of-Stake, “validators” not “miners” validate the network based on the algorithm of the amount of cryptocurrency that is “staked” or provided by the validator to the network. It is important to note that Ethereum is slowly transitioning to a proof-of-stake paradigm.</p><p>AERGO’S Environmental Idealism Into Vision Through DPOS: A Clean Energy Representative Democracy.</p>AERGO’S Delegated Proof Of Stake (DPOS), A Green Energy Model And Representative Democracy<p>Energy efficiency is a major talking-point within the blockchain community, and Proof-Of-Stake models are at the forefront of this growing discussion. Delegated Proof-Of-Stake, however, embodies not only the notions of efficiency and an environmentally conscious consensus model, but perpetuates the concept of representative democracy as well. AERGO envisioned a concept for their blockchain that successfully amalgamated Proof-Of-Work with with the Byzantine Agreement consensus model. In essence, a Byzantine Agreement model guarantees instant block finality while requiring a set of parties to agree on a value even if one of the parties are corrupted. AERGO envisioned a representative democracy that is clean energy and representative to the populace of the network; a community that thrives allows a project to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>AERGO emphasizes the right of generating blocks to set block producers, while allowing a reorganization of these block producers through a finite range. By following a Proof-Of-Stake model with only a limited amount of block producers, AERGO addresses multiple performance issues. AERGO prevents an excessive amount of energy consumption from occurring from an ever-growing amount of block producers like what occurs in a Proof-Of-Work system such as Bitcoin. Simultaneously, AERGO gives a voice to its token holders, an important value proposition in any Proof-Of-Stake network; it gives token holders a voice in their investment and prevents them from staying on the outskirts as voiceless entities who just bought the token. Block producers must produces blocks in the allotted time given and AERGO stakers can freely vote for numerous different block producers (though they can choose one per-day to avoid an excessively dynamic and unpredictable environment for block producers). AERGO has made an important promise to become a net-zero carbon blockchain producer by 2030, and the company has the resources and partnerships to create such a&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Conclusion: AERGO’S 21st Century Mining: Representative Equity, Efficiency And Environmentally Friendly: The Three E’s Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>In Order For Blockchain To Become Mass Adopted, Companies Within Blockchain, Must Contribute And Perpetuate A Eco-Friendly Blockchain Paradigm: This Is The AERGO&nbsp;Vision<p>It is evident that Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake systems perpetuate representative democracy, transparent republicanism, and eco-friendly blockchains. These paradigm of virtues must accompany the vision’s of blockchain companies if we’re to hope for any type of mass adoption. Companies like AERGO, who have recently joined the Crypto Climate Accord (which is inspired by the Paris Climate Accord), will be on the forefront of this idealism through further collaboration with the Accord, providing preference to net-zero carbon companies, and a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake paradigm that eliminates the competition of Proof-Of-Work. This is the AERGO&nbsp;vision.</p><p>If you have an interest in becoming AERGO’s Block Producer, please email <a href="mailto:hello@aergo.io">hello@aergo.io</a></p><p>Helpful Links:</p><p><a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">cryptoclimate.org</a></p><p><a href="https://www.aergo.io/">https://www.aergo.io/</a></p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

The antitrust lawsuit against Facebook gets dismissed Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>We’ve been talking quite a bit about Lina Khan, Big Tech, and antitrust. The big news last week was that a federal judge <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">dismissed parallel lawsuits</a> filed against Facebook by the FTC and a coalition of state attorney generals.</p><p>The takeaway? Legally pinning Facebook as a monopoly is a tough task despite “conventional wisdom.” (And maybe the FTC and state AGs were a bit unprepared for this first go&nbsp;around.)</p><p>As Judge James Boasberg&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>“It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.”</blockquote><p>Part of the issue is the definition of monopoly power — the ability to jack up prices beyond the market rate. But Facebook is essentially free. And Mark Zuckerberg would argue that they have plenty of competitors in the form of TikTok, YouTube, Discord,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-29/facebook-victory-against-the-ftc-is-an-antitrust-lesson-in-monopoly-power-kqi8jeku">Matt Levine with a counterpoint</a>:</p><blockquote>That said, the government’s position is not crazy, it’s just not fleshed out, so the judge dismissed the complaint but suggested that the FTC should try again with a bit more specificity.[2] Perhaps the FTC will re-file a complaint making clearer arguments that Facebook has market power, and then it can move on to debate whether Facebook abused that power by, for instance, excluding competitors.[3] Here at Bloomberg Opinion, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/24305256.68914/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDYtMjgvZmFjZWJvb2stcy1jbGltYi10by0xLXRyaWxsaW9uLW5lZWRzLWFuLWFzdGVyaXNr/57d8173a3f92a424d68db1c2B0286af7b">Tae Kim writes</a> that “it shouldn’t be difficult for the agency to come up with the required backup,” and that “it’s also likely any renewed legal action will be formidable.”</blockquote><p>Also, Facebook just became a trillion dollar&nbsp;company.</p> 2. And here’s what everyone else is&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: The rulings show just how tough it will be for regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to make their charges of tech malfeasance stick.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, but: It could also strengthen the hand of lawmakers who argue that today’s outdated antitrust laws lack the teeth to restrain the power wielded by Google, Facebook, Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: Antitrust prosecutions remain dauntingly complex and forbiddingly difficult to&nbsp;clinch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/technology/facebook-ftc-lawsuit.html">NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>Courts have narrowed interpretations of antitrust laws over the years, making government cases difficult to win. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of loosening the influence that the big companies have over wide swaths of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>“Today’s development in the F.T.C.’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado and a co-sponsor of the antitrust bills. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”</blockquote><blockquote>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri and a critic of Big Tech, said on Twitter that the court had acknowledged Facebook’s “massive market power but essentially shrugged its shoulders.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-dismisses-government-antitrust-lawsuits-against-facebook-11624907747?mod=hp_lead_pos4">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The rulings dealt a direct, early blow to bipartisan government efforts to pursue Big Tech giants on allegations they have unlawfully monopolized the marketplace. They also served as a reminder that antitrust cases — particularly against dynamic tech-sector firms that offer free, nontraditional products — can be difficult to win before federal courts that have narrowed the reach of antitrust laws over several&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>“This really stings for the agencies,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman. “The FTC and the states I’m sure used the best talent they had to bring these cases, and they have been knocked out at the earliest&nbsp;stage.”</blockquote><blockquote>Even if the FTC is able to successfully amend its lawsuit, he added, “this adds complexity and delay to a case that was already going to be difficult.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/business/dealbook/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The ruling is a blow to the antitrust movement that is gaining momentum in Washington. The biggest takeaway from the case is this: The monopoly case against one of Big Tech’s key players is out of step with the law as currently written. What needs to be established is whether what Facebook is doing, as defined by the law and rulings in other cases, is illegal. The answer seems to be&nbsp;no.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge’s ruling also added evidence for those who say the law is not up to the task of keeping Big Tech in check. Legislative efforts took a step forward last week when the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of reining in tech giants. But this also puts Lina Khan, the Big Tech critic who now chairs the F.T.C., in a tricky spot. If the F.T.C. amends and refiles its case against Facebook, Khan would need to balance arguments that Facebook is violating law as it currently stands with support for efforts, as she has backed in the past, for Congress to introduce new legal&nbsp;tools.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/judge-s-facebook-ruling-embarrasses-ftc-states">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>The milder rebuke of the FTC suggests the ruling may prove a mere speed bump in the government’s case, rather than a brick wall bringing the entire case to a halt. But the rulings are a reminder that, despite the deluge of coverage by the news media about the antitrust battle against big tech, nothing is guaranteed. And that has particular significance for the FTC’s new chair, Lina Khan, who is seen as a critic of big tech. She has previously argued that current approaches to antitrust law don’t address the scope of Amazon’s power. For Khan, and other tech critics, the rulings make it even more important that Congress pass the antitrust bills targeting big&nbsp;tech.</blockquote> 3.

<p>Privacy changes from big tech are coming thick and fast right now. Some are solid privacy commitments, like Apple’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;and Google’s abolition of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">Ad IDs</a>&nbsp;for users who opt out of tracking. But others are underwhelming from a privacy perspective, like Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">planned abolition of third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and its new Google Play&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/googles-safety-section-doesnt-really-keep-pace-with-apple/">safety section&nbsp;</a>which doesn’t raise the bar anywhere near as far as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple privacy labels</a>.</p>



<p>The latest big privacy announcement comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">Apple</a>, with its raft of privacy and security measures to launch in updates&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/">macOS</a>&nbsp;this fall. The new features are designed to help users better control and manage apps’ access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Apple promises users “deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.” And individual control is what is at the core of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;after all, right?</p>



<p>And, we have to say, with these changes Apple has got a lot of things right for consumer privacy. While some of the biggest moves are security measures, we like most of what we see from the privacy ones.</p>



<p>That’s not to say Apple is offering a complete fix for protecting consumer data privacy. Users absolutely still need the privacy capabilities baked into&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and available through&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, which is why we’re going to look at what Apple is offering against what we already offer:&nbsp;</p>



 iCloud Private Relay 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Private Relay is a new internet privacy service that’s built right into iCloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s network provider. All the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays. The first assigns the user an anonymous IP address that maps to their region but not their actual location. The second decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Private Relay is like a VPN or Tor in that it masks data by running it through relays. With a VPN from a quality provider, the user is trusting a single vendor with their data. If they choose vendor wisely, VPN is also a safe and private option.&nbsp;If iCloud Private Relay is thought of as a simplified version of Tor, then wider ownership and control of the relay servers would be desirable.</p>



<p>Apple is asking for trust to deliver this service, which is fine, but it’s not offering&nbsp;choice. The user can only access it from a Safari browser. If all the user does is in the Apple ecosystem and they use a Safari browser, this is a fine solution. But if users want choice and alternatives, they’d look to MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>, and Safe Browser, Safe Browser Extension and the VPN in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safe Browser is a full-featured web browser that isolates user data from the default web browser that comes with their device. Their browsing history, bookmarks and settings are encrypted and never leave the device.</p>



<p>Safe Browser allows the user to open multiple tabs, view full screen video in landscape and portrait, and bookmark favourite sites.</p>



<p>For added safety and privacy, Safe Browser comes with a built-in ad and tracker blocker and a site reputation shield. The site reputation shield checks for known malicious sites on the device and warns the user before they visit them. The user can also enable biometric or PIN access for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform VPN is a completely secure VPN that supports streaming and geographical relocation.&nbsp;</p>



 Hide My Email 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“Expanding on the capabilities of Sign in with Apple, Hide My Email lets users share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private. Built directly into Safari, iCloud settings, and Mail, Hide My Email also enables users to create and delete as many addresses as needed at any time, helping give users control of who is able to contact them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Hide My Email validates MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">multi Sudo approach</a>. Disposable or one-off email like Apple is offering is great, but sometimes users want to link their private email to other privacy capabilities like a&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">virtual card</a>, as they can in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>. If a user is a committed Apple customer and happy to use only Safari and Apple Mail, then this feature is great. But if that’s not the case, then users still need a private email solution with greater functionality. Identity is more than email and that what’s we at Anonyome Labs have known for years. Proof:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">MySudo email</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/secure-communications/encrypted-email/">Sudo Platform encrypted email</a>.</p>



 Mail Privacy Protection&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is good.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;offers similar. A lot of marketeers&nbsp;embed&nbsp;invisible pixels in the emails they send to force email servers to make network requests (e.g. to show that an email was opened and from where). We can’t criticize this Apple move, but it is certainly a case of them doing something second but being very good at convincing users it’s novel. And, again, it’s a nice easy solution for committed Apple customers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved Intelligent Tracking Prevention&nbsp;

<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a number of years, Intelligent Tracking Prevention has helped protect Safari users from unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers while allowing websites to function normally. This year, Intelligent Tracking Prevention is getting even stronger by also hiding the user’s IP address from trackers. This means they can’t utilize the user’s IP address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is a good feature.&nbsp;This type of anti-tracking capability is great, and the embedded browser in MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>&nbsp;has this capability too. But&nbsp;where we offer a significant but complementary difference is in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, compartmentalization means&nbsp;categorizing and separating the user’s personal data to reduce the impact when it is compromised. It’s the world’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">most powerful data privacy strategy</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;was created on the exact same principle.&nbsp;MySudo is based around&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a&nbsp;customizable digital identity that intentionally differentiates from the user’s personal identity and mitigates the risk to their highly sensitive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MySudo, our exemplar consumer privacy app, a user can create up to nine different Sudos and use them in any context (e.g. for banking, selling on classifieds, catching up with friends, and booking travel).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Sudo has its own set of attributes and associated capabilities:&nbsp;</p>



  name  phone number  address  email address  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a>&nbsp;for secure shopping  browser profile (all your bookmarks and any cookies that sites set are compartmentalized to the browsing Sudo)  notification settings for phone, email and message  contacts and more.  



<p>The user gives each of their Sudos one or more identity attributes that are different from their personal identity. They can make their Sudo identity a little different (e.g. by having a different phone number) or very different (e.g. by having a different name, email address, phone number,&nbsp;virtual cards, contacts, etc.). They label each Sudo and can even assign a different notification sound to each.</p>



<p>Users structure their Sudos to achieve the degrees of privacy, safety, organization and convenience they need. For example, they might regard their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">medical information</a>&nbsp;as more sensitive than their financial information, and their financial information as more sensitive than who they know. They decide what suits them. (Listen to how two of the world’s leading privacy experts Michael Bazzell and Justin Carroll structure their Sudos in this episode of The Privacy, Security, &amp; OSINT Show:&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/034-our-sudo-strategies">Our Sudo Strategies</a>.)</p>



<p>Sometimes the user might want to let one of their Sudos retain some of the benefits of ‘privacy invasive’ searching and tracking online. Health information is a great example. When researching a health condition, the user may want some level of tracking in order to preserve their search history, mark favorites, set bookmarks, be offered search results relevant to their previous searching, receive discount coupons for remedies, be offered new research material, or even be referred to doctors or hospitals specializing in their condition. By using a Sudo, the user can still have all these benefits, but they’re not correlated to the user’s personal data.</p>



<p>The bottom line is MySudo private browser is more nuanced than Apple’s offering and gives the user more of that granular control Apple is talking about, which is essential to privacy.</p>



<p>Overall, Apple’s latest privacy enhancements are good, and even more great validation that we’re working on the right stuff. Check it out here:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a></p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Dock mainnet has successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) network today. This is a major milestone for the Dock community which can now play an active role in securing and running the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS further decentralizes the network by expanding the validator pool to 50 concurrent validators (there may be several hundred vying for top 50 spots) who are selected based on the amount of Dock tokens they have staked. This also marks a transition to more open governance with token holders being able to elect council members and vote on proposals.<br></p><p>To ensure that the new mainnet is safe to use, we have worked with the security experts at <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a> in partnership with <a href="https://cryptonics.consulting/security-and-diligence/">Cryptonics Consulting</a> to perform an audit of the network. The final report from the auditors shows that all issues identified have been resolved or acknowledged by the Dock team and is publicly available on our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate/blob/master/audit-reports/Dock%20PoS%20-%20Audit%20Report%20%5B20210706%5D.pdf">Github</a>.<br></p><p>Please follow the following links on how to participate in the network as a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nominating-validators-on-docks-proof-of-stake-network/">nominator</a> or a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/how-validation-works-in-docks-proof-of-stake/">validator</a> and we will follow up soon with an additional article on how governance works in the new mainnet. You can also learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a>, and please feel free to reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a> with any questions.<br><br>We hope you enjoy the new mainnet as much as we enjoyed creating it!</p>

 Ontology Weekly Report (July 1 — 6,&nbsp;2021)  Highlights <p>It has been another exciting week at Ontology HQ. The development of our EVM, which connects our trusted decentralized identity solutions with millions of developers and users in the EVM-based blockchain ecosystem, is now fully complete. In other big news, we celebrated an important milestone in Ontology’s history, the third anniversary of our MainNet&nbsp;launch.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We are delighted to announce that Ontology’s EVM development is now fully complete. It is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum contract ecosystem.  ETH RPC support is also fully complete, while the testing phase is 50% complete.  Ontology’s new Ethereum account system is now 80% complete.  The flow logic of optimizing transactions from the network layer to the transaction pool is now 50% complete. Transaction pool processing performance has been significantly improved.  EVM assets and OEP-4 assets seamless transfer technical solution is 50% complete, which facilitates the conversion and circulation between OEP-4 assets and EVM&nbsp;assets.   Product Development   To celebrate the third anniversary of the Ontology MainNet launch, ONTO released 10,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1411263448978059268">limited edition collectible NFTs</a>. There was a great reaction from the global community, which claimed all of the NFTs within 4 hours of their&nbsp;launch.

 Why Use a YubiKey? 
 
 
<p>A YubiKey is a hardware-based authentication device that can securely store secret keys. Once a private key is written to your YubiKey, it cannot be recovered. Keeping secrets off your computer is more secure than storing them on your computer’s hard drive—another application could read your SSH keys from the <code>~/.ssh</code> folder.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Each type of YubiKey supports a variety of different "interfaces," each with different use cases.  Many people associate a YubiKey with generating long one-time passwords (OTP) that look like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cccjgjgkhcbbirdrfdnlnghhfgrtnnlgedjlftrbdeut</code> 
 
 
 
<p>However, generating one-time passwords is just a small slice of what you can do with a YubiKey. In this post, I’ll be talking about the OpenPGP interface and how you can use it for authentication.</p>
 
 






If you don’t own a YubiKey, you can still follow along and skip the YubiKey parts.



 
 
 
 
 What Is OpenPGP? 
 
 
<p>OpenPGP is a specification (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880">RFC-4880</a>), which describes a protocol for using public-key cryptography for encryption, signing, and key exchange, based on the original <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/">Phil Zimmermann</a> work of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).</p>
 
 
<p>There is often confusion between PGP and Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG), probably because of the inverted acronym. Sometimes these terms are used interchangeably, but GPG is an implementation of the OpenPGP specification (and arguably the most popular one).</p>
 
 
<p>You may have seen "Verified" badges on GitHub commits that use OpenPGP to confirm an author’s identity.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Set Up and Configure a GPG Key 
 
 
<p>First, you need to generate a GPG key. You could do this directly on a YubiKey. However, you can NOT back up the keys once they are on the device. So instead, I’ll generate a GPG key on my computer, and once I have everything working, I’ll permanently move it to my YubiKey.</p>
 
 
<p>Start by generating a new key using <code>gpg</code>. If you already have a key, you can skip this first step:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --full-generate-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1 (1)
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096 (2)
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      &lt;n&gt;  = key expires in n days
      &lt;n&gt;w = key expires in n weeks
      &lt;n&gt;m = key expires in n months
      &lt;n&gt;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y (3)
Key expires at Sat Jun  3 15:08:09 2023 EDT
Is this correct? (y/N) y (4)

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Brian Demers (5)
Email address: Brian.Demers@okta.com (6)
Comment: bdemers test key (7)
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o (8)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create an RSA key.


2
Set the key size to 4096.


3
Expire in 2 years, you can extend the expiration later.


4
Enter your name.


5
Enter your email address.


6
Enter an optional comment.


7
You will be prompted for a secret passphrase.


8
Press `o' to save and exit.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now you have a key! You can view your secret keys at any time by running:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------
sec   rsa4096 2021-06-03 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-03]

ssb   rsa4096 2021-06-03 [E] [expires: 2023-06-03]</code> 
 
 
 


1
make a note of the Key ID; you will need this for a few different steps below.


 
 
 
 
<p>Add an authentication sub-key for use with SSH for authentication—more on that below.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --quick-add-key {your-key-id} rsa4096 auth 2y</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you list the secret keys again, you can see the new key and capability:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------
sec   rsa4096 2021-06-03 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-03] (1)
      4C40E4AD3A157D172ECB27C9B2EAA49E11DE8CBD

ssb   rsa4096 2021-06-03 [A] [expires: 2023-06-03] (3)</code> 
 
 
 


1
The primary key, has the capabilities of signing <code>[S]</code> and certification <code>[C]</code>.


2
The encryption <code>[E]</code> subkey.


3
The new authentication <code>[A]</code> subkey.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now that you have your newly minted key, back them up!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Back Up Your GPG Keys 
 
 
<p>Backups of your GPG keys should be stored offline. You are going through the process of securely storing your keys on a YubiKey, don’t leave your backup hanging around on disk.</p>
 
 






Pick a backup strategy that works for you, anything from storing the keys on a USB stick in a lock box, to a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Paperkey">printed paper key</a>, or you could <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/">go all out</a>.



 
 
<p>Run the following commands to export the keys and trust store.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --armor --export &gt; public-keys.asc (1)
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys &gt; private-keys.asc (2)
gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; ownertrust.asc (3)

# Create a revocation certificate, in case you need lose your key
gpg --armor --gen-revoke {your-key-id} &gt; revocation.asc (4)
# Select 1 for "Key has been compromised"</code> 
 
 
 


1
Export all public keys.


2
Export all private keys.


3
Export the trust store.


4
Create a revocation certificate as well. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#define_rev_cert">GnuPG docs</a> to learn more about key revocation.


 
 
 
 






The <code>--armor</code> argument outputs the key in a PEM format.



 
 
<p>If you ever need to restore your keys from this backup, you can run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># restore public keys
gpg --import public-keys.asc
# restore private keys
gpg --import private-keys.asc
# restore trust store
gpg --import-ownertrust ownertrust.asc</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enable Your GPG Key for SSH 
 
 
<p>There are a few moving parts needed to expose your new GPG key in a way that your SSH client will use them. Initially, this part confused me the most and left me jumping between blog posts and various Stack Overflow questions (many of which were out of date).</p>
 
 
<p>Working backward from the SSH client:
- The SSH client reads the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable; it contains the location of a Unix socket managed by an agent.
- A <code>gpg-agent</code> running in the background controls this socket and allows your GPG key to be used for authentication.</p>
 
 






<code>gpg-agent</code> can replace the need for <code>ssh-agent</code>.



 
 
<p>Enable SSH support using standard sockets by updating the <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo "enable-ssh-support" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
echo "use-standard-socket" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, you will need to find the "keygrip" for the authentication key; this is different from the key id, run:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys --with-keygrip</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------
sec   rsa4096 2021-06-03 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-03]
      4C40E4AD3A157D172ECB27C9B2EAA49E11DE8CBD (1)
      Keygrip = 78BCD171C2DD44E5D6054F0EC98B8C5D2A37D076
uid           [ultimate] Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;

      Keygrip = 48B8049057AE142926CADB23A816DFF57DC85098

      Keygrip = 28E05AC1DCFCB0C23EFD89A86C627B0959758813 (2)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Don’t confuse the Key ID with the "keygrip"


2
The "keygrip" for the authentication <code>[A]</code> key.


 
 
 
 
<p>Update <code>~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</code> with the authentication "keygrip"; this allows the gpg-agent to use this key with SSH.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo {keygrip} &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Configure your shell environment to use <code>gpg-agent</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># configure SSH to use GPG
echo 'export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc

# start gpg-agent, if it isn't started already
echo 'gpgconf --launch gpg-agent' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo 'gpg-connect-agent /bye' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
# the docs say to use: gpg-connect-agent /bye

# Set an environment variable to tell GPG the current terminal.
echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code> 
 
 
 






The <code>gpg-agent</code> is started automatically the first time it is used. However, to make sure it is running and available for SSH, it needs to be run when your shell starts.



 
 
<p>Open a new terminal session and run <code>ssh-add -L</code>; if everything is working correctly, your public key in SSH format will be output to your console:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh-rsa 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 (none)</code> 
 
 
 






If you don’t see any output, try restarting the agent with the following command: <code>gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye</code>



 
 
 
 
 Test Your GPG Keys with GitHub 
 
 
<p>Now that I have GPG configured on my computer, the next thing is to make sure everything is working correctly.</p>
 
 
<p>Log in to GitHub and go the Settings → <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">SSH and GPG</a> page. Copy the output from <code>ssh-add -L</code> and add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">new SSH key</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>On the same page <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">add your GPG key</a>, copy the value from <code>gpg --armor --export {your-key-id}</code>.</p>
 
 






On macOS, you can pipe the output directly to your clipboard using <code>pbcopy</code>, for example, <code>ssh-add -L | pbcopy</code>.



 
 
<p>Once you have your key configured, you can open an SSH connection to GitHub:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh git@github.com</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The session will close immediately but will print a message:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Hi bdemers! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Woot! Everything is working!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Use a Graphical Pin Entry Program 
 
 
<p>If you would rather use a graphical application to enter your passphrase, you can install an alternative "pinentry" program.  For example, on macOS:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># install a GUI pin entry program
brew install pinentry-mac

# configure gpg-agent to use this pinentry application
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# Restart gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sign Git Commits 
 
 
<p>Signing your commits is the only way to prove you are the author. Without a signature, someone could easily impersonate you by setting the name and email on a commit to match your information.</p>
 
 
<p>Configure Git to sign commits and tags automatically takes a few global properties; you want that "Verified" label on GitHub, don’t you 😉:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global tag.gpgSign true
git config --global user.signingkey {your-key-id}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Your next commit will be signed, and you can double-check this by running <code>git log --show-signature</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>commit 85e0174d961f44666d8ffc7000e81df22eea13c6

 Setting Up a YubiKey 
 
 
<p>You didn’t need a YubiKey to complete any of the above GPG setup. Without one, though, I don’t think I’d go through setting up GPG + SSH authentication. Using standard SSH keys will offer the same level of security with less complexity. As I mentioned above, the goal was to move keys off my computer, and into the secure storage of the YubiKey.</p>
 
 
<p>One of the first things I do when I get a new YubiKey is to disable the keyboard functions. Unfortunately, I found myself accidentally touching the device, only to have it spew out a long set of characters; this is an excellent feature if you use it, but if you don’t, it can easily be disabled.</p>
 
 
<p>Open up the YubiKey Manager Application, select the Interfaces tab, and disable "OTP," "PIV," and "OATH" interfaces, and press the Save Interfaces button; the result will look something like this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Open up a terminal and run <code>gpg --card-status</code>, to display information about your device.</p>
 
 






GPG refers to devices as "smartcards", so any time you see the term "card" it refers to your YubiKey.

<p>Each key will need to be individual, the signature, encryption, and authentication keys. Edit the key by running:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --edit-key {your-key-id}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Follow along with the prompts:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg&gt; keytocard (1)
Really move the primary key? (y/N) y
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key
Your selection? 1

...

gpg&gt; key 1 (2)

Your selection? 3 (8)

...

gpg&gt; q (9)
Save changes? (y/N) y</code> 
 
 
 


1
Move the primary key to the smartcard.


2
Switch to key 1, the encryption key.


3
The selected key is marked with a <code>*</code>. If you do not see a selected key that means the primary <code>key 0</code> has been selected.


4
Run <code>keytocard</code> again.


5
Deselect <code>key 1</code>.


6
Repeat the process for <code>key 2</code> the authentication key.


7
You know the drill <code>keytocard</code>


8
All done! Exit and save changes.


 
 
 
 






After moving your keys to smartcard like a YubiKey, running the <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> command will show a greater-than symbol <code>&gt;</code> next to the <code>sec</code> and <code>ssb</code> listings:



 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------
sec&gt;  rsa4096 2021-06-03 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-03]
      4C40E4AD3A157D172ECB27C9B2EAA49E11DE8CBD
      Card serial no. = 0006 16260201
uid           [ultimate] Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;
ssb&gt;  rsa4096 2021-06-03 [E] [expires: 2023-06-03]
ssb&gt;  rsa4096 2021-06-03 [A] [expires: 2023-06-03]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The smart card does NOT store your public key, run the <code>fetch</code> sub command to make sure GPG can fetch your key from the GitHub URL specified above:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --edit-card</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg/card&gt; fetch
gpg: requesting key from 'https://github.com/bdemers.gpg'
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: duplicated subkeys detected - merged
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: public key "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Use Your GPG Key on Multiple Computers 
 
 
<p>One of the great things about storing your GPG keys on a YubiKey is that you can easily bring the keys to a different device. Since the keys are stored on the smartcard, you simply need to "link" the device’s keys:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --card-edit</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg/card&gt; fetch
gpg: requesting key from 'https://github.com/bdemers.gpg'
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: duplicated subkeys detected - merged
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: public key "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

gpg/card&gt; quit</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Finally, you can confirm the keys have been linked by running <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> and look to see if the <code>sec</code> entry is marked with a <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------
sec&gt;  rsa4096 2021-06-03 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-03]

      Card serial no. = 0006 16260201
uid           [ultimate] Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;

ssb&gt;  rsa4096 2021-06-03 [A] [expires: 2023-06-03]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The last thing to do is update the trust store on the new computer:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --edit-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
gpg&gt; trust (1)
...
Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5 (2)
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

gpg&gt; q (3)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Run the <code>trust</code> subcommand.


2
Select <code>5</code> ultimately trust; ONLY do this for your key.


3
Finished! Press <code>q</code> to exit.


 
 
 
 
<p>Your smartcard is now set up on multiple computers!</p>

 The key is not just about the needs, but it is also about trust! 



<p>Rapid developments in digital transformation put pressure on businesses to constantly update and adapt to new technology. While shifting towards online platforms is already a huge effort, further steps must be taken as service providers are facing immense disruptions, driven by their customers, in every aspect of their business.</p>



 Personalizing customers’ need should be more efficient 



<p>A variety of advertising tools are available to help businesses reach their potential customers, and for users to experience quick and easy access in purchasing what they need. As good as it seems on paper, in practice things do not go so well. Although the filters and algorithms of these tools provide some assistance in personalizing marketing, they could only filter basic information such as demographics, but could not classify more advanced categories. Thus, it brings inconvenience to both parties.</p>



<p>On the one hand, customers are being disturbed with absurd ads popping up on their screen when swiping their feed, or excessive deals being offered as they are trying to participate in a transaction. They are being exposed to too many options, while not all of those options can meet their needs, interests, or capability precisely. This abundance backfires in two possible ways: ignorance or the paradox of choice. Customers might pursue the tendency to disregard all kinds of ads and recommendations so that they could avoid any disturbance on online platforms. The other potential outcome is “The paradox of choice”, a well-known psychological theory by Barry Schawrtz (2007), that indicates the unpleasant experience in decision making when having too many options to choose from.[1] Both ways of behavior lead to disincentives for customers to onboard any services suggested on the site.</p>



<p>While businesses can reach a larger pool of audiences by switching to online transactions, they are still facing the problem of personalizing needs efficiently. Applying technology to precise target the customer segment could escalate their rate of conversions and enhance their customer experience.</p>



 Time is also a crucial key 



<p>Does this customer have this demand and capability to participate in such a transaction at this particular point in time?</p>



<p>While most businesses are mainly focusing on the former challenge, approaching customers on time is also a vital complementary in enhancing customer experience. While online offers are created to increase customer experience, bombarding advertising that appears at any time defeats this main purpose. Customers may receive ads that relate to their interests and yet, it is not what they want at the moment. By repetitively seeing information that they do not need right away,&nbsp; customers tend to neglect these disturbances, which is why using ad-blockers is one common example of how they negatively react towards advertising.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To support businesses in tackling such issues, the concept of embedded finance arises from robust digital transformation. Since embedded finance is a branch of fintech that financial services are integrated into other online platforms, appropriate offers with content tailored to match with customer’s demand and capability as well as appear only when customer need. This optimizes the personalization of customer experience and supports businesses to efficiently convert new clients while working remotely.</p>



<p>Furthermore, integrated services provide customers opportunities to participate in cross-sectoral transactions without going through different intermediates to make their purchases like the traditional ways.[2] Hence, this experience not only serves customers at the right time but also shortens the customer journey.</p>



 A step towards the future of data security and data privacy 



<p>Although Vietnam is still new to the ideas of “data privacy” and “data security,” both of these terms are predicted to become more widespread in the next couple of years as the pace of digitalization is getting faster than ever. Hence, businesses should be aware and get ready before the rising trend as a part of improving customer experiences.</p>



<p>The benefits of digitizing our daily activities are undeniable. Nonetheless, potential threats underneath these benefits could make customers become victims in many fraudulent transactions. Such risks arise from the great possibility of private information leakage while users participate in online activities. While some people might think the results of data leakage would only appear in rare serious cases, the consequences are experienced by the majority in many different forms, namely, telemarketing calls from a company or services that one might have never heard before. An increase of data leaking incidents in the past few years does also raise doubts amongst users when trying new products and services. Therefore, ensuring data security could also help improve customer experience by gaining their trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need of users in governing and using their own data is interconnected with data security. Customers would want to ensure that their data is used for a precise purpose and benefits them the most. If businesses could provide customers with a more active engagement and a sense of ownership, customer experience can be significantly improved. In order to both meet the rising demand for both data privacy and data security as well as earn the trust from customers, businesses will need to keep up by advancing their technology.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Even though many companies have taken a major step in transitioning their services to online platforms, the robust digital world requires them to make more efforts to stay ahead of the game. While personalizing experiences might be a great gateway for businesses to reach customers remotely, both customer’s needs and the right timing should be acquired in order to optimize its efficiency. Furthermore, businesses may also want to be aware of the rising trends of technology, in which data privacy is one of the distinguished movements.</p>

   Password-based authentication is no longer fit for purpose. Passwords are costly and difficult to manage, they result in poor user experiences, and they are easily compromised. This has been widely recognized for some time, but going passwordless is also challenging and continues to be elusive for many organizations.

 Recap: Ontology’s Consensus 2021 Live&nbsp;Session  Transcript of Ontology’s Consensus 2021 live session, featuring Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, and Raindy Lu, Ontology’s Head of Marketing and Communication. <p>Humpty Calderon <br>All right and we are live. Welcome everyone who is joining us here, today. My name is Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology. We also have Raindy, would you like to introduce yourself?</p><p>Raindy Lu <br>Hi everyone, this is Raindy Lu, Head of Marketing and Communication at Ontology, glad to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>Humpty<br>Excellent, so for those of you who are unfamiliar with Ontology, Ontology is a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data. There is a lot of technology that’s been built to facilitate identity; self-sovereign, credit data, marketplaces, DeFi, etc. If you are interested in getting a snapshot of what that is, you can go to <a href="http://ont.io">ont.io</a> to see a few of the different products and protocols that have been developed like ONT ID, Oscore, Wing Inclusive Pool within Wing, which is the proof of concept of decentralized credit and DeFi. There is ONTO Wallet, of course, which, no secret, is my favorite wallet; multi-chain digital asset management and the easiest way to create your digital identity.</p><p>Once you create an ONT ID, you can see how easy it is for you to do soft verification, hard verification, whatever you need. And then, of course, Saga and DDXF, some of which we are going to talk about today. Anything you wanted to add, Raindy, before we get started on the presentation?</p><p>Raindy<br>That’s fine, please go&nbsp;on.</p><p>Humpty<br> Okay cool, so we have shared a presentation here. If anyone is interested after this call to get access to this, just let us know either in the messages here or through Ontology’s social media or on Telegram. Say “Hey, I saw this really cool pitch deck. I really want to get one of those for myself because I want to learn more, I want to dive into any of these really complex topics to learn more about each of&nbsp;those.”</p><p>So like I said, Ontology is a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data. In three steps, you can see what Ontology is, what it is offering and its ecosystem. We will probably explore these, step-by-step, throughout the presentation.</p><p>Ontology: high performance public blockchain, distributed collaboration platform; basically means really fast blockchain. Consensus has reached, I believe, finality under one second. So definitely one of the fastest blockchains that exists. It is efficient in terms of gas consumption and you are able to build on it. There is a lot here, maybe there will be a slide here but there is definitely one slide that I like that has to do with how open the blockchain is for developers. It isn’t just locked to those who are familiar with Solidity, for example, which of course is very popular but there are also various languages that you can use. In fact, here it is on this slide, it supports Python, Java, Golang, C++, so definitely it is an on-ramp for developers so that they can start working on blockchain development without necessarily having to learn a different programming language.</p> Ontology Providing DID solutions to Music Streaming Platforms, ROCKI <p>So if we move on through here we can see one of the partners that Ontology has recently onboarded to the blockchain or to its identity, I should say, solution, and that is Rocki. If you are not familiar with who they are they are, they are a music platform that is built for musicians, artists, creators, to share their music in a decentralized way. And as it says here, Ontology and Rocki have developed a strategic partnership to integrate the decentralized identity solutions developed by Ontology to verify their artists. We can certainly dive into that, in fact, I did earlier in today’s call and I have in other conversations that I have posted on Twitter and Clubhouse, where we look at why that is important, why is identity important when it comes to verifying the creator and verifying the digital assets. Of course, authenticity is key, especially if the reason why you are collecting something is because you want to support a particular creator.</p><p>Raindy did you want to add anything about Rocki and in terms of why Ontology sees that project as important and valuable for expanding decentralized identity?</p><p>Raindy<br>Cool, so we talked with Rocki for a long time, since the NFT market is blowing up right now and they do have the requirements about the KYC and AML login system. So they were looking for partners who provide DID solutions and they compared different projects among all the ones that are doing the same thing Ontology does and after the efforts from our both our business and technical team they finally choose Ontology because the think that Ontology is the leading expert in this area. So he objective for both Rocki and Ontology is that we want to transform the traditional login system for every creator on the Rocki platform, from a centralized way to a decentralized way. So through that way, all the users can have the power to control their own data and access without leaking the information to the platform, which is very important and also an innovative way for all the projects who care about protecting users’ identity and data. So through that way, now we are going to build up the whole system and then we will show our community members and also the users how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>I think that there won’t be much difference between the traditional login way and the decentralized way so users can just login like they do now but the new process protects their identity using our DID solution, which is really&nbsp;cool.</p><p>Humpty<br>Yeah, I think another thing worth noting, Rocki is actually built on the Binance Smart Chain. So this is a platform that is operating not an Ontology but it is operating on another blockchain. So it is important to note that Ontology has deployed these identity solutions to other blockchains, right, so can you tell us briefly what some of these blockchains are?</p><p>Raindy<br>Yes, so other than BSC, we are also proving DID solutions to Ethereum, Polkadot, Tron, and all the leading public chains, I would say. So you can find the W3C registration on their official site to see how many DID solutions and registrations are provided by the Ontology Foundation.</p><p>So, I think, no matter whether we’re talking about ONT ID or OScore, it is not only limited to Ontology chain and the ecosystem, it should be to the whole blockchain ecosystem. So we are supporting more applications and Rocki is a good start to encourage more projects building on BSC to consider DID solutions that can be employed on their projects.</p><p>Humpty<br>Absolutely, I really love that idea of interoperability and the portability of that identity. Because if you are creating identity solutions and you are locking them within a particular protocol, be it a platform like this or just one blockchain, there is value to the users but that value is&nbsp;limited.</p><p>It’s great that what Ontology is building in ONT ID d and OScore and all these other identity protocols is that interoperability. Because that way individuals who may, for example, utilize their identity on Binance Smart Chain, could take that identity to another blockchain like Ontology.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, that is the idea, so everyone has their decentralized identity but they don’t want it to be individual. So it should work on all the chains. So that is what we’re doing; clearing all the barriers and limitations between the different chains to realize true cross-chain.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, absolutely, I think over the last couple of years we have seen the value of interoperability, whether that is to create some sort of cross-chain bridge for digital assets or even within DeFi, that composability of these protocols so that they can create a more dynamic ecosystem, I think the same thing is going to be true for identity. There is going to be a need for that interoperability and composability to create richer experiences, a more robust and more secure experience for&nbsp;people.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, definitely.</p><p>Humpty<br> So, just as we say that we show here another on the other slide that Ontology is the only decentralized identity partner for Binance Smart Chain. I think that is valuable to note because of opportunities like we saw on the previous slide where there are developers that are building technology that can leverage these identity solutions that Ontology has delivered to Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain.</p> Ontology &amp; MicroWorkers Partner to Enhance Global Freelancing Marketplaces <p>Humpty<br> Oh, this is a fun one actually so, this was recently announced maybe two months ago, the partnership between Ontology and MicroWorkers. Do you mind sharing a little bit of this because this is definitely not one of the ones that I am most familiar in terms of what MicroWorkers are using and why that is important.</p><p>Raindy<br>Sure, as most of the audience know, we have our own digital assets and data wallet called ONTO. So it is a decentralized and cross-chain crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>So, when MicroWorkers comes to us and says they are looking for a new way to pay freelancers in crypto assets but they lack the devices between the platform and also the way they do it is through fiat. So Ontology has its amazing ONTO Wallet, we are talking deeply to get a way, so through ONTO Wallet it links the freelancers to payroll so they can finish their taxes on the MicroWorkers website. So, there will be multiple tasks to be finished and no matter where they are in the world, they just need to finish the task and they can get&nbsp;paid.</p><p>There is also a new option for them to get rewards via ONTO. Once they click on their ONTO wallet, they get paid in crypto assets and they will get additional rewards provided by ONTO. So through that way, it motivates users try a different way to get rewards and that invites them into the blockchain world.</p><p>So once they try it, they realize that it works very smoothly and there is no difference between a fiat system like Visa or Mastercard and I also get additional rewards. So why not try this new way which also helps people gain exposure to blockchain and crypto assets. So it helps promote crypto foster connections with real assets and the real world. So that is what Ontology is trying to do and additionally, we also give people the chance to try ONT ID. Everyone that gets rewards from ONTO gets an ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity in the crypto world that fully protects their identity and data — this is a great move in the industry, I would&nbsp;say.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, you know I think the one thing that I am hearing from what you are sharing right now is that what Ontology is doing is creating on-ramps for new people to find their way onto blockchain. One of the most difficult things right now is finding people who aren’t already crypto native,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Because a lot of the people that utilize blockchain and cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols are the same people, so people keep fighting for the attention of the same people, over and over and&nbsp;over.</p><p>I think there is only so much attention people can have but it is very difficult to find new people and to give them a use-case that makes sense for them. Something that you said is, “Oh wow, this is very similar to what I am already using; this is something that I could use not just for this but let me continue to explore this further”, right, because there are those additional incentives and rewards that they are earning with ONTO. Furthermore, they have an identity that got created that’s going to then empower them even further, down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>So, I think that all of these things are really fantastic and just prove to me even further more than I already believe that what Ontology is is a bridge. They don’t just bridge technology, they don’t just bridge protocols, they bridge people, they bridge utility, they bridge decentralize with institutional, I mean I think that is really what Ontology is known for, they are a bridge in the blockchain, so that is really exciting.</p><p>So, here we have a slide that really breaks down what we’ve been talking about for some time now, at least since the beginning of this call, and if you joined us earlier in the call during the community call we dove a little bit into what an ONT ID is but you know I think something to note here is that ONT ID is based on the W3C standard and why is that important. Just like anything else, I think if you are building something from scratch, sure, that is great but if you want to scale, if you want that interoperability, you need to work with standards and I think the fact that ONT ID has been built on that standard is incredibly valuable, and as other projects will certainly create their own identity solutions, it is building with these standards that will allow them to interoperate between each other as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I want to add that from the beginning of the project, we were thinking about interoperability already and how it should be aligned with globalized standards as the official standard. So the W3C is the most widely used one with a good reputation and also it requires high demand on the technical side, so our tech team did make a lot of effort on this&nbsp;side.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think one of the more valuable things that I learned when I started exploring decentralized identity and looking at these W3C standards is the institutional adoption of W3C. We are not looking at just blockchain utilizing these standards, these standards are also used by institutions like Microsoft.</p><p>So, I think one thing that I’ve talked about, of course, all of this is just ideas and concepts because it is a really exciting space because it is so new, but there is a lot of potential for it is, I tell people: if you look at utilizing these standards like W3C, for creating ONT ID, you can imagine that at some point maybe there will be a way for you to interoperate between your institutional software like Microsoft Office, as an example, and then using that at the same time to access you DeFi protocol; it can potentially navigate all of these different systems because they are using standards that have been adopted by institutional developers as much as blockchain developers.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, it is really exciting and also the tech team is getting fully involved in the regulation and standards making so they are attending their technical meetings with the W3C experts to find solutions to get the most balanced and widely used&nbsp;one.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think that that is also super important because regulation is key. When technology is new, it tends to go unregulated because it needs to continue to grow, scale, adapt, evolve, but as things start to become more standardized, regulation comes in and it is important for people, for developers that are building it to have a voice so that we get hopefully a more accurate representation of what the original intent was, even after regulation.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, definitely.</p><p>Humpty<br>Okay, so this is a cool slide. I really like this and in fact I might make this my profile picture for a little while because I like that it shows the rich and deep ecosystem of ONT ID — the number of blockchains that it is currently on and you know this list is&nbsp;growing.</p><p>We see like you said some of the leading blockchains here; we have Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Near, Elrond, Tron, Klaytn, Ontology obviously, so it is really great to see the development that is covering the gamut of blockchains. Just like you have your favorite token, you have your favorite blockchain; ONT ID is likely already&nbsp;there.</p><p>So, ONTO, my favorite wallet, go to Twitter you will see I talk about it enough. Is there anything that we don’t know about ONTO or maybe another perspective about ONTO that you think is valuable for us to know beyond the fact that it is a multi-chain, supports multiple tokens, and the fact that it is a simple way to create your decentralized identity.</p><p>Raindy<br> I think there are three points — the key points of ONTO. The first one is it’s a decentralized wallet, which is different from the centralized wallets. So they just keep your crypto assets on their server and there’s a risk if they do some harm to the assets. So ONTO can help users avoid these kinds of&nbsp;risks.</p><p>The second one is that it’s a truly cross-chain wallet. This means that once you have your ONT ID, once you download and open ONTO, it actually links to the other assets that are supported. As listed, there should be about 14 in total so you don’t need to have a mnemonic for for each ten, you only need to get one private key for everything. So it saves time for the users to manage their assets and even if they need to change their devices like they have a new phone then they can just download ONTO on their new phone and easily import their assets&nbsp;there.</p><p>So, the third one is that it is the only crypto wallet with the identity functionality, so it has ONT ID and you can also get your OScore with the ONT ID inside ONTO. The OScore calculation is based on your behavior on-chain, plus the crypto assets you have. This is really different and makes ONTO the leading crypto wallet among others, I would say Another thing is that it’s not only an app wallet; just last month we launched the ONTO web version which is Chrome extension. So no matter whether you’re using a mobile or desktop device, you can use the same wallet actually. It is easy to switch between the two and you still only need ONT ID to manage your&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Humpty<br>I think having that flexibility, being able to go from your desktop wallet — or should I say your browser wallet — and going to your mobile wallet, being able to utilize it not just for digital assets but for identity, I think it is this rich experience, this dynamic utility that you give people, I think that makes the wallet that much more valuable. It is one of the things that I say whenever I talk to people about digital wallets: I say, honestly, I think digital wallets have come a long way from the very beginning but you know there is still room for evolution, there is still room for improvement, especially as identity starts to become this critical element for helping blockchain and crypto&nbsp;mature.</p><p>I think we are going to see a ton of value in having wallets that have these solutions built-in, these identity solutions, and I am not saying I know what every wallet out there is doing but I don’t think that there is another wallet that has what ONTO has in terms of that flexibility and that rich utility that goes beyond just holding digital assets or beyond just working across multiple blockchains.</p> Why ONTO <p>Humpty<br> So, you know a little bit about why you want to use ONTO; you know it is a decentralized wallet, you own your assets, you own your keys, it gives you or enables you to have your identity as part of your digital wallet. I think that all of these are critical elements to making these wallets safer makes them more valuable to people as, like I said, blockchain continues to grow and&nbsp;evolve.</p> Beneficiaries of ONTO&nbsp;ID <p>Humpty<br> So, I don’t know if we are going to talk about OScore on one of these upcoming slides maybe we have already gone beyond it because we have talked about ONT ID, but I think maybe we shouldn’t get too far without talking about OScore, both kind of which go hand in hand together. OScore and ONT ID being your digital identity and then OScore being your reputation based on that identity. Can you maybe give us a quick introduction to what OScore is and why it is important from your perspective.</p><p>Raindy<br>Sure, so once everyone has their identity, it is like an identifier so people know who you are. But how can they judge your trustworthiness? That is why we have the OScore protocol in our ecosystem. So everyone is able to get an OScore that is based on their ONT ID and it links to all the behaviors they do on-chain but it can be customized according to their own demands. So I would say there is no limit or guidelines to tell people how your OScore is going to be generated because it is quite different, it depends on different demands. So, basically the one use-case right now is on Wing Finance, the DeFi platform that is developed by Ontology. So there is an Inclusive Pool which is a credit-based lending platform on Wing. Once you get your OScore, it makes it possible to be under-collateralized to lending out crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s say you have one thousand dollars as collateral in USDT and you have a very high OScore. This enables you to borrow about one thousand one hundred USDC maybe based on your good reputation on-chain. So this is a real application to let people benefit from their credentials and reputations. It’s a critical protocol for the blockchain world because it is kind of solving the problem of trust which is one of the purposes of blockchain, I would&nbsp;say.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think there is such a synergistic relationship between ONT ID and OScore and the way they are utilized. Like you said, there is a lot of flexibility in how that score can be&nbsp;created.</p><p>I really like what Ontology has done with Wing because it really is proving that the future of DeFi, you know, it is still so early that it doesn’t have to be over-collateralized, that is not how the real world works. You have a reputation in the real world and that reputation is what enables you to borrow. So, with OScore and on Wing, as an example, like Raindy mentioned, you are able to then get better rates whether that is an under-collateralized loan or that is better incentives. It also depends on the protocol on which ONT ID and OScore are integrated, there may be a different use-case.</p><p>I see Alonzo here in the chat is asking “Is consumer loyalty systems a good case?”, absolutely. You imagine, right now, in the real world you have these loyalty cards and how many do you have or maybe you have to download the app and every time you go you have to scan this but really is this the best way, like, is there a way for you to be able potentially to take that reputation across all of the different stores and websites that you visit? If you do, maybe that is a more accurate representation of who you are. You’re going to five marketplaces and you’re saying, “Well, I want to buy the same things and I go everywhere, well with ONT ID, with OScore, potentially this information” — again this is your identity, your data, it’s up to you how much of this you want to share — you say, “I want to share this information with these five purveyors” and from that they can then dictate your loyalty and then give you rewards based on that, on-chain, in the real world, or on the web as well. Because, of course, most of the world has gone digital, so most of us buy all of our things online. So definitely a very good use case, airdrops, absolutely.</p><p>In terms of airdrops, maybe Raindy you could talk a little a bit about how that is being utilized today with ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, the team is working on the airdrop related use-case with ONT ID because in the crypto world, especially when new projects launch their tokens there will be massive airdrops. So, the project teams’ concern is how they can prevent bots from claiming the airdrops for free, which is harmful to real users and real community members. So through the ONT ID system — and we call it the DID SDK solutions provided to the projects that are seeking ways to evaluate individuals who participate in the airdrops as credit and also based on their previous records, on-chain. So this can help solve their problems and their concerns. I am not familiar with that use-case because Gloria, our Chief of Ecosystem Development Lead, is leading the project. So I think we can save that question in our notes and we will dig out more detailed information with her and give you the answers, directly.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think that is a great thing. I think one of the valuable things about events like this is we get questions that, even though we are not either the technical person or don’t have all the information, we can use this to make sure that we can continue educating the community on all of these particular use-cases and even some of the ones that we may be exploring already.</p><p>Maybe just to touch on airdrops a little bit, in one of the calls that I have hosted on Clubhouse, someone brought up a really good example: UNI airdropped — Uniswap, I should say, — airdropped UNI across all of their user base but one of the questions that we ask ourselves in terms of the way that was distributed versus maybe if they had used some sort of identity solution is, if one person had used ten wallets and one person only used one wallet, do we believe that distribution was sent fairly because one person got a lot more than someone else because they — not that it is wrong that you are using ten different wallets — but now the distribution of that wealth of that token isn’t fair, it isn’t per person, it is now going to wallets so if we really want to look at ways to create a more fair distribution of these tokens, we can potentially look at solutions like ONT ID so that we can make sure we are sending it to real people. And how do we verify that these people are real? If you download ONTO you can see that there are ways to do it via social verification; you could also do it through some hard verification methods that utilize a KYC element. So certainly, there are a lot different ways that we can do this and the really cool thing is that there is a lot of areas that can be explored with identity.</p> SAGA <p>Humpty<br> Well, we’ve almost been here an hour, Raindy, so that is fantastic. Let’s see if we can get through this presentation. I know Saga is something that the team is currently developing and exploring use-cases for. Can you give us a very quick rundown? What is Saga and why is it important?</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, Saga is a decentralized data marketplace that is designed for both individuals and enterprises. I remember that there is a community member who mentioned his understanding of Saga: it is “the 1Inch of data”. So that is really impressive because he gained the main idea of it. So in most cases around the digital assets that is why we have so many DeFi platforms but we do have the requirements about data in the long term. That is the reason why we focus on data and as we mentioned before, Ontology is a blockchain not only for decentralized identity but also data and ONT ID is one of the critical elements of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>So, now you can log into the Saga website — it went live last year. You can try it out by logging in with your ONT ID and start accessing the data listed on the website. In the future, we are going to build more than that so it will be a truly decentralized data marketplace. It will be built on the Ontology chain but with interoperability with other chains. We hope the marketplace can develop more use-cases so that the Saga platform can have an official launch at a later stage. So right now, we are getting fully prepared to show our professionalism and also respect to the old users. So we don’t want to rush. We want to pay more attention to the details and to get it more well prepared.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, that is fantastic. I think what Ontology is doing is creating a very complete ecosystem for identity and data. You have got your decentralized identity; you have your decentralized credit score; you have DeFi integration — which is the next slide that we are going to get to with Wing; you have the wallet (ONTO) that enables you to just utilize this entire ecosystem from creating your identity to utilizing these DeFi protocols to potentially, in the future, utilizing SAGA, which is the decentralized marketplace.</p> WING <p>Humpty<br>So, Wing, the first credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. That is a big sentence. Basically, the lending platform has traditional Flash Pools; currently, it is cross-chain because it is currently on Ontology, it is on Ethereum, and on OKchain, which it was recently launched on I believe a week or two&nbsp;ago.</p><p>The interesting or the very unique element of this platform is because Ontology has developed these technologies focused on decentralized identity, they were able to create a testing ground for how that could work and that is Inclusive Pool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>What we were talking about earlier, in terms of, under collateralized loans, better rewards — which is great and I think that the future of DeFi is going to be this. The more I listen to people talking about this subject on Twitter, on Clubhouse, on YouTube, a variety of media channels, people are seeing that currently the way that DeFi is built isn’t fair; it is only benefiting those with a lot of wealth. The word that I see being used a lot is “plutocracy”, meaning that if you have a ton more money then your voice counts for more. And really what blockchain crypto is trying to solve is to go against a lot of these traditional ways the economy works and it wants to be more fair. And I think with the introduction of decentralized credit scores and identity, there is a potential of leveraging your behavior, your reputation, to be able to get access to these markets without necessarily having this huge amount of digital assets to be able to back that&nbsp;loan.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I want to add that, besides the Flash Pool — the leading pool and the Inclusive Pool, the credit-based pool — we also launched the Any Pool, which is also a big thing in the DeFi world because it makes it possible to link real world assets to the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>As an example, if a user has a flat (apartment) in the real world and he wants to collateralize it in order to borrow crypto assets, it is possible using the Any Pool. The flat can be minted as an NFT, to be recorded on-chain as a credential. So it releases the liquidity of that flat’s value and you can borrow crypto assets by using it as collateral. So, that’s one use-case. And also, you can lend and borrow like the Uniswap V3 NFT and also there’s various different NFT projects. So they can collateralize their assets on the Wing platform — the Any Pool — to lend out crypto assets and also the other NFTs. So it overcomes the barrier between the real world and the crypto world. This is a big deal in the industry, as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think that goes back to something I was saying earlier which is that Ontology is building bridges. It builds bridges, not just in the traditional sense — the way that we look at building bridges on-chain — but also is doing that in the traditional world. I know we also have some members in our team who are very possibilities with Any Pool because they can start lending not only their NFTs but their land because they’re living in an entirely different world and they want to be able to utilize all of these different assets that they have on these marketplaces. So I’m really excited about the possibilities that Wing enables, again, to continue to evolve and mature the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Ontology Community <p>Humpty<br> So, I think we are almost at the end of our presentation here. Raindy, did you want to make some closing remarks about Ontology and this very rich ecosystem?</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I think through today’s talk and the presentation that people already understand what Ontology is doing. So, what we are doing is focusing on decentralized identity — that’s the first thing. The second thing is data. Listed on this info graph it shows what we have achieved on this aspect but more than that, we are still doing traditional things like all the crypto projects do: We are creating a rich ecosystem with all the public chains, wallets, DeFi projects and exchanges, and also the other protocols, and are aiming to build trust with everyone’s efforts. So as you can see, we have already have over 29 language communities and around 200 partners. I think it is more than that, recently. Also, regarding governance, we have a decentralized and global network. We have around 1000 nodes in total and 65 of them are candidate nodes.</p><p>For individual users, they can stake their ONT on any of the nodes to earn ONG, the gas fee which allows you to do transactions on the Ontology chain. What’s incredible is that now we have so many ONT IDs created on the Ontology chain. It is very good to see that so many people have a decentralized identity and I hope there will be more people who have their IDs and data controlled by themselves through in decentralized way. Ontology will keep moving forward and developing a more trusted world for everyone.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think these metrics both on this side and looking at the numbers on the other side, looking at the partnerships and that landscape that is very diverse. So it’s not just limited into one area because, of course, it’s a very multi-faceted ecosystem. One of the metrics that I love is — going back to ONTO is — the reason there’s so many ONT IDs is because it’s so easy to make ONT IDs. One of the more important things that, I think, the responsibility of every developer should be is creating on top of this very complex ecosystem is to make it accessible; to make it super simple and to be able to allow people to very simply create that decentralized identity just by creating a wallet — which is kind of standard in this space — I think it’s going to take Ontology a very long&nbsp;way.</p><p>From the landscape side, one we didn’t touch on and I think is super important and again, shows that multi-faceted nature of Ontology, is the automotive partnership with Daimler and the “Welcome Home” app, in order to prove how ONT ID could be utilized in the automotive industry as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yes, that’s also a real world application that shows how users can control their data. As an example, let’s say someone has a car in Germany and he’s used to it so all of his settings are saved in that car. Then he travels to Singapore and rents out the same car. All the settings are different, though. So using the “Welcome Home” app, he can import all his preferences so the neither the car nor the manufacturer, Daimler, won’t have access to his data. So it is fully controlled by him but can be simply applied to the new car. So he feels like he’s using his car back in Germany but in a new place and in a new car. This is really&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>Humpty<br> I’m smiling a little bit because I think maybe for most people who don’t have these very smart cars, it might not seem like a very big deal but as we move forward with these intelligent cars — just like the rest of the electronics that we own — we’re going to see a ton of value in terms of being able to record our preferences in a decentralized way, in a way that we have complete ownership of that data and then utilizing that, anywhere.</p><p>Going back to the question Alonzo asked earlier, if you go on a website and you’re constantly having to fill in the same information over and over, it might seem like a small little pain but if you could just automatically fill that information out in a way that you know that you control that data — that it’s not just getting utilized in whatever way that company wants to use it — I want to use that. I think that’s a future I want to be a part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I recommend everyone visit <a href="http://ont.io">ont.io</a> and our video showing our vision for the future of how your data is used and how you can manage your daily life with a decentralized identity. You can watch that video to get the&nbsp;idea.</p><p>Humpty<br> I’ve heard really, really positive things and I’ve heard “Oh my god, that looks really scary” but at the end of the day, all of your comments are important. Whether you think it’s really fantastic or you’re questioning something, I think the whole point of this conversation is to be able to facilitate a way to ask questions.</p><p>Alright Raindy, well I think we have reached the end of our chat, here. Thank you so much to CoinDesk for putting together this event and providing us with a space to have a conversation with the attendees, to be able to engage with the community, and hopefully to add value to the conversation and that there are things that you learned here&nbsp;today.</p><p>Raindy<br> Thank you, everyone.</p><p>Humpty<br>Bye.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Let’s power up the&nbsp;Machine! Ampere-hour token&nbsp;(Ah)<p>Upala is launching the Ampere hour (Ah) token. The goal is to award early contributors, find intrinsically motivated people and give contributors an advantage over investors.</p> Become a core team&nbsp;member   Developers are paid assuming that 1 Ah equals $1. Every job reward is negotiated the same way as one would do with&nbsp;fiat.  Ah tokens can only be acquired for a job done. Cannot be bought or traded (transfers are&nbsp;frozen).  No real money behind Ah token. We are just maintaining the record of contributions with it. The value though is in getting to the core team and receiving a share of the real Upala token when it is launched. Plus there’s an investment option (see&nbsp;below).  Only for developers. Non-technical people have something even better with Upala. All the artifacts they produce can be wrapped as NFTs, and sold under the Resistance “brand” (check out the <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/starting-the-resistance-b9e49d4b150e">article</a> on starting the Resistance). This is disputable, though.  How many ampere-hours can you produce,&nbsp;human? Technical details   At the launch, the token is non-transferable. Ahs can only be received in exchange for a completed job. This is done to avoid speculation.  Transfers can be switched on in the future (if ever&nbsp;needed).  Zero token supply. Payments are made by minting new tokens on the go right to the receiver’s address.  <p>Deployed to <a href="https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xeed9D0f7265892e84e43d05dA464c75add199260/transactions">0xeed9D0f7265892e84e43d05dA464c75add199260</a> on xDai. See source code on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/upala-digital-identity/ampere-hour-token">Github</a></p> Economic details <p>The exact path of Upala launch is not decided yet. However whichever path we chose there will be a core team share in the total token supply. This is what you can get access to. After the Upala token launch, the core team share will be distributed according to Ah token balances.</p><p>I don’t want to put too many constraints by promising too much and want to leave some room for tweaking. Though the goal is to find intrinsically motivated people, I want to bring as much clarity as I can to the economic part. Here are some numbers to count&nbsp;on.</p><p>Core team share in total token supply. The minimum core team share will be&nbsp;10%.</p><p>My compensation. I’m on the same conditions as all other contributors (so that the whole team incentives are aligned and I’m interested in increasing Core team share in the total token supply). At the real Upala token launch, I will mint to myself [x] * [time] tokens. Where [x] is monthly compensation and [time] is the number of months since I started to work on the project full time (Jan’ 01 2019). My monthly compensation would be not less than $10k and not higher than the highest-paid developer in the team (this would allow hiring any skill&nbsp;level).</p> Investment opportunity <p>As the Ah token tracks contributions in dollars, an interesting opportunity opens up. A developer may find an investor and turn part of his/her Ahs into dollars. Still no speculation, as we are able to manually select investors (also sounds like a DAO). This is like retroactive investing, or accurate investing, or investing just-in-time if you will. Need a bit more coding to make it work trustlessly. Just an idea for now which we can start experimenting on.</p> Conclusion <p>Upala is solving one of the most acute and toughest problems in cyber-space — the Sybil-resistance problem (or simply, one human — one account problem). And damn it is&nbsp;fun!</p><p>See where you would love to apply force — check out the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Upala-infrastructure-9f9a09ea9f6b451fb8d39ea85ad5d5f2">infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://www.notion.so/66cc454c551847d2aa3666b9782dfeb0">roadmap</a>.

Recently, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663">European Union unveiled plans for a digital ID wallet</a> for EU residents to access public and private services as a strategy to accelerate the shift to an online&nbsp;world.</p><p>Today, identity (ID) management remains one of the biggest challenges for humanitarian action. In fact, due to a lack of recognized proof of identity, roughly 1.5 billion individuals (World Bank, 2016) face challenges to accessing or enjoying basic rights and services, including humanitarian assistance. The current challenges regarding identity in humanitarian aid delivery&nbsp;include:</p>  Too much valuable NGO time and money spent managing duplicative enrollment efforts and inefficiencies: Every time an NGO wants to deliver aid, they must re-register beneficiaries for each project. There is also no way for NGOs working with similar populations to securely share beneficiary data across NGOs and projects, creating siloed, inefficient work&nbsp;streams.  Lack of access to aid for extremely vulnerable populations: Lack of ID prevents many individuals from accessing much-needed cash-based aid. For example, prior to the DIGID project, the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) struggled to provide aid to approximately 25% of its target beneficiaries because they did not have ID (a requirement for mobile money aid distribution via the popular mobile money vendor M-PESA often used by the KRCS for cash transfer distribution).  Lack of beneficiary data privacy and security: Currently, beneficiary identity data is stored in systems that do not provide optimal privacy and security for this sensitive data. Without a secure data system, NGOs run the risk of beneficiaries “double-dipping” to receive extra aid or, in some instances, non-qualified individuals tyring to receive aid meant for someone&nbsp;else.  <blockquote>Gravity and the DIGID consortium are tackling these challenges via portable, user-centric digital identity for humanitarian aid. Gravity helps NGOs overcome siloed aid delivery with a digital ID solution that beneficiaries can easily use to verify their identity and receive services across multiple organizations and aid projects.</blockquote> What is the DIGID&nbsp;Project? <p>The <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">Dignified Identities (DIGID) for cash assistance project</a> aims to address the issue of lack of official or recognized identity for recipients of humanitarian cash assistance by piloting Gravity’s digital identity solution in Kenya. The DIGID Project strives to give control and ownership of personal data back to individuals, and at the same time increase collaboration between NGOs and their beneficiaries, with user consent as a&nbsp;key.</p><p>Launched in 2021, the DIGID Project uses Gravity’s digital ID solution to help the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) distribute direct cash transfers to vulnerable Kenyans without IDs in urban and rural, remote&nbsp;areas.</p>Kenya Red Cross Society using Gravity’s digital ID platform for aid distribution.<p>To address the beneficiary technology gap, Gravity also designed its digital ID platform to suit the specific needs of all types of users, ensuring that even beneficiaries with little to no access to or knowledge of technology can create digital identities to access aid services.</p><p>The DIGID Project is made possible by some of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world, with the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/the-movement/ifrc/">International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC)</a>, <a href="https://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/about/our-mission/">Innovation Norway</a>, <a href="https://www.rodekors.no/en/english-pages/">Norwegian Red Cross</a>, <a href="https://www.reddbarna.no/om-oss/organisasjon/english/">Save the Children Norway</a>, <a href="https://www.nrc.no/">Norwegian Refugee Council</a> and <a href="https://www.kirkensnodhjelp.no/en/">Norwegian Church Aid</a> coming together to help tackle this challenge.</p> Gravity Digital ID Platform&nbsp;Overview <p>Gravity’s digital ID platform (referred to as the “Gravity Platform” moving forward) used during the DIGID Project is based on decentralized identity and <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027">blockchain technology</a>. It is for use by NGOs, Financial Service Providers (FSPs) and aid beneficiaries.</p>Kenya Red Cross Society using Gravity’s digital ID platform for aid distribution.<blockquote>Gravity’s digital ID platform helps the KRCS and international NGOs increase their impact by improving service delivery with ease, saving staff time and money and focusing on what’s really important: providing aid to beneficiaries in&nbsp;need.</blockquote><p>The Gravity Platform prioritizes interoperability between organizations and ensures the inclusivity of vulnerable populations to access necessary aid services via persistent digital IDs. Persistent digital identities are important because they use blockchain technology to allow for the easy exchange of verifiable, consistent beneficiary data to different organizations while also protecting beneficiary data privacy and ownership.</p> Gravity Platform Benefits for NGOs — Key Learnings <p>After concluding the DIGID Project, the Gravity team met with all stakeholders to get their feedback for future projects using the Gravity Platform.</p>KRCS and Gravity debrief after DIGID Project cash distribution. For NGOs interested in using Gravity’s digital ID solution, the DIGID Project taught us that the Gravity Platform:  Saves NGOs money and staff time in the&nbsp;field <p>The Gravity Platform makes the overall process of NGO aid distribution faster and more efficient.</p><p>Time saved:</p><blockquote>During the DIGID project, it took approximately one minute to authenticate and verify a beneficiary with a digital ID via the Gravity Platform for aid services.</blockquote><p>Money saved: During the DIGID Project, the KRCS confirmed the identity of beneficiaries by scanning a QR code on the beneficiary’s phone or via a paper QR code given to them at the time of their digital ID registration. The cost per beneficiary of a printed and laminated QR code is $0.30 USD, compared to $2–5 USD for a smart card typically used by the KRCS for cash distribution.</p><blockquote>“These digital ID QR codes are good because beneficiaries won’t have to keep registering for cash transfers. It’s much easier this way for us volunteers and for the beneficiaries.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Kenya Red Cross Society volunteer</blockquote> Helps NGOs have a quicker aid response after a&nbsp;crisis <p>The Gravity Platform allows NGOs to quickly and accurately identify beneficiaries. As previously mentioned, it took approximately one minute to authenticate and verify a beneficiary with a digital ID to ensure that the correct person was receiving the cash disbursement. This process had previously relied on a chief or community leader to be present to individually verify each beneficiary’s ID at disbursement. If the chief/community leader could not be present at the time of aid distribution, there was also the risk that a person could falsely claim to be a beneficiary in order to receive a cash disbursement meant for someone&nbsp;else.</p><blockquote>“The [cash distribution] process was well organised.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Beneficiary, DIGID&nbsp;Project</blockquote> Facilitates interoperability across different aid organizations and&nbsp;projects <p>The Gravity Platform streamlines humanitarian action targeting the same beneficiary populations. During the DIGID Project, the Gravity Platform successfully integrated with KRCS vendor <a href="https://www.redrosecps.com/">RedRose</a>, a beneficiary and cash distribution management system used to facilitate the distribution of direct cash transfers to beneficiaries.</p> Helps NGOs put more money directly into the hands of target beneficiaries <p>The DIGID Project is the first time that the KRCS was able to provide many beneficiaries with direct cash transfers in lieu of mobile money transfers via mobile money service&nbsp;M-PESA.</p>Beneficiary biometrics being taken during the DIGID&nbsp;Project.<p>From the beneficiary feedback received after the DIGID Project, we learned that many beneficiaries prefer direct cash aid to M-PESA mobile money payments because the cash is put directly into their hands at the time of distribution without them having to worry about how to receive or access a mobile money&nbsp;payment.</p><p>By providing hard cash directly to beneficiaries at the time of distribution, the DIGID Project eliminated the need for beneficiaries to rely on more tech-savvy alternates/agents to handle M-PESA mobile money transfers on their behalf. With mobile money payments, beneficiaries may not know when they receive the payment, and in some instances, there is even the risk that an alternate/agent takes some of the money from beneficiaries without their knowledge, leaving them with less money than intended by the&nbsp;NGO.</p> Enables NGOs to provide aid to beneficiaries without ID that they could not access&nbsp;prior <p>With the Gravity Platform, it is now possible for NGOs to deliver aid to extremely vulnerable beneficiaries who are often left out of receiving services due to a lack of ID. Before this project, the KRCS struggled to provide aid to approximately 25% of its target beneficiaries because they did not have&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>During the DIGID Project, 95% of beneficiaries in Turkana had no official ID, but were able to receive KRCS aid with digital IDs created via&nbsp;Gravity.</blockquote> Supports all vulnerable populations, regardless of their access to or knowledge of technology <p>Gravity offers digital identity solutions for smartphone, basic phone and no phone users via QR codes. The Gravity Platform also works to close the technology gap by introducing beneficiaries to digital identity solutions that can help them gain access to and benefit from humanitarian aid.</p> Gives beneficiaries ownership and agency over their personal&nbsp;data <p>With the Gravity Platform, beneficiaries create digital IDs that allow them to control what personal data they want to share and who they want to share it with, ensuring that beneficiaries have a say in the privacy and management of their personal data at all&nbsp;times.</p> Organizations can use the Gravity Platform&nbsp;to:  1. Efficiently enroll beneficiaries with digital&nbsp;IDs <blockquote>The Gravity Platform is built to help organizations support all types of beneficiaries, regardless of their access to or knowledge of technology.</blockquote>During digital ID enrollment with a phone, the beneficiary receives a confirmation text message from Gravity when their data is shared with the&nbsp;NGO.<p>Shared beneficiary enrollment via the Gravity Platform means no more re-registering the same beneficiaries every time and improved coordination between NGOs. Organizations can sign up a beneficiary for a digital ID in three easy&nbsp;ways:</p><p>No phone user: NGO signs up beneficiary for a digital ID via a web portal.<br>Basic phone user: beneficiary signs up for a digital ID via an easy-to-use USSD Menu on their phone.<br>Smartphone user: beneficiary signs up for a digital ID via an easy-to-use web app on their&nbsp;phone.</p> 2. Easily issue credentials based on beneficiary information <p>NGOs manage beneficiary data all in one easy place via the Gravity Portal website. This data is encrypted and digitally signed to create a credential. The digital signature helps verify the authenticity and origin of the data accompanying it, ensuring that the beneficiary is who they say they are. It is extremely important to note that this data is securely stored in a decentralized credential repository, which ensures that no individual or third party (not even Gravity) apart from the beneficiary can access any of this data data without the beneficiary’s consent.</p> 3. Quickly authenticate beneficiary information to ensure that aid and services provided are going to the right individual <p>Organisations delivering assistance and services can use the Gravity Platform to request a beneficiary’s credentials to authenticate them, ensuring that the beneficiary is who they say they are. Organisations can request beneficiary credentials either: (1) directly through the Gravity Platform or an API for beneficiaries with phones, or (2) through a paper QR code for beneficiaries who do not have a&nbsp;phone.</p>Beneficiary view of their digital identity credentials on the Gravity Platform.<p>The Gravity Platform can be used by beneficiaries to:</p> 1. Share credentials and authenticate their identity with organizations to access&nbsp;services <p>Beneficiaries can share credentials that have been requested by an organisation by giving their consent and authenticating themselves via a PIN or other means, including biometrics.</p> 2. Manage their digital&nbsp;identity <p>Beneficiaries can view their own credentials to see the data that an NGO has collected about them.

<p>Jackson Shaw, technology sector veteran and Chief Strategy Officer at Identity Access Management firm Clear Skye, is to deliver a keynote presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4600" title="Jackson Shaw Keynote">Identity and the Rise of Platforms</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>




<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Jackson Shaw some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p></p>
<p>You say we are entering a new era of SaaS with new kinds of enterprise platforms, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p>


What I'm trying to basically say is that what we've seen over the last 10 years is an explosion of SaaS applications that cover all kinds of different use cases. Every company out there is using many different SaaS applications, and in the identity space, that includes many things like governance, life cycle management, privilege account management, web access, [and] all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>But what I've been seeing over the last couple of years, is this whole dynamo of digital transformation. And we're seeing companies that are doing their digital transformation, but they're not doing digital transformation with identity as the&nbsp;centerpiece. They're doing digital transformation with some sort of a platform as the&nbsp;centerpiece. And it's through that platform that we see things growing like governance, life cycle management, provisioning, and many of the other core identity capabilities that are being built into these platforms.</p>
<p>So, my supposition or theory is that eventually we're going to see more and more of these capabilities in these platforms, which I believe is going to make for a very interesting marketplace where customers are going to be choosing between platform-based solutions that they're using for their digital transformation versus standalone identity solutions like they've used up until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you think traditional IAM vendors are going to face competition from enterprise platforms like ServiceNow and Salesforce?</p>
<p>


First of all, it's not just ServiceNow. You can see where this is starting to happen in other platforms like Atlassian, where they've started to add some of these capabilities. You see it even in Salesforce, you see it with the Okta acquisition of Auth0 and building more and more identity into theirs. And the stated future from Todd McKinnon, the CEO of Okta, is he wants to be a platform. So, it's nascent, and this is not something that's going to happen overnight, but you can definitely see where things, in the ServiceNow case where, for example, GRC is being added to ServiceNow, where security operations is being added to ServiceNow, where there's a lot of these capabilities that typically have been more identity focused and more separate.</p>
<p>So, I just think that you'll see over the next five to 10 years, where a lot more of the traditional capabilities that are&nbsp;in identity will start bleeding into these platforms, and then customers will be making a choice on what they want to use. And I think the biggest factor here is that for digital transformation, customers are picking these platforms as the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;for their digital transformation. The identity piece is a supporting player, so to speak, but it's not the main course on the menu.</p>
<p>I think the problem that we're going to see - the tension between the platforms and the identity products - is that the money is going to be spent on the platforms. The strategic direction of a company is going to be on the platform, and the identity products that a company has, are going to have to fight to maintain their relevance within that sort of transformation as it occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How could competition from enterprise platforms shape the future of the identity industry?</p>
<p>


Well, I think what we've seen - again, if we look kind of a little bit historically - we've seen identity vendors start back in my day, doing email address synchronization, we've seen them do directory synchronization, [and] life cycle management. And then when we started seeing the identity vendors start acquiring other companies, when I was at Quest [Software], for example, we acquired 12 different companies to build our identity portfolio. So, you've seen all of these acquisitions occur with the intent of the identity vendor to build a suite of tools or in some ways, a platform, with the platform being built for digital transformation, whether it's ServiceNow or Atlassian or Microsoft Azure or any of the other products that are out there, or even Okta's intentions.</p>
<p>What we're going to see, is more and more of those capabilities become part of the platform, an easier and easier choice for a customer to say, I don't need to buy a specialized tool from a company that I don't really know and isn't part of my overall strategy. I'm going to go with my platform. And I think what we'll see is the pendulum shift from the identity players with a whole bunch of different products and different tools, back to where identity products are perhaps more niche-y. So, let's say five to 10 years, we're going to have a lot of specialized, very purpose-built identity products instead of these broad suites, and a lot of the general capabilities for identity that people are buying today, either as part of a suite or just general purpose, [will] now [be] inside the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is this trend going to affect traditional identity vendors – is it a question of adapt or die?</p>
<p>


Well, again, I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky, but I've seen this over the last 30 years basically. And I was thinking about this the other day, of all the organizations I knew before the SaaS revolution happened, that are no longer here. Like ISOCOR, World Talk, Critical Path and Softswitch. There's a whole bunch of these vendors that are no longer with us for various different reasons, but certainly SaaS being one of them, or the evolution of SaaS.</p>
<p>So, I&nbsp;think what we'll see is - and I'll take [for example] one of my previous companies who acquired a whole bunch of companies and they've built a platform or they've built a set of products that are on-prem, [and then] they've built a SaaS platform, and now they're trying to manage all of these things. I believe digital transformation is&nbsp;going to evolve these platforms to start eating into their lunch. I believe that there's going to be a number of vendors, especially the bigger vendors in this space today, that are going to suffer the consequences of not being ready for this movement towards the platform and the digital transformation that's occurring in companies.</p>
<p>Will everybody disappear? Well, of course not. There are a lot of companies that [date from] back in the nineties, that are still with us. But I think there, there's going to be another one of these tectonic shifts, or maybe it's not a tectonic shift, but certainly a change in the marketplace over the next five to 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could or should CIOs and other decision-makers at end-user organizations do in response to the trend you describe?</p>
<p>


The message I would want CIO's and the other people in the audience to take from this is that a number of these platforms are starting to provide significant value outside of a vendor like us, who have built on one of these platforms, but just in themselves. If we take ServiceNow as an example, it has a piece of software called Integration Hub. Integration Hub is 100% about integrating with other directories and systems. They connect to over 250 different systems. Why wouldn't a CIO want to use that because, well, in fact, they're already using it for things like Microsoft Teams and all kinds of other things internally. Why wouldn't they also want to use that for identity if the capability is there, which it is. So, what I want folks to take away from this presentation is that there is a rise happening with these platform vendors, and there will be a slow decline, in my view, of many of the identity vendors.</p>
<p>And if your digital transformation, your company's future, your customer experience, your employee experience, your partner experience is being focused on one of these platforms, you need to think about how identity can be a part of that digital transformation, instead of sitting to the side where it is now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think that these huge platforms will increase dependency of companies using these platforms to such an extent that this could limit the growth of those companies?</p>
<p>


That's, that's an excellent question. [But] I almost want to flip it around, and say what's more appropriate for a company? Is it to be making a further bet - doubling down, to use a gambling term, on the platform that they're using, that they're betting their whole company on, versus an independent player, that might not be here tomorrow or the next day? When you look at the magnitude of the difference between, let's say the market cap of an Okta versus a ServiceNow or an Atlassian&nbsp;versus one of the other companies, we're talking about an order of magnitude. The same around&nbsp;Microsoft and their capabilities.</p>
<p>So, I think that there's more staying power, so to speak, more capability for those companies to continue to expand and buy into identity, than staying with a particular platform. You can just imagine it, for example, Okta, which just made a huge acquisition of Auth0 - Okta isn't immune itself from being acquired, right? It could be acquired by a Salesforce or a ServiceNow, or even a Microsoft. They have the capability and the depth. And that's my point. I think the platform players have more capability, depth, and&nbsp;long-term ability to do acquisitions and build more technology into their products.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>You know how you will see an ad on Instagram for something that you just searched for hours earlier? This is in no small part due to a special API for iOS that allows app developers to track your behavior across apps, even those by different developers. Well, all of this is changing with the rollout of iOS 14.5, so let’s take a look at what exactly is changing and what this means for app developers.</p>

<p>When Apple first launched Sign in with Apple in 2019, one of my favorite parts about it was the privacy-first stance they took on access to user data. Unlike most other social login providers, Sign in with Apple gives the user the option of hiding their name and email address from the app if they wish. With the release of iOS 14.5, Apple is taking user privacy one step further and letting users opt out of targeted advertising. This is part of Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency framework. Let’s break down what it is, how it works, and what this means for app developers.</p>

 What Is Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers? 

<p>First, let’s take a look at how Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers worked before this change. For the last several generations of iOS, Apple has provided an API that gives developers a unique ID corresponding to a particular iOS device. This identifier is known as the “Advertising Identifier,” or “Identifier For Advertisers “ (IDFA).</p>

<p>While the IDFA is just a random string and doesn’t contain any personal or identifying information itself, it is tied to a specific device and any app that reads it will get the same value, making it possible to link user information across apps by different developers. The classic use of this is in retargeting campaigns in advertising networks, so that a user who uses a certain app can receive related ads when inside other apps.</p>

<p>It has been possible for a user to disable this feature for quite some time, although the process to disable it wasn’t obvious, and so relatively few people actually did opt out of personalized ads. However that has all changed with the release of iOS 14.5.</p>

 What Changed in iOS 14.5 

<p>As of iOS 14.5, apps now have to explicitly request access to the advertising ID, and in doing so, will trigger an OS-level prompt asking the user if it’s okay for the app to track their activity across other apps. Similar to the location tracking prompt, the app developer gets to add a sentence that will be displayed in the prompt in order to explain to the user why they are asking for this access.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is a fantastic gallery of these prompts from a wide variety of apps being collected at <a href="https://www.attprompts.com">https://www.attprompts.com</a></p>

<p>The options presented to the user are “Ask App Not to Track” and “Allow.” App developers and advertisers are worried that most users will not choose “Allow,” blocking advertisers’  access to this advertising ID. If the user doesn’t allow this permission, when the app goes to read the advertising ID, it will get a string of zeros.</p>

<p>So what does it mean if an app developer isn’t able to access the user’s advertising ID anymore? Without the IDFA, and without any sort of login mechanism, developers of two different apps have no way to know that the same user is using both apps, or that both apps are installed on the same device. Because of that, ad networks used within apps can’t track user’s activity across different apps, only within a single app. This means the inability to show users “personalized” ads based on information learned about them from outside the app.</p>

 Limiting All Forms of Cross-App Tracking 

<p>While returning all zeros as the advertising ID is a technical limitation Apple can put in place, Apple actually has taken this one step further and put guidelines in place in their App Store review process that prevent apps from attempting any kind of cross-app tracking for advertising purposes. This means if a user selects “Ask App Not to Track,” not only will the advertising ID be unavailable, the app is not allowed to do any sort of tracking with any other information for advertising purposes either.</p>

<p>There are plenty of techniques available to try to identify users in order to track them outside of the application, including everything from device fingerprinting to using social login, or really any sort of login. For example, if your app asked the user to log in with Twitter, and a completely different app asked the user to also log in with Twitter, both apps could share the user’s Twitter ID with an ad network to link the user between the two apps. This would also be possible with traditional login just asking for an email address and password, since both apps can share the user’s email address with the tracking service. However, this kind of cross-app tracking is explicitly prohibited by Apple’s new rules when used for advertising purposes.</p>

 What This Means for Your Applications 

<p>So what does this mean for your own applications? Will you have to show this prompt to the user if you are just asking them to log in? Not exactly!</p>

<p>Apple’s rules around the advertising ID and cross-app tracking are specifically written to address the advertising use case. If you are tracking users across apps for the purposes of advertising, then you do need to prompt the user and respect their decision if they choose “Ask App Not to Track”. However, this doesn’t affect non-advertising use cases—for example, asking users to log in so they can save their work. While this technically could be used for cross-app tracking, just providing a login feature doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be required to show the app tracking prompt, as long as you aren’t tracking the user in order to show them ads. And yes, this is definitely a judgment call more than a technical limitation, and whether your app complies with the rules will ultimately be judged by Apple during the App Store review process.</p>

<p>One thing to pay attention to as you’re developing your apps is which third-party libraries you’re including. It’s quite possible that some third-party libraries have code that will do some form of cross-app tracking even if you don’t do anything special with the SDK. For example, if you have included the Facebook SDK in your app to use Facebook login, you’ll want to make sure that you update it to the latest version before publishing an update of your app. Prior versions of the SDK included had no way of opting out of the cross-app tracking that the SDK performed. Facebook introduced a new “Limited Data Mode” in the SDK which avoids cross-app tracking. From their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">announcement post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
When using the limited version of Facebook Login, the fact that a person used Facebook Login with this iOS app will not be used to personalize or measure advertising effectiveness
</blockquote>

<p>This introduction of the new “Limited Data Mode” gives your app a way to continue to use Facebook login while not breaking Apple’s rules around cross-app tracking.</p>

<p>Since we’ve seen some examples of how social login features can either intentionally or inadvertently be tracking users across apps, you might be wondering what this means if you’re using Okta’s own iOS SDKs. Okta’s SDKs support signing in with an Okta account as well as <a>Sign In with Apple</a> and other social login providers. The good news is Okta has never shared user identifiers with anyone else, so you don’t need to worry about accidentally breaking Apple’s rules by including the Okta SDK!</p>

Once their validator node is up and running, candidate validators can set up their accounts, verify their identities, and stake tokens for their candidacy by following the steps described in our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/validators">validator documentation</a>.</p><p>Once validators are selected and begin producing blocks, the network will incentivize them to act responsibly by rewarding the validation activity while punishing negative behaviors. Each year, the network will release ~25% of the remaining token supply, with a total of 150 million tokens released over the next 25 years. Here is a table illustrating the token emission schedule:</p><p>Year</p><p>Tokens Released</p><p>Tokens Remaining</p><p>Total Issuance</p><p>1</p><p>36,652,688</p><p>109,958,063</p><p>890,041,937</p><p>2</p><p>27,489,516</p><p>82,468,547</p><p>917,531,453</p><p>3</p><p>20,617,137</p><p>61,851,410</p><p>938,148,590</p><p>4</p><p>15,462,853</p><p>46,388,558</p><p>953,611,442</p><p>5</p><p>11,597,139</p><p>34,791,418</p><p>965,208,582</p><p>10</p><p>2,752,056</p><p>8,256,167</p><p>991,743,833</p><p>15</p><p>653,076</p><p>1,959,227</p><p>998,040,773</p><p>20</p><p>154,978</p><p>464,934</p><p>999,535,066</p><p>25</p><p>36,777</p><p>110,331</p><p>999,889,669</p><p>The rewards, which consist of the tokens released by the network and transaction fees paid by network users, will be distributed among validators and their nominators. More information on rewards can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">here</a>.</p><p>If a validator misbehaves by being offline, equivocating, or engaging in any malicious behavior, the network will penalize them through slashing and/or chilling. In slashing, the harshest of the penalties, some or all of the tokens staked by the validator and their nominators would be taken away and distributed to the Dock Treasury and/or other validators. The amount of tokens affected will depend on the number of validators that are misbehaving, with a heavier penalty applied as the number of offending validators increases. In chilling, the offending validator would be removed from the validator set and prevented from participating in the next validator selection, hence barring them from earning rewards for some time. More information about these penalties can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/slashing">here</a>.</p><p>In order to get started, there are some technical requirements that all validators must meet:</p>  1 or 2 publicly accessible machines  At least 4 GB of RAM  At least 50 GB of SSD  Bandwidth of 10 Mbps over WAN  Some familiarity with provisioning machines (either cloud or on-prem) and some familiarity with Linux command line is needed to run the provided scripts to generate keys and deploy your node. Dock currently supports Ubuntu 18.04. Any cloud provider can be used to run a Dock node cost at minimal expense.  <p>If the technical requirements are met, candidates can start running their validator nodes by following the instructions posted <a href="https://docs.dock.io/validators/tooling/becoming-a-validator">here</a>.</p><p>We are looking forward to completing this important milestone, and will update the community when the Proof of Stake transition is completed in the mainnet later this week. In the meantime, we encourage you to learn more by reviewing our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a> and other articles on our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a>, and to reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a> with any questions.</p>

<p>As a follow up to our recent teaser video, we are pleased to share more details about our set of trusted solutions for the health industry. The core functionality of ShareRing Health has been designed to be piloted at health centers for Covid-19 in advance of a wider rollout of use cases across the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ShareRing Health solutions use our proprietary blockchain to securely tie an individual’s digital identity to an encrypted, immutable record of health data. Our Personal Information Vault (PIV) allows users to then safely store these credentials for future use. The final stage of the cycle is when the individual uses these encrypted and verified credentials to access goods or services around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, throughout this entire process ShareRing never stores any sensitive health information on our servers or the cloud, we utilise a no-knowledge proof of transfer. The user also retains complete control of their data thereby providing a truly self-sovereign identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issuing the health credential</p>



<p>Health center staff conduct a visual identity check of the individual against their OCR-checked and face-matched ShareRing ID documents. This ensures the health data is tied to the right person in an encrypted and immutable structure, thereby reducing the risks of fraud. Depending on whether the health center has the technology to create a QR code or not will determine the route used to add the health credentials into the user’s PIV.</p>



<p>Credential ownership</p>



<p>Once the user receives the digital vaccination or test certificate from the issuer it is added to their secure PIV on their mobile device. This, combined with their OCR-checked and face-matched ID and other documents that will be added in due course, can be used to simplify their day-to-day lives as society moves forward. Due to the self-sovereign nature of the platform, users can rest assured knowing that their data cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone without their permission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumption</p>



<p>ShareRing has&nbsp; and continues to build a variety of routes for businesses to consume these verified health credentials. We are initially responding to requests from sporting venues, hotels, and the wider tourism industry. These new features illustrate ShareRing’s dedication to restoring normality to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Benefits</p>



<p>Benefits to corporate stakeholders include:</p>



  Enhanced customer experience and engagement  Improved operational efficiency  Secure data transfer  Blockchain-grade Security with immutable datasets  Reduced cybersecurity costs&nbsp;  Increased visibility and business potential resulting from being part of our wider ecosystem  



<p>Benefits to users include:</p>



  All key documents stored in one, secure, user-friendly app  Peace of mind with privacy-by-design  Contactless journey when accessing goods and services  Easy registration and on-boarding  Ability to locate nearby health centers or businesses  Seamless access to venues and events  Express check-in for hotels (where activated)  



<p>ShareRing&nbsp; contributes to and fully supports the Good Health Pass blueprint. Embracing this ethos, ShareRing Health has been developed to be interoperable, allowing a user to share their verified health data with other systems.</p>



<p>Throughout the entire data lifecycle we combine blockchain technology with self-sovereign identity and have eliminated the need to store sensitive personal information on our servers. The result is a platform which allows all stakeholders to share trusted and verified data with the highest forms of protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond test and vaccination certificates, future uses within the health industry could be expanded to prescription issuance, operation and treatment records, allergies, training and vocational certificates for staff, as well as using trusted health records to assist with insurance policies.</p>



<p>To pilot our health solutions at your facility or venue please contact our sales team and request a demo today. And make sure you follow us on our <a href="https://twitter.com/ShareRingGlobal">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharering-network/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShareRing.Network/">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://sharering.network/blog/">blog</a> for all the latest updates and news.</p>

<p>Yesterday we announced the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a>, where HoloPort owners can earn in HoloFuel just for leaving their machines on. (I’m not kidding! Go read the announcement! There are some uptime requirements, and it might not be available in all countries, but that’s about it.)</p><p>What is this program about? Haven’t we already been alpha testing the Holo network for ages? Well yes, that’s technically true. The difference here is the whole ‘paid in HoloFuel’ thing. And the reason for this is that we need a lot of HoloPorts to stay turned on all day. Here’s why.</p> Availability and scalability <p>As we start inviting people to test out Elemental Chat hosting via the web, we need to be assured that the HoloPorts assigned to store their messages will stay online. In the future we’ll have redundant backup for each user’s app instance, but for now our focus is more on stress-testing Holochain and the hosting infrastructure.</p><p>We also want to be able to serve lots of users and see how it performs. In order to do this, we’ll need to have lots of capacity online, ready to start serving apps to new sign-ups.</p> Parallel testing <p>Our current pre-release alpha testers have been wonderful — infinitely patient, supportive, rigorous in their testing and bug reporting. But as we invite in more testers, we want it to be a smoother experience — both for their sakes, and for the sake of our support team.</p><p>So as the dev teams keep building features and fixing bugs in Holochain, HPOS (the operating system on HoloPorts), and Elemental chat, we need to roll the updates carefully so we can roll them back if needed. Hosts who choose to participate in the Alpha programme will allow their HoloPorts to be remotely switched to staging or various different testing channels of HPOS. These tests will remain small — restricted to team members and the aforementioned pre-release members. Hidden bugs will get discovered before they’re released to the wider world, which will make everyone happier.</p> Holochain v0.0.101 released <p>The core dev team has released a new version of Holochain this week. It comes with a huge pile of changes (v0.0.100 was released in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">February</a>, after all, and the <code>develop</code> branch has been changing fast since then). Here’s a short list:</p>  The storage engine has moved from LMDB to SQLite in preparation for sharded storage and the immune system.  Network traffic for entry publishing has been throttled back to avoid flooding the network.  The gossip algorithm no longer floods the network on each received operation, moving instead to a slow loop. It also uses Bloom filters rather than Merkle trees for syncing, which means brief CPU spikes but fewer bytes over the wire.  Wasmer, the WebAssembly engine Holochain uses to run hApps, has been updated to version 2. We’ve discovered a bug in this version of Wasmer that causes memory leaks and slows down execution. We’ve built some workarounds, but we’re waiting for the bug to be fixed upstream. In the meantime, you should only notice performance issues if you’re testing lots of instances of a single hApp in one conductor.  The admin API for installing apps has <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665">changed</a>:<br>• There’s a new endpoint, <code>InstallAppBundle</code>.<br>• The endpoint <code>RegisterDna</code> can now take a <code>DnaBundle</code>.<br>• Breaking: The endpoint <code>InstallApp</code> now only accepts DNA hashes. Specifying DNAs by paths has been removed, as has the ability to specify properties at install time. Please move to using <code>InstallAppBundle</code> and <code>RegisterDna</code> instead.<br>• Breaking: When specifying DNAs by path, the endpoint <code>RegisterDna</code> must point to a DNA bundle, not a single DNA file.  The dev tool <code>hc</code> has had the <code>install_app</code> subcommand <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665">temporarily removed</a> in favour of <code>install_app_bundle</code>.  Breaking: All references to <code>”uuid”</code> in the DNA have been <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/727">renamed to <code>”uid”</code></a>.  The HDK has two new crypto functions, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/ed25519/fn.sign_ephemeral.html"><code>sign_ephemeral</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/ed25519/fn.sign_ephemeral_raw.html"><code>sign_ephemeral_raw</code></a>.  <p>Read the whole changelog <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/ea726cc05aa6064c3b8b4f85fddf3e89429f018e/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p><p>Performance warning: We do expect performance to be better in some places and worse in others. Changes in the wire protocol have resulted in less network traffic, while changes to Wasmer and SQLite have both improved and degraded memory and CPU usage. Using v0.0.101 for development work should be fine, but we don’t recommend bundling it with user-facing hApps yet.</p><p>You can get the new Holochain by <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">entering the Holonix shell</a> or downloading it from crates.io via <code>cargo</code> (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain/0.0.101">conductor</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdk/0.0.101">HDK</a>).</p> Errata and additions for last week’s developer ecosystem roundup <p>After I published all those lovely developer resources, a couple devs pointed out that I’d missed some pretty important ones. There are also a few new things that have popped up in the meantime.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/embedded-holochain-runner/">Embedded Holochain Runner</a> makes it easy to run Holochain as a library in your own app. This lets you bundle up everything in a single executable without any background services to manage. It’s already being used in <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn</a>.  There’s the beginnings of a <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/geolocation">geolocation zome</a> that lets you tag and search for things by latitude and longitude. The developers are also talking about adding the ability to search within range, optimised by breaking the globe up into ‘cells’.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/cell-client">Cell-client</a> is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/">JavaScript client SDK</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk/">Holo Web SDK</a> that makes it easy for your UI to target both self-hosted Holochain and Holo-hosted at the same time.  There’s a full set of <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/core-types">TypeScript typedefs</a> for Holochain core types; this is useful for interfacing your UI with your DNA.  Connor Turland has written up a great guide on unit-testing zome functions and validation callbacks, along with a <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/minimal-hdk-unit-test-example/tree/main/zome/src">minimal example</a> and some handy <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/minimal-hdk-unit-test-example/blob/main/zome/src/validate_helpers.rs">validation helpers</a>.  The community-created wiki is growing, with new articles on <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/Writing-a-validation-hook-for-an-entry-type">writing good validation functions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-To-Write-An-Entry-Struct-with-an-Enum-Field-That-Serializes-Nicely-(Serde-Msgpack)">serialising Rust enums nicely</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-create-a-Holochain-network-over-the-internet">creating a network</a>.  There’s a rich conversation happening on the forum about <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/overall-thoughts-from-developers-using-holochain/6348/7">what the developer experience is like</a> so far. If you’ve been doing any dev work with RSM, come over and celebrate/complain with other devs :)  <p>Do you have any developer resources I’ve forgotten? Post them in the comments section below and I’ll feature them in a future Dev Pulse.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">ian dooley</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/balloon-launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

In recent years, the growth in identities operating across cloud and digital services has seen vendors offering IAM solutions as a service to assist with this growing complexity and concomitant security challenge.

This is IDaaS designed by a third-party integrator using best of breed identity components to build an IAM solution that is bespoke to operational and budgetary requirements and can also be operated by the integrator if the customer chooses.</p>

<p>Introduction: The Cryptocurrency Mining Carbon Emissions Political Discussion</p>As Cryptocurrencies Garner Mainstream Coverage, A Specific Environmental And Political Issue Has Spawned: How Does Cryptocurrency Mining Affect&nbsp;Climate?<p>Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have been making headlines over the past year, garnering mainstream adoption and attention for a variety of reasons. One specific issue has garnered massive political attention from some of the most influential and powerful people in the world and that issue is “how does cryptocurrency mining and creation affect the environment? Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and founder of SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink, has publicly stated his stance on cryptocurrency; Musk believes that cryptocurrency possesses a bright future, but believes it yields a massive carbon footprint. Elon Musk hasn’t been the only individual touting this rallying cry, but political commentators such as Bill Maher and Former Democratic Presidential Nominee Elizabeth Warren have consistently urged Congress to crack down on cryptocurrencies because of their impact on the environment and lack of regulatory oversight.</p><p>It is evident that cryptocurrency mining requires energy inputs and outputs, and the question of its impact on the environment has raised regulatory questions, specifically associated with massive centralized mining farms. According to The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index at the University of Cambridge “The most reputable such estimate comes from the <a href="https://cbeci.org/">University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index</a>, according to which the global bitcoin network currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of <a href="https://www.mcginley.co.uk/news/how-much-of-each-energy-source-does-it-take-to-power-your-home/bp254/">23 coal-fired power plants</a>, or close to what is consumed by the nation of <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/finland">Finland</a>.” Fathom this for a minute, are these politicians and economic titans wrong on their perspective that Bitcoin is harmful for the environment based on the above quote, or are they just unaware that projects like Aergo have joined an entity known as the “Crypto Climate Accord” who’s aim is to immensely decrease the amount of carbon emissions cryptocurrency mining farms create. If mainstream adoption is to occur, it is incumbent that it doesn’t come at the cost of our planet, our&nbsp;home.</p>Bill Maher, Speaking Vehemently Against Bitcoin In A Recent “Real Time With Bill Maher: New Rules”&nbsp;Segment<p>The Crypto Climate Accord: Combatting Climate Change Through Decreasing Blockchain Carbon Emissions</p>Aergo Has Joined the Crypto Climate Accord And Aims To Give Preference To Projects Who Aim To Garner Net Zero Carbon Emissions<p>The Crypto Climate Accord, inspired by the Paris Climate Accord, is fighting back against climate change and the detrimental affects fossil fuels have on our environment. The Crypto Climate Accord’s main vision and goal is a planet where cryptocurrency thrives while our environment survives; how is this achieved, through net zero carbon emission blockchain platforms that transition to 100% renewables. The Crypto Climate Accord was created by three specific entities “Energy Web, The Alliance For Innovative Regulation and RMI Energy Transformed” and the Accord envisions a blockchain paradigm that decarbonizes the cryptocurrency industry at a record rate. The signatories of this Accord pledge to reduce their emissions to net zero emissions from electricity consumption by the year 2030. As of July 2021, over thirty companies have become ardent supporters of this Accord: some companies to name are Aergo, Enjin, Ripple, Polygon (Matic) and Terra Pool.” Industries from all over the globe that utilize electricity consumption have perpetuated the ideals and actions that facilitate decarbonization, and it is about time cryptocurrency does the same, and Aergo emphasizes such an&nbsp;ethos.</p>Aergo Will Play A Vital Role In The Expansion Of The Crypto Climate Accord And Intends On Putting Their Principles Where Their Mouths Are As A Show Of Leadership And Devotion: By Decarbonizing Their Own Blockchain<p>Aergo, is one of the projects that intends on fighting back against carbon emissions through their induction into The Crypto Climate Accord. Aergo is a hybrid-blockchain platform based out of South Korea that has joined “The Crypto Climate Accord” in an attempt to facilitate discussions and actions that lead to net-zero carbon emissions, not just through their platform, but through the entirety of the cryptocurrency sphere. Aergo intends on giving preference to companies, partners and projects who aim for zero net carbon emissions. Aergo is also aiming to lower its own carbon footprint to net-zero by the end of the decade. The primary focus for Aergo to preserve and expand the continuity of our environment is to require all block producers within the Aergo ecosystem to go carbon net zero by the year 2030. Aergo also has many unannounced partnerships with service and cloud providers that have ESG initiatives who aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>ESG “Environmental, Social, Governance” initiatives are set standards for a company’s operation that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investment prospects. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward and a protector of nature and Earth. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates, including local, national or global entities. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, and shareholder rights. Aergo aims to embody the principles of the Crypto Climate Accord through three core principles.</p><p>The Guiding Principles Of Aergo: A Healthier Planet Leads To Mainstream Adoption</p>Aergo’s Carbon Conscious Principles: A Better Environment&nbsp;, A Better&nbsp;World<p>The first principle is to build upon our existing progress; it is evident that carbon emissions are reducing in electrical sectors and Aergo aims to utilize tactics and strategies that have been proven successful surrounding lowering carbon emissions. The second principle is to move quickly; Aergo aims to have a completely carbon net zero blockchain by the year 2030 and it is necessary to comprehend how blockchain can benefit such an idea. The same decentralized technology underpinning the global crypto industry — blockchain — can bring transformational levels of data transparency and trust to decarbonization efforts; Aergo desires to facilitate such a notion ubiquitously throughout the blockchain sphere. The third principle is to be community driven. It is evident that the success of a project can be determined by the ethos of the community that backs it; Aergo aims to encourage its community to ensure that blockchain doesn’t further exacerbate climate change, but coordinates with Aergo and other projects to fight against this harmful paradigm. Aergo will be one of the stewards that will stand the test of time in the blockchain space for fighting back against carbon emissions.</p><p>Conclusion: Climate Consciousness: A Blockchain Necessity</p>Earth Gave Blockchain Life, Its Time To Return The&nbsp;Favor<p>Blockchain technology has become a dominant force to be reckoned with since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, but like all new technological innovations, they’re accompanied by a host of dilemmas that must be rectified to transcend into its natural next step of technological evolution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, in order to garner mainstream attraction and utilization, must lower their carbon emissions and not facilitate the further decimation of our planet. Banking the unbanked can not come at the cost of unbanking the planet of its atmosphere and clean energy. The time to change is now, and Aergo will perpetuate such an environmentally conscious zeitgeist.</p><p>Helpful Links:</p><p><a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Home - Crypto Climate Accord</a></p><p><a href="https://www.aergo.io/">https://www.aergo.io/</a></p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>At MATTR we’re always dreaming up ways to make decentralized identity and verifiable credentials easy and intuitive to use for as many people as possible.</p><p>From the start, it’s been a core part of our mission to make sure that end users understand the implications of decentralized identity and the control it affords them over their data and their privacy. This model offers users greater sovereignty over their own information by empowering individuals as both the holder and subject of information that pertains to them. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital&nbsp;wallets</a>.</p><p>We first released our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> for smartphones in June 2020, with a simple user interface to allow people to interact with and receive credentials from issuers as well as present credentials to relying parties. In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>[ update Jul 1, 2021 4:51PM EST&nbsp;]</p><p>We’ve found another minor glitch that will result in a “success” transaction but no upgrade&nbsp;event.</p><p>This will not affect the total balance or prevent you from any other activities. This will consume gas much like a failed transaction.</p> Our diagnostic <p>We have found that the issue relates to our <a href="https://upgrade.shyft.network/">upgrade.shyft.network</a> dApp’s rounding of floating point numbers in comparison to the input fields (human readable) and the ‘wei’ value in the background.</p><p>We can see this in the first completed Upgrade that emits Logs and Events. The second has not completed, the transaction is a ‘success’, but no on-chain balances have changed, and no event logs&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Zooming in, we can see that the input value ends with ‘050000’ and the ‘Quantity’ of the actual tokens in storage in this address are ‘048192’. As the input value is higher than the actual value, the Upgrade event fails, and due to the fact that we could not modify the original contract, we could not get additional events/notifications in&nbsp;place.</p> Suggested Fixes <p>1. A bit more patience — We’ll get a new dApp up that does the mathematics properly in relation to the input fields, should be able to get it up later tonight, reasonable 100% estimate is Friday June 2nd at 5pm&nbsp;EST.</p><p>2. If you want to do it right now — Simply enter the number manually into the text field instead of using the ‘max’ button on the interface, round to the nearest 5th decimal and you’ll be perfectly fine in consideration of the 0.0001 SHFT sent to all previous&nbsp;Holders.</p><p>Thanks for the feedback and support. We are working together to get this phase over as quickly as possible.</p><p>[ update Jul, 1, 2021&nbsp;]</p><p>The Shyft co-founder team came together to problem solve, and we’ve found a clever fix for this&nbsp;issue!</p><p>We ended up using <a href="https://disperse.app">https://disperse.app</a> to send 0.0001 SHFT to each user, forcing Etherscan to update the token balances &amp; associations for each of the existing token holders from the Shyft v1 contract.</p><p>We did this by using “export as csv” from the token holders in the v1 (<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xcba3eae7f55d0f423af43cc85e67ab0fbf87b61c#balances">https://etherscan.io/token/0xcba3eae7f55d0f423af43cc85e67ab0fbf87b61c#balances</a>)</p><p>and sent out the 0.0001 SHFT to each existing token holder, across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>We appreciate the community’s patience &amp; feedback while we were inspecting this issue&nbsp;:)</p><p>Hello everyone, Chris from the <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> here.

 Paying for use of HoloPorts during&nbsp;Alpha <p>We are incredibly appreciative of our community of early adopters who pre-purchased HoloPorts. In previous months many HoloPort owners contributed greatly to our ability to release early milestones. These community testers are people who have monitors and keyboards connected to their ports and who’ve dedicated their time to actively participate with our delivery team during early test cycles. Huge&nbsp;thanks!</p><p>Now we need to expand testing. It’s becoming increasingly important for the continued evolution of the Holo platform. At this stage, Holo is looking to set up parallel test environments which require consistent support from hundreds of HoloPorts. This will better reflect how the infrastructure and applications will work when running at scale on the platform. Creating multiple test environments helps our development and QA efforts and is especially needed for the upcoming release of hosted Elemental Chat, as well as the subsequent Holo application milestones.</p><p>Because of that, Holo would like to offer HoloPort owners a new opportunity to make their port available for use by Holo during the Alpha testing&nbsp;period.</p><p>Participants in the HoloPort Alpha Program can choose to volunteer their HoloPort or receive a small stipend in HoloFuel based on meeting the minimum metrics each month. The reason we are offering this stipend now is because as we move forward, it is critical that the HoloPorts remain turned on and connected to the Internet while we are&nbsp;testing.</p><p>Here are the requirements for the HoloPort Alpha&nbsp;Program:</p>  HoloPorts must be updated to the latest version of&nbsp;HPOS  Participants must be signed up and accepted into the HoloPort Alpha&nbsp;Program*  HoloPorts must have monthly uptime of&nbsp;95%  HoloPorts must maintain SSH at an availability level of&nbsp;99%  <p>A stipend of 10,000 HF** will accrue monthly for each port and will be paid upon Beta launch (mainnet) of the Holo platform. We’ll send all participants a weekly report on metrics and a monthly report that details the stipend accrual. For the general public we’re also preparing a simple dashboard that aggregates network data about the HoloPorts active on the platform.</p><p>Registration for the HoloPort Alpha program will open up in July. To get ready, it’s important that you <a href="https://forum.holo.host/t/how-to-update-your-holoport/3379">update your HoloPort</a> to the latest version of HPOS. If you own a HoloPort please reach out to <a href="http://help@holo.host">help@holo.host</a> for your invite to the Holo Forum where you will find all HoloPort guidance as well as community support.</p><p>We will be holding an AMA later this month and you can <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/RFsluzvz">submit questions with this&nbsp;link.</a></p><p>We’re excited to be expanding Alpha testing to the wider Holo host community!</p><p>– The Holo&nbsp;Team</p><p>* Holo may limit the program to certain jurisdictions as may be required by&nbsp;law.</p><p>** The stipend amount may change from time to time if there are material changes to the HOT&nbsp;price.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">The HoloPort Alpha Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Img source: NASA via unsplash.com<p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>, the Verifiable Data Platform for global trade, is proud to announce that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued Patent №11,050,572 titled, “Systems and Methods for a Decentralized Data Authentication Platform.” The patent covers unique technology in Transmute’s Platform that immutably anchors verifiable credentials to decentralized identifiers to enable cryptographically provable integrity checks.</p><p>In the Transmute Platform, we often refer to this specific anchoring process as the “Transmute Integrity Check.” Customers need the ability to prove that a credential was issued at a specific moment in time, so we leveraged the existing open standards in a unique way to provide an extension to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> that allows them to be anchored to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and checked for evidence of tampering at the same time the credential content is verified according to the standard process. This gives customers confidence that the data is authentic and has not been tampered with since it was anchored.</p><p>For example, an international shipping company can issue trade documents such as a verifiable commercial invoice using the Transmute Platform. This invoice can be cryptographically verified by any receiving party, agnostic of delivery method or technical system. Recipients like carriers, banks, consignees, or customs organizations can click a button or make an API call to run the Transmute Integrity Check ensuring that this exact invoice was in fact issued by the shipper at a particular moment in&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We built the Transmute Platform to solve the trust challenges inherent in multi-party transactions like moving goods through a supply chain from origin to end customer,” says Karyl Fowler, CEO and Co-Founder of Transmute. “We are known for our corporate commitment to open, interoperable global standards, and pragmatic implementation that meets customers on the systems they’re already relying on. Our technical approach builds atop these standards in a novel way that enables companies to securely share verifiable data across existing silos, and we patented this method to protect our customers’ ability to harness it at&nbsp;scale.”</p><p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> combines the best of centralized and decentralized technologies to secure critical trade data related to suppliers, products, and shipments to give customers a competitive edge in the increasingly dynamic global marketplace. Our Verifiable Data Platform leverages open standards-compliant decentralized identifier-based technology to streamline and enforce identity authorization via key-based signatures, cloud-wallets, verifiable credentials, and immutable logging. The Transmute Platform and its underlying microservice components are being actively piloted with clients and enterprise partners in the global trade and IT industries.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-issued-u-s-patent-for-decentralized-data-authentication-18f54a13745b">Transmute Issued U.S. Patent for Decentralized Data Authentication</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The full initial integration will also involve bridging OCEAN token from Ethereum Mainnet, and a new deployment of Ocean Market webapp components for Moonbeam. Once complete, this will enable users to publish data, stake on data, and buy data in the Polkadot ecosystem in an open, secure&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>The partnership between Ocean Protocol and Moonbeam will lead to additional updates. For example, assets from both Ethereum Mainnet and Moonbeam will be viewable side-by-side in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>. Further data privacy-enhancing features will be rolled out. And over time, there will be ways to bridge datatokens themselves across networks and to share liquidity.</p><blockquote>It’s our pleasure to work with the Moonbeam team to start engaging with the Polkadot ecosystem. We have long envisioned Ocean to be a data asset layer across many blockchain networks. Polkadot is all about interoperability among these networks. Since Ocean deployed initially to Ethereum Mainnet, then the clear starting point for Ocean in Polkadot is Moonbeam with its Ethereum compatibility.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol Co-Founder</blockquote><p>The Moonbeam team is continuously working to simplify the implementation process for Ethereum developers who want to expand to Polkadot. Ocean Protocol chose Moonbeam as its expansion point because of its unmatched compatibility. Now, the Ocean team can use its existing Ethereum smart contracts to access the new and growing Polkadot ecosystem.</p><blockquote>We’re excited to work with the Ocean team on their first expansion outside of Ethereum. By deploying to Moonbeam, Ocean Protocol will provide the Polkadot ecosystem with access to a robust Web3-based data marketplace.

In addition, users will have the ability to create entirely new derivative markets which utilize these data&nbsp;tokens.</p><blockquote>With this collaboration, Injective users will be able to create and access decentralised derivatives for datatokens starting with Tokenized Data Futures. This is another step towards establishing datatokens as first class citizens of DeFi and introducing a new asset class into DeFi&nbsp;space.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>The integration of the price feeds from Ocean will be made possible by Balancer, which is built on top of Ethereum. Given Injective Chain’s EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications, we will be able to acquire dynamic pricing data in order to create both perpetual and expiry futures contracts.</p><blockquote>We at Injective are thrilled to be working with Ocean which continues to be a leading provider of digital assets pertaining to data. This collaboration will undoubtedly aid in opening up new ways for users to interact with data tokens as well as DeFi as a whole. We look forward to democratizing access to data assets globally alongside the team at&nbsp;Ocean.</blockquote><blockquote>– Eric Chen, Injective CEO</blockquote><p>Once the price feeds are live, users can take part in creating new indices, data tracking markets, etc. Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This will allow anyone to both create a data market using only the price feeds from Balancer and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem. This can help to introduce new markets that were previously inconceivable within decentralized finance.</p> A Rapidly Growing Data&nbsp;Market <p>Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and enterprises to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it. Through <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, data publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas data consumers can access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. Publishing a dataset on Ocean amounts to an Initial Data Offering&nbsp;(IDO).</p><p>The data market is currently valued to be over $140B. This number is only expected to surge moving forward. Tokenized data assets of course present a profound opportunity to introduce new forms of capital allocation. Injective Protocol is seeking to take this one step further with the introduction of tokenized data futures which would help to unlock unlimited possibilities for trading data&nbsp;markets.</p> Looking Ahead <p>We look forward to nurturing the DeFi ecosystem further with the introduction of more innovative use cases for data as an asset. This will aid in both new forms of adoption for digital assets while also helping to signify the true flexibility of data&nbsp;markets.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value.

 Ontology first to support four smart contract platforms including the Ethereum Virtual Machine, providing faster block production speeds and lower handling&nbsp;fees. <p>At the start of 2021, Ontology’s technical team began developing the Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In addition to NeoVM, Native (Ontology) VM and WasmVM, we are adding support for the EVM. The goal is to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.</p><p>On the third anniversary of Ontology’s MainNet launch, we announced that the development of Ontology EVM had been completed. The existing version adds the Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web 3 APIs. At the same time, the virtual machine layer and transaction pool are optimized and enhanced, and the blockchain browser is synchronized.</p><p>Below, we describe the design and development details.</p> Part 1: Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine  EVM: General Introduction <p>Ethereum <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">describes</a> the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a ‘single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum&nbsp;client.’</p><p>It goes on to&nbsp;state:</p><p>The Ethereum protocol itself exists solely for the purpose of keeping the continuous, uninterrupted, and immutable operation of this special state machine; It’s the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one ‘canonical’ state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to&nbsp;block.</p> Ontology’s EVM: Introduction <p>The EVM developed by Ontology is a virtual machine compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It uses ONG as the gas fee for on-chain services and requires relatively low gas fee consumption. Our goal is to ensure that Ontology’s EVM is fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Part 2: Design and Development Process  Goals <p>Ontology’s smart contract system adopts the multi virtual machine scheme and supports three kinds of contracts; Native contracts, NeoVM contracts, and Wasm contracts. Thanks to Ethereum’s strong community and ecosystem, adding EVM support for Ontology can facilitate more existing Ethereum ecosystem developers to use Ontology.</p><p>Our aim is to ensure frictionless interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum to reduce migration costs of developers, and at the same time, avoid significant changes to the existing platforms to ensure the continuity of the ecosystem development.</p> Development Process and&nbsp;Results <p>Our development process lasted over one month, with one iteration. Upon completion, Ontology and Ethereum can interoperate seamlessly with a high level of compatibility. Specific features: updated browser, supported Ethereum account system, infrastructure, RPC (remote procedure call), and additional Web 3 interfaces.</p> Enhancements: <p>1) Account System at the Ledger&nbsp;Level</p><p>The underlying ledger status of Ontology only stores contract data; account data is stored in various contract storage areas, including native ONT and ONG contracts. However, Ethereum ledger status consists of two layers of MPT. The first layer is the account status, including the Nonce (Number only used once), the Ethereum balance and the status root of the account data. The second layer is the key value pair data of the contract account. Due to the huge gap, adopting an Ethereum solution would lead to a large number of destructive updates to Ontology. Therefore, we opened up a storage space to store the Nonce and contract codes of accounts related to Ethereum transactions. The key value pair data of the contract account is consistent with Ontology, which not only takes into account the function of Ethereum, but also ensures the compatibility of Ontology&nbsp;itself.</p><p>2) Virtual Machine&nbsp;(VM)</p><p>Based on its existing multi-VM system, Ontology can easily add EVM support. Most of the instructions are exactly the same as those on the Ethereum platform, with a few EVM instructions suitable only for Ethereum, such as COINBASE and DIFFICULTY, which use default values on Ontology. Because they are rarely used in dApps, most contracts can be seamlessly migrated in practical applications. We provide support for Ontology EVM calls from existing NeoVM and Wasm virtual machines to facilitate the interaction between existing contract applications and EVM applications. At the same time, in order to avoid the expansion and bifurcation of EVM, we do not currently provide support for EVM cross virtual machine&nbsp;calls.</p><p>3) Transaction Structure</p><p>Ontology’s transaction structure is scalable and supports several transaction types on demand. We support Ethereum EIP-155 transactions on the basis of existing transaction types, so that the transactions issued by existing Ethereum ecosystem wallets are compatible with Ontology&nbsp;EVM.</p><p>4）Transaction Pool&nbsp;Updated</p><p>The order of Ethereum’s transaction record must be increased according to the Nonce value of the account. To ensure this feature, we maintain a list of EIP-155 transactions in the transaction pool. Only transactions meeting the conditions can be packaged into&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>5）Web 3&nbsp;API</p><p>At present, Ontology EVM provides rich interfaces such as RESTful, JSON-RPC, and WebSocket. Since contract development tools, wallets and dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem all use Web 3 API, we developed an additional interface adaptation layer to support Web 3 API, ensuring contract development tools and wallets such as Truffle, Remix, and MetaMask, can be directly used for dApp development on Ontology.</p> Part 3: Advantages <p>With the launch of the Ontology EVM, users can access Ethereum applications and wallets in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>Developers can use contract development tools such as Truffle and Remix to realize seamless connections between two chains and experience a more compatible blockchain ecosystem&nbsp;.</p><p>Ontology contracts development has the following advantages:</p>  Contracts supported: industry-leading VM support; multi-VM includes four kinds of contracts (NeoVM, Native, Wasm,&nbsp;EVM).  Fees and Velocity: Users can experience the Ethereum ecosystem on Ontology blockchain, with lower gas fees and faster block production.  Wasm support: <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NjA3OTY0NQ==&amp;mid=2247484341&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=c105c06477f45ee5d7172f1b8244922b&amp;chksm=ce510547f9268c5199b5a5ed3febd3d6f453e1e16c14c9fa570f6cc90866fb2aa2f0c89017e8&amp;token=1622747231&amp;lang=en_US#rd">Wasm</a> has performed excellently since its launch two years&nbsp;ago.   Part 4: Conclusion <p>When Multi-VM launched in 2020, the Ontology Technical team&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>In the field of blockchain, the goal of virtual machine (VM) technology is to create a smart contract execution environment suitable for all transactions. However, from a technical point of view, the efficiency of contract execution, the complexity of supported transactions and the ability of cross-system cooperation are all key factors. In this process, different VMs have different application scopes. Ontology Multi-VM is committed to meeting a wider range of transaction requirements, bringing higher execution efficiency and lower gas fees. The design and launch of Ontology EVM is an important aspect of this goal, which will bring more transaction scenarios.</blockquote><p>On the basis of the underlying completed functions, more compatibility tests and enhancements of the Ethereum tool chain will be carried out in the future to further satisfy the requirements of trusted data interactions and bring more convenient and efficient experiences for developers and&nbsp;users.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>New regulations set to come into force on July 1st will have a significant impact on the online gambling industry in Germany. They will promote responsible gaming, making the industry safer for users and fairer for operators that comply.</p>
<p>But coming amidst a spike in online gambling activity will make it even more important for operators to get it right. Processing high volumes while still complying with regulations will be critical.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2021-06-webinar-gambling/">expert panel from IDnow and operator GVC-Entain</a>, came together recently to discuss these regulations, implementation challenges, and the future benefits for the industry.</p>
 New Germany gambling regulations 
<p>As anyone in the gaming industry knows, regulation differs significantly between countries. Gambling in Germany is governed under the Interstate Treaty on Gambling law, and online gambling is heavily restricted.</p>
<p>New German gambling regulations will come into effect from July 1st, 2021. This will open up the online gambling market to new operators, but with many requirements for safe gambling. The regulations will impact many areas of online gambling – including onboarding and verifying users, moving to deposit limits, controlling advertising, and equal taxation for the industry.</p>
 Promoting responsible gaming 
<p>A major focus is to promote safer gambling. This includes protecting those who are underage, controlling advertising, and moving gambling away from the black market. Players will further be addressed with a database introduced to monitor user and operator interaction.</p>
<p>There will be uniform regulation across all states under a central gaming authority based in the state of Sachsen-Anhalt. Licensing will transfer to this authority in 2023.</p>
 Regulations will be challenging for some operators 
<p>Some areas of the regulations are more contentious. The introduction of a uniform tax rate of 5.3% on turnover is a key example. How this will play out in particular for smaller operators and new entrants to the market remains to be seen. During the webinar, Rayissa Armata,&nbsp;Head of Regulatory Affairs&nbsp;at IDnow, explained how this taxation is likely to be challenged.</p>
<p>Over the course of the webinar, we also shared experience of working with operators in such restricted markets. We were highlighting how some operators, particularly smaller ones without the proper knowledge, choose not to enter these more regulated markets. Participants agreed that we will have to wait and see how this plays out as regulations come into effect over time.</p>
 Changes will take time to be fully implemented 
<p>The new regulations come into force on July 1st. But it will take time for many of the changes to be introduced and for operators and the regulator to see the effects, with many areas experimental for the first year or more.</p>
<p>Rayissa explained how the introduction is a great first step, but there is much more to follow. She told the webinar:</p>
<p>“Some requirements are hard and strict and go into effect straight away, and other aspects of these requirements will develop over time.”</p>
<p>Some KYC and verification rules will come into effect immediately, for example. But moving from stake limits to deposit limits will be transitional, as will the introduction of a database.</p>
 KYC is a vital part of the changes 
<p>One of the most important parts of the new regulations is the onboarding and verification of users. As the industry moves to be safer, proper verification of users by all operators is vital. Transition phases for this have been in effect since October 2020, but <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/gambling/">regulations will be strengthened from July 1st</a>.</p>
<p>Checks will include the verification of the user’s name, address, and date of birth. But KYC is about much more than just mandatory identity and age checks. It is also intended to prevent fraud, offer security, promote high conversion rates, and help operators avoid regulatory fines.</p>
 Important to balance regulations with user experience 
<p>Furthermore, we explained in our webinar how these KYC changes could impact users. The extra steps created during onboarding take time out of the user experience and can even create a sense of anxiety.</p>
<p>This experience is not uncommon. In fact, similar user behaviour has been seen in the crypto sector already where users were previously not used to being verified.</p>
<p>Using technology in the right way can help make the process as timely and seamless as possible.</p>
 Operators can make the most out of KYC 
<p>An important point to keep in mind is that proper KYC can help operators stand out as reputable.<br>
Roger Tyrzyk,&nbsp;Director Global Gambling &amp; Sales UK with IDnow, explained how it is important to “see KYC as an enabler rather than a distractor – nowadays people appreciate when they are being checked on.”</p>
<p>And Martin Lycka, SVP Compliance at GVC-Entain, supported this from an operator point of view. He noted that in some cases, it can be challenging to find the right balance, but in the long run, operators that embrace it will benefit.</p>
 Changes coming amidst a spike in gambling 
<p>These new regulations will be particularly impactful as they come during a period of high online gambling activity. Implementation will come mid-way through the Euro 2020 championship, with large spikes in activity expected.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&nbsp;is not possible&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply dismiss the impact of the past events and the huge rise in online gambling with people watching from home. While sharing how betting at the 2021 Grand National was up 28% from 2019, we came to learn this conclusion:</p>
<p>“If we look at the Grand National, we’ve had an all-time record in the amount of volume we’ve seen in betting just on single events across exchanges and sports books of 92.8 million that was traded on the big races, that made up a 71% increase across the three-day festival.”</p>
<p>Onboarding a high volume of customers while complying with regulations presents a challenge. Martin provided some perspective from an operator’s point of view. He discussed how the launch might not be so straightforward with the date clash, but their systems are prepared for it.</p>
<p>He also expects that the phased introduction of the regulations will help with this, and the expected transition of existing licenses will ease the burden.</p>
 Responsible gambling in Germany is critical to industry success 
<p>Looking ahead beyond July 1st, though, what is the expected future impact on the gambling industry?</p>
<p>Martin provided some excellent context on this from an operator’s point of view, explaining his view that “Responsible gambling is absolutely critical to the long-term sustainability of in the industry. ”</p>
<p>He explained further how “We do see regulation as an opportunity to create markets that are sustainable in the long run company.” Currently, 99% of Entain’s revenue comes from regulated markets, or those with upcoming regulations.</p>
<p>He also stressed that to make it work, it will need to be implemented to the highest level of responsible gaming standards, and German authorities will need to take action against those who choose not to comply.</p>
<p>Going forward, there will be more benefits seen from verification. As users get more used to it, and operators handle higher volumes and greater accuracy, security should increase, and fraud will become harder.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to understand about these new regulations and their implementation. For some more insight from the experts, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2021-06-webinar-gambling/">watch the full webinar</a>.</p>

<p>Digital identity is the next big leap as we embark on digitizing an aspect that uniquely represents each of us. What started as baby steps to empower oneself and have complete control over one’s identity, soon evolved into a movement, and led to the emergence of what’s called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">need for SSI</a> was accentuated by the COVID pandemic, where all activities moved online, and there was a greater awareness about owning and protecting one’s identity.</p><p>Is this the beginning of a paradigm shift? What can companies do to increase the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">adoption of SSI</a> in the post-COVID world?</p><p>We asked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sangyshin/">Sang Shin</a>, the Director of Digital Innovation at Singapore-based <a href="https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index">Temasek</a>, and here are the excerpts of this interview.</p> What are the key trends that will shape the post-COVID world? <p>Though the infrastructure for this migration from a physical to a digital world was already in place, what was missing was a change in user behavior, and the COVID pandemic brought about this behavioral change.</p><blockquote>During the pandemic, users had to forcefully embrace the digital world to continue on with their everyday activities, and this eventually conditioned them to not just adapt well, but also make it an integral part of their lives now. In this sense, COVID was a catalyst for the digitization of&nbsp;mankind.</blockquote><p>COVID also showed us the power of a multidisciplinary approach, innovation, and collaboration of data, all of which led to novel ways of controlling and managing the disease, and this multidisciplinary approach is another key shift towards digitization.</p><p>When you extend this learning to digital identity, it translates to having an open mind and collaborating with different entities to enhance the quick adoption of&nbsp;SSI.</p> How to leverage these trends and create a lasting transformation? <p>A difficult question, given the complexity of the digital identity space and the many known and unknown factors working within&nbsp;it.</p><p>To build on what we have created and to sustain it, there needs to be a concerted effort from everyone involved such as the regulatory authorities, users, and companies operating in the private and public&nbsp;space.</p><p>In many ways, this is a multi-dimensional playing field. At the grassroots or bottoms-up level is the users’ drive to own their digital identity while at the top-down level, organizations must create a working economic model, and the two should meet at the midway point of the activity to ensure a digital identity solution that would work for both these entities.</p><p>The third component in this mix is the legislative and sovereign laws that are underneath all these activities. This is probably the most important aspect of sustainability because a sovereign nation must demand a secure digital identity for its residents.</p><p>All these three aspects have to come together for a lasting transformation.</p> The digital <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallet</a> announcement by <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">the EU</a> is seen as a stimulus for greater adoption of digital identity. What can companies do from&nbsp;hereon? <p>Companies must collaborate with entities from the private and public sector and take a multi-disciplinary approach to understand the needs of different user segments and come up with products that would cater to these&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Secondly, companies can strive to make an intelligent prediction of the general shift instead of making very specific predictions because of the many unknown aspects that can suddenly change the dynamics, like a new legislation or a change of government. To this end, it’s best to stay away from high-risk areas that are too dependent on sovereign legislation.</p><p>Alongside, it’s important to educate users and developers about the possible use-cases and market opportunities of self-sovereign identity, so companies can leverage this positive change in user behavior.</p><p>Finally and most importantly, companies must build an economic and incentivization model that creates a win-win situation for everyone involved. For example, offer discounts and better services for using the digital identity solution, and so&nbsp;on.</p> What’s the single most important aspect that can shape the future of digital identity? <blockquote>A person’s identity is the most personal thing that one can digitize because it represents YOU.</blockquote><p>Though we often get lost in technologies, frameworks, legislation, and economic models, it’s ultimately the human aspect that will define the future of the digital identity industry. Bearing this in mind can determine the heights we scale and how quickly we can get&nbsp;there.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">Innovation in Digital Identity and Credentials in the Post-Covid World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 🔮Shyft Network v.2 Ethereum Contract&nbsp;Upgrade  V.2 Integrates critical components and features for Shyft Network’s use cases, and it paves the way for the launch of the&nbsp;network. <p>Shyft Network was designed as a cross-chain, general purpose, smart contract infrastructure to support use cases that require compliance, identity &amp; trusted data requirements.</p><p>As we move closer to the launch of mainnet, we have identified use cases and areas of opportunity where the network and it’s layer 2 smart contract infrastructure can truly shine. Our development team has rolled out a series of improvements to upgrade our Ethereum smart contract and we want to invite our community to join us in this exciting next step. This upgrade is critical to the next phases of use cases that the Shyft Network was designed to&nbsp;enable.</p> What is SHFT&nbsp;v.2 <p>The upgrade brings the following critical architecture updates as well as key feature sets into the Shyft Core smart contracts:</p>  Serves as bridging between the Shyft Network layer 1. This is critical to ensure users, use cases &amp; assets are 1:1 transferable across all EVM’s that support Shyft Network core contracts;  Creates the necessary upgrade requirements for the ecosystem to utilize institutional data &amp; asset composability architecture for dapps &amp; DeFi. These modifications allow the Shyft core contracts to utilize user, data &amp; asset routing tables enabling rule engines &amp; trust channels tooling for institutional liquidity requirements to be deployable on Ethereum;  Enables opt-in synthetic asset creation into the Shyft Network smart contracts for bootstrapping institutional liquidity pools;  Enables incentivized liquidity pools for community rewards to be easily utilized &amp; deployed, and  Fixes Etherscan &amp; related data requirements as well as minor changes that allow for smart contract extensions.   The Upgrade Process &amp; Philosophy <p>The Shyft Network smart contracts do not allow for automated upgrades so users &amp; VASPs (liquidity venues; exchanges) will have to utilize the upgrade paths in order to complete their migration. This is to ensure that, in the future, the community does not allow core developers to make changes to the smart contract system without users directly taking steps within the upgrade&nbsp;process.</p><p>We believe in decentralization &amp; while it is easier to allow for forced upgrades, we believe long term that these controls should be based on user opt in &amp;&nbsp;choice.</p> SHFT V2 Upgrade Information <p>The migration process is available starting today. It is advised that users complete the upgrade within a week from launch of upgrade. We want to ensure that the Shyft Network community transitions prior to new deployments, upgrades &amp; deployment, by the Node Federation, of the Shyft Network main&nbsp;network.</p> How to do the token&nbsp;upgrade:   Open the MetaMask Browser extension and log in to your&nbsp;wallet;  Scroll down and select “Add Token” and type in the SHFT v.2 Token Contract Address:<br>0xb17C88bDA07D28B3838E0c1dE6a30eAfBCF52D85<br>**Don’t worry about the other fields as they will&nbsp;autofill  Go to the token upgrade portal (<a href="https://upgrade.shyft.network/">https://upgrade.shyft.network/</a>) and connect to your MetaMask&nbsp;wallet;  Perform the token upgrade by clicking on “Max” and then “Upgrade”<br>**Make sure you have enough ETH in your MetaMask to cover gas fees or else you will be unable to upgrade your&nbsp;tokens**  Wait a few minutes to confirm your balance,&nbsp;and  Enjoy your V2 Shyft&nbsp;Tokens!   Wrapping Up <p>These are very exciting times for Shyft Network and we want the community to be able to fully utilize Shyft and see its use cases in action as quickly as possible. As we approach full decentralization, we are making sure that this transition takes place in the most coordinated fashion. Reach out to us should you have any questions.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Google is finally making a genuine commitment to privacy by cutting off Android app developers’ access to the unique Advertising IDs of users who opt out of receiving personalized ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This change pretty much matches&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">Apple’s new ATT</a>&nbsp;which allows users to say no to cross-app tracking by iOS apps for personalized ad purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the changes are rolled out later this year, Google will completely cut off app developers’ access to the Google Advertising IDs (AAIDs), instead showing a string of zeroes, for those users who opt out of cross-app tracking. The AAIDs are like Apple’s IDFAs, which uniquely identify a user’s device and companies use to track users everywhere they go online to customize ads to their interests and searches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Google change also means app developers won’t be able to use the AAIDs for non-tracking purposes either, such as fraud detection and analytics. Google promises a different solution for these areas in July this year.Google says Android app developers will still be able to use a persistent or proprietary identifier (no external linkability) but will need to make clear any data collection linked to this in their app privacy policies. They’ll also have to handle the data under the terms of Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html#use">Developer Distribution Agreement</a>, as well as all relevant privacy laws.</p>



<p>This is the second big announcement from Google recently, but this one does more for user privacy than the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/googles-safety-section-doesnt-really-keep-pace-with-apple/">new safety section</a> in Google Play which came in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time Google is keeping up with Apple’s new ATT but its move on cross-app tracking differs from the ATT in a couple ways. First, users won’t see an in-app opt-in prompt and won’t be able to adjust each app’s access to their IDFA. Instead, Android users will have the blanket option of opting out of&nbsp;all tracking for all apps. It’s worth reiterating that Google is asking users to&nbsp;opt out of tracking&nbsp;rather than to&nbsp;opt in like Apple, which some&nbsp;<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/google-to-let-android-users-opt-out-to.html">commentators</a>&nbsp;say might be to protect the tech giant from further antitrust backlash.</p>



<p>Google says it will start phasing in this latest change in late 2021. The change will initially affect apps running on Android 12 devices and move to other apps running on devices that support Google Play in early 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we know, consumers&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">increasingly rejecting</a>&nbsp;personalized advertising over privacy concerns. Apple’s new ATT&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">got very low opt-in rates</a>&nbsp;for cross-app tracking—a loud message from consumers globally. Let’s see what users think of Google’s latest move.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Apple’s ATT, Google’s move on AAIDs is a good move for data privacy, but it doesn’t stop tracking within a single app. It’s only for cross-app tracking. You still need MySudo to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data </a><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized</a>&nbsp;and protected across different services.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are running on Binance’s finance-centric chain</p><p>As part of Ocean’s <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc">Binance Smart Chain</a> (BSC). BSC has seen wide adoption with over 865 dApps, 700 million transactions, and 82 million unique addresses. BSC focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and draws on the strengths of <a href="http://binance.com">Binance.com</a> exchange.</p><p>BSC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style tokens. It’s a Proof-of-Authority (federated) chain with a small number of nodes, which allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>With Ocean deployed to BSC, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in BSC. They simply point their wallet in MetaMask to BSC, and Ocean Market will show data assets registered in the BSC&nbsp;network.  Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (market) with&nbsp;BSC.  Token holders can move their <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48">OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet</a> to <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a">OCEAN on BSC</a>, and back using <a href="http://binance.com">Binance.com</a> or <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/bridge">Binance bridge</a>. On Ethereum it follows the ERC-20 standard; the Binance equivalent is BEP-20. <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-get-started-with-binance-smart-chain-bsc">Here’s more info on how to&nbsp;bridge</a>.  <p>Ocean components supported in BSC include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, [BSC] OCEAN smart contract, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#binance-smart-chain">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol deployments to Ethereum mainnet and to Polygon (Matic) mainnet, and related services including Ocean Market, will continue as&nbsp;before.</p> Cross-chain Mental&nbsp;Model <p>Prior to BSC, Ocean Protocol was deployed on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon (née Matic), Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Ganache. An Ocean Market user could change the network by pointing their wallet (e.g. MetaMask) to a different network, and Ocean Market would show data assets that are on that network. Ocean.js and ocean.py drivers are similar; the dApp developer simply specifies the “network” URL. It’s the same for&nbsp;BSC.</p><p>This makes three “production” networks that Ocean is deployed to: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and now Binance Smart Chain&nbsp;(BSC).</p><p>In each of these networks, tokens on the network have real value associated, so there need to be token bridges across networks. For BSC this&nbsp;is:</p>  OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as OCEAN on&nbsp;BSC.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to BNB for gas fees on&nbsp;BSC.   New Datasets and&nbsp;Services <p>People can choose to publish datasets and services in Ethereum, Polygon, or BSC. With Ethereum, there are higher gas fees and confirmation latency, but in exchange, the UX and familiarity of users is high. For BSC, the costs and latency are much lower, though users need to use the [BSC]OCEAN bridged&nbsp;tokens.</p> Previously Published Datasets/Services <p>Let’s say a publisher has an existing dataset/service as an Ocean datatoken contract published on Ethereum, along with a pool of sizable liquidity. They shouldn’t just publish a new datatoken contract to BSC for the same dataset/service. This would be highly unfair to their existing datatoken holders and stakers on Ethereum because value in the new token siphons value from the&nbsp;old.</p><p>Ideally, there would be bridges for datatokens, just like the bridge for OCEAN. This might seem like it would come out-of-the-box since datatokens follow the ERC20 standard, but alas, it doesn’t work because there are technical “gotchas” related to datatoken metadata and more. These issues are solvable and currently being worked on, but not in time for this&nbsp;release.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pragmatic workaround for publishers and stakers called the Republish Rule. The basic idea is that publishers can republish if there’s sufficiently low liquidity in the original datasets. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Here are&nbsp;details</a>.</p> Further Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;BSC   <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#binance-smart-chain">Ocean-related tokens and services in&nbsp;BSC</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/bsc-bridge">Tutorial on bridging OCEAN in Ethereum mainnet, to OCEAN in&nbsp;BSC</a>  <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a">OCEAN contract in BSC blockchain explorer</a>   Announcement Statements <blockquote>Binance Smart Chain has been an excellent addition to the EVM ecosystem, considering the prohibitively high gas fees on Ethereum mainnet. Binance Smart Chain has created a top-tier platform for EVM smart contracts and for bridging across chains. We’re excited to deliver yet another milestone on our multi-chain strategy so that Ocean users may benefit from lower gas costs in Ocean Market and other emerging dApps and protocols that use Ocean technology.</blockquote><blockquote>– Bruce Pon, Founder at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

The integration of ARIADNEXT will help to meet this rising demand by providing an outstanding, frictionless user experience.</p>
<p>Together we will work towards our clear joint vision of providing European businesses with a one-stop solution for identity verification, offered through a fully comprehensive and seamless identity verification platform.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow reveals a few more details about the deal:</p>
<p>What drew your attention to ARIADNEXT?</p>
<p>ARIADNEXT has built its impressive offering on the foundation of state-of-the-art technology, they have great products and a passionate team behind it. Our two companies share the same values of universality and simplicity as well as the constant strive for excellence, and I am excited about what our joint teams can achieve together in the future.</p>
<p>When did you first meet the management team at ARIADNEXT? </p>
<p>I have known ARIADNEXT’s founders Marc and Guillaume since February 2020. I admire what they have built and share their passion for the industry.</p>
<p>Will the founders and the team stay on board?</p>
<p>Of course, the team is the heart of every operation, and we are looking forward to welcoming them into our company as valuable members of the IDnow family. We love being curious and learning from each other on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Will you retain ARIADNEXT’s locations? </p>
<p>Yes, we will retain all locations for now. Firstly, it is important for all employees to retain their working space and in addition to this, keeping a presence across Europe supports our joint vision of becoming a Pan European leader in the industry.</p>
<p>At IDnow, we are also practicing a flexible remote working policy. In most roles you can work from wherever you feel most productive. It can be in the office in Munich – or in Rennes – or in your home office. Perhaps some of the new colleagues want to join us in our Munich headquarters or the other way round.</p>
<p>What are your plans looking into the near future?</p>
<p>We are very excited about the ARIADNEXT’s product offering and integrating our portfolios together. This will be a big step in enabling us to provide a comprehensive solution for all our joint customers and their needs.</p>
<p>We will also be very focused on bringing the companies together – their cultures, their organizational structures and of course the teams. We are accountable for this process and want to make sure all employees in both companies feel secure and also passionate about the acquisition and the future.</p>
<p>What does success look for ARIADNEXT and IDnow like in 5 years’ time?</p>
<p>We have a clear joint vision of creating a leading pan European identity verification platform however, success for us is not defined by an end result but the process of getting there. I would say a strong team spirit, collaboration, trust and achieving excellence in everything we do together.</p>

The European Union is on a mission to achieve data sovereignty. This is supported by the European Digital Strategy, released last year. It is aimed at realising the EU’s vision of ensuring that, by 2030, the EU’s share of the data economy is in line with the region’s traditional economic weight. And the strategy itself is based upon empowering businesses and people with the right technology to gain control of their data.




 




But are we equally as concerned about data as the EU policymakers? Although incidents such as data leaks and data abuse of data fuel controversy and debate, they haven’t yet led to a mass exodus from platforms or social media channels.




 





 Data sovereignty and data sharing 




In recent years, the discussion around data sovereignty and data sharing has steadily increased. The public is more aware of what is right way to handle their data and that their data itself is a valuable asset. The General Data Protection Regulation has paved the way for organisations to be more responsible with people’s data. Now is the time for regulation to evolve and support individuals’ data sovereignty.




 





<blockquote>Meaningful control, ownership, and other claims to data articulated by a variety of agents ranging from individuals to countries. Data sovereignty alludes to a nuanced mixture of normative concepts such as inclusive deliberation and recognition of the fundamental rights of data subjects.<p></p>Data sovereignty: A review, Hummel et al. (2021)</blockquote>





 




Whilst it may be helpful to have a legal description of what data sovereignty means, we’re really interested in what it means in practical terms, and how it contributes to the development of a more equitable digital society.<br><br>How does it impact our daily life as citizens, employees, customers, patients and students?




 




How many of us really think about all the data we are producing, or what happens to it?&nbsp;<br><br>And what does data sovereignty mean to you? <br><br>The answers to all these questions and more will be published as part of the first Data Sovereignty Monitor, providing us with a dashboard of where we are today and how we are thinking about our digital life in the future. <br><br>Please spare a few minutes of your time to help us learn from one another by sharing your opinions in this anonymised survey on this important topic.

 Delivery versus Delivery (DvD) Transfers 
<p>DvD transfers allow the execution of trading security tokens with stablecoins, on a peer-to-peer basis between counterparties.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This month we take a look at the introduction of DvD (Delivery versus Delivery) transfers in our service offering.</p>
<p>As you know from our previous communications, the T-REX protocol and our platforms already support <a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/">simple transfers and conditional transfers</a>. They allow an investor:</p>
 
 In the case of simple transfers: to transfer a position from his wallet, on a peer-to-peer basis to another investor’s wallet, as long as this other investor is already white-listed and satisfies the eligibility rules defined by the issuer for the token considered and; 
 In the case of conditional transfers: to transfer a position from his wallet to another (white-listed) investor wallet, upon prior approval of the transfer by the issuer (or his mandated agent). 
 
<p>We are now introducing and rolling-out a DvD transfer functionality – secured by a specific blockchain smart contract – allowing an investor to transfer a position of a T-REX compatible token against a position in any ERC20-compatible token.</p>
<p>The sequence for performing a DvD transfer is as follows:</p>
 
 Investor A instructs the delivery of a quantity of T-REX compatible security token Y from his wallet to Investor B wallet against a quantity of token Z; 
 Investor B receives a request for approval of the terms of the DvD transfer and validates (or rejects) it; 
 Upon validation of the request by investor B, the DvD transfer is executed on the blockchain i.e. the two positions of tokens are exchanged between the wallets of investors A and B simultaneously and inter-dependantly to mitigate counterparty risk. 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			

		 
	 
        
	 
		 
			

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Although this functionality could be used in other contexts, DvD transfers have primarily been designed to allow the execution of trades agreed on a peer-to-peer basis between counterparties where a quantity of T-REX compatible security token is exchanged against a quantity of “cash token”, “stablecoin”, “settlement coin” or equivalent.</p>
<p>The DvD transfer functionality is available as part of our services both on the Ethereum and the Polygon networks.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-mainnet-will-launch-on-july-7th-2021/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=nominating_validators_on_docks_proof_of_stake_network">announced</a> last week, Dock’s mainnet will be transitioning from Proof of Authority to Proof of Stake on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT. To help prepare our community for this exciting step, in this post we will expand upon our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-testnet-is-now-live/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=nominating_validators_on_docks_proof_of_stake_network">earlier article</a> and explain how Dock token holders will be able to earn passive income by participating in the new network as nominators.</p><p>Nominators are an integral part of the new Proof of Stake mainnet, as they help secure the network by electing validators and extend the utility of the Dock token by using it as a tool for nomination. After candidate validators begin accepting nominations, nominators can review their details - e.g., identity, commission rate, and their current level of stake - and decide on which validators to support (a nominator can back up to 16 validators at a time). Nominators can then make a transaction on the Dock chain to stake (lock up) Dock tokens for the selected validator(s). When the nomination period is over, the Proof of Stake algorithm automatically selects the candidates with the highest stakes to become validators. Token holders can review validator information and stake tokens using our <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/staking">network frontend application</a> once the mainnet launches on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT. Step-by-step instructions on nominating using this platform can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/staking">here</a>.</p><p>Once a validator is selected and begins to successfully produce blocks on the Dock mainnet, the validator and their nominators start earning rewards in the form of Dock tokens. The rewards consist of <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">emission rewards</a> released by the Dock network and the transaction fees paid by network users, and how they are split among the validator and the nominators depends on the validator’s commission rate and how many tokens each party has staked. It takes 7 days for the locked tokens to be unlocked (or unbonded) further to the processing of an unbond transaction. </p><p>For example, let’s say that a validator generates 100 tokens as rewards, where their own stake is 10% of the total stake behind the validator, their commission is 5%, and they have 3 nominators with 35%, 30%, and 20% stake each. In this case, the network would distribute 15 tokens (10 for staking + 5 for commission) to the validator, and provide 35, 30, and 20 tokens to the nominators. Here’s a table that summarizes this scenario:</p><br><p>Validator Stake</p><p>Validator Commission</p><p>Nominator 1</p><p>Nominator 2</p><p>Nominator 3</p><p>% of Total Stake</p><p>10%</p><p>5%</p><p>35%</p><p>30%</p><p>20%</p><p>Tokens Received (Out of 100)</p><p>10</p><p>5</p><p>35</p><p>30</p><p>20</p><p>We strongly recommend that nominators perform their due diligence on the candidate validators before locking up tokens on their behalf, as backing validators that misbehave on the network may result in having some or all of the staked tokens <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/slashing">slashed</a>. In addition, nominators should be strategic when deciding which validator(s) to support and how much tokens to stake, because backing a validator who already has a large number of nominators or staking only a small amount could prevent a nominator from earning rewards. More information on these considerations can be found in <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/staking-and-nominating">this article</a> from our docs.</p><p>We are currently working with various partners to make it possible for DOCK holders to stake and nominate through exchanges, staking platforms, and hardware wallets. We will provide updates as soon as these methods become available. In the meantime, please feel free to review our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a>, read other articles on our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a>, and reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a>.</p>

(He would very much appreciate your feedback/thoughts/discussions/etc.)</p><p>This week:</p>  Overview of the six antitrust bills that just passed the house subcommittee  What this means for antitrust and Big&nbsp;Tech  What people are&nbsp;saying  This week in antitrust  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Felix Salmon on Lina&nbsp;Khan  This week in&nbsp;crypto  This week in&nbsp;identity  Stuff happens   1. A quick overview of the six antitrust bills that just got approved by the&nbsp;House <p>Last week we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-165-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-ftc-chief-lina-khan-ea39ef54b384">talked about Lina Khan</a>, the new 32 year-old chair of the FTC. This week, let’s get into some of the nitty gritty of the six bills written and passed by the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>First — this is a really big deal, as <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">Matt Stoller points&nbsp;out</a>:</p><blockquote>This isn’t the end of the process, but it’s the first Congressional vote to actually restructure powerful firms since the 1996 Telecom Act, and the first real Congressional attack on concentrated corporate power since the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. Congressman Mondaire Jones summed up the hearing where they voted to do so. “Unless we break these companies up,” he said, “they will continue to be above the&nbsp;law.’”</blockquote><p>The first two bills are general antitrust ammunition for antitrust enforcers. One pads the accounts, increasing the FTC’s budget from $351 million to $418 million. The other prevents companies from opportunistically moving cases to friendlier jurisdictions — a go-to&nbsp;tactic.</p><p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">Here’s Matt again</a> on the significance:</p><blockquote>These two bills might not seem like a big deal. However, if these two bills were all that passed, they would still comprise the single most important strengthening of Federal antitrust law in a generation. For decades, antitrust was just not important, and the Judiciary Committee didn’t bother to focus on it. So to have these markups, and pass these bills, is in itself meaningful.</blockquote><p>The other four are specifically aimed at Big Tech — directly addressing many of the issues presented by <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">the antitrust subcommittee’s report last&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>Overview, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">courtesy of&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>1) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-3849-N000002-Amdt-3.pdf">ACCESS Act</a> mandates that big tech firms have to make their systems open to competitors and business rivals, in the same way that AT&amp;T customers can talk to T-Mobile customers, or users of different email systems can communicate with one&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>[We <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-165-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-ftc-chief-lina-khan-ea39ef54b384">talked about the ACCESS Act last week</a> — basically the portability and interoperability act.]</blockquote><blockquote>2) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3826-N000002-Amdt-4.pdf">merger bill</a> makes it harder for big tech firms to buy&nbsp;rivals.</blockquote><blockquote>3) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3816-N000002-Amdt-5.pdf">nondiscrimination bill</a> is intended to ban the ability to big tech firms to preference their own products, the way Google substitutes its own reviews for Yelp reviews, even if Yelp’s reviews are&nbsp;better.</blockquote><blockquote>4) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3825-N000002-Amdt-6.pdf">break-up bill</a> is supposed to split apart big tech firms by prohibiting platforms from owning any line of business that uses that platform.</blockquote><p>All six of those bills were passed by the committee!</p><p>For context, we <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">bring back&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>What has been happening since the financial crisis of 2008, and what continues today, is nothing short of a revolution in the way Americans think about political economy and monopoly power. We haven’t had such ferment over these issues since the 1890s or 1930s, during the Gilded Age and New Deal. Any one of these bills put forward would be the biggest strengthening of Federal antitrust enforcement in at least fifty years, so that all six passed out of committee — especially the bill that breaks up these firms by statute — is remarkable.</blockquote> 2. What this means for the future of antitrust and Big&nbsp;Tech Photo: Alessio&nbsp;Jacona<p>To be clear, this is history making stuff. But it’s also just the first step with plenty of uncertainty ahead. Assuming these bills become law, there will still be wrangling over verbiage. Laws will be open to interpretation. Loopholes will be found. And we’re still going to rely on regulators and judges to enforce those&nbsp;laws.</p><p>It’s also unclear the ramifications of some of these laws — though well intentioned.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2021/06/21/standards-competition-governance">here’s standards expert Mark Nottingham</a>:</p><blockquote>This bill requires designated platforms (likely candidates would be Google, Facebook and Amazon) to conform to interoperability standards set by new a new committee run by the FTC. If it passes, the APIs that define the next layer of the Internet will not be based upon broad community input, review, or participation.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, the FTC will hand-pick the participants at its pleasure, and will retain change control over the APIs.3. Even if the right mix of people gets onto the committee, its role is explicitly ‘advisory’.4 Documentation for those APIs is only supplied to ‘competing businesses or potential competing businesses.’5 There’s no guarantee they’ll be&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>To be clear, I’m super-happy that Lina Khan is now the FTC Chair. Some big platform heads need kicking, and her boots are laced. That said, technical standards defined to force interoperability on big tech will inevitably become the de facto standards for the industries that they’re established within, potentially lasting far longer than the companies they’re designed to hobble (if they do their jobs well). That effectively makes the FTC a new Internet governance institution.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2021/06/21/standards-competition-governance">As Mark points out</a>, that’s not how current standards bodies like the W3C are set&nbsp;up:</p><blockquote>These bodies are set up for voluntary, not mandatory standards, and the spectre of mandatory implementation for some parties has a huge distorting effect. As someone who’s been involved in Internet and Web standardisation for more than twenty years, I’m not sure how it would go, and there are a lot of hard questions that would need to be answered.</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean we won’t see a world where the W3C works closely with the FTC.

But the California delegation’s hesitation to fully support them may foretell some trouble for them in the full House, and their future in the Senate is likely to be even&nbsp;rockier.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/64ad09">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>The technology industry lobbied against the package, which includes the American Choice and Innovation Online Act. That bill, which advanced in a 24–20 vote, would, among other things, bar platforms from favoring their own products or services over those of others, keep them from restricting the interoperability of products or services and ban their use of customer or other businesses’s data to to help the platform’s own business interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Prior to the vote, Google and Amazon had asked the committee to slow its work on the package of bills, arguing that the changes would force them to degrade the quality of their products and services and harm consumers and small businesses.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/antitrust-overhaul-congress.html">NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>“We think it’s an uphill climb for the toughest bills,” said Paul Gallant, a research analyst at Cowen and Company. “The Senate filibuster is always the highest hurdle, and I suspect it will hold back the toughest of these bills. But the House is going faster and farther against tech than anyone expected.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-facebook-pressure-falls-short-as-major-antitrust-measures-advance-in-house-committee-11624505607">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>Many Republicans also voiced concern that the package was overreaching by handing too much new power to government agencies, while a few tech-friendly Democrats raised concerns that the legislation had not been adequately refined.</blockquote><blockquote>Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), a vocal critic of the legislation, said it represented a worrisome instance of big tech and big government “now marrying up and working together.” He complained that it would give unprecedented power to the FTC to set industrial policy and even impose its own political agenda on the affected companies.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The battle is likely to intensify in coming weeks. While antitrust legislation remains one of the bigger vulnerabilities in Congress this year for the big tech companies, several of the committee’s more far-reaching bills face uphill fights to become law in their current&nbsp;form.</blockquote> 4.

Her job now is to use her bully pulpit — and her ability to hire and fire at the FTC — to start expanding the circle of people who embrace her approach.</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: What Khan wants is an almost total reimagining of the way in which antitrust is conceptualized. That’s not going to come from, say, her agency’s investigation into Amazon’s acquisition of MGM Studios. It’s going to take many years, and it’s not something that financial analysts can even begin to start quantifying.</blockquote> 7.

<p>Ocean’s privacy-preserving marketplace solution will aid in Boson’s goal of truly liquid data markets, allowing consumers to derive fair prices for high-quality and diverse datasets.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/announcing-boson-protocols-partnership-details-with-ocean-protocol-b6cd3178af18">(This partnership was originally announced on March 26,&nbsp;2021.)</a></p><p><a href="https://bosonprotocol.io/">Boson Protocol</a> will build its Web3 commerce data marketplace on <a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a>. Ocean’s architecture gives consumers the chance to unlock value from their data without compromising their privacy, and to be incentivized to do so. Within this powerful token economy, datatokens act as a missing link to more easily allow for the formation of an Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Using Ocean’s architecture, the data itself doesn’t need to live on chain; just the agreement for data access control does. The concept itself is powerful, establishing fully decentralized on-ramps and off-ramps between data itself and tokenized crypto assets. This “Data Lego” allows for the easy movement of datatokens in and out of DEXes, as well as easy integration into the DeFi system. In the future, new brands wanting to make an educated beginning of their journey could buy anonymized commerce preference data in a data market and be able to make decisions just as elegantly as Big Tech is able to — without it necessarily taking years to aggregate it, or at prohibitively high&nbsp;costs.</p><blockquote>E-commerce platforms love data. This data comes from their users; it’s both personally sensitive and extremely valuable. With this Boson and Ocean partnership, for the first time ever, e-commerce users will be able to control their own e-commerce data, and monetize it if&nbsp;desired.</blockquote><blockquote>Trent McConaghy, Founder at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Why is this data so important? On its own, it is not. But acquiring customer preference data and then doing something with it is crucial for e-commerce businesses. Digital-native organizations such as Amazon have led the way and many legacy companies have struggled to move to a data-driven decision-making culture, hampered by a lack of expertise in decision architecture and data&nbsp;science.</p><p>Hence there is a huge market for this data, especially when aggregated. But until now, there was no easy way for individual users to accrue value from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Of course, it is entirely possible to use Boson Protocol for simply enabling decentralized commerce transactions and to opt to keep your data private. But ultimately, the power of token economies, running on permissionless, frictionless global networks, is that capabilities such as monetizing data, which is currently in the hands of few corporations, becomes a possibility to everyone.</p><p>We often talk about our data as a liability — something you need to keep safe, build a walled garden around, and trust third parties to keep safe. But the truth is that voluntarily shared data is an asset, and by creating a seamless flow between Ocean’s liquid markets for data and Boson’s game-changing dCommerce ecosystem, buyers and sellers will discover how valuable commerce data can&nbsp;be.</p><blockquote>This is an entirely new way of thinking about the role of each participant in the ecosystem. We can finally move from being farmed to playing a fulfilling role in an Open Tokenized Economy for Commerce.”</blockquote><blockquote>– Justin Banon, CEO of Boson&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Just as Amazon uses data to give recommendations to customers, Boson’s dCommerce marketplace needs data too. It has both supply and demand of data: supply via past customer behavior, and more, and demand in order to give recommendations. Such commerce data is extremely valuable because other marketplaces can use it for recommendations as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Voluntarily opting into a data marketplace is a critical part of the decentralized commerce revolution and allows people to derive a fair price for their commerce data, which would otherwise be hoarded and have its value captured by the commerce giants, whose prime purpose is to&nbsp;extract.</p><p>Partnerships and integrations are key to the development of the Web3 ecosystem. This collaboration takes us another step toward reimagined data sovereignty.</p> Further Synergies <p>There’s a natural synergy between Ocean and Boson, since decentralized commerce markets rely heavily on data for their efficacy. We foresee further potential synergies: Boson borrows design patterns developed by us here at Ocean for data, and applies them to things. They do this at three levels: thing tokens, dCommerce marketplaces, and system-level design.</p>  Thing tokens: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">Ocean’s datatokens</a> turn data into data assets to enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data as collateral by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Similarly, Boson’s ERC20 thing tokens turn things into thing assets to enable thing wallets, thing exchanges, and things as collateral by leveraging crypto tools. Let innovation roam&nbsp;free!  dCommerce marketplaces: Ocean-powered data marketplaces use DEX tools to help price discovery, and aid curation via staking on data. Similarly, Boson-powered dCommerce marketplaces use DEX tools to help price discovery, and aid curation via staking on&nbsp;things.  System-level design: Ocean founder Trent McConaghy developed <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">the Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>, a system-level design pattern for Web3 projects for near-term growth and long-term sustainability. Ocean uses this pattern. Boson have adapted it for Boson’s own<a href="https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/introducing-the-dcommerce-sustainability-loop-1d72026636d0"> dCommerce Sustainability Loop</a>. It enables us to give grants from minimally extractive fees accrued in our protocol; such grants will foster more activity within the protocol; which will accrue more fees; which will power more grants. This is the flywheel in&nbsp;action!   About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The OCEAN token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

BDP will launch the <a href="https://bigdataprotocol.com/datamarket">BDP Data Market</a>, powered by Ocean Protocol, focusing on commercially valuable data, with an existing network of 14,141 professional data providers.</p><p>This data marketplace will extend <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> code (a fork), and connect to Ocean Protocol’s underlying smart contracts. In doing so, BDP leverages the technology behind a high quality, battle-tested Web3 data marketplace out of the box and gains a network of DeFi integrations.</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol helps to unlock the value of data. Big Data Protocol’s massive network of professional data providers will benefit from our tech offerings while contributing greatly to Ocean’s ecosystem and, as a result, the greater Web3 Data Economy. This is an exciting opportunity for all players in the space, as we continue on this path of positioning data as an asset class. We’re excited to work with the Big Data Protocol team and see how this partnership further develops.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder, Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>BDP Data Market comes with the following capabilities:</p>  Publishing data: BDP’s network of 14,141 professional data providers can launch data offerings and publish their data on BDP Data&nbsp;Market.  BDP Data Market armed with full Ocean Market functionality: datatokens released on BDP Data Market will be published, traded, and consumed on the BDP platform, and trading against the BDP&nbsp;token.  Value creation: fees generated from publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming datatokens on BDP Data Market go to publishers, BDP holders, and a percentage to the Ocean community.  BDP and Ocean synergy: cross-listing of BDP datatokens on Ocean Market (and listing of Ocean datatokens on BDP Data market), as well as sourcing, referral, and onboarding of data providers to both BDP and&nbsp;Ocean.  BDP datatokens get out-of-the-box access to Ocean’s current integrations and future improvements, including DeFi integrations (e.g. with lending and stablecoin protocols), third-party data ratings, datatoken derivatives platforms, and migration to Layer 2 on Ethereum, as well as cross-chain capabilities.  <p>The Ocean and BDP teams have worked closely together in the past, and the BDP team has served as data providers on Ocean Market. Our teams plan to deepen their collaboration by having BDP team members join Ocean’s Slack channels and team calls and contributing to the future development of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><blockquote>I have loved playing with Ocean Market ever since I found out about it. I have spent hours and hours doing everything there is to do on Ocean Market, including publishing, staking, trading, and consuming datatokens. It’s a fun and immersive experience.

The Ocean token (OCEAN) will be listed on Benchmark’s lending platform, which is backed by the MARK token — Benchmark’s supply elastic stablecoin-alternative that connects traditional capital markets to DeFi. This will enable OCEAN holders to lend their Ocean tokens and earn interest, while collateral providers can borrow&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>For Ocean Protocol, a data exchange protocol for the Web3 Data Economy, the collaboration helps to create one more use of the Ocean token and further deepens its DeFi integrations. With this listing, OCEAN holders will be able to lend their Ocean tokens while keeping exposure to OCEAN and earning interest yield, without risk of impermanent loss.</p><blockquote>At Ocean Protocol, we try to maximize ways for OCEAN holders to utilize their Ocean tokens. This collaboration will enable OCEAN holders to earn interest from their Ocean token holdings while keeping exposure to OCEAN. In the future Benchmark will enable each of these datatokens to have their own lending market on their platform unlocking another utility for datatokens.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Benchmark Protocol, a DeFi protocol that connects traditional financial markets to DeFi markets has its native asset MARK pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) asset. The SDR is a composite international reserve asset, consisting of the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Great British Pound, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen. This provides a better hedge against vulnerable single-nation backed assets such as the&nbsp;USD.</p><blockquote>We look forward to the Ocean Protocol community taking advantage of our stablecoin-alternative, MARK. MARK opens the doors for truly decentralized smart contract collateral payments that are not subject to high volatility in the&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><blockquote>– Kurt Uhler, COO of Benchmark Protocol</blockquote><p>Ocean and Benchmark are exploring future collaboration together which would leverage Ocean Market, an open-source community marketplace for data, and the lending of Ocean’s datatokens, a data asset wrapped in an ERC20 token on Ocean Protocol.</p>  Ocean will help Benchmark Protocol monetize their DeFi data via Ocean Market, enabling the Ocean community access to these datasets.  Benchmark will source curated data from Ocean Protocol marketplaces to be able optimize the lending rates and possibly provide under-collateralized loans.  Benchmark will allow the lending of Ocean’s datatokens to help datatoken holders earn interest on their holdings.

The protocol operates as a rules-based utility that dynamically adjusts supply based on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) and deviations from the target metric — equal to 1 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) unit. Employing the SDR creates a larger use case rather than exposure to just one currency; the application of this creates a larger user base and delineated exposure to markets around the world. The DeFi space needs a collateral utility that retains its efficacy and increases inherent, baseline liquidity during periods of high volatility.</p><p>Benchmark is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The MARK token is the native asset in the Benchmark network and provides only the utility value available to it through the Benchmark network.</p>  Learn more by visiting the <a href="https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/">project&nbsp;website</a>.

<p>On June 29th, InfoCert will take part of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference, the leading independent European Think Tank focused on identity, privacy and trust. InfoCert will participate in a program of seven live and interactive webinars, focused on the theme of Securing Trust in the New Digital Reality. More than 40 countries will be represented during the free-to-attend conference, which takes place from 29th June – 1st July 2021.</p>



 <a href="https://annualconference.eema.org/#register">InfoCert Focuses on Self Sovereign Identity Paradigm Shift as a Platinum Sponsor of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference</a> 



<p>Chair of EEMA, Jon Shamah, states: “We are delighted that InfoCert has chosen to be a Platinum Sponsor for this year’s EEMA Annual Conference. InfoCert is a longstanding and active member of the EEMA community, and an organization at the forefront of innovation in Self Sovereign Identity, an area of specific interest for our members and partners.” One such innovation is Dizme, a Blockchain-based app developed by the DizmeID Foundation (of which InfoCert is a Premier Member), which incorporates the benefits of distributed identity, to provide individuals with direct control over the information they share with companies, with all of the legal value and trust of a Qualified Trust Service Provider.</p>



<p>Daniele Citterio, Chief Technology Officer at InfoCert and Chairman of the DizmeID Foundation, which is bringing together companies, institutions and other organisations interested in exploiting the power of Self Sovereign Identity (SS) and making it compliant to existing regulations explains: “SSI is creating a paradigm shift in Digital Identity Management, whereby Digital Identities will no longer be merely elements that support commercial transactions, but a new strategic asset to leverage to generate new business.” Daniele adds: “It is our aim is to implement a scalable technological solution that fully complies with the fundamental principles of SSI, to guarantee Privacy by Design and governance of the global ecosystem.”</p>



 <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_OyZYV0nJTN6fgQo-78p76w">“Decentralized Identity – what is missing before this is usable for Aunt Magda?” – Follow the session on 29th June (15:00-16.15 CEST)</a> 



<p>Attendees of the EEMA Annual Conference will have the opportunity to learn more about the work of InfoCert and Dizme, when Daniele presents a use case, based on SSI in an eIDAS-compliant governance framework. The session takes place on 29th June (15:00-16.15 CEST), when EEMA will host the webinar entitled ‘Decentralised Identity – what is missing before this is usable for Aunt Magda?’ Daniele will be joined by John Erik Setsaas, VP Identity &amp; Innovation, Signicat; Marc Sel, Director, Trust Warp, and Kaliya Young, Identity Woman, Expert, Consultant and a leader in the field of SSI.</p>

 The Price of Gas: <br>Why KILT Chose Polkadot Over&nbsp;Ethereum <p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>There are many reasons why we chose to build the KILT blockchain on <a href="https://www.substrate.io/">Substrate</a> and plan to run as a parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem (i.e. the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> networks). One major reason is the fixed, low costs offered. For the first time, this will allow companies to incorporate permissionless blockchain into their business plans, knowing in advance what the costs of their transactions, and subsequently their product, will&nbsp;be.</p><p>To understand why this is a ground-breaking development for enterprise in general and us in particular, we first need to look at the history of blockchain.</p> Transaction costs on legacy blockchains <p>Blockchain first came to prominence after the Bitcoin white paper was released in October 2008. Bitcoin introduced two incentive models, providing a way for the developers running nodes (“miners”) to earn while maintaining the&nbsp;network:</p><p>1) By receiving newly minted Bitcoin tokens (BTC) for solving a cryptographic puzzle and winning a block (“mining”), adding it to the blockchain. This will occur until all the BTC tokens — a maximum of 21 million — are&nbsp;mined.</p><p>2) By receiving the “gas” (transaction fees) from any transaction within the&nbsp;block.</p><p>Ethereum, the next biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, also has a system with gas costs. The user can choose how much gas they want to pay when making a transaction. The miners look at the amount offered and choose which transaction they want to carry out. Naturally, the more gas you offer to pay, the more attractive your transaction is.</p><p>Permissioned blockchain alternatives with stable gas costs do exist, but since the attraction of blockchain is that it can be trustless, i.e. the user can trust the mathematical system rather than having to trust in people, that was not an option for&nbsp;us.</p> Supply and&nbsp;demand <p>What we see with permissionless systems is that gas costs follow supply and demand. As a consequence, when the networks are busy many transactions end up in a memory pool on the network (e.g.<a href="https://mempool.space/"> Mempool</a>) waiting to be processed, sometimes for up to a day. This is a critical problem with transaction fees on permissionless blockchains, as you never really know how much you have to put in to avoid being stuck in a Mempool, and subsequently how much the transaction is going to cost if you want it carried out within a specified timeframe. While this can be calculated using interfaces such as the<a href="https://ethgasstation.info/"> Eth gas station</a>, it means that the cost of the transaction isn’t known in advance, since it depends on the current market situation. This makes it nearly impossible for businesses to create a reliable financial plan for their&nbsp;costs.</p><p>At KILT, we use blockchain technology to record the hash (a number representing the information) of credentials issued. This forms a core part of our goal to create revocable, anonymous credentials. Using legacy blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, we could create a credential, but couldn’t quote a regular price — it could be inexpensive one day, and it could be €100 the next. Or it could take up to 24 hours to&nbsp;process.</p><p>That made building ID services on legacy permissionless blockchains impossible for industrial use, as a fixed production cost could not be determined in advance. Since a product price consists of the production cost and the profit, the price could not be set without risking winning or losing on each transaction, making it impractical to build a business model as an attestor. What we needed was a system with a more predictable cost structure.</p> Transaction costs on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot uses different incentive mechanisms. Like the first incentive mechanism in Bitcoin, Polkadot uses a system in which newly minted coins are earned by the people running the network — the validators — and the nominators backing them. Therefore, the gas price doesn’t need to be competitive, as the validators are already compensated for their work and not competing with each other on&nbsp;price.</p><p>The gas price in Polkadot, therefore, has a different purpose. It is mainly to disincentivise spammers from flooding the network or causing bottlenecks with useless or extraordinarily heavy transactions, as users have to pay a fee to write a transaction on the blockchain.</p><p>The funds raised by these gas fees go to the Treasury. Native token (KSM or DOT) holders can then propose referenda and vote on how the gas is spent — for keeping the system running smoothly, marketing, community events, etc. Gas not used is “burned” and taken out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>The actual gas costs vary depending on the computer power needed, and the amount of data to be saved. For example, a simple transfer of DOT from one account to another needs less gas than a smart contract, and saving 10 bytes of data forever uses less power than saving a gigabyte. Behind the scenes, the gas fee the user pays for a transaction in the Polkadot ecosystem is calculated by multiplying the base fee by the data amount needed by the computing power needed. So while Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the market, Polkadot is designed to be driven by computer algorithms, with a constant, fair fee depending on the size of the transaction.</p> Transaction fees on&nbsp;KILT <p>For KILT, writing the hash on the blockchain doesn’t use much more computing power than a simple token transfer, so the base fee for credentials can be kept low — as little as a few&nbsp;cents.</p><p>Another element of our system includes the possibility of delegation, for example allowing a large company to delegate attestation rights to several employees. Setting up delegation trees requires more power and energy because they need to go through the validator, and will therefore cost more than recording the hash. These costs can, however, be anticipated and written into a business’s cost structure.</p> Keeping transaction costs stable on&nbsp;KILT <p>As gas costs (known as the “angel’s share” on KILT) are paid in KILT tokens, volatility in the price of KILT would affect the corresponding price in fiat. We aim to address this in several&nbsp;ways.</p><p>The initial cost of a transaction will be set at network&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Later, on-chain oracles — which automatically link the base fee of KILT to the current price of the KILT coin in fiat — could be used to keep the cost stable. Until these oracles are available, in the event of the fee going too high before Sudo is removed, we could adjust the cost. After Sudo is removed and before oracles are introduced, changes to keep the cost stable could be made by the community of token holders using on-chain governance.</p> Bringing blockchain to&nbsp;business <p>The fixed, stable costs of using permissionless blockchains via the Polkadot ecosystem will finally make blockchain technology practical and accessible to a wide variety of use cases in business. We look forward to being among the first parachains in the ecosystem and having our credentials available not only to those already using blockchain, but for traditional businesses and users. Using our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">open-source SDK</a>, even small companies could build solutions to meet their digital ID needs cost-effectively and without blockchain expertise. Finally, the advantages of trustless blockchain technology can be brought to the mainstream, bridging the advantages of the fairer, decentralised Web 3.0 to our current experience of the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-price-of-gas-why-kilt-chose-polkadot-over-ethereum-6bef9006a305">The Price of Gas:&nbsp;

<p>The UEFA EURO was about to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2020 with 3 million tickets and 5 billion global live viewers anticipated. The event initially was supposed to take place in June 2020, but due to the global COVID19 pandemic, it was moved to 2021.</p>
<p>For gaming operators, big sports events traditionally mean large spikes in user activity and especially new user registrations. More than ever, during this year’s EURO 2020, gaming operators are facing a high number of surges in new signups on a matchday. Unfortunately, with rising demand, there is an increase in fraud attempts coming along.</p>
 A new wave of sophisticated fraud 
<p>IDnow is constantly monitoring the fraud attacks on its customers to detect trends early and ultimately stay ahead of fraudsters. Recently IDnow has detected an increasing wave of highly sophisticated fraud attacks. These advanced fraud attacks were bypassing standard identity verification processes, making them very difficult to detect.</p>
<p>After investigating and analysing the sophisticated fraud attacks, IDnow discovered that fraudsters were utilising very well forged ID cards. The visual security features, like holograms and watermarks, were forged to perfection. In consequence, both humans and artificial intelligence were not able to visually detect fake ID cards.</p>
 If the ID cards were forged to perfection, how did IDnow spot them? 
<p>IDnow is not only looking at individual identity verification cases but is monitoring across all verifications, over long periods and across multiple customers with different use cases. This results in extensive data sets, allowing IDnow to detect fraud patterns and trends at scale.</p>
<p>This data enabled IDnow to detect two ident cases with two different identities, however the same person on appeared the biometric images. In other words, at least one or more likely both ID cards were fraudulent. After investigating the cases further and performing a manual review, the two used ID cards were proven fake by verifying the built-in electronic chip using NFC.</p>
<p>Below I highlighted some of the things that come up for my clients. The main question is how we ensure with NFC technology we reduce the increasing rate of fraud cases?</p>
 Sophisticated fraud attacks require more sophisticated identity verification solutions 
<p>When an ID document is forged to perfection, it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features. Today modern ID documents contain an NFC chip that stores a copy of the identity details. The information on the chip is secured and can be authenticated through an electronic certificate from the issuing government. Consequently, the NFC chip is far more complex to forge than visual security features, like holograms and watermarks. Validating the presence of a chip and the stored information using NFC offers an additional and more sophisticated security feature.</p>
 What’s NFC? 
<p>NFC stands for Near Field Communication, wireless communication technology for short ranges of 4 cm or less. Today NFC is well known through contactless credit cards and mobile payment solutions such as Apple- and Google Pay. Nowadays, most smartphones can read NFC ID documents, including both leading operating systems, Android and Apple iOS. As a result, you can scan your passport or ID card and identify yourself on your smartphone, just like you use to do at ePassport gates at airports. When scanning an identity document with NFC, the information gets read out automatically from the chip. Like at the airport, automatically scanning your passport is faster and more convenient than somebody visually checking your documents.</p>
<p>Read our Quick Guide: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/nfc-technology-for-id-verification/">Do you want to how NFC offers security and convenience for your identity verification?</a></p>
 How is NFC going to help our operators make the EURO 2020 a success? 
 
 Additional security layer:&nbsp;Validating an NFC chip adds a new form of physical security feature that goes beyond visual security marks. Further, the chip is highly complex to forge. Therefore NFC chips offer a higher level of security against fraudsters. 
 Higher Automation: Scanning an NFC document is fast and easy and eliminates user error, such as blurry pictures or poor lighting conditions. Instead, the identity details and the biometric picture are read out automatically. In consequence, NFC authentication requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. 
 Regulatory Acceptance:&nbsp;More and more regulators have started evaluating and approving NFC-based ident methods. More recently, FINMA in Switzerland and ANSSI in France have approved NFC-based methods.&nbsp;Other regulators like in Portugal are considering it. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, NFC offers a win-win for both gaming operators and football fans alike. For gaming operators, NFC presents an additional and more sophisticated security feature. At the same time, their customers get a fast and convenient onboarding process. That’s why we at IDnow believe that IDnow AutoIdent plus the new NFC feature provide the right combination of convenience and sophisticated security for the UEFA EURO 2020.</p>

 How Access Control Works 

<p>OIDC claims are a piece of information inserted about an entity. Name and picture are claim examples for users.</p>

<p>OIDC scopes are a group of claims.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll define a new claim based on an Okta group. The claim will be included in all scopes defined. The OIDC plugin must check if the coming tokens have this specific claim to allow the Kong route consumption. Only users who are part of the Okta group will have the claim included in the token and will be able to consume the route.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Okta 

<p>In my example, I already created two users and a group. The group has only one member.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new claim will be based on this group, so only its members will have permission to go through the Kong route.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new Kong claim definition is based on the Kong group. It’ll be included in any scope for each access token issued.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s run a token preview to check the tokens and claim out. For the first request, we can try the user who’s not a Kong group member. As expected, the access token does not have a Kong claim inside of it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we try the other user that belongs to the Kong group, the access token will be different. Here’s the Kong claim inside our token.</p>

<p></p>

 Enable OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Let’s check our Kong route with the OIDC plugin enabled. According to the parameters in the screenshot below, the plugin should check if the token has the Kong claim defined by Okta. So in this sense, the route should be consumed only by users who are members of the Kong group.</p>

 
   Config.Scope Claim: <code>kong_claim</code> 
   Config.Scopes Required: <code>kong_group</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Consume the Kong Route 

<p>Let’s have both users consume the route. The process will be similar to what we already did in Okta’s token preview process. For the first request, let’s try the user who isn’t in the Kong group. As expected, we shouldn’t be able to consume the route.</p>

<p>We are trying to consume the route, but since we don’t have any token injected inside our request, the API gateway redirects us to Okta to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And after getting authenticated, Okta is redirecting us back to the API gateway. However, since the token doesn’t have the claim inside it, the gateway says “forbidden” and won’t allow us to consume the route.</p>

<p>Let’s try the other user who is a member of the Kong group. Again, we try to consume the route, getting redirected to Okta, but we’re going to use the second user this time.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After getting authenticated, Okta redirects us back to the API gateway. This time, our token has the Kong claim we defined in Okta previously.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, we will decode the JWT token and check the token and the claim inside it.</p>

Application-based threats happen when people download apps that look legitimate but actually skim data from their device. Examples are spyware and malware that steal personal and business information without people realizing it’s happening.</p>  <p>Web-Based Mobile Security Threats. Web-based threats are subtle and tend to go unnoticed. They happen when people visit affected sites that seem fine on the front-end but, in reality, automatically download malicious content onto devices.</p>  <p>Mobile Network Security Threats. Network-based threats are especially common and risky because cybercriminals can steal unencrypted data while people use public WiFi networks.</p>  <p>Mobile Device Security Threats. Physical threats to mobile devices most commonly refer to the loss or theft of a device. Because hackers have direct access to the hardware where private data is stored, this threat is especially dangerous to enterprises.</p>   <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/on-demand-uk-digital-id-verification/">How the trend of On-Demand Culture in the UK fuels the need for Digital ID Verification</a> <blockquote><p>Given that <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf">85% of internet users</a> in the United Kingdom would rather access the internet via a smartphone, digital ID systems that are accessible on both web and mobile platforms will be considered on-demand compliant.</p></blockquote> MyData  <a href="https://mydata.org/2021/06/23/mydata-global-joins-team-data-spaces-to-support-the-eus-plan-to-create-data-spaces/">MyData Global Joins “Team Data Spaces” to Support the EU’s Plan to Create “Data Spaces”&nbsp;</a> <blockquote><p>MyData Global announces to have joined forces with ‘Team Data Spaces’ – a coalition of leading European players with experience in standardising, creating and operationalising data sharing – to facilitate the development of European data spaces which are at the heart of the EU’s data strategy.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/support-centre-for-data-sharing-interview-with-meeco/">Support Centre for Data Sharing interview with Meeco</a> <blockquote><p>Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth.

SSI is simultaneously the potential enabler of new modes of empowerment, autonomy and data security for refugees and a means of maintaining and extending bureaucratic and commercial power.

Meeco is looking for self-driven software engineers to contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform.  The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph. <br><br>We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 





 About Us 





 




The product team currently consists of 15 people, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting Meeco’s secure decentralised and cloud solutions. Our products are modular and can be implemented as a single solution (decentralised wallet) or together with key backup and secure storage (vault). These products enable developers to build a range of applications for users and organisations to access, control and exchange identity, personal data, credentials and tokens.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of&nbsp;Elixir and Node services on the backend, and Angular/NgRx/Ionic/Capacitor and&nbsp;Flutter apps on the frontend.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code, this is based on many decades of experience across the team. We are pragmatic and want to see positive change in the data world now – not years away. For these reasons we always seek to understand the user’s perspective and their “job to be done”, how to layer in privacy and security and then design a mutually beneficial solution.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We do test driven development




 




• We set quality standards for our code




 




• We review each other’s code




 




• When looking for solutions to problems, we brainstorm, we draw on virtual boards, we discuss




 




• We documents our decisions, workflows, architecture as Confluence documents




 




• We constantly work on improving our estimation skills.

 About You 




We are looking to appoint at least two people for the following roles:




 




Role 1 – Experienced frontend developer with a proven track record building hybrid mobile applications in TypeScript




 




Role 2 – Full-stack TypeScript developer




 





 




Here is what we are looking for to help us create awesome hybrid mobile applications:




 




• You have built a few cross-platform hybrid mobile applications




 




• The browser is a development environment where you feel at home and sometimes you have dreams about the DOM API




 




• If you have used Angular, NgRx, Ionic and Capacitor, we are looking forward to hear from you, don’t delay!




 




• If you’ve used another framework, please share with us why it is great




 





 




And here is how we see the role of the full-stack TypeScript developer:




 




• You know and love TypeScript




 




• You’ve built modern JS web applications




 




• You’ve used Node as the backend




 




• You use relational databases like Postgresql, Mysql with confidence




 




• You’ve deployed applications using cloud providers like AWS, GCP or Azure




 





 




Besides the above points for both roles, there are certain points we welcome in any developer:




 




• Someone that cares about clean code




 




• Ready to learn about new domains such as decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials




 




• Like solving new problems and innovating




 




• Having a practical understanding of&nbsp;cryptography&nbsp;(is a big plus)




 




• Can learn a new programming language or a technology and consider it a improvement of you skillset




 




• Any experience building dApps, building on top of distributed ledger technologies, we would like to talk to you!




 




• If you have used Hedera Hashgraph, are interested in tokens and payments, we should definitely talk!!!




 





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming fundamentals is most important.




 




You might have a degree in CS, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




We have offices in Adelaide, Brussels, London, Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of the time, you are free to work where you work best, but we expect you to spend a few days a week in the office together with the team. For these roles we would prefer for you to be based in Adelaide, Melbourne or Brussels.




 




We value people who can work independently and manage your time, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. A lot of what we are working on has not been done before, so the ability to explore, test, iterate and learn is an essential part of our culture. So we would like to iterate that asking for help is highly regarded!




 





 What we have achieved 





 




We are early pioneers in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012




 




Funding; our founder and CEO bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have a strong runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. Check out Meeco on Twitter or LinkedIn and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won nine international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands, Germany, USA for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: During COVID we launched our developer portal so our partners could keep working with us remotely and we kicked off 2021 with some really interesting projects across a range of use-cases.




 




Partners: In early 2020 we started working in partnership with <a href="https://hedera.com">Hedera Hashgrap</a>h to develop our multi purpose wallet to support decentralised identity, verified credentials, micropayments and tokens.




 





 How to apply 





 




Unfortunately due to ongoing COVID restrictions we are not able to offer visa sponsorship at this time. Therefore,  Australian applicants must already be in Australia and have permanent residency. For Belgium, you must have the necessary rights to work in the EU. <br><br>By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you have to do is contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a> or hit the button below:

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Almost all enterprises have many security tools in place already, some of which are still focused on perimeters/DMZs and on hosts, such as servers and endpoints. Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools are becoming more commonplace in enterprises and SMBs. EDR tools depend on agents installed on endpoints to collect and transmit telemetry to the EDR console. EDR agents can be instructed by administrators and programmatically to respond to suspicious and malicious events, taking actions like gathering forensic evidence, terminating processes, removing malware, etc. EDR tools emerged as a second line of defense on endpoints in situations where Endpoint Protection (EPP), formerly known as Next Generation Anti-Virus, may have missed detection and prevention of execution of malware. EPP and EDR vendors have been merging and acquiring one another over the last few years, so a large part of the endpoint security market has essentially become Endpoint Protection, Detection &amp; Response (EPDR).</p>
<p>Many organizations today are also looking for security tools such as Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) that provide additional visibility and controls at the network layer. NDR tools rely on sensors on the network for gathering data about traffic in a given environment. These sensors generally plug in to taps or SPAN ports on network switches and routers. Most modern enterprises have a mix of on-premises networks and cloud-based resources to cover with NDR solutions. NDR solutions mostly focus on analysis of traffic metadata, although some can do full packet capture and a few products even do packet decryption. Like EDR, the “D” and “R” in NDR emphasize the abilities to detect malicious behavior and respond to it. Examples of NDR actions are collect forensic evidence, terminate sessions, and block traffic by IP/host/domain.</p>
 Functional overlaps 
<p>Functional overlaps exist between EPDR, NDR, and Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs). CWPPs provide malware scanning, remediation, and configuration management for IaaS instances, containers, and serverless environments.</p>
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) systems are centralized repositories that collect security telemetry and log files from many sources around an enterprise. Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) tools facilitate analysis of information in SIEMs and help orchestrate analyst responses across disparate downstream security tools.</p>
<p>XDR (eXtended Detection &amp; Response) solutions are an emerging category of security tools that are designed to consolidate and replace multiple point solutions such as Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).</p>
<p></p>
 Our view of XDR 
<p>In our definition and view, XDR must encompass endpoint, network, and cloud aspects. This means that XDR solutions must have agents for endpoints, sensors for networks, and agents for cloud instances and containers. As opposed to SIEMs, telemetry is pushed into XDR systems in real-time, not pulled from logs, which allows for real-time correlation and analysis, and therefore a reduction in time-to-detect and time-to-respond metrics. Companies conducting RFPs for XDR expect implementations of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) detection models and functions to reduce the labor needed for analysis, time-wasting false positives, as well as add value by improving anomaly detection and categorization, leading to an improved overall security posture.</p>
<p>As with SOAR solutions, XDR systems are tools that enhance security operations, and as such have consoles that are designed for deployment within Security Operations Centers (SOCs) at customer sites or Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) sites. SOAR tools prominently feature “threat hunting” interfaces. With XDR, the emphasis is on automation and continuous threat hunting, making threat hunting less of a manual activity.</p>
 XDR and SOAR: evolution or competition? 
<p>XDR and SOAR solutions are on a path toward either convergent evolution or competition, depending on the vendor. However, SOARs depend on SIEMs, and XDR solutions should be able to function somewhat independently of SIEMs. XDR systems can export relevant event data to SIEMs.</p>
<p>Though real-time detection is advantageous, we emphasize the response capabilities, because such leading-edge technologies should expand on the automation of mitigation actions. Therefore, the types of response actions available in EPDR and NDR must also be present in XDR.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced XDR use cases and solution capabilities may include active defensive measures, such as the deployment and maintenance of Distributed Deception Platforms (DDPs). DDPs are systems that are designed to simulate a variety of computing assets and environments for the purposes of drawing in would-be attackers to clearly alert IT security teams to the presence of attackers, drawing attackers away from real assets, and allowing IT security teams to study the TTPs of attackers in order to better defend against current and future attacks. DDPs therefore aid IT security teams in discovering anomalous and malicious behavior at various layers across the infrastructure.</p>

			  Mario Cámara is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>I love solving challenging problems with the help of technology to keep learning smarter ways to solve the next one. Currently, I’m settled in Spain with my family. In the past, I had brief spells in Moscow, Zurich, Edinburgh and Paris. Actually, who knows if we will move to Seattle, Vancouver, London, Shenzhen or Seville at some point in the future?</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After doing diverse things in the past, like pursuing a PhD and an MBA, I created my own startup to help companies to tap into high skilled tech professionals that might not be actively looking for a new job.</p>
<p>Although this was a fruitful learning experience, I realized that I would be more useful in putting my expertise at the service of a growing startup. That’s when the opportunity to join Tokeny popped up,&nbsp;and I’m glad I made that choice to join and to be part of the team that’s making Tokeny flourish.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s very interesting and enriching. The staff comprises multiple nationalities and extensive backgrounds. Management is approachable and very active in moving the company forward to hit new targets. However, I work mostly with the people in the tech team. Although they’re spread in several countries, there’s almost no friction coming from this. Besides that, they have high expertise that shows daily, and you can always learn new things from them. Additionally, they tend to welcome feedback on their pull requests or the product features. Overall, it’s a team that makes it significantly easier to ship great software.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love delivering products that exceed customer expectations. And I want to believe that it’s not only a saying, but I do really make that difference. Put bluntly, and as a wise person taught me: “Under promise and over deliver.”. Moreover, I also love learning about new things.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p><br>
As a firm believer in science and innovation, I can’t settle on a single dream or even a handful of them. There are still many things that humankind will achieve in the coming decades. Just to name a few: fully autonomous self-driving vehicles, flying cars, neural implants, decentralized and accessible finance, safe and clean nuclear power, hypersonic commercial flights, etc. On a personal level, I still keep some faith that, eventually, I’ll learn to play the piano.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Again, there are many things to make the world a better place. But, if focusing at a local level and, provided that high-quality education is the base of modern and advanced societies, I’d love to see and help the Andalusian universities to reach the level of top-class European ones such as Oxford, Cambridge, the Imperial College, ETH Zurich, EPF Lausanne or MIPT.</p>

Full-stack model for next generation institutional capacities A sketch for the transformation of Italy’s&nbsp;cities <p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-lockie-b294696/?originalSubdomain=uk">Sean Lockie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelica-monaco-5b086722/?originalSubdomain=it">Angelica Monaco</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://twitter.com/indy_johar">Indy Johar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joostbeunderman?lang=en">Joost Beunderman</a> and Juhee Hahm. For Italian translation, see&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">here</a></p><p>Italy, like many nations, is facing a major strategic transition. Many Italian cities are seeing a cocktail of intensifying challenges and future risks, including the brain drain of young skilled people to bigger cities and other parts of Europe; economic stagnation and aging infrastructure; poor air quality, growing heat island impacts, and increasing incidence of flooding. All this has been exacerbated by COVID, which has deeply affected Italy’s communities and economy; it has both revealed and deepened inequalities. Already, we are seeing signs of a growth in exploitative labour patterns and the deprivation of minimum rights; in terms of social and psychological distress we are seeing growing incidences in violence both in the street and domestic sphere, and a worrying increase in self-harm. Italy’s society is hurting, and it needs a deeply strategic approach to investing in the infrastructures of tomorrow.</p><p>Beyond incrementalism</p><p>The transition required is systemic — this is not an incremental or additive transition, but a fundamental one. We know, for example, climate change not an isolated crisis: it is fundamentally a symptom of a structural problem in how we govern and how our relationships in the world are governed — in terms of our relationship with the future, our relationship with the natural and material world and our relationship with each other. As the evidence of growing social divisions and the perspective of <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ degrees Celsius climate change</a> becomes more and more unmissable, we must allow ourselves to re-think a series of fundamental social, economic, human and planetary relationships to forge a thriving future for Italian cities. And with a once-in-a-generation level of capital being made available through Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), this is perhaps the best opportunity we have — which implies a huge responsibility on all of us as professionals and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic has seen levels of fiscal and policy coordination within the EU not seen before. For example, the capital to be raised to finance the Covid-19 recovery fund for fiscal stimulus packages across the EU was a collective response. The fund will be distributed over the next five years, in a mixture of grants and loans to EU countries, and direct EU spending; approximately 1/3 (€250bn) is to be spent on funding the green economy. The Commission plans to start borrowing in the markets in June of this year, and this now creates a precedent for other fundraising activities in Europe. The plan requires agreement on a new tax on goods imported into the EU from countries adhering to less aggressive CO2 emissions goals, new levies or surcharges on emissions in the transport sector, and a digital tax. The €250bn to be allocated to the green economy should provide the basis for the fiscal innovation to occur in the climate change space, e.g. to look at the feasibility of a climate change impact bond that could enable Europe to lead the way and invest in a clean, healthy and just future. All this comes on top of a very ambitious Italy-wide energy efficiency major retrofit programme called the ‘Superbonus’ scheme addressing fabric, renewable and heat source upgrades. Administered through Italy’s Revenue Agency there will be a subsidy of 110% of the installation costs paid back over only five years through tax savings. An impressive amount of organisations have been executed around this scheme involving banks, the tax department, consultancies, technical supply chains (insulation, plumbing, architecture, engineering) municipalities and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic also showed that places have to be able to transform fast, and that we need to develop this sort of institutional resilience and agility to deal with unpredictable events — so that we are not just responding reactively to crisis, but ensure our recovery measures are transformative and reduce future vulnerabilities. Milan, for example, was of the first large cities in Europe to lock down, and the city has responded with a broad set of initiatives, which included fast-track active mobility strategies, use of the home as a means of production, and schools deploying online learning at scale to address a digital divide and create more opportunity for self learning.</p><p>A multi-dimensional recovery programme</p><p>As the transformation is multidimensional, it has become very clear now that the processes to make it happen are of utmost importance. All recovery measures to be deployed in the near future need to go beyond one-dimensional quick-fixes, and instead target multiple co-benefits and synergies. For example, this includes the opportunity to leverage further the ‘superbonus’ subsidies to create an inclusive retrofit programme that addresses sustainability at street by street level. Such a retrofit programme should tackle not just the energy performance of the housing stock but the potential for greater social cohesion and long term benefits through residents generating and distributing their own energy, the enhancement of the public realm that connects the buildings, and repurposing space dedicated to the car to urban parks that allow residents to enjoy to exercise, birdlife, urban meadows and eventually community gathering (farmers markets&nbsp;etc).</p><p>In setting out such a multi-dimensional recovery programme, a first challenge relates to how we understand the interconnected and cascading risks that we face (e.g., air pollution, fuel poverty, health impacts, job losses and precariousness, lack of appropriate education and community cohesion as well as climate change). Secondly, we need to re-think how we build portfolios of mutually reinforcing interventions against such future liabilities, enabling us to set a clear directionality of the transition but be open to uncertainty and emergence of new opportunities as well as possible new crises. This also means building distributed capacity to build, iterate and learn from early interventions, to create dynamic transition portfolios that have proximity and agility to evolve with ongoing new issues, opportunities and problems and insights as they emerge. After all, we live in an age of both chronic emergency and emergence — meaning centralised, slow moving institutions are by definition not up to the&nbsp;task.</p><p>Next gen institutional capacities</p><p>In practice this means building the institutional capacity in both the public sector (municipalities), private sector (developers, energy companies etc) and civic sector to understand and act on emergence in a collaborative way. This is about fundamental institutional properties: the distributed capacity to make sense of complex data and weak signals, distributed capacity to innovate, and distributed capacity to forge new coalitions. We aren’t able to 1:1 predict what the problems are, where our greatest liabilities lie, and what the solutions might&nbsp;be.</p><p>One dimension where such institutional capacity needs are particularly urgent is innovation in maintenance. We have to radically reduce the bureaucratic and the management costs of maintaining, adapting and upgrading our existing cities as a whole if we are going to unlock the current infrastructure upkeep backlogs and unlock new value in the existing built environment. This is particularly relevant in Italy where there are many layers or control and bureaucracy which hold cities back in the procurement and government of such works. A ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ in local empowerment, accountability and simplification of procedures is essential for the country to spread its wings and take flight to new levels. Italy needs to change its mindset from “we have always done it this way” to one of “these are extraordinary times, let’s give this a go and learn from&nbsp;it”.</p><p>To get there, we need to take a value chain approach to investing. This looks at investing across value chains, such as enabling the real estate development and construction sectors to move into bio based and circular materials. Critically, such value chain transitions and deep and structural shifts need to be approached from a ‘just transition’ perspective. If we limit ourselves to point based innovations, we are going to see the consolidation of capital and wealth in the hands of the few. So recognising the SME and family-based nature of the economy in Italy, how do we invest in an inclusive, economy-wide revolution of the whole value chain, driving digitised production and whole-life-cycle performance capacity, emphasising the new skills and ways of working essential to new machine-human automation capacities?</p><p>We know that in the 21st Century, if we are going to talk about prospecting for the future, we are fundamentally operating in the domain of new machine-human capabilities. This requires the setting up of new institutional and financial infrastructures, both to crystallise what our future risks are and to integrate a more sophisticated understanding of those liabilities into how we invest in a range of human, technological and physical transition infrastructures. Our infrastructure investments have to move well beyond the familiar ‘cranes on the horizon’ — financing also the long-term capacity for companies, whole sectors and communities to be part of imagining and innovating within the transition.</p><p>For example, cities are increasingly taking seriously the need for massive investment in green infrastructure, with Milan, Turin and Bologna being among many European cities with plans to plant millions of trees. But it is impossible to build truly integrated approaches unless we have integrated e.g. flooding, heat island, health and biodiversity liabilities into the models of the utility companies that own the flood risk and the energy companies that own the capex requirements for heat island effects - integrating them with the impacts on health, and involving insurance companies across these risks or rewards, and building a collective outcome buying capacity which integrates those risks and liabilities across the public and private sector. Multiple-benefit infrastructure solutions like (peri-) urban forests can manage these risks simultaneously and produce co-beneficiary results. So the pooling of those liabilities and being able to build frameworks for companies, communities and other long-term focussed organisations to set up <a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/november-2019/heres-a-way-for-governments-to-buy-positive-outcomes/">community driven outcome buying contracts</a> to allow the investing towards collaboratively defined priorities become fundamental tools. This sort of innovation in procurement lets the public sector and communities describe the outcome they want and then leave space for new innovation to occur. We are on the cusp of seeing this innovation in some places where health authorities for example are investing in changes to the built environment because they result in say less obesity or respiratory disease or a community with reduced mental health stresses. We are seeing cities like Vienna and London starting to grapple with these systemic challenges.</p><p>The social contract for transition</p><p>What becomes apparent in all this is that Italy must invest in the citizen-level capability for innovation. We have to build citizen understanding of the transition and appetite for innovation, almost at an everyday level — it is an essential part of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">the social contract required for a legitimate transition</a>. The street level capability, the mass democratic capability to innovate is a fundamental component in this thesis. Bologna is a great example where this already starting to happen, through the Fondazione Innovazione Urbana and its “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, patient and democratic spaces for discussion at neighbourhood level. The goal is to activate on-going processes of listening, dialogue and collaboration in each neighbourhood, to bring out priorities, needs, indications and proposals, imagining shared solutions on how to regenerate and enhance spaces in the various areas of the city through public assemblies in the neighborhoods, thematic sessions and physical or on-line meetings.</p><p>Or take Ferrara, where the Climb Project has boosted active and sustainable home-to-school mobility through a mix of behavioural change, internet of things and gamification; it aims to change the attitude of children, their families and their community to embrace environmentally sustainable travel solutions by creating eco-friendly mobility habits as a fun and social experience. Local communities can use the lessons learned from the project to create a civic movement with other co-benefits too. These projects all start at a grass roots level and are seeing important levels of citizen participation.</p><p>Or take the Silk Project in Rovereto aimed at creating a cultural and economic district of silk-based activities following an integrated development approach: regeneration and reclamation of the uncultivated land; promotion of a social and sustainable agriculture project for the production of mulberry trees and silkworms, with job placements for people in difficult situations. Finally, in the circularity space there are numerous examples of innovation that are at the point of scaling in Italy. Bioplastics from grape residue in the Valdobbiadene area for example, or the numerous examples of new business models we are seeing in places like Milan around circular housing concepts, where there are developer models being refined that bring residents together to not only manage their building but to help with child care, asset sharing (mobility) and food production. These are the projects we need to find and learn from, whether to grow in scope and / or replicate, or in order to enable lessons learnt to drive systemic impact, using the recovery funds to catalyse this change and bring these new climate resilient value chains and business models to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Building lead markets in Italian&nbsp;cities</p><p>Ultimately we need a culture change in how we view such transition initiatives. If for example we invest in digitally enabled street ‘de-pavings’ creating space for micro-meadows and urban trees all across a city, and if we create new models of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">Civic AI</a> to get communities to engage with their public assets like urban meadows, allotments and other Nature-based Solutions — then we are not just making cities better and communities more resilient. By making such machine learning models open source and looking at the social network capital that builds the capacity to then retrofit whole streets and districts in an integrated way, that allows you to generate demand for the value chain innovation and regulatory innovation which builds a high value economy for the 21st Century. So it’s not just de-paving: it’s an intentional pathway to inclusive transition and new ‘lead markets’ that create sustainable jobs, livelihoods and positive place identity.</p><p>Clearly, this type of fundamental transition demands a deep reflection on and investment in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">institutional capacity fit for the 21st Century</a>. We have discussed investing in value chains, civic collaboration capacity and financial instruments like outcome buying. Another dimension is the educational investment for human development in the machine age. What are the new 21st century schools and development agenda that Italy wants to prepare for? Do we need radical new schools or universities which are transformed? Do we need a whole new area of human development infrastructure? Currently there are still several areas of the country suffering the digital divide and this is having significant consequences on the ability to attend schooling online, affecting the level of competences of future generations. There are world leading examples of AI occurring in Italy in the regions in Piemonte in Turin, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia where research centres and companies are partnering. The challenge here is to learn from the insights created for system-wide benefit, so that such innovation is shared nationally in a more evenly distributed way.</p><p>The other aspect is government acting as a lead market. Government procurement should not just be focused on efficiency but actually on purposeful creation of new lead markets through investing in and ‘buying’ innovation in key sectors. How do governments actively support the emergence of new behaviours through what they procure? Governments and cities have great potential here but there are many obstacles in practice. Civil servants get worried about the risk of failure so go with the middle ground and we miss the chance for the big innovation to occur. Alongside regulatory innovation, acting strategically in this domain is going to be&nbsp;vital.</p><p>The final dimension is building the infrastructures for regulation to be less about control oriented to one of enabling. A control orientated governance and regulatory system works in a world of predictability. But that is not the world we live in — now less than ever. So if this is the case we need not just a series of immediate regulatory adjustments enabling a green recovery, but also to create agile new ways to evolve our regulatory frameworks on an on-going basis for a complex emergent world focused on innovation and transition. This is particularly true in Italy, where a deep change in public administration is needed whether in procurement, recruitment, authorization procedures and or know-how on public-private-civic collaboration.</p><p>The PNRR offers great opportunities. But it cannot be a sticking plaster. Driving an innovative, resilient, and thriving society in the 21st Century cannot be achieved with the tools and practices of the 20th century. We must create tangible pathways towards a next generation governance system at urban level and beyond — through collaboratively building portfolios of new instruments and tools right across the domains we mention in this piece: a ‘boring revolution’ of institutional infrastructures to enable the more visible aspects of recovery and resilience in our&nbsp;cities.</p><p>If you want to find out more about this initiative contact <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> or <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">The great 200 billion Euro Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Per la versione inglese vedi&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">qui</a>.</p><p>L’Italia, come molte nazioni, sta affrontando un’importante transizione strategica. Molte città italiane stanno assistendo ad un cocktail di sfide crescenti e rischi futuri, inclusi la fuga di cervelli di giovani qualificati verso città più grandi e altre parti d’Europa; la stagnazione economica e le infrastrutture che invecchiano; la scarsa qualità dell’aria, gli effetti negativi delle isole di calore e l’aumento dell’incidenza delle inondazioni. Tutto ciò è stato aggravato dal COVID, che ha profondamente colpito le comunità e l’economia italiana rivelandone e amplificandone le disuguaglianze. I modelli di sfruttamento del lavoro con privazione dei diritti minimi si stanno diffondendo; mentre in termini di disagio sociale e psicologico stiamo assistendo a sempre più episodi di violenza sia in ambito domestico che nelle strade e ad un preoccupante aumento dell’autolesionismo soprattutto tra i giovani. La società italiana sta soffrendo.</p><p>Oltre l’incrementalismo</p><p>La transizione richiesta è sistemica: non si tratta di una transizione incrementale o aggiuntiva, ma radicale. Sappiamo, ad esempio, che il cambiamento climatico non è una crisi isolata: è fondamentalmente un sintomo di un problema strutturale nel modo in cui governiamo e in cui sono governate le nostre relazioni nel mondo: il nostro rapporto con il futuro, il nostro rapporto con la natura e il mondo materiale, il rapporto tra di noi. Man mano che le divisioni sociali e la prospettiva di un riscaldamento globale di <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ ​​gradi Celsius</a> diventano sempre più probabili, dobbiamo metterci nelle condizioni di ripensare una serie di relazioni sociali, economiche, umane e planetarie per forgiare un futuro florido e sostenibile per le nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Il Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) con la sua irripetibile dotazione di capitale, rappresenta forse la migliore opportunità che abbiamo e comporta un’enorme responsabilità per tutti noi come professionisti e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha visto livelli di coordinamento finanziario e politico all’interno dell’UE senza precedenti. Ad esempio, la raccolta di capitale per il fondo di ripresa Covid-19 per i pacchetti di stimolo fiscale in tutta l’UE ha registrato una straordinaria risposta collettiva. Il fondo sarà distribuito nei prossimi cinque anni, con una combinazione di sovvenzioni e prestiti ai paesi dell’UE e spesa diretta dell’UE; circa 1/3 (250 miliardi di euro) andrà a finanziare l’economia verde. La Commissione prevede di iniziare ad emettere titoli nel giugno di quest’anno creando un precedente a livello europeo per altre attività di raccolta fondi sui&nbsp;mercati.</p><p>Il piano richiede l’accordo su una nuova tassa sui beni importati nell’UE da paesi che perseguono obiettivi di taglio delle emissioni di CO2 meno ambiziosi, nuovi prelievi o sovrattasse sulle emissioni nel settore dei trasporti e una tassa per il settore digitale.</p><p>I 250 miliardi di euro da stanziare per l’economia verde dovrebbero fornire la base per l’innovazione finanziaria nel settore del cambiamento climatico, ad es. esaminare la fattibilità di bond legati all’impatto del cambiamento climatico per consentire all’Europa di aprire la strada agli investimenti in un futuro pulito, sano e&nbsp;giusto.</p><p>Tutto questo si aggiunge a un programma di retrofit di efficienza energetica molto ambizioso a livello nazionale, “Superbonus”, che si occupa del miglioramento dei materiali, degli impianti energetici e dell’incremento di fonti rinnovabili. Amministrato attraverso l’Agenzia delle Entrate, prevede un sussidio del 110% dei costi di ristrutturazione e installazione, che verrano rimborsati attraverso un bonus fiscale nell’arco di pochi&nbsp;anni.</p><p>Attorno a questo schema si sta mobilitando una quantità impressionante di organizzazioni come le banche, l’agenzia delle entrate, le società di consulenza fiscale, un insieme di fornitori per la parte tecnica e di realizzazione (isolamento, impianti, architettura, ingegneria, imprese edili, etc.), comuni e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha anche dimostrato che i luoghi devono essere in grado di trasformarsi rapidamente e che dobbiamo sviluppare resilienza e agilità istituzionali per affrontare eventi imprevedibili, per rispondere alle crisi non solo in modo puramente reattivo, ma garantendo che le misure di ripresa siano veramente trasformative e capaci di ridurre le vulnerabilità future.</p><p>Milano, ad esempio, è stata una delle prime grandi città in Europa a dover attuare un lockdown. La città ha risposto con un’ampia serie di iniziative, che hanno incluso la realizzazione a tempo di record di strategie di mobilità attiva, la trasformazione dell’ambiente domestico in luogo di lavoro, l’attivazione su larga scala della didattica on line facendo fronte al divario digitale e creando maggiori opportunità di autoapprendimento.</p><p>Un programma di ripresa multidimensionale</p><p>Poiché la trasformazione è multidimensionale, è molto chiaro ora che i processi per realizzarla sono della massima importanza. Tutte le misure di ripresa da implementare nel prossimo futuro devono andare oltre le soluzioni temporanee unidimensionali e mirare invece a molteplici co-benefici e sinergie. Ad esempio si potrebbero sfruttare le agevolazioni “superbonus” per creare un programma di retrofit inclusivo che porti la sostenibilità a livello di quartiere. Un tale programma di riqualificazione dovrebbe affrontare non solo il rendimento energetico del patrimonio abitativo, ma anche realizzare una maggiore coesione sociale e benefici a lungo termine attraverso la generazione e la distribuzione della energia prodotta dagli stessi residenti, la valorizzazione delle aree pubbliche che collegano gli edifici e la conversione di spazi dedicati alle auto a parchi che consentono ai residenti di praticare attività fisica, godere della natura e organizzare mercati di prossimità (prodotti agricoli&nbsp;ecc.).</p><p>Nel definire un programma di recupero multidimensionale di questo tipo, una prima sfida riguarda il modo in cui comprendiamo i rischi interconnessi che dobbiamo affrontare (ad esempio, inquinamento atmosferico, povertà energetica, impatti sulla salute, perdita di posti di lavoro e precarietà, mancanza di istruzione adeguata e coesione della comunità, cambiamento climatico).</p><p>In secondo luogo, dobbiamo ripensare a come costruire portafogli di interventi che si rafforzino a vicenda contro tali passività future, permettendoci di stabilire una chiara direzionalità della transizione ed essere aperti all’incertezza e all’emergere di nuove opportunità, nonché a possibili nuove&nbsp;crisi.</p><p>Ciò significa anche sviluppare una capacità distribuita di costruire, iterare e imparare dai primi interventi, creare portafogli di transizione dinamici, agili e capillari capaci di evolversi man mano che emergono nuove problematiche, opportunità, problemi e intuizioni&nbsp;. Viviamo infatti in un’epoca di continua comparsa di difficoltà/opportunità e crisi emergenziali e le istituzioni centralizzate si muovono lentamente e non sono, per definizione, all’altezza del&nbsp;compito.</p><p>Le capacità istituzionali di prossima generazione</p><p>In pratica questo significa costruire la capacità istituzionale di comprendere e agire sull’emergenza in modo collaborativo sia nel settore pubblico (comuni), nel settore privato (costruttori, società energetiche, ecc.) che nella società civile. Si tratta di proprietà istituzionali fondamentali: la capacità distribuita di dare un senso a dati complessi e segnali deboli, capacità distribuita di innovare e la capacità distribuita di creare nuove coalizioni. Non siamo in grado di prevedere 1:1 quali sono i problemi, quali sono le nostre maggiori responsabilità e quali potrebbero essere le soluzioni.</p><p>Una dimensione in cui tali esigenze di capacità istituzionale sono particolarmente urgenti è l’innovazione nella manutenzione. Dobbiamo ridurre radicalmente i costi burocratici e di gestione della manutenzione, dell’adattamento e del miglioramento delle nostre città nel loro complesso se vogliamo recuperare l’arretratezza nella manutenzione delle infrastrutture e liberare nuovo valore dell’ambiente costruito esistente. Ciò è particolarmente rilevante in Italia, dove ci sono molti livelli di controllo e di burocrazia che frenano le città nell’approvvigionamento e nella gestione di tali lavori. Una ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ (una ‘rivoluzione noiosa’) nell’empowerment locale, nella responsabilità e nella semplificazione delle procedure è essenziale affinché il paese dispieghi le ali e prenda il volo. L’Italia ha bisogno di cambiare mentalità da “abbiamo sempre fatto così” a “questi sono tempi straordinari, proviamo e impariamo ”.</p><p>Per arrivarci dobbiamo adottare un approccio all’investimento a livello di filiere / catene di valore, che presuppone investimenti su varie filiere produttive, come ad esempio quelli necessari per supportare il passaggio a bio materiali e circolarità nei settori dello sviluppo immobiliare e dell’edilizia&nbsp;. È cruciale che cambiamenti profondi e strutturali siano affrontati assicurando una “transizione giusta”. Se ci limitiamo a innovazioni puntuali, vedremo il consolidamento del capitale e della ricchezza nelle mani di pochi. Quindi, riconoscendo il ruolo delle PMI e della natura familistica dell’economia italiana, come possiamo investire in una rivoluzione inclusiva dell’intera catena del valore, spingendo la produzione digitalizzata e la capacità di rendimento dell’intero ciclo di vita, enfatizzando le nuove competenze e modi di lavorare essenziali per la moderna automazione uomo-macchina?</p><p>Sappiamo che nel 21° secolo, se vogliamo parlare di prospettive per il futuro, operiamo fondamentalmente nel dominio delle nuove capacità uomo-macchina. Ciò richiede la creazione di nuove infrastrutture istituzionali e finanziarie, sia per cristallizzare i rischi futuri sia per integrare una comprensione più sofisticata di tali responsabilità con il modo in cui investiamo in infrastrutture umane, tecnologiche e fisiche per la transizione. I nostri investimenti in infrastrutture devono andare ben oltre le familiari “gru all’orizzonte”, finanziando anche la capacità a lungo termine di aziende, di interi settori e della comunità di essere soggetti attivi della transizione, portando ciascuno immaginazione e innovazione.</p><p>Ad esempio, le città stanno prendendo sempre più in considerazione la necessità di massicci investimenti in infrastrutture verdi come Milano, Torino o Bologna, tra le tante città europee che si sono dotate di piani di forestazione urbana da milioni di alberi. Ma è impossibile costruire approcci veramente integrati senza considerare le inondazioni, le isole di calore e la biodiversità, come fattori essenziali nei modelli delle società di servizi e multiutilities che gestiscono i rischi e gli investimenti per farvi fronte. Questi a loro volta devono andare di pari passo con la valutazione dei rischi sulla salute, il coinvolgimento del mondo assicurativo e la costruzione di una capacità collettiva di acquisto basata sui risultati (outcomes based contracts) che integra tali rischi e responsabilità nel settore pubblico e&nbsp;privato.</p><p>Le soluzioni infrastrutturali multi-benefici come le foreste (peri-) urbane possono gestire questi rischi simultaneamente e produrre risultati per più beneficiari. Quindi la condivisione di tali responsabilità e la creazione di un quadro di riferimento per aziende, comunità e altre organizzazioni per i contratti di acquisto basati sui risultati (Outcomes Based Contracts),diventano strumenti fondamentali per dare agli investimenti priorità definite in modo collaborativo.</p><p>Questo tipo di innovazione negli appalti consente al settore pubblico e alle comunità di descrivere il risultato che desiderano e quindi di lasciare spazio a nuove innovazioni. Stiamo iniziando a vedere sperimentazioni di questi tipo in alcuni luoghi in cui le autorità sanitarie, ad esempio, stanno investendo in cambiamenti all’ambiente costruito perché si traducono in meno obesità, meno malattie respiratorie o meno stress per la salute mentale. Città come Vienna e Londra stanno iniziando ad affrontare queste sfide sistemiche.</p><p>Il contratto sociale per la transizione</p><p>Ciò che diventa evidente in tutto questo è che l’Italia deve investire nella capacità di innovazione a livello di singolo cittadino. Dobbiamo costruire nei cittadini la comprensione della transizione e la voglia di innovazione, quasi a livello quotidiano: è una parte essenziale del <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">contratto sociale necessario per una transizione legittima</a>. La capacità a livello di strada o quartiere, la capacità democratica di massa di innovare è una componente fondamentale di questa tesi. Bologna è un ottimo esempio in cui questo sta già iniziando a succedere, attraverso la Fondazione Innovazione Urbana e i suoi “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, spazi pazienti e democratici di confronto a livello di quartiere. L’obiettivo è attivare processi continui di ascolto, dialogo e collaborazione in ogni quartiere, per far emergere priorità, bisogni, indicazioni e proposte, immaginando soluzioni condivise su come rigenerare e valorizzare gli spazi nei vari ambiti della città attraverso assemblee pubbliche nei quartieri, sessioni tematiche e incontri fisici o&nbsp;on-line.</p><p>Oppure Ferrara, dove il progetto Climb ha promosso la mobilità casa-scuola attiva e sostenibile attraverso un mix di cambiamento comportamentale, internet delle cose e gamification; il progetto mira a cambiare l’atteggiamento dei bambini, delle loro famiglie e della loro comunità ed abbracciare soluzioni di viaggio eco-sostenibili creando abitudini di mobilità eco-compatibili come un’esperienza divertente e sociale. Le comunità locali possono utilizzare le lezioni apprese dal progetto per creare un movimento civico che porta anche ad altri benefici collaterali. Tutti questi progetti iniziano dal basso e hanno portato a importanti livelli di partecipazione dei cittadini.</p><p>Oppure si pensi al Progetto Seta di Rovereto volto a creare un distretto culturale ed economico delle attività seriche secondo un approccio di sviluppo integrato: rigenerazione e bonifica dei terreni incolti; promozione di un progetto di agricoltura sociale e sostenibile per la produzione di gelsi e bachi da seta, con inserimento lavorativo di persone in situazioni difficili.</p><p>Infine, sul tema della circolarità ci sono numerosi casi di innovazione che si stanno sempre più diffondendo in Italia. Bioplastiche da residui d’uva nella Valdobbiadene, i numerosi esempi di nuovi modelli di business che stiamo vedendo in luoghi come Milano attorno a concetti abitativi circolari, dove si stanno affinando modelli di sviluppo che riuniscono i residenti per aiutare con la cura dei bambini, la condivisione delle risorse (mobilità) e la produzione alimentare. Questi sono i progetti da cui imparare, sia per ampliarne la portata e / o replicarli, sia per consentire alle lezioni apprese di guidare l’impatto sistemico, utilizzando i fondi per la ripresa per catalizzare questo cambiamento e portare queste nuove filiere e modelli di business climaticamente resilienti a&nbsp;mercato.</p><p>Costruire mercati guida nelle città&nbsp;Italiane</p><p>Infine, abbiamo bisogno di un cambiamento culturale nel modo in cui consideriamo tali iniziative di transizione. Se, ad esempio, investiamo nella de-pavimentazione stradale supportata dall’uso di strumenti digitali creando spazio per microprati urbani e alberi in tutta la città, e se creiamo nuovi modelli di <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">intelligenza artificiale civica</a> per convincere le comunità a impegnarsi su beni pubblici come i prati urbani, terreni ad uso pubblico e altri interventi naturali, stiamo facendo di più che migliorare le città e territori più resilienti.</p><p>Rendere open source tali modelli di machine learning e tenere in conto il valore dei social network che creano la capacità di riqualificare intere strade e quartieri in modo integrato, consente di generare domanda di innovazione di filiera e normativa e costruire un’ecoonomia ad alto valore aggiunto nel 21° secolo. Quindi non si tratta solo di de-pavimentazione: è un percorso intenzionale verso una transizione inclusiva e nuovi “mercati guida” che creano posti di lavoro sostenibili, mezzi di sussistenza e identità positiva del&nbsp;luogo.</p><p>Chiaramente, questo tipo di transizione radicale richiede una profonda riflessione e un investimento in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">capacità istituzionali adatte al 21° secolo</a>. Abbiamo parlato degli investimenti in catene del valore, di capacità di collaborazione civica e di strumenti finanziari come gli Outcomes Based Contracts. Un’altra dimensione è l’investimento educativo per lo sviluppo umano nell’era dell’automazione.</p><p>Quali sono le nuove scuole del 21° secolo e il programma di sviluppo a cui l’Italia vuole prepararsi? Abbiamo bisogno di nuove scuole o università? Abbiamo bisogno di infrastrutture completamente nuove per lo sviluppo&nbsp;umano?</p><p>Attualmente sono ancora diverse le aree del Paese che soffrono il digital divide e questo ha avuto conseguenze significative sulla capacità di frequentare la scuola online, incidendo sul livello di competenze delle generazioni future.</p><p>Ci sono esempi di leader mondiali di AI in Italia, a Torino, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia, dove i centri di ricerca e le aziende stanno collaborando. La sfida qui è imparare dalle conoscenze generate estendendone i benefici a livello di sistema, condividere l’innovazione a livello nazionale e distribuirla più uniformemente.</p><p>Un altro aspetto importante è relativo al ruolo che hanno i governi nel guidare il mercato. Gli appalti pubblici non dovrebbero concentrarsi solo sull’efficienza, ma anche sulla creazione mirata di nuovi mercati guida attraverso l’investimento e l’”acquisto” di innovazione in settori chiave. In che modo i governi sostengono attivamente l’emergere di nuovi comportamenti attraverso ciò che acquistano? I governi e le città hanno un grande potenziale, ma nella pratica ci sono molti ostacoli. I dipendenti pubblici si preoccupano del rischio di errore, si adotta una via di mezzo e si perde l’occasione che si realizzino grandi innovazioni. L’’innovazione normativa è uno degli strumenti per attuare una strategia sistemica e trasformativa.</p><p>La dimensione finale è relativa alla costruzione di infrastrutture affinché la regolamentazione sia meno orientata al controllo e più orientata all’abilitazione. Un sistema di governance e regolamentazione orientato al controllo funziona in un mondo di prevedibilità. Ma questo non è il mondo in cui viviamo, ora meno che mai. Quindi, se questo è il caso, non abbiamo bisogno solo di una serie di aggiustamenti normativi immediati che consentano una ripresa verde, ma anche di creare nuovi modi agili per far evolvere i nostri quadri normativi su base permanente per un mondo complesso incentrato sull’innovazione e la transizione. Ciò è particolarmente vero in Italia, dove è necessario un profondo cambiamento nella pubblica amministrazione negli appalti, nelle assunzioni, nelle procedure di autorizzazione e / o nel know-how sulla collaborazione pubblico-privato-cittadino.</p><p>Il PNRR offre grandi opportunità. Ma non può essere un cerotto. Non si può guidare una società innovativa, resiliente e florida nel 21° secolo con gli strumenti e le pratiche del 20° secolo. Dobbiamo creare percorsi tangibili verso un sistema di governance di prossima generazione a livello urbano e oltre, attraverso la costruzione collaborativa di portafogli di nuovi strumenti e di souluzioni come quelle menzionate in questo articolo: una ‘boring revolution’ delle infrastrutture istituzionali per abilitare e valorizzare le componenti di resilienza e ripresa nelle nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Se sei interessato a continuare la conversazione, contattaci <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> o <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">Un piano da oltre 200 miliardi</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A case study of using Fission's UCAN to power lightweight, verifiable credentials for discounts, offers, and other deals between businesses on the web.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>How do you coordinate among many business units in one company, or with many independent businesses across the web? Fission's UCAN approach makes for lightweight, verifiable credentials that can help businesses coordinate without tight integration or coordination ahead of time. </p> "At a Doughnut Shop Near You!" <p>Let's say that you've recently realized your lifelong dream to open an independent doughnut shop. To welcome you to the neighbourhood, the coffee shop next door wants to run a promotion to drive awareness of both businesses (what's better than coffee and a doughnut, right?) If someone buys a cruller from you, the coffee shop will give the them a brew coffee at half price.</p><p>To keep things simple, customers only need to show a receipt from your shop issued in the last 24 hours at the coffee shop. To prevent them from being claimed multiple times, the cafe will track the receipt ID in their system. Non-coffee drinking customers can hand off their doughnut receipts to their friends, who gratefully take the 50% off, and drives even more business to the area. Foot traffic is up, and profits soar.</p><p>Time goes on, and this arrangement is working so well that the other shops in the area want to also offer collaborative deals. They want to do all kinds of things: some keep the single-use deal offer, but others want to offer permanent discounts to members of their co-op, over different time periods, or recurring offers (e.g. "every Friday").</p><p>You could absolutely create a coordinated system with a central database for the entire neighbourhood, but that shows everyone how many sales are being done at the other stores, and requires ongoing maintenance. You want to offer specials and deals without coordinating with the entire business association! You keep the system that's been working: record the receipt IDs, and leave it up to each retailer how they want to run their offers.</p> The Online Equivalent <p>The above story not only sounds reasonable, but is done in real life with physical receipts. It's ground-up, requires little coordination, has no service outages, and anyone can participate. No one has to ask the doughnut shop if they are allowed to use their receipts, and no one is maintaining a complex system of rules for these offers.</p><p>Historically, doing this online has been less straightforward. Because permissions are done per company, offering a discount code requires coordination between at least two teams: the doughnut shop in the above story suddenly needs to either:</p>  Know all of the discount codes for all of the participating shops, or  Register the user ID as being eligible for deals, and wire up the two company's back-ends  <p>These both work, but they depend on a high level of coordination, and rules to be maintained across systems. They're permissioned, and top-down. There must be a simpler way, closer to the bottom-up version from our doughnut shop story, right?</p> Enter the UCAN <p>At Fission, we've developed a version of distributed auth called UCAN:</p><blockquote>User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are a way of doing authorization where users are fully in control. OAuth is designed for a centralized world, UCAN is the distributed user controlled version.<br><br>– <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/auth-without-backend/">Fission blog: UCAN: Authorizing Users without a Backend</a></blockquote><p>As well as being like a distributed variant of OAuth, UCANs are also stateless by default ("REST for auth"), so it continues to work client-side, P2P, and even offline.</p><p>UCANs are used anywhere that we need to authorize a user to perform side-effects: time-based expiry, rights delegation, authorized access, writing to a database, and so on. Fission is a platform that helps people create apps, so we made it extensible: it can support arbitrary use cases as long as they're well understood by the issuer and verifier.</p><p>It turns out that UCANs are able to fully support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credential</a> use cases, in a different format, with the added flexibility of delegation. This makes them work much like the receipts in the doughnut shop story, thanks to the following properties:</p>  Permissionless —&nbsp;anyone can accept UCANs issued without bothering you  Bearer Credential —&nbsp;you only need the UCAN itself (like a receipt)  Delegable — can be passed around to friends, and prove that they're allowed  Non-fungible — uniquely identifiable, even when delegated   Use Case: Decentralized Coordination <p>We have been exploring use cases with a few teams, including a Fortune 500 publishing company. They have many properties under their umbrella, and collaborate with many third parties to offer perks to their subscribers. Like many companies offering running at scale today, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">solved for team agility with microservices</a> — each team can move their publications forward independently. Users have a single account across publications, and so all logins and billing get funnelled through the auth service.</p> Internal Decentralized Coordination <p>If you have ever read a physical magazine, you'll be familiar with their leaflets enticing you to sign up for their other publications and partners. You typically mail the leaflet that's already prefilled with your account number back to the publisher. How would we replicate these offers digitally?</p><p>The centralized auth server works well, but that auth server is a both a technical and team bottleneck: if Publication A wants to give a trial offer for Publication B, they need to encode this logic directly in the auth server. The auth and billing teams are suddenly responsible for maintaining the complex rules across all teams' marketing deals. Teams A and B now have a hard dependency on the roadmap of the auth team, which is also responsible for servicing all of the other teams.</p><p>By placing all the information needed to describe and validate an offer right in the token, teams can ship independently.</p> Easy Third-Party Integration <p>The same applies to teams outside the company: anyone with a valid credential can be used as authorized proof that you have an account, despite having totally separate auth systems. It can be as simple as signing up with the same email that's in the credential, or having a challenge code signed into the UCAN chain.</p><p>What this can't tell you statelessly is that the holder is currently a subscriber, only that they were when the credential was made. For this reason, these credentials generally have an expiration date. They can absolutely be made stateful by requiring a lookup — it's always easier to go that direction than from stateful to stateless —&nbsp;but in our experience it's not required for the 95% use case.</p><p>What this enables is that business and marketing teams can make discounts, offers, and other specialized deals anywhere, with any company, with low effort and without developer coordination overhead, while still having verifiable credentials, and without sharing more than a single fact about users.</p> Contemporaries <p>It turns out that it's not just us! This pattern is being picked up elsewhere, too.</p> Google Macaroons <p>Until fairly recently, Google had a similar centralized auth setup as the publishing company. Being at Google scale means that their auth servers were dealing with an enormous volume for logins and auth across Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, Google Docs, Stadia, and so on. To make this scale better, they developed the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/macaroons-resources/527">Macaroons</a> system to delegate auth responsibilities to the individual services, which still remaining interoperable with a single account.</p><p>In many ways, UCANs are like Macaroons taken to their logical conclusion: they fully decentralize auth, are stateless by default, and work well permissionlessly across teams.</p> Passport <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenThompson">Ben Thompson</a> of the excellent <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> has recently released <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/passport/">Passport</a>, which is also aimed at a subset of the problem space. From the linked article:</p><blockquote>The second reason to build Passport is to provide a better experience &nbsp;for my subscribers. One of the downsides of relying on a menagerie of &nbsp;different services is that there were both more rough edges exposed to &nbsp;users, and also an inability to provide more personalized offerings. &nbsp;Passport is an improvement on both fronts.</blockquote><p>We had a number of people send us this article, saying that it reminded them of how Fission worked. Definitely, these are the types of use cases that we think can be created and enabled across the web as an open, interoperable standard. And some of it crosses into the work we're doing as <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/fission-demo-day-may-2021/">part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, too.</p><p>It feels like this idea's time has come!</p> Your Turn <p>Interested in implementing UCANs to coordinate offers? Have a use case we haven't thought of? Want to poke holes in the whole concept? We'd love to hear from you!</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/borismann">Book a time in our calendar</a>, or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by our Discord chat</a> with any further questions.</p><p>You can find all the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/user-controlled-authorization-networks-ucan-resources/1122">collected UCAN resources in our developer forum »</a></p>

   We’re excited to announce that Dock’s mainnet will transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT.

<p>We’re excited to announce that Dock’s mainnet will transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT.</p><p>As discussed in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-testnet-is-now-live/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=docks_proof_of_stake_mainnet_will_launch_on_july_7th">earlier blog post</a>, this transition will further decentralize the Dock blockchain by basing validator selection on the amount of tokens staked by validators and token holders, and introducing a new governance structure that allows anyone with Dock tokens to vote on proposed changes to the network.</p><p>This transition also comes with a change in the network’s consensus algorithm, from Aura to BABE (you can read more about these algorithms <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/consensus">here</a>), and this will require starting a new chain that runs the BABE algorithm. However, we’re taking the following steps to minimize the impact of creating a new chain on our network users:</p>  The new chain’s genesis block will preserve the state (accounts with balances, DIDs, schemas, etc.) of the existing Proof of Authority (PoA) mainnet.  We will retain the history of the PoA mainnet blocks and have it publicly available on a separate explorer, whose link will be shared soon after the new chain is launched.  <p>The upgrade to PoS will involve stopping the block production on the existing PoA mainnet, exporting the state of the PoA network, and starting the new PoS chain that preserves the PoA network’s state. This process will begin at 10am GMT on July 7th, and will take around 3 hours, during which transactions will not be possible. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused by this, but we're sure you’ll agree that the benefits outweigh the disruption.</p><p>In the coming days we’ll publish more detailed information on how token holders can participate in the new network, and keep the community updated on our progress in taking this important step!</p>

<p>Guest post by Nasubo Ongoma, <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala Limited</a>, email: nasubo.ongoma@qhala.com</p>Natasha, a woman driver receiving a client request on her phone in Nairobi, Kenya. Photo credit: Natasha (driver).<blockquote>“Digital channels are actually the lifesaver when it comes to these challenges females&nbsp;face.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Lizzie, 24, freelancer and research participant</blockquote><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Qhala and Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will work to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young women’s experiences working or selling through online platforms in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> Why this research&nbsp;now? <p>There is growing conversation on how platformization (broadly, the use of digital technologies to get work or sell) has increased access to work and markets for young women. Despite consistent calls for gender equity and <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2016/leaving-no-one-behind">narrowing</a> the gender gap worldwide, in many emerging markets, such as Kenya, there is much more to learn about how platforms impact women’s lives, especially during and after COVID-19.</p><p>COVID-19 deprived people of sources of income and led to the closure of businesses, vending sites, and marketplaces, and women were among the <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_women_9_apr_2020_updated.pdf">worst</a> affected. The pandemic and its effects on livelihoods emerge in the context of global <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_771749.pdf">findings</a> by ILO that a majority of workers on digital labor platforms are highly educated and male. How can women compete in this economic sphere dominated and enabled by men? Understanding the experience of platform livelihoods from women’s perspective is key to identifying the enablers, barriers, opportunities, and challenges for women as they strive to get platform work during and after the pandemic.</p><p>This research builds on Qhala and Caribou Digital’s previous work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a>, which explores the effect of “platformatization” on different livelihoods for Kenyan youth. Through an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">extensive literature review</a>, Platform Livelihoods describes in detail the experiences of youth workers in farming, creative sectors, logistics (motorcycle drivers), and small businesses. (The full report is in publication; frameworks and the gender-specific literature review can be found <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender">here</a>). Through interviews with workers, the differences between male and female youth economic opportunities and participation became clear. This includes <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/access-to-work-is-there-work-for-those-who-want-it/">access</a> (access to capital, freedom of movement, devices, and safety), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/flexibility/">flexibility</a> (juggling productive and reproductive roles and responsibilities for women), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/earnings/">earnings</a> (reflecting a difference in how skills are valued their skill is based on gender) and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/objectivity-professionalism/">professionalism</a> (societal perception about what kinds of jobs or roles women and men are best suited for). Milly is an onion farmer in Kajiado County. Her quote below illustrates the complexity of female Kenyan gig worker experiences:</p><blockquote>“Yes of course there is always that — a little bit of male chauvinism around. I won’t lie. There is a lot of sexism that is around. But there is also the advantage of the fact that you are a woman that people will easily believe you or trust in you. You know? So you look at it in both ways. It’s an advantage sometimes and sometimes a disadvantage. Yeah. But I think it has worked for me rather than it has worked against me.” — Milly, 26, Farmer, (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>Women participants (especially in the creative sectors) mentioned that there is sexism. For example, in the music and artistic industries, women face the expectation to sell their products cheaper than men or face harassment:</p><blockquote>“There are people who are going to take advantage of you. They come to you with other intentions, not businesswise.” — Lynn, 25, Visual Artist (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>The gig sector is known for its flexibility and earning potential. However, with stiff competition emerging in the platform economy, will women be able to thrive and succeed in this sector, in terms of earnings and finding opportunities? Further, women were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Some were out of work. Others considered a career change and ventured into the platform economy. Understanding women’s economic participation experiences in the gig economy is thus necessary to generate evidence to describe the enablers and barriers including coping mechanisms, and then inform gender policy and program considerations to improve livelihoods through platformatization.</p> About the&nbsp;research <p>The questions we will ask in our gender-focused Kenya research will be informed by our initial global findings and gender, work, and platformatization. From the Platform Livelihoods literature review, sectoral reports on <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24732/w24732.pdf">ride-hailing</a> platforms outline notable differences in wages, attributed to experience on the platform, driving experience, choice of where to work and live, as well as safety issues as they carry out the work. There are also notable differences for women freelancers when bidding for work. Foong et al. (2018) found that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274322">women bid less</a> than men and as a result have to bid for more work to <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=527000067124025066094116074070107108039003024042071075093072121088117122097095002067114102007027106035006118100121071013027083005082039040022084028076126102024076010057077009093030069067114126083085115085011092008094101027115097072008067001006102100001&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">compensate</a> for this disparity in earnings.</p><p>Although women dominate the trade and services sectors, female gig workers allude to the skewed power dynamics that privilege clients over workers. (It is worth noting that men may also experience the same, and some platform economy critics point out that we talk more about women and platforms than men and platforms). These sectors are also heavily <a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">dependent</a> on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64697-4_7">ratings</a>; many young women report wanting more bargaining power in terms of the jobs they bid for, time put in the work, and the quality of&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“Let’s say I have been booked for five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. It will be a big house that does not even tally with those five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] but the client expects me to finish that job, so I am forced to add hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. The client will be putting pressure on me to work fast, but if I work fast, I will get a bad rating attributed to not cleaning properly as the job was rushed. There is a serious problem there.” — Faheema, FGD participant, Cape Town (<a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">Hunt et al</a>.,&nbsp;2019)</blockquote><p>A gender analysis of the platform economy is therefore timely to assess the enabling factors of and barriers to economic participation by young women in Kenya, especially in the informal sector. Notably, women’s involvement in the informal sector has been increasing, particularly in the platform economy, given its potential for women’s economic opportunities and participation for empowerment. By articulating the supports, barriers, and risks associated with the platform economy, this study will provide key learnings and understanding to address inequalities that may challenge young women’s economic participation. This study will begin in Kenya, followed by complementary research in Ghana (with the <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a>) and Nigeria (with <a href="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/">Lagos Business School</a> and <a href="https://v4w.org/">Value for Women</a>). The sample population is young women aged 18–35 years from rural and urban Kenya working on the gig/ platform economy (with parallel populations in Ghana and Nigeria).</p> Young women turn to digital platforms in&nbsp;Kenya A visual artist posting her art work on Instagram. Photo courtesy of Wanja (Visual&nbsp;Artist).<p>Digital platforms encompass social media too. With a <a href="https://kenyanwallstreet.com/digital-gig-economys-potential-to-solve-youth-unemployment.">rapidly expanding</a> youth population and limited opportunities for formal employment, Kenya’s workforce is shifting towards the informal sector which offers endless economic opportunities. The informal sector in Kenya has grown exponentially in the last two decades and presents innumerable opportunities for youth and women. For example, in several <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/98644.html">African countries</a> the employment contribution of the informal sector is estimated at approximately 80% for non-agricultural jobs.</p><p>Within the informal sector, women account for a disproportionate percentage of workers from street vendors, to domestic workers, subsistence farmers, and seasonal agricultural workers. These economic opportunities are often labor intensive, low-income, short-term unsecured work characterized by informality without proper structures and guidelines for operations. However, what we have seen in Kenya is that while digital companies have tried their hand in these sectors due to the abundance of workers, many initiatives for “platformatizing” informal work have not taken off due to the reliance of a trust based system, where clients prefer referrals from their closed networks/circles. For example, domestic help is more likely to be sought through a friend in a one-on-one message or closed WhatsApp group than contracted through a platform.</p><p>Beyond this, however, other types of work are thriving online. Platforms are capitalizing on the economic potential of the informal sector to create marketplaces for buyers and sellers, or clients and independent contractors. As we begin interviews, three primary topics are of interest: COVID-19 and its effects, the influence of offline gender norms, and policy regulations in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> The effect of&nbsp;COVID-19 <blockquote>“It affected us because most of our clients were employed through some offices so the offices when they closed, we lost some clients, we had some losses.” — Pauline, 21, MSE (Food&nbsp;Vendor)</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the <a href="https://rstmh.org/news-blog/news/the-evolution-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-kenya">onset of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> informal sector economic opportunities easily available for youth and women in Kenya were the worst hit as containment measures and health directives such as social distancing, <a href="https://techweez.com/2020/03/27/uber-kenya-suspends-night-pickups-due-to-curfew/">restricted movement</a>, and lockdown brought businesses to an impromptu standstill, with some eventually <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/11/ride-hailing-startup-safeboda-quits-kenya-citing-impact-of-covid-19/">shutting</a>&nbsp;down.</p><p>COVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing problems, especially for women, <a href="https://data.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/COVID-19%20Gender%20Assessment%20-PopularVersion.pdf">most of whom</a> lost jobs or business and could no longer work for pay after COVID-19. There was also an increased burden of work, including unpaid care and domestic&nbsp;work.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/blog/covid-19-gig-workers-social-protection">left workers</a> on their own. Some report <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/covid-19-exposes-risks-and-opportunities-kenyas-gig-economy">cutting back</a> on non-food items and reducing their number of meals to cope with decreased income. The number of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/08/tackling-kenyas-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-crisis">domestic violence</a> cases attributed to COVID-19 increased. Some sectors, on the other hand, found <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">new success</a> with an upsurge of <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001365681/boon-for-delivery-apps-as-city-eateries-shut-on-virus-fears">demand</a>, for instance, <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2020/05/sendy-launches-a-home-delivery-solution-to-help-flatten-the-curve/">deliveries</a>, food industry, pharmaceutical corporations, cleaning companies, and online&nbsp;work.</p> Offline gender&nbsp;patterns <p>Social norms and perceived women’s roles still limit women’s engagement in the platform economy. In the previous Platform Livelihoods study (study to be published), each of the four sectors displayed long-standing dynamics. For instance, in logistics, female drivers are scarce and are seen as courageous for taking up the&nbsp;job.</p><blockquote>“[People tell me] Madam, congrats. You are doing work that even most men can’t do.” — Brenda, 29, Motorcycle Rider</blockquote><p>However, it does seem to be the case that young Kenyan women are successfully navigating social commerce and even social agriculture (using social media platforms to buy and sell produce). This demonstrates that there may be new barriers to be confronted, challenged, or changed. Women are faced with formal and informal structural barriers manifested in the perceptions of the work they do. For instance, societal bias to what work is decent: if educated e.g with certain academic qualifications, family may not understand why a worker is doing that work as opposed to looking for more formal employment or working during late hours for married women may be shunned. It is key to understand the role of actors who may enable or hinder women’s growth and development. These could be peers, spouses, and sometimes family members like parents or siblings.</p><p>While women engage in the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/why-women-hold-the-keys-to-africas-future/">informal sector</a> that is labor intensive and time-consuming, women still have to fulfill their traditional roles which then means they have a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24738395/Gender_planning_in_the_third_world_Meeting_practical_and_strategic_gender_needs">triple burden of work</a>. Women’s workload often includes the unmeasured, unpaid domestic work demanded by their reproductive and productive roles. Further, the informal arrangements in informal sector operations subsequently limit women from fully accessing benefits and entitlements of labor engagement. For instance, working without clear human resource laws that govern the workers time, level of engagement, working conditions and negotiated pay.</p><p>According to Kenya’s gender mobile access <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSMA-Connected-Women-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2019.pdf">outlook</a>, over 82% of women own a mobile phone, but only 28% of these have access to mobile internet. Furthermore, women are significantly disadvantaged in accessing credit, land, or financial products, which prevents opportunities for them to start a company or make a living by managing&nbsp;assets.</p> Taxation, women, and platform work in&nbsp;Kenya <p>In 2020, the Kenyan government launched COVID-focused fiscal, monetary, and social insurance policies to <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/kenya-tax-developments-in-response-to-covid-19.html">moderate the impact of COVID-19, such as tax exemptions</a>. However, these policies <a href="https://www.fes.de/referat-afrika/neuigkeiten/how-the-pandemic-is-affecting-the-informal-sector-in-kenya">hardly benefit those in the informal sector</a>, where a large percentage of young women work. Additionally, for increased revenue collection, the government is now targeting <a href="https://www.bmmusau.com/electronic-commerce-law-with-a-special-emphasis-on-the-kenya-legal-tax-and-regulatory-challenges/">emerging e-commerce, which includes online business for tax returns</a>, yet more young Kenyan women are increasingly turning to this sector for work. <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/income-tax-gender-discrimination">Empirically</a>, when taxation is linked to labor supply, women’s labor supply compared to that of men is more responsive to their after-tax wage. With a reduction of taxes, the participation of women increases. The government tax on e-commerce coupled with the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic effects portend serious economic, social, and security consequences for young&nbsp;women.</p><p>These barriers in the informal sector notwithstanding, <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-are-kenyas-youth-experiencing-gig-economy">young women</a> continue to strive to source incomes from available opportunities. For those who can access and navigate digital technologies, online platforms present new<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/"> business lines and shifts in livelihoods</a>, especially in the gig economy, namely: platform work, small and medium enterprise, logistics, farming, and creatives.</p><p>There could be a reprieve for Kenyans on the digital tax with a <a href="https://citizentv.co.ke/business/relief-for-kenyans-in-digital-service-tax-waiver-11466752/">proposed</a> 2021 finance bill that will instead tax only non-residents or foreigners as opposed to local businesses. However, in foreign platforms this cost is passed down to users, and will impact overall earnings of anyone working online. For instance, UpWork will add the Digital Service Tax on services provided through their platform, and AWS (Amazon Web Services) will pass those extra costs to platform providers.</p>Caption: Information on the Digital Service Tax. Courtesy of Kenya Revenue Authority <a href="https://www.kra.go.ke/images/publications/Brochure--Digital-Service-Tax--final.pdf">KRA</a> The upcoming research&nbsp;process <p>As more women join the platform economy, they will have to overcome pre-existing barriers to participation, including offline gender patterns, new policies that make it harder to do business, and the effects of the pandemic on earnings and employment. From this study, then, there is a need to further explore and detail the gender dynamics in the platform economy. Qhala is thus setting out to upscale from the initial 2020 study and conduct in-depth research to provide detailed insights into gender and platform work in Kenya. The study is anchored in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">Cornwall’s women’s empowerment framework</a>, which calls for cutting away the tangle of assumptions and stereotypes that fill the field of gender and development.</p><p>The study will project the voices and unique perspectives of young women as actors in the platform economy to articulate the nuanced barriers and enablers including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will also facilitate mapping of the context and provide gender perspectives in the gig economy when regarded as a sector that has potential for increasing young women’s economic opportunities and participation to contribute to the realization of empowerment and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>The study will adopt a mixed method research design including:</p>  Flash conversations via closed social media groups where women work in the platform economy. Women discuss issues they face getting work or selling on online platforms. This is a key methodology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where women are turning to online groups for&nbsp;support.  In-depth interviews and focus group discussions with female gig workers with select male partners to understand the experiences of women workers and actors responsible in shaping their work experience.  Participatory video storytelling to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">See our previous participatory video storytelling work&nbsp;here</a>.  <p>We would welcome any feedback, from useful literature you think we should consult to methods we might have missed.

<p>Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/468663/uk-internet-penetration/">internet penetration rate in the United Kingdom is at an all-time high</a>. 46% of people in the UK attributed increased mobile device usage to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Britons now spend an average of 3.5 hours every day on the Internet — the statistic is much higher for Britons who work and live through e-commerce establishments.</p>
<p>The unstoppable rise of the internet opens up a plethora of questions that technology providers need to answer. The most important questions revolve around building security and trust especially in a way that does not frustrate end users.</p>
<p>How do we keep every Briton safe and secure when they access the Internet — without hampering user experience?</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK and the Digital ID Surge 
<p>The proliferation of digital products and services for the everyday consumer today has many effects — some intended, others unforeseen.</p>
<p>As is customary when people have multiple choices, an unpleasant one-time experience is enough to negatively affect customer experience, leading them to switch between brands that provide more pleasurable experiences. This is the most important rule guiding a frequently increasing on-demand culture in the UK.</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK 
<p>The term “on-demand culture” pays homage to a 21st-century consumer trend of heightened consumer convenience.</p>
<p>A major example of the on-demand culture in action is the expectations of mobile phone users.&nbsp; For mobile devices, users want digital service providers to deliver top-notch services and software solutions — search engines, financial apps, instant messaging —&nbsp; that can work securely and efficiently anywhere in record time.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the United Kingdom, end-users require the most of Digital ID verification systems. Consumers want an identity verification system that is fast, reliable, and accessible on cue.</p>
 How to be ‘on-demand’ compliant? 
<p>Given that<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf"> 85% of internet users</a> in the United Kingdom would rather access the internet via a smartphone, digital ID systems that are accessible on both web and mobile platforms will be considered on-demand compliant.</p>
<p>Consumers will waste no time switching brands whose ID systems they consider to be unavailable or often inaccessible. Tech service providers need to always prioritise solutions that fit the on-demand culture. Digital identification solutions, no matter how complex the backend operations, are no exception.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Digital ID solutions that fall short of the on-demand culture expectations risk losing consumers, who will undoubtedly lay claim to poor customer experience.</p>
 Security and Trust: The Digital ID Surge 
<p>As of the turn of 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/748192/number-of-contactless-transactions-in-the-uk/">an aggregate of 939 million contactless transactions</a> have been made in the United Kingdom. As more people decide to function digitally, there’s a corresponding increased responsibility on the part of public and private stakeholders to ensure that the internet is safe, secure and trustworthy.</p>
 What are digital identity and Digital ID (identification)? 
<p>Digital identity and Digital ID verification present the way out of the digital world’s security maze. These concepts are fast becoming an all-important requisite for smooth operations in the on-demand digital economy — and the digital world.</p>
<p>Digital ID verification systems provide processes to digitally authenticate a person’s identity whenever the need arises. For Digital ID verification systems to work, people need to have individual digital identities.</p>
 The Digital ID Surge 
<p>The United Nations (which the UK is a member of) recognises the need to bring trust back to digital operations. Together with the World Bank’s ID4D initiative, the plan is to provide every person on earth with a legal identity by 2030.</p>
<p>Providing security for consumers through digital ID verification is crucial for all digital service providers who want to stay ahead of the curve. As part of the on-demand culture amongst Britons, businesses that do not provide a robust digital ID framework for their customers are very likely to lose out.</p>
 Nipping the “fraud” bud 
<p>Fraud, money laundering and a swathe of financial crimes are what you get in a world where Digital ID is not taken seriously by both private and public stakeholders.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, according to <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/online-fraud-report/">research findings by Uswitch</a>, was the highest-ranked nation in Europe for money lost by online fraud in 2020. A mind-boggling amount of 376.5 million pounds was lost to e-commerce fraud.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot more to lose to fraud because the threat still exists. For the end-users, especially on digital payment service platforms, the threat of fraud is a big-enough incentive to switch to more reliable and secure solutions.</p>
<p>Digital ID solutions that are accessible, operable and usable by Britons anywhere will surely change the racecourse, favourably.&nbsp; A workable digital ID process should combine national identity documents with company-specific consumer data (biometrics, to facilitate on-demand electronic identification) for every financial transaction.</p>
<p>This effectively prevents fraud and other financial crime cases to create the kind of secure environment that ultimately ensures Britons trust in the digital economy.</p>
 The Government’s place in Digital ID 
<p>The United Kingdom government has not had the best of times where implementing a national digital identity project is concerned. The cost-intensive “Verify” digital identity project has fallen short of its goals — meaning that the UK does not yet have a national standard identity verification system.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the British government is still keenly aware that digital ID systems are the key to a future of financial inclusion and security in the United Kingdom. It is precisely why the Government Digital Service is working on another digital identity project.</p>
<p>Following further amendments to financial regulations, the government’s position — under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">the trust framework</a> — is to make it mandatory for service providers to have effective, robust, flexible and scale identification verification systems. For service providers, nothing should be more important than picking the right identification verification service to work with.</p>
 A user-centric Digital ID system 
<p>Building a hugely secure Digital ID system is important. That said, building one that is not just simple but also requires minimal effort to operate is far more important — because it really is all about the end-user.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the UK, companies need identity verification solutions that excel in: security, compliance and versatility.</p>
 Get in touch with IDnow 
<p>Simple and effective digital identity verification systems are not as straightforward as they sound. These systems require massive data input, immense technological capabilities and strict compliance with the government’s identity regulations.</p>
<p>Even for the most qualified tech service providers, forging a consumer-centric digital ID verification solution that complies with the on-demand culture can be a tough ask.</p>
<p>. . . And that’s where IDnow comes in.</p>
<p>IDnow is proudly in control of one of Europe’s leading identity verification platforms with trusted expertise in regulation markets, financial institutions and a host of other businesses and industries.</p>

<p>Given the many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">hacking and identity theft</a> incidents that have happened in the last few years, all of us are concerned about our online privacy and the safety of our Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is emerging as a solution for these apprehensions as it gives complete control and ownership of data to the individual entities as they can decide what data to share and with&nbsp;whom.</p><p>Beyond this encompassing vision, let’s drill down into the specifics to understand what you can and can’t do with&nbsp;SSI.</p> What You Can Do With&nbsp;SSI? <p>What are the things you can do and the benefits you derive from using SSI? Let’s&nbsp;explore.</p> Protect your Data from Centralized Storage&nbsp;Systems <p>With SSI, you have control over where your information is stored and shared. This means you can choose to move your information from centralized storage owned by companies to an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallet</a> that only you can&nbsp;access.</p> Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>In the currently popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> system, companies like Google and Facebook monetize your data through ads. With SSI, you can monetize your data and even choose which companies you want to share it with for&nbsp;money.</p><p>A possible way for data monetization is through a VC marketplace that is akin to an online eCommerce platform like eBay or Airbnb where buyers and sellers come together to buy/sell&nbsp;data.</p> Safeguard your&nbsp;PII <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">Security</a> is probably the most important benefit you get as you know who has your data and what it is being used for. Unauthorized users can’t access your data and use it for the wrong purposes.</p><p>Also, since your data doesn’t sit in a centralized database, there’s little incentive for a hacker to spend time and resources to steal a single person’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>All these are sure to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.</p> More ROI for Businesses <p>If you’re a small business owner, you can earn more returns from your business because you no longer have to spend resources on protecting customer data and complying with data regulations.</p> What You Can’t Do with&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary technologies that can change the way you think about your data and handle it. But it is not without pitfalls either. Instead of turning a blind eye to these pitfalls, understanding and navigating through them will help you to better leverage the SSI benefits.</p><p>So, what are some of the things you can’t do with&nbsp;SSI?</p> Pass on the Responsibility <p>With SSI, you can no longer pass on the responsibility of protecting your data to large companies. Remember, companies invest millions of dollars each year to protect the data stored in their systems and still get hacked. So, it can be a huge responsibility for&nbsp;you!</p><p>While the architecture of SSI makes it difficult to hack your data, still the responsibility to safeguard it is all yours. This means you will have to know the security policies of the entity using your data and the onus of picking a secure vendor lies completely on your shoulders.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’ve stored your identity details in a digital wallet that’s protected by a public-private key pair. Here, it’s your responsibility to remember the private keys, as no one can recover it for&nbsp;you.</p><p>A possible workaround can be to use a custodial wallet like the one offered by <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/GetCredentials">Affinidi</a>, but then you lose some level of decentralization.</p> Seamless Transfer <p>The SSI space is highly fragmented now with each company developing its applications and possibly even ecosystems. As a user, this translates to a lack of interoperability between different applications or ecosystems. You may have to change the format of data each time you send it to a different user.</p><p>This is undoubtedly inconvenient now, but it could change as the technology matures and eventually leads to the creation of a marketplace where companies can offer their services and you can pick a service provider and send your data for validation and for using the services&nbsp;offered.</p><p>Since the marketplace can have a common format, your data can be interoperable across the applications of companies who participate in this marketplace. Until then, you’ll have to make changes to your data’s&nbsp;format.</p> Cannot Avoid Middlemen <p>The heading can sound counterintuitive. After all, SSI and decentralized identity are all about removing companies, centralized storage, and middlemen, right?</p><p>Well, yes, but you can’t avoid middlemen in all situations. The idea of a marketplace we talked about earlier is a middleman of some&nbsp;sort.</p><p>Likewise, we saw that you can monetize your data if you chose to. Most likely, you’ll need a common marketplace or some other way through which you can inform companies about your willingness to sell your data. This entails a middleman as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So, you can’t avoid middlemen altogether, though their roles can&nbsp;change.</p> Verdict: Should You Go with&nbsp;SSI? <p>Absolutely YES, because the benefits far outweigh the downsides. Also, remember SSI is a relatively new technology and it could take some time for people to jump on its bandwagon.</p><p>Nevertheless, SSI is likely to stay, as is evident from the many proactive steps that the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU</a> and other countries are taking in this direction. It may not be long before other governments follow suit, so SSI is undoubtedly a part of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

 The Coming Storm 
 
<p>On April 28th, 2021 the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en" title="European Data Protection Board announced">European Data Protection Board announced</a> that The Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD) ordered INE (National Institute for Statistics) to suspend the sending of personal data from the Census 2021 to the United States. CNPD has issued a <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/decisoes/deliberacoes/" title="decision">decision</a> addressed to INE for the suspension within 12 hours of any international transfer of personal data to the United States or other third countries without an adequate level of protection in the context of Census 2021 questionnaire.</p>
<p>If this were your organization, would it be able to weather this storm?</p>
 
 The Fair Weather Cloud 
 
<p>Most organizations have been using cloud services for some time. This has been what could be called “fair weather” use. Where the impact of service failures has been limited. This is revealed by various studies that show only a small proportion of business-critical workloads have been moved to cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the COVID pandemic has accelerated Digital Transformation and cloud usage. This is making organizations much more dependent upon their IT services and the impact of failure has become much higher.</p>
<p>What is needed is a “Cloud for all Seasons” which organizations can exploit today’s complex IT environment to obtain the benefits that cloud services can bring in a secure and compliant manner.</p>
<p>The common business risks from the use of cloud services can be summarized as:</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – from individual element failures as well as cyber-attacks such as ransomware and denial of service. 
 Data breaches – loss, leakage, or unauthorized access to the applications or data stored or processed within the cloud service. 
 Compliance- results in failure to comply with obligation imposed by laws or regulations. 
 
<p>These arise because the existing internal security and compliance controls do not take account of cloud use. Furthermore, there is often confusion resulting from the way responsibility is shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Provider) and the cloud tenant.</p>
<p></p>
 Inconsistent Governance 
<p>Many business-critical applications now depend upon multiple services from multiple providers. The service levels must be set by business needs - but mapping multiple SLAs is difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, each cloud service provides their own disparate management capabilities and tools. This imposes an extra management burden for each cloud service.</p>
<p>When IT services are delivered on premises the security and management capabilities are chosen by the organization. For cloud services most of the tools and capabilities are specific to the service.</p>
<p>You may also need additional tools such as SASE (Secure Access Service Edge), CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers) and CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management).</p>
<p>This all leads to a costly and inefficient ad hoc approach to security and management.</p>
<p>Organizations need consistent approach to governance across the delivery models.</p>
 
 Zero Trust Cloud 
 
<p>Can you trust your cloud to protect your data? The Schrems II judgment in July 2020 found that there is a risk because governments are able to override contracts to seize data held in outsourced IT services.</p>
<p>Contracts, Supplementary Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules are not sufficient protection. <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="According to the EDPB">According to the EDPB</a> organizations need to take supplementary technical measures to protect their where it is transferred to a Third Country.</p>
<p>While this judgment applied to personal data – is your <a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5122014519132358461949.pdf" title="business-critical data safe">business-critical data safe</a>?</p>
<p>Organizations need to take a Zero Trust approach to cloud services – never trust always protect your data. Confidential computing provides the technology to help with this.</p>
 
 Cloud for All Seasons 
 
<p>Organizations need their cloud usage to be storm proof. This involves not only how you choose the cloud service but also how you govern all of your IT services – however they are delivered. It also requires adoption of common frameworks as well as transparency on the part of the cloud service providers</p>
<p>For more details on this subject attend our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/cloud-strategy-optimization" title="KCLive Cloud Strategy Optimization">KCLive Cloud Strategy Optimization</a> event on July 7th.</p>
<p>During the live event, we will discuss the future workplace trends such as De-Materialization &amp; Anywhere Computing, Workplace-Consumerization, KyE (Know Your Employee), How to Balance Zero Trust requirements with easy access and more.</p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

					 Decentralized Identity opens the doors for safe travel and tourism 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Learn how Indicio and SITA worked together using privacy-preserving technology to reshape contactless health information sharing.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Proof of testing or vaccination has become central to how we reopen travel to countries, admit visitors, and bring tourism economies back to life. Providing privacy and control for people is the key to establishing public confidence in a system for proving one’s health status.</p>
<p>A digital proof of a Covid negative test or vaccination must be designed to protect individual privacy. It should enable a medical or test center to directly provide that information to an individual—and involve no one else storing or managing their data. It should be tamper proof and incapable of being faked. And it should be easy to download and quick to use.</p>
<p>This is why Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation that provides decentralized identity software solutions, and SITA, the leading global technology provider for the air transport industry, have used open source, privacy-by-design technology to build a solution that allows airports, airlines, and all elements of the tourist economy to use verifiable digital credentials to safely and securely return to life.</p>
<p>How to reopen travel and tourism and preserve privacy<br>Decentralized identity uses distributed ledger technology, cryptography, and a new way to provide an individual with control of their digital information. This means identity credentials that contain health information are issued directly to that person’s digital wallet, without any handoff to or management by third-parties. Trusted organizations can quickly issue millions of credentials without any of the information they contain being collected and stored in a third-party database.</p>
<p>Then, when the person decides they want&nbsp; to share all or just part of the information, such as the specific details of their test status, the authenticity and original source of that information can be definitively proven. This makes the digital credential compliant with health and data privacy law (HIPAA, GDPR).</p>
<p>The advantages of this decentralized identity ecosystem are that it can:</p>
 
 Replace paper cards with fully digitized identity information 
 Increase efficiency by automating many tasks involved in presenting personal&nbsp; health status 
 Ensure consent and control when sharing personal data 
 Allow a user to select which information they want to disclose while obscuring the rest 
 Enhance security through privacy-by-design, user-friendly digital records, and tamper-evident distributed ledger technology 
 Avoid the problem of fraudulent health cards or paper forms from being presented 
 Scale to include millions of participants, including employees, travelers, and residents, with just a few writes to a public ledger and an inexpensive mobile application 
 Speed recovery of reopening venues and countries 
 
<p>Open and manage public spaces<br>Indicio’s identity ecosystem is built using Cardea, a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Based onHyperledger Indy and Aries open source technology, its flexible design means it can be easily adapted and deployed by any company, government, or organization that needs a privacy preserving digital credential for managing access.</p>
<p>Indicio’s implementation of Cardea for SITA and the Government of Aruba features a mobile interface in the form of a mobile app for users and a second mobile app for use by venues to receive and verify credentials from users. Software called mediator agents and enterprise agents allow for scaling and automation of the credential issuing and verification processes. Distributed ledger technology provides cryptographic assurance that the data within any given credential has not been tampered with or altered.</p>
<p>Cardea’s architecture protects privacy and aids compliance by separating issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. Issuers cannot know where credentials were used by those holding them, and verifiers (receivers) of credentials are able to limit the amount of data they receive and retain.</p>
<p>Successful test deployment in Aruba<br>The island of Aruba and global air transport technology provider SITA came to Indicio to create a trusted traveler system that makes it easy for visitors to share their health status privately and securely using their mobile device.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on finding innovative ways to strengthen its tourism industry while minimizing the risk of Covid-19 infection from visitors. Unlike immunity passports, the verifiable digital credential system from Indicio allows visitors to share a trusted proof of their health status. This trust is possible because the traveler has shared their health status and had it verified by a public health agency.</p>
<p>Once a test result is approved, the traveler is issued a second credential by the public health agency to confirm that they have tested negative. This credential contains no medical data whatsoever and is used only to prove the person’s test status. The Happy Traveler Card, as this credential is called in Aruba, is verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that the traveler visits. It is an easy way for even their smallest businesses to ensure the safety and health of their guests.<br></p>
 The Happy Traveler Card in action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine readable governance enabled businesses and venues to trust that tourists had been tested on arrival by Aruba’s health department. Visitors using the digital Aruba Happy Traveler Card could be swiftly and reliably verified with a phone app. This freed both businesses and the government from the burden of mechanically collecting data with the attendant risk of error or fraud.</p>
<p>The Cardea ecosystem enables Aruba to move toward a privacy-first approach to supporting their tourism industry, which in 2019 accounted for 98.3% of Aruba’s GDP and supported 47,000 jobs—99% of all employment on the island.</p>
<p>Build on our experience for your solution<br>The tourism and hospitality identity solution for SITA is highly replicable for use cases in any industry and easy to integrate with existing systems. With a professionally staffed global network for verifiable digital credentials supported by many of the leading companies in this space, Indicio is building the future of identity. Open source and interoperable software means your solution is scalable and&nbsp; sustainable. Our expert team of architects and engineers can create and customize a solution quickly for business, governments, and organizations who need a privacy-first identity solution and they can deploy it in weeks.</p>

The Support Centre for Data Sharing (SCDS) initiative focuses on researching, documenting, and reporting about the data sharing practices, EU legal frameworks, access and distribution technology that are relevant to organisations, and that imply novel models, and legal or technological challenges.




 





<blockquote>“Whilst privacy is paramount, you can’t have a digital economy if everyone is locking&nbsp;their entire digital footprint away”<p></p>Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder Meeco</blockquote>





 




This is one of the many topics touched on the latest Support Centre for Data Sharing interview. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayweyzen/?originalSubdomain=nl">Raymonde Weyzen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estherhuyer/?locale=en_US">Esther Huyer </a>interview Meecos’ CEO &amp; Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> and Chief Commercial Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Jason </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase">Smith</a>.




 




Some of the challenges that come with data sharing are data privacy and data control. However the paradox of data sharing is that it generally means the recipient needs the data in order to fulfil an obligation, such as deliver a service, validate identity, deliver a package or customise an experience. <br><br>So the issues are often not about sharing, but about trust and transparency. Helping customers understand why the data is required and providing evidence that it is being used as intended is a great way to establish trust. Another way to boost trust is to focus on designing services that minimise the amount of data collected whilst maximising the value created.





When designing data sharing services, consider how to minimise collection whilst delivering maximum value. It might be as simple as only holding the data for the maximum time needed to complete the service and then sharing evidence that it has been deleted.






 




In this thought provoking interview Raymonde asks about Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth. Some of the the exciting projects discussed include <a href="https://miks-it.com/">mIKs-it, the safe multimedia app for children</a>, developing a decentralised identity and verifiable credentials wallet and how innovators like <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> are transforming workforce management and <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com/">My Life Capsule</a> are helping their customers be prepared for a family emergency.



Other questions and topics covered include:




 




+ How the idea of Meeco was conceived




 




+ Why is there a need for data sharing?




 




+ What is the data sharing lifecycle at Meeco?




 




+ Examples of use cases at Meeco




 




+ What specific licensing or standards to share data are used at Meeco?




 




+ In order to share data proper;y going forward, do we need more or less regulation?




 




+ Where would you see Meeco and ultimately the digital world in 10 years from now?




 




And finally, the most difficult question we weren’t prepared for “What would be the working title of a movie starring Meeco?” to find the answer to this and more click below to listen or watch the interview.

<p>Google has&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced</a>&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">Critics</a>&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a privacy move so much as a justification for why a user can trust an app with their data. As Google puts it, the new section “will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s not really saying apps shouldn’t collect the data in the first place — which is increasingly Apple’s position, particularly with its new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature.</p>

  What personal data they collect, including users’ names and email addresses, and any information from the device, such as location data, contacts and photos and videos&nbsp;  What they’re using that personal data for — is it for a better user experience or personalized ads, for example?&nbsp;  Any good security and privacy practices they already have in place, such as data encryption or protecting children under Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families">Families policy</a>  Whether the app needs the data it collects to function or whether users have a choice about their data being shared (as they do on iOS apps through Apple’s new ATT)&nbsp;  Whether the app’s safety section is verified by an independent third&nbsp;party  Whether they will service the user’s right to data deletion requests if the user chooses to uninstall the app.&nbsp;  



<p>As we said, Google’s safety section and Apple’s privacy labels are not really a case of comparing apples with apples (pardon the pun). Critics are&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">saying</a>&nbsp;Apple privacy labels focus on the data apps are collecting for tracking purposes and what’s linked to the end user, whereas Google’s safety section is more about an app’s best practices and trustworthiness in collecting and handling a user’s personal data. While the independent verification on the Google labelling doesn’t happen on Apple’s privacy labelling, it is optional, and it also remains to be seen how rigorous it will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, this is all part of Google’s predictable misunderstanding of what safety means to many people. Yes, it’s about security of data, but Google’s repeated ploy to bait-and-switch a privacy concern into a security solution is missing a big aspect – what companies do themselves and how they share our personal data with other parties. No amount of security-only thinking results in a privacy solution in this case. What’s more, Google going on about the evils of data sharing are moot since they are the biggest data hoarder there is.</p>



<p>Like Apple did when it announced the ATT feature, Google is giving developers plenty of time to get used to the idea. The safety section in Google Play store won’t become mandatory for all apps until Q2 of 2022. In fact,&nbsp;this feels like Google is giving its app developer community longer than Apple did from announcement to required implementation. Perhaps that’s an indirect acknowledgement by Google that the data handling practices of its huge app dev community needs more time?</p>



<p>Once the requirements are mandatory, app developers who don’t comply will face sanctions.</p>



<p>Like all the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-will-adtech-face-google-apple-privacy-changes/">privacy changes we’re seeing in the ad tech space</a>&nbsp;lately, consumers will ultimately determine whether this new move from Google goes far enough in protecting their personal data. As iOS apps have seen with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">low opt-in rates for cross-app tracking</a>&nbsp;from Apple’s new ATT, Android apps might be in for a rude shock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, June 23rd 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, announces the launch of AML-compliant video identifications around the clock. Users can now perform non-automated identity verification procedures at any time thanks to the overnight operation.</p>
<p>“With the extended service hours with 24-hour availability, we give our users even more freedom and enable our business customers with tailored support even better accessibility, higher customer satisfaction and of course the possibility to identify more customers per day” says Bettina Pauck, COO of IDnow. “No matter what industry you are in or what your use case is – opening a bank account, foreign exchange trading or player verification, we are here for you.”</p>
<p>The new service offering, which is available in English and German, completes IDnow’s strategy of focusing on the user needs and providing an easy and quick identification – whenever and wherever a customer wants. “For a convenient process that fits into the fast-paced, digital-centric everyday life of users, such a factor is essential,” adds Bettina Pauck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IDnow offers a highly secure and reliable structure – with a diversification to a total of 20 geographically distributed ident center locations. The sites are located in various cities across Germany and Europe and also guarantee a high level of data protection. The highly qualified and multilingual fraud and identification specialists, who can also offer the service in French, Italian and Spanish, are trained on the comprehensive BaFin process, know the data protection regulations as well as the common forgery and fraud possibilities.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

   FastAPI is really fast and SQLAlchemy is really…SQL-y. But what good is a fast and SQL-y application if it isn’t secure? 

 In this post, we’re going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app! 

 First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify
who the user is. We’ll use Okta for this. 

 Next, we’ll want to perform authorization, which controls what the user can do in our app

 Bear Management Service Architecture 

<p>What, you expected TodoMVC?</p>

<p>Our app allows authenticated users to register their own bears and view the bear population at large. It consists of two separate services: (1) a front end through which users authenticate with Okta, and (2) a back end that exposes an extensive API for creating and retrieving bears.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once your new Okta application is created, the Okta CLI will print out its <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> properties:</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create

...

Okta application configuration:
Client Id:     &lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
Issuer:        https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the project’s root directory with the following contents:</p>

   <code>CLIENT_ID=&lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
ISSUER=https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>After creating the <code>.env</code> file in the project root, symlink it into the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> subdirectory so that both the front end and back end projects have access to the same configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>$ ln -s ../.env okta-hosted-login/.env
</code>   

 Start the React Front End 

<p>In the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies and then <code>npm start</code> to fire up the React front end.</p>

<p>Once the app is up and running, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your browser. Click the <code>Login</code> button and enter your Okta credentials when prompted. Successfully signing in should redirect you back to your front end, where you’ll be greeted with your name (courtesy of Okta), a ‘Create a new bear’ form, and a list of bears:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The list will be empty because our back end service isn’t running. Let’s change that now.</p>

 Start the FastAPI Back End 

<p>While the React app runs happily in the background, open a new terminal and <code>cd</code> to the project’s root directory. In the root, create and activate a new virtual environment, and then install dependencies:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Finally, start the FastAPI server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload --reload-dir=app
</code>   

<p>If you reload <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, you should see the list of bears populated with a number of very good bears owned by various members of Example.com, Inc:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and create a few new bears of your own.</p>

<p>Our app is now open for business. In fact, it’s  too open. Every authenticated user can see everyone’s bears — even users who have been banned for trying to create koalas. It’s time to put a stop to this madness.</p>

 ABAC, As Easy as 1-2-3 🕺 

<p>Oso is an <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso">open source</a>
authorization system that we’ll use to secure our app. Oso is flexible enough to support <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/examples.html">any access control pattern your heart desires</a>, but for this example we’ll focus on <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>

<p>ABAC is all about representing fine-grained or dynamic permissions based on who the user is and their relation to the resource they want to access.</p>

 The Bear Necessities 

<p>First, after pressing Ctrl+C to exit FastAPI, we’re going to install the <code>oso</code> and <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> packages:</p>

   <code>pip3 install oso sqlalchemy-oso
</code>   

<p>Once pip finishes pipping, open up <code>app/main.py</code> using your favorite text editor and make the changes that you see below. The following is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">Git diff</a> of the change — if you’re following along, add the lines that start with a single <code>+</code> symbol to your local copy of <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Next, create an empty Oso policy file in the <code>app</code> directory:</p>

   <code>touch app/policy.polar
</code>   

<p>This is where we are going to write all of our authorization logic
using Oso’s declarative policy language called Polar.</p>

<p>Load the new policy file into our Oso instance in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Before we start filling that policy file with authorization rules, we first need to register the application data types that we’re going to use in our authorization policy with Oso. Registering the application types allows us to reference them in our Polar policy as <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/polar/polar-syntax.html#specialization">specializers</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to use the <code>register_models()</code> helper from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library to register our SQLAlchemy models with Oso in bulk. <code>register_models()</code>
registers all descendants of a SQLAlchemy base class with Oso; otherwise, we would have to call <code>oso.register_class()</code> for each individual class that we wanted to register:</p>

<p>In addition, let’s register the <code>BearBase</code> Pydantic model that’s used in the <code>create()</code> handler.

<p>If you save <code>app/main.py</code> and then try to create a new bear, the <code>POST</code> request will return a <code>403 Forbidden</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Oso is deny-by-default, and we currently have an empty policy file. In the next section, we’ll write our first authorization rule to allow real bear lovers to create real bears.</p>

 Add Your First <code>allow()</code> Rule 

<p>For our first foray into writing a policy, we’re going to use Polar to add a rule that prevents banned users from creating new bears.</p>

<p>Open up <code>app/policy.polar</code> and add the following rule:</p>

 <code>allow(user: User, "create", _bear: BearBase) if
    not user.is_banned;
</code> 

<p>The rule works by matching the inputs provided by the application:</p>

 
   <code>user</code> - an instance of the <code>User</code> class. 
   The action is the string literal <code>"create"</code>. 
   <code>_bear</code> - an instance of the <code>BearBase</code> class. 
 

<p>And then checking that the provided user’s <code>is_banned</code> field is false.
We don’t yet need to check anything further about the <code>bear</code> resource,
so we prefix it with an underscore to indicate that it won’t be referenced in the body of the rule.</p>

<p>NOTE: To learn more about Polar syntax, head on over to <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/learn/policies.html">the Writing Policies guide</a> in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Save the file, flip back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should once again be able to create new bears (assuming you haven’t set your own user’s <code>is_banned</code> property to <code>True</code>). All law-abiding bear enthusiasts have had their access restored, and the koala lovers are left out in the cold. (Does it get cold in Australia? We’ll investigate in a future blog.)</p>

 Deal with List Endpoints 

<p><code>oso.is_allowed()</code> worked perfectly for securing the <code>create()</code> endpoint, but it’s not the best tool for the job when it comes to securing <code>index()</code>. The difference is that <code>create()</code> operates over a single record, while <code>index()</code> operates over a potentially very large collection. If performance weren’t an issue, we could load the collection from the database and iterate over it,
calling <code>oso.is_allowed()</code> on every record to filter out unauthorized entries. However, we all know that Zoomers lose interest and click away from your website if it takes longer than a few Planck time units to load, so we need a better solution.</p>

<p>And now, presenting… a better solution. Data filtering! The cure to all of life’s performance issues.</p>

<p>The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library is built on top of Oso’s data filtering feature. In a nutshell, the logic engine at the core of the Oso library can turn your authorization policy into a set of constraints similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clauses used to filter records when querying a relational database. The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library then applies those constraints directly to your app’s SQLAlchemy queries. In this way, only authorized records are loaded from the database in an efficient operation instead of loading all records and then iterating over the collection to determine the authorized subset.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s wire up our app so that we can efficiently filter some bears.</p>

<p>First, we need to modify <code>app/main.py</code> to import <code>authorized_sessionmaker()</code> from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>
library:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644
--- a/app/main.py
+++ b/app/main.py
@@ -9 +9 @@ from oso import Oso
-from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
+from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, authorized_sessionmaker
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll create a new <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/">FastAPI dependable</a> that mirrors our existing <code>get_db()</code> function but yields an Oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/api/sqlalchemy.html#sqlalchemy_oso.session.AuthorizedSession">AuthorizedSession</a> instead of a regular SQLAlchemy <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session">Session</a>. To do this, add the following code below the <code>get_db()</code> function in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and… no bears. They’re still happily growling away in the database, but we haven’t added any Oso rules permitting access. Let’s change that.</p>

 Flesh Out Your Authorization Policy 

<p>To start off, let’s add a rule to <code>app/policy.polar</code> that permits all users to list all bears:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
</code> 

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should see every bear again. But something else is missing. The <code>Owner</code> column is empty! When we serialize bear records in the back end, we include the email address for each bear’s owner — a piece of data that comes from our SQLAlchemy-backed <code>User</code> model. Access to <code>User</code> data is now protected by Oso because <code>User</code> is a subclass of the <code>Base</code> SQLAlchemy class we registered via <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <code>register_models()</code> method. Let’s add one more blanket <code>allow()</code> rule, this time permitting users to view user data at the <code>index()</code> endpoint:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: User);
</code> 

<p>Do the save-and-reload dance, and the <code>Owner</code> column should once again be populated.</p>

<p>Next, let’s add some constraints to our <code>"index"</code> rule for bears so we can see Data Filtering in Action (coming soon from Manning, probably).</p>

<p>Perhaps users should only be allowed to see their own bears:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar
index ff90780..0a1a77d 100644
--- a/app/policy.polar
+++ b/app/policy.polar

-allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
+allow(user: User, "index", bear: Bear) if
+    bear.owner = user;
</code>   

<p>Save, reload, and confirm you can no longer see anyone else’s bears. If you want to see some bears, you’ll need to create them for yourself.</p>

<p>The index view is now private, but it feels wrong to prevent our fellow bear enthusiasts from viewing polar bears, the sweetest and most mild-mannered of all bears. To right that wrong, we can register the <code>Species</code> enum as a constant so that we can reference it in our policy:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index 1fa9573..6abb06d 100644

</code>   

<p>Then, update said policy:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar

</code>   

<p>While we’re at it, who doesn’t like pandas or bears named “Smokey”:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar

<p>Well, that’s about all we can bear (sorry) for one blog. Let’s take stock and wrap up.</p>

 Learn More About Oso, FastAPI, and Python 

<p>In this post, we started out with a very fast and SQL-y application built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. We created and configured a new Okta application to handle identity management and authentication for our app. Then we used Oso to add efficient, fine-grained authorization to our back end API.</p>

<p>The full example is available on <a href="https://github.com/osohq/fastapi-sqlalchemy-okta-oso-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re up for it, here are a couple exercises to try:</p>

 
   Add roles to the app using <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/getting-started/roles/builtin_roles.html">built-in roles</a> feature.
Perhaps every bear lives in a sanctuary, and a user can have a particular
role in each sanctuary, e.g., “Visitor”, “Friend”, or “Shepherd”. 
   Add a “Delete” button next to every bear in the list, and wire up each button to send
a DELETE request to the back end. Secure your new <code>delete()</code> handler with
Oso, and add a rule to the policy that only allows users to delete their own
bears. 
   Join <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com">our slack</a> and let us know what your favorite bear is and why
it’s the polar bear. 
   Learn more about other use cases of Oso, other languages it supports,
and more in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.

Immutable, Trustless And Immune To Fraud: The Blockchain Expansion Of Democratic Republicanism<p>Introduction: The Great Fraud: Blockchain’s Rectification</p>Can We Trust Traditional Paradigms Of Ballot Counting For Fair And Equitable Elections Without Blockchain?<p>It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry; ballots don’t make results, the counters do. The last three elections within the United States have succumbed to political parties accusing one another of voter fraud, through substantiated and unsubstantiated claims; how can we rectify such a broken paradigm that threatens republicanism, blockchain is the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Blockchain technology is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries which include supply-chains, escrow, invoices, healthcare, crowdfunding and cloud storages etc. and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the demise of voter fraud. Blockchain in its purest of forms and most simplistic of terms is a digital ledger that is peer-to-peer that mitigates the avaristic intent of centralized entities. Encryption makes these records incorruptible and easy to verify. Voters can utilize blockchain and can be assured that their vote will not be tampered with and simultaneously, their vote stays anonymous; this is the true ethos and incorruptible paradigm of voting that should become the foundational bedrock of republicanism. This dynamic change in transparency surrounding voting is incumbent for democracy to expand and flourish into the 21st century, especially with ongoing investigations surrounding voter-fraud, not just in the United States, but throughout the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Aergo’s Understanding And Desire To Decimate Voter Fraud: The Pikkle Construction</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Voting Mechanism On The Aergo Platform: Enhancing Global Participation Of Transparent Blockchain Voting<p>Pikkle is the first of its kind; built on the Aergo platform by Blocko, Aergo’s technology partner and utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, Pikkle aims to resolve a variety of dilemma’s that plague traditional voting paradigms and mechanisms. Pikkle resolves issues such as cost inefficiencies, resolving voter processes that creates substantial costs that coincide with targeting voters, identity verification, ballot counts and check lists. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which, throughout the world, many voters have lost confidence in voting mechanisms because of the continuous onslaught and investigations of voter fraud. Pikkle ensures that trust is consolidated back into the consciousness of the populace; unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest. We saw this occur consistently among some of the most prominent social media platforms during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections within the United States. With voter fraud corrupting democracy, one must ask, are we in a democracy, or a democracy masked by corruptible despotism; it is not power that corrupts, but it is magnetic to the corruptible and Pikkle aims to change this&nbsp;notion.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. Centralized entities have attempted to garner similar approaches, but since the public trust in these entities has waned over the last fifteen years, it is evident that an app like Pikkle can replace traditional voting mechanisms. Through the utilization of blockchain technology, stake-holders, companies, governmental organizations, criminal enterprises and political parties can no-longer shake the foundational bedrock of pure democracy, and Pikkle emphasizes and embodies such a notion. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association: Blocko And Aergo: Unified Under The Consciousness Of Mending Public Voter&nbsp;Trust</p>Mending Public Trust Through Blockchain Voting Platforms: The Pikkle&nbsp;Paradigm<p>On April 23rd, The Korean Broadcasters Association, Blocko and Aergo signed an MOU to ensure the practical application and construction of a blockchain based audience participation application and voting system. The Korean Broadcasters Association is an organization that is almost half a century old with an aim to unify South Korea through domestic terrestrial broadcasts. The Korean Broadcasters Association has worked with the largest broadcasting stations in all of South Korea which include joint ventures when counting exit polls alongside the KBS, MBC and SBS. Through offering various cooperation to provide the 40 members with high quality and diverse broadcasting services, the KBA is continuously trying its best. The KBA intends on utilizing Pikkle for a variety of services which include, but are not limited to, media content and voting systems to select winners for Korea Broadcasting Prizes and the Seoul International Drama Awards on the Aergo platform. Blocko also plays a crucial role in the development and expansion of Pikkle as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Blocko is Aergo’s main technology partner that was established in 2014 and has worked with some of the largest institutions in all of South Korea which include the Bank of Korea, Financial Security Agency, Shinhan Financial Group, Hyundai Motor Group and many more. It is incumbent to reference that Blocko is South Korea’s largest blockchain infrastructure provider that has built blockchain based services for financial, political and public institutions throughout the nation. Blocko has commercialized enterprise blockchain platforms based off of Aergo, an open-sourced hybrid blockchain protocol powered by the native cryptocurrency AERGO optimized for hybrid deployments for public and private institutions.</p><p>Conclusion: Mending Democracy: The Pikkle Mission Confirmed</p>Pikkle Aims To Integrate With Broadcasting Systems And Festivals By Q3 Of This Year And Intends To Launch NFT’s Next&nbsp;Year<p>It is evident that the public trust of traditional voting mechanisms has all but collapsed over the last decade. Aergo comprehended this notion and seeks to rectify public trust themselves through the utilization of Pikkle on a consolidated frontier between Aergo, Blocko and the Korean Broadcasters Association. Pikkle is the first of its kind surrounding blockchain voting, enabling immutable and incorruptible data to be stored on the blockchain which has the ability to rectify our globally broken electoral system. Blockchain technology can transform democracy, and Pikkle can perpetuate its transcendence.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digitized-voting-democratized-the-aergo-blockchain-voting-paradigm-df70da14e2d">Digitized Voting Democratized: The Aergo Blockchain Voting Paradigm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#165 — Everything you need to know about new FTC chief Lina&nbsp;Khan <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-164-what-apples-missing-about-digital-identity-1d587693e285">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool  What people are&nbsp;saying  What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech  Everything Lina Khan + Big&nbsp;Tech  What people think about Big Tech platforms  Chart of the&nbsp;week  BONUS: Every platform is Clubhouse now  Stuff happens   1. The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool Photo: Lexey Swall / linamkhan.com<p>Lina Khan shot to unlikely national recognition after the publication of her seminal work while still at Yale, <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>. An overnight sensation, the paper helped reframe decades of consensus around antitrust frameworks — which at the time were formulated around pricing. Instead, we should focus on structural power, Lina&nbsp;argued.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">the NYTimes</a> back in&nbsp;2018:</p><blockquote>Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, [Lina Khan] presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: “The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon’s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.”</blockquote><p>Lina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">at the&nbsp;time</a>:</p><blockquote>“As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,” she said. “But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.”</blockquote><p>Thanks to Lina’s paper and her ability to bring newfound attention to an old challenge, new frameworks and vocabularies have been bubbling below the surface over the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>In that time, our stance on Big Tech has rapidly shifted. From being darlings of capitalism and innovation, we now view the corporate titans that control our digital world with a heightened sense of skepticism.</p><p>Our political leaders have taken the hint. The issue of monopoly power is, today, a bipartisan issue — though sometimes for different reasons.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Now, 32, Lina Khan is the new chair of the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-will-chair-federal-trade-commission-c7ea8e06-25de-4d8d-b188-2297169cd3fa.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Khan, an antitrust expert well-known for her ideas for applying competition law to the tech industry, is sure to spook tech platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>Khan, 32 years old, is a hero to critics of tech who want to see the government act more aggressively against what they see as anti-competitive behavior from companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57501579">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Worryingly for Big Tech too, a number of bipartisan bills have also been put forward in Congress to rein in the power of Big Tech. That there are Democrats and Republicans who support antitrust action makes her position even more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>Ms Khan’s appointment is the clearest sign yet that President Biden means business when it comes to clipping the wings of companies like Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><p>Wired in a piece titled, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-finally-moving-at-speed-of-tech/">The US Government Is Finally Moving at the Speed of&nbsp;Tech</a>:</p><blockquote>The result is that we find ourselves living in a world that looks very different from the one we were living in just a few years ago. New antitrust cases against tech giants are popping up left and right, keeping the issue firmly in the public consciousness. The companies are devoting unprecedented sums toward lobbying, advocacy, and advertising to try to avert a crackdown. And in the sharpest break with the past, Congress and the White House are taking concrete steps to restructure markets that have been left to their own devices for two and a half&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s all so much, so fast, that it’s hard to keep track of the various subplots. The introduction of the five House antitrust bills and the elevation of Khan to FTC chair, for example, look like two separate stories. But they’re really two parts of the same story: Khan was herself the key investigator behind the House antitrust subcommittee’s investigation of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, begun in 2019. The bills introduced last week are the fruits of that investigation. (While the time between the start of the investigation and the release of legislative proposals has felt like an eternity to those of us who follow this closely, it wouldn’t be bad for a Silicon Valley product launch. It took Amazon three years to bring the Kindle to&nbsp;market.)</blockquote><p>Matt Stoller, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-antitrust-revolution-has-found">The Antitrust Revolution Has Found Its&nbsp;Leader</a>:</p><blockquote>Khan is something rare in progressive politics, someone with academic credentials and mastery over a dense technical subject, but also connected with a broad-based populist social movement that crosses partisan lines. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken to in business, Republicans as well as Democrats, who talk in reverential tones about Khan. It’s not just that she is an important thinker, it’s that she *understands* what they are going through, the coercive power they are up against. And that’s because she got her start understanding the economy not in a classroom or at a law firm, but as a business journalist, listening to business people and workers facing monopolists.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>To call this appointment remarkable understates the point. That Khan is on the commission, with Republican votes, is surprising enough, but for her to be Chair is downright shocking. It’s too soon to know what Khan is going to do in her new role, but her appointment is already sending shock waves in the enforcement community globally. Antitrust policy is run by a small yet international community of lawyers and economists who know each other. In every country, some of them are cheering this move, while others are horrified. But they all know it matters, because as goes the U.S. on antitrust, so goes&nbsp;Europe.</blockquote> 3. What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech <p>For one, they’re on high alert. Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/big-tech-s-uneasy-future">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>And on Tuesday, tech stocks barely flinched at the news. But Khan’s arrival is likely to put Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft on the defensive in a way the past few years of heated anti-tech rhetoric have&nbsp;not.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s because Khan’s appointment to lead the agency, one of two antitrust enforcers in the U.S. along with the Justice Department, poses perhaps the most serious threat yet. Although she is just one person on a five-member commission, as chair she will set the enforcement and policy priorities for the agency. That could very well mean an antitrust case against Amazon, given her law school paper outlining the antitrust problems with the online retailer. A Khan-led FTC also is likely to bring enforcement actions to rein in not just the technology sector, but corporate America writ&nbsp;large.</blockquote><p>We’ll be watching to see how Lina Khan intends to leverage her new position of power. But it’s worth noting that antitrust is about a lot more than just trust busting — say, forcing Facebook to break up Instagram and WhatsApp. As Greg has mentioned in the past, the cat’s out of the&nbsp;bag.</p><p>Instead, we could see new rules around key issues such as interoperability and portability — <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/privacy/061721-tech-regulatory-overhaul-series-the-excess-of-access/">including this recently introduced bill</a> (via&nbsp;/m):</p><blockquote>This post assesses H.R. 3849, the “Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act of 2021” introduced by Representatives Scanlon (D-PA) and Owens (R-UT). The bill would impose sweeping requirements on specific covered platforms to build new technical interfaces to transfer data to competitors and potential competitors and to enable interoperability between their services.</blockquote><p>Here’s Mitja on the subject, comparing it to when telco companies finally allowed phone number portability:</p><blockquote>This bill might end Facebook’s monopoly, but one of the interesting and important things to note is interoperability which enables users to switch from one social network to&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In this case, “switch” could be defined similarly to when the UsSs government forced wireless companies to let you take your phone number with you when you switch carriers — a similar move may be called on social networks to let you take your identity and social content and transfer it elsewhere.</blockquote><p>With Lina, anything’s on the table. But these are early days and she still has her work cut out for her, as WIRED reminds&nbsp;us:</p><blockquote>None of this is to say that the movement to break up Big Tech, or rein it in, or whichever bumper sticker you prefer, has achieved victory. The legislative agenda in particular remains a long shot until proven otherwise. While it’s noteworthy that the bills have bipartisan support within the House antitrust subcommittee, they might not have enough to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, even in altered form. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has already come out in opposition, and even those Senate Republicans who might be sympathetic have yet to publicly support the agenda. (Even if the bills become law, there’s no guarantee they will achieve the desired results.) Ted Cruz, who appears to revel in browbeating social media executives as much as anyone, voted against Khan’s confirmation. So did Mike Lee, the ranking Republican member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee.</blockquote><blockquote>But even if legislation stalls, Khan’s overwhelming confirmation — she received support from 21 Republican senators — means change is coming to the FTC. Several experts have argued that the agency has enormous, mostly untapped power to structure markets. Two of those experts now make up two-thirds of the commission’s Democratic majority: Khan and her former boss, Rohit Chopra, who last year published an article arguing for the agency to use its authority to issue rules about unfair competition, rather than relying exclusively on litigation.

 Encoding Trust that Travels with Data — A New Product Introduction Case Study Powered by Solutions Design with Transmute  This case study describes supply chain innovation work completed by <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/">GS1 US</a>, and <a href="https://gs1ca.org/">GS1 Canada</a> and <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a> during the second half of&nbsp;2021. <p>About <a href="http://www.gs1.org">GS1</a>: GS1 is a neutral, not-for-profit organisation that develops and maintains the most widely used global standards for efficient business communication. GS1 is best known for the barcode, named by the BBC as one of “the 50 things that made the world economy”. GS1 standards improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains across physical and digital channels in 25 sectors. GS1’s scale and reach — local Member Organisations in 115 countries, 2 million user companies and 6 billion transactions every day — help ensure that GS1 standards create a common language that supports systems and processes across the globe. Find out more at <a href="http://www.gs1.org">www.gs1.org</a></p><p>About <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>: Transmute is a US-based technology company that uses next generation identity and credentialing technologies to provide comprehensive solution design and software to define, digitize, and share verifiable data at scale. Transmute partners with innovative enterprises and governments to build digital trust ecosystems where this data can be securely exchanged across diverse stakeholders and technology vendors. Transmute specializes in trusted information about global supply chain products, actors, and transactions.</p> Project Overview <p>In 2021, GS1 and Transmute worked together to test the business and technical feasibility of combining <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 standards</a> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> for product-related claims.There was mutual interest in moving from theory to practice to illustrate the tangible value of leveraging Verifiable Credentials for creating trust that travels with&nbsp;data.</p><p>This project was guided by these key questions:</p>  How can GS1 create trust that travels with data by issuing authoritative information about companies and products?  How might <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a>, Verifiable Credential, and Decentralized Identifier standards be leveraged together to create business value related to product&nbsp;claims?  <p>Through our collaboration we discovered particular value in the area of new product introduction — or the process of procuring new products as a retailer. As consumers we rarely think about how the things we buy arrived on the physical (or virtual) shelf. Behind the scenes it can take months for retailers and brands to establish relationships, validate products, complete distribution, and ensure quality before making those goods available to consumers. We found multiple opportunities to improve the speed and security of these processes by leveraging Verifiable Credentials in conjunction with GS1 standards and identifiers.</p> Solutions Design Process: GS1 + Transmute Collaboration <p>Our companies worked through a step-wise approach to move from broad theory to a targeted application of our combined technologies for new product introduction.</p><p>Collaborative working sessions including GS1 experts and the Transmute team were conducted over several months to identify the most feasible and impactful possibilities. We drew from the international standards, supply chain, and technical expertise of GS1 team members. Transmute combined this information with our decentralized technologies expertise to propose specific credentials, workflows, and businesses narratives to address the product claims focus. These solutions are technically supported by the Transmute platform and open source libraries.</p><p>Our group went through multiple iterations as a part of early solution design work. This stage includes detailed business narratives for a variety of supply chain use cases, workflow mapping, brand interviews, sample credentials, and early prototypes, culminating in a Solution Design Report. This phase of work ultimately drove the narrowed focus to the new product introduction use case as the highest value opportunity for illustration of immediate industry&nbsp;value.</p><p>Next we built a Proof-of-Concept demonstration — including an interactive prototype and technical libraries — to show how these credentials can be issued, exchanged and verified seamlessly across brands. You can see the prototype in action&nbsp;here:</p> New Product Introduction Description <p>The following written description provides further detail about the business story portrayed in the video above. If you already watched the video you can also jump to the subsequent section.</p><p>Brand Healthy Tots wants to sell its natural baby food products for the first time with retailer Sell Anything &amp; Everything (SA&amp;E). SA&amp;E will start by selling the Healthy Tots product in its online store, with the future possibility of also selling it in brick and mortar locations.</p><p>Typically new product onboarding is a lengthy process, requiring submission of PDF documentation and requesting data from a variety of parties, often leading to duplicated costs and effort. These documents and sites are also very easy to fake, giving false confidence in product&nbsp;claims.</p><p>Healthy Tots provides SA&amp;E with verifiable evidence of its GLN and the product GTINs, and the process kicks off instantly. SA&amp;E uses the <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> resolver to immediately discover locations of all related product information. SA&amp;E’s system can then request relevant information from the associated locations, providing evidence where needed that it is authorized to do so. For example, it is able to request third party issued organic certification, allergen information, and product&nbsp;images.</p><p>SA&amp;E receives this information in the form of Verifiable Credentials signed by the original issuing parties, and is able to confidently populate the new product listing. SA&amp;E can do so automatically because the issuer of the information can be identified and confirmed, allowing data they issue to be passed through relatively unknown or untrusted parties like Healthy Tots systems. The SA&amp;E system can even automatically check that the issuing parties possess appropriate accreditations and/or GLNs to make sure such statements about the product are authoritative. This includes going all the way back to GS1 Global as a root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Healthy Tots can fill in any additional product details that SA&amp;E needs, and the product can be listed for sale within minutes. Relevant pieces of verifiable information such as certified organic and allergen information can also be passed through to the consumer’s view, providing deeper confidence in the legitimacy of the product and associated accreditations.</p> Testing Business&nbsp;Benefits <p>This novel approach to sharing product data can lead to the following benefits:</p>  Reduced administrative burden and faster timeline from engagement to product on&nbsp;shelves.  Automation for the retailer, working with hundreds or even thousands of vendors and tens of thousands of products. This protects brand reputation and allows elevation to human review when risk is detected.  Unambiguous documentation requirements that meet regulatory needs and further speed up processes.  More broadly, an encoded process for establishing trust in data that persists across systems, data pools, and unknown intermediaries.  <p>One of the next steps for this work is deeper testing of these benefits to measure cost savings, efficiency gains and strategic insight.</p> Building Trusted Ecosystems with&nbsp;GS1 <p>The demo scenario is underpinned by GS1 as a root of trust in the network — continuing a rich history for GS1 in this role. GS1 licenses and identifiers are and will continue to be at the foundation of trusting products and companies. Combining current practices with verifiable credential, decentralized identifier, and <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> standards disambiguating products builds business reputation for just-in-time engagement while keeping information up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>We believe that institutions like GS1 are critical in paving the foundations for trusted data to move across ecosystems in the future. Ultimately, trust has to flow from one or more sources whose reputation allows businesses to act with confidence. The advantage of the approach taken in this POC is that the distance between verifiers and root-of-trust organizations can be much greater without losing confidence in the information being presented. As long as the chain of trust retains integrity, the possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p> Next Steps <p>This new product introduction demonstration is now being used to test, validate, break, and refine assumptions about how the involved standards and technologies can best be leveraged to generate value for individual businesses and the broader ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“GS1 is moving forward with work to extend existing standards in order to better support the evolving needs of our member companies and create a consistent, common path forward for the scale of digital credentials.” — Melanie Nuce, Senior Vice President, Innovation and Partnerships, GS1&nbsp;US</blockquote><blockquote>“Verifiable Credentials are an exciting opportunity for GS1 to extend its identification system, improve data quality, and secure the supply chain in ways never before possible.” — Kevin Dean, Special Projects Consultant, GS1&nbsp;Canada</blockquote><p>Transmute is working with customers to continue designing, building, and growing digital trust ecosystems — from Solution Design work to bringing businesses onto the Transmute Platform to experience issuance, exchange, and verification of Verifiable Credentials integrated with existing business infrastructure.

A recent survey on the <a href="https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/it/security/the-psychology-of-passwords-neglect-is-helping-hac/download" title="Psychology of Passwords">Psychology of Passwords</a> found that 59% of the respondents use the same password repeatedly, at home and in the office. The main reason behind this dangerous trend is the fear of forgetting the login information.</p>
<p>It is therefore time for businesses to evolve their approach to identity proofing to mitigate the risks of an increasingly remote workforce. As the corporate boundaries disintegrate, organizations require a new defensive playbook to address emerging business risk and remain secure.</p>
 A Zero-Trust approach to risk mitigation 
<p>When the concept of Zero-Trust was first conceived, it was about zero trust networks. However, today and in the future, corporate users and partners are accessing data through a plethora of networks – corporate, private, mobile. Hence, it is not efficient to discuss about securing access networks – it is almost impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The security perimeter of corporate assets had to shift to another frontline. The evolution of Zero-Trust is about securing the access points to apps and data. Since everyone is literally an outsider in cloud environments, there is a need to “never trust, always verify” the identity of the individual or the device requesting access to data and apps.</p>
<p>While Zero-Trust is not a single technology solution, it is the paradigm that can assist businesses support securely requirements for accessing a “constellation” of apps and data from everywhere. By validating the identity of the individual or device at every access point, organizations can mitigate the threats introduced by the proliferation of multi-cloud and hybrid computing environments and secure their digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
 Access management trends towards a Zero-Trust future 
<p>As technology evolves, organizations can evolve their access security to meet the increasing demands of cloud computing and pave their path towards a Zero-Trust culture. Businesses need to be aware of the various emerging trends on access management, evaluate them and tailor them to their business needs.</p>
<p>According to many security experts, the following trends will shape the access management and security ecosystem:</p>
 
 Identity-first security - Now that organizations operate fully (or mostly) remote, this trend has become vital to address. The result of these technical and culture shifts is that “identity first security” now represents the way all information workers will function, regardless of whether they are remote or at their office. 
 Managing machine identities as a critical security capability - As digital transformation progresses, organizations are experiencing increased numbers of non-human entities – containers, apps, services, mobile devices – IoT devices. Managing machine identities has become a vital part of the security strategy. As the number of devices increases, establishing an enterprise-wide strategy for managing machine identities, certificates and secrets will enable the organization to better secure digital transformation. 
 
<p>Shared security model in the cloud will be the defining factor for managing access requests. The old security model of “inside means trusted” and “outside means untrusted” has been broken since most digital assets and devices are outside the enterprise, as are most identities. The shared security model provides a more integrated, scalable, flexible and reliable approach to digital asset access control than traditional security perimeter controls.</p>
<p>Organizations are already opting for these integrated, cloud agnostic access security platforms which embed strong access management controls, such as verification and authentication of users for privileged account access via single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). These features add a multitude of risk mitigation benefits and create sources for contextual adaptive access controls.</p>
<p>Thales SafeNet Trusted Access platform can help business today reach a Zero-Trust access management future. SafeNet Trusted Access has been recognized by <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80547/thales-safenet-trusted-access-platform/">KuppingerCole</a> as “a market leading Enterprise Authentication and access management solution. It offers a variety of hard and soft token solutions as well as FIDO compliant authenticators. It is highly scalable and built for environments that require the highest security levels.”</p>
<p>The report highlights, as strong points and benefits of SafeNet Trusted Access, the compatibility with FIDO 2.0 protocol, a good out-of-the-box selection of connectors for a variety of apps, integrations with most IAM and IDaaS products, strong anti-tampering mechanisms, and machine learning risk detection models.</p>
