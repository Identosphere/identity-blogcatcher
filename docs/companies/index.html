 TL;DR 



<p>On June 1, UAGro Wallet goes live on iOS and Android, giving 500 K+ students and alumni instant, tamper-proof diplomas via blockchain. Extrimian’s SSI suite—Digital Credential Wallet, ID Connect API, and Academy—powers this leap, cutting verification time by 99.9%, eliminating fraud, and meeting GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD requirements.</p>



 



 UAGro Wallet &amp; Extrimian: A New Era in University Credential Security 



<p>In 2024, universities worldwide lost over $600 million to fake diplomas, and manual verification still takes 5–14 days per record. On June 1, the Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero (UAGro) breaks this cycle with UAGro Wallet, a mobile app (iOS/Android) delivering verifiable credentials to 500 000 + students and alumni. Powered by Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) from Extrimian, this project seals document fraud and transforms how diplomas, transcripts, and certificates are issued, stored, and verified.</p>



<p></p>



 1. The Credential Crisis in Higher Ed 



 
 Fraud Costs Soar: $600 M+ lost yearly to forged diplomas and transcripts (<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/company-and-culture/the-8-things-you-should-know-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-education-sector-and-how-to-prevent-them/" title="">Check Point 2024</a>). 



 Slow Manual Checks: Average 7 days per verification vs. 2 minutes with SSI. 



 Security Gaps: Under 50 % MFA adoption in universities (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



<p>These delays frustrate applicants and employers, drain staff hours (120 h→8 h monthly), and expose institutions to data-theft and compliance fines.</p>



<p></p>



 2. How SSI &amp; Blockchain Fix Verification 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) hands control back to students. Instead of siloed servers, diplomas live in a Digital Credential Wallet—secure, private, and always available offline. Key benefits:</p>



 
 Cryptographic Security: Each credential is signed on a blockchain, making tampering impossible. 



 Instant Trust: Employers verify in seconds without calls or faxes. 



 Selective Privacy: Share only what’s needed (e.g., “Bachelor’s Degree, 2025” without grades). 



 Built-in Compliance: GDPR, FERPA, LGPD covered by design.

  Thales Reinforces Commitment to Malaysia at LIMA 2025 <br>
with New Leadership and Contracts Awarded
prezly

Thu, 05/22/2025 - 11:11


             
 As a strategic partner in helping Malaysia achieve air sovereignty, Thales has been awarded the role to supply two additional Ground Master 400 Alpha (GM400α) radars by the Ministry of Defence for the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), following the previous contract for the first radar at the end of 2023.  
 Thales will enhance tactical communications for land forces and reinforce its radio communications capabilities through the signing of a strategic MoU with Malaysian defence partner, ADS, to collaborate on radio projects. 
 Thales has also been selected to deploy the AW139 flight simulator to the Royal Malaysian Police with local partner Novatis Resources through the LOA signed in the presence of Thales.  
 To drive the Thales business forward, Florian Riou has been appointed Country Director for Thales in Malaysia, effective 1 July 2025.

<p>On the occasion of the LIMA 2025 exhibition in Langkawi, Thales’ commitment to Malaysian defence is once again recognised by the Malaysian Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces. With a steady economic growth outlook, the Malaysian government is keen to advance the country’s military modernisation and Thales remains at the forefront of this, with the Memorandum of Understanding &amp; Letter of Award received for equipment ranging from radars to radios. </p>
<p>I. Two additional GM400α long-range radars for superior situational air awareness </p>
<p>To strengthen the air surveillance and air defence capabilities of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), Thales will supply two additional long-range air surveillance GM400α radars, following the ceremony held on Day 3 of LIMA 2025, in presence of Francois-Xavier Boutes, Country Director of Thales Malaysia and YBhg Datuk Lokman Hakim bin Ali, Secretary General from the Ministry of Defence, and witnessed by YB Dato’ Seri Mohamed Khaled bin Nordin, Minister of Defence. The award of these two additional radars underscores the trust held by the RMAF in Thales’ radar technology, following the first GM400α contract signed at the end of 2023. Thanks to its high mobility, high availability, easy upgradeability and seamless integration, the GM400α offers armed forces with a valuable tool to gain tactical advantage, detecting all types of threats early and providing precious minutes for decision-making and action (515km range). Today more than 270 Ground Master field-proven family air surveillance radars have been sold worldwide. </p>
<p>In Malaysia, Thales will partner Weststar Group once again to deploy the radars in line with the operational requirements of the RMAF. Thales will also engage in the Transfer of Knowledge and Train-the-Trainer courses delivered under the Industrial Collaboration Programme (ICP), while strengthening its installed base in Malaysia for long-range surveillance radars. By building local expertise, Thales will enhance the efficiency of radar maintenance, enhance the autonomy of the RMAF and ensure timely on-ground maintenance support close to the end-users. Thales’ radar expertise in Malaysia runs deep, as the country was also the launch customer for the precursor GM400 radar in 2009. </p>
<p>II. Enhancing tactical and radio communications for Malaysia</p>
<p>To further deepen its expertise in radio and tactical communications, Thales has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with partner ADS Sdn. Bhd. Signed on Day 2 of LIMA between Brig Gen Dato’ Abdul Hadi bin Abdul Razak (R), ADS and Nicolas Bouverot, VP Thales Asia, the collaboration will see both parties working on the latest digital technologies for handheld radios and other tactical communications. </p>
<p>III. A helicopter training simulator marks a first contract with Royal Malaysian Police (RMP)</p>
<p>Pascale Sourisse, CEO, Thales International witnessed the signing of an LOA, together with Malaysian partner Novatis Resources to deliver a Reality-H® AW139 Full Flight Simulator (FFS) to be used for pilot training with the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP). The Thales Reality H Full Flight Simulator is the world’s most advanced commercial helicopter simulator, and will be qualified to meet Level D standard, the highest level of qualification for a simulator. This marks a first engagement with the RMP, where pilots of the Police Air Wing Training Academy and other government agencies including the fire brigade and coast guard can benefit from realistic and immersive training, customised to the Malaysian environment and terrain. </p>
<p>IV. New leadership for Thales in Malaysia</p>
<p>To drive the growing business in Malaysia, Florian Riou has been appointed Country Director for Thales in Malaysia and Brunei and will effectively take on the role on 1st of July 2025. Florian brings close to 18 years of professional experience in foreign trade policy and trade compliance, with roles held in the French Ministry of Economics and Finance and Safran Group. With Thales since 2017, Florian’s most recent role was as Group Trade Compliance Director for Thales, based in France. </p>
<blockquote><p>"These latest agreements are recognition of how Thales’ solutions are supporting the needs of the Malaysian government and Malaysian forces. Our air surveillance radars are bringing air superiority to the Royal Malaysian Air Force in some of the most challenging tropical environments. In addition, our history in tactical radio communications dates back several decades in Malaysia and looks set to continue as we collaborate with strong local partners to develop home-grown expertise and joint solutions to support the Army. We appreciate the renewed trust established with Thales to help drive the modernisation of its armed forces.” Pascale Sourisse, CEO, Thales International.</p></blockquote>

 <p>The percentage of breaches that involved a third-party doubled in the last year, and 54% of firms were hit by a third-party sourced attack or breach; vendor access is now a top enterprise risk.1, 2</p>
 
 <p>Traditional, siloed identity and access management (IAM) tools weren’t built to handle the scale, diversity, or fluidity of modern B2B ecosystems and supply chains.</p>
 
 <p>Identity gaps, like stale accounts, overpermissioned access, and weak onboarding, create openings for fraud and data exfiltration.</p>
 
 <p>B2B IAM enables continuous, adaptive trust to govern external access, reducing risk and improving third-party collaboration.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses depend on a vast network of third-party organizations to drive innovation, speed, and scale in today’s hyper-connected economy. But behind that collaboration lies a critical security question: Can you trust every connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is, while your internal security practices may be sound, the weakest point in your defense might lie just outside your organizational boundary — in your supply chain.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/">Suomi.fi</a> identity brokering service provides a list of authentication methods for the Tax Administration e-service.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, people handle so much sensitive information online that the need for strong authentication is apparent. People cannot rely on username and password authentication for services such as banking, insurance, health care and tax administration, to mention a few. Traditionally, in Finland, we have had three classes of strong authentication methods available for citizens: BankID, Mobile Certificate (Mobiilivarmenne) and the national ID card (HST card). Since the end of October 2024, a fourth type of official strong authentication method has been made available, hightrust.id.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Overview – Hightrust.id 
<p>Hightrust.id is a digital wallet solution designed for mobile devices. It aims to offer a centralised solution for managing individuals’ online identity credentials without remembering various usernames and passwords or carrying several documents. When I write this, higtrust.id provides strong identity verification and legally binding electronic signatures, but the solution has much more potential. In this blog, I will review hightrust.id mainly as an authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id as a Strong Authentication method&nbsp; 
<p>It’s not every day that new, strong authentication methods are introduced. But what makes these methods strong? Multifactor authentication methods (MFA) are often seen as stronger options than methods that rely only on a username and password. However, MFA capability alone cannot define a particular method as an officially strong authentication method. It must undergo a complex certification process to prove the solution’s maturity. This is indicated by using a level of assurance (LoA) level. The National Cyber Security Centre of the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, Traficom, makes the certification guidelines in Finland. From the current strong methods, BankID and Mobile Certificate are on the second highest LoA level of eIDAS Substantial and the HST card on the highest level of eIDAS High using the EU 3-step scale. Hightrust.id has been certified oto the highest level of eIDAS High, although when used in the Finnish Trust Network, it is registered&nbsp; on the same LoA level as the Bank ID and Mobile certificate, eIDAS Substantial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Wallets&nbsp; 
<p>Generally, a digital wallet is an app that includes personal identity data (PID) based on different types of identity and payment documents and potentially additional attributes that could indicate, e.g., your profession or the organisation you work for. Soon, various kinds of cards, such as identity cards, driver’s licenses, debit cards, credit cards, and cryptocurrencies, can be added to the wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hightrust.id digital wallet is a smartphone application that can be downloaded for free from Android’s Google Play or Apple’s App Store. The solution enables user identity verification in a smartphone application with a citizen certificate scanned from an HST card, and it can be used without a separate card reader. The user can also sign documents electronically using the app. Other cards supported now in the hightrust.id wallet include the Finnish Sote card (for healthcare workers) and the Finnish DVV organisation card (generally used by public sector employees). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting digital wallet solution is the EU’s long-planned EUDI wallet, which will be launched around 2026 to 2027. The EUDI wallet will harmonise how EU citizens verify their identity across borders in different e-services. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the 27 EU nations. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here.</span>">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Citizen Digital Certificate&nbsp; 
<p>A digital certificate is an identifier verified by a third-party organisation. It can be used to identify its subject and reliably sign in to information networks and systems. Several certificate types, such as server certificates, are available to identify Internet service providers and secure data exchange. The mobile certificate method is based on a certificate stored in a SIM card on a smart device. The certificate stored in an HST card is called the citizen certificate, and the user must enable it before use. Passports cannot be used for this because their chips do not include the citizen certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not enabled the citizen certificate of your HST card, you can do it in hightrust.id app. This is a great feature, as previously this would require using a device with a smartcard reader or attaching a smart card reader to a computer. Your card must be issued after August 31, 2021, and you need a smartphone or tablet with a near-field communication (NFC) feature. Also, you must have the activation code that is delivered to you on paper separately from the card. This code is used to activate the citizen certificate and create a PIN1 for authentication and a PIN2 for signing. If you do not have the activation code available, you can visit the police station to get a new one for a fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start using the citizen certificate, do the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding and confirming your email address in the hightrust.id wallet is essential. It speeds up the revocation operation of the citizen certificate in case you accidentally lose or break your phone or change it to a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed instructions in Finnish, Swedish and English on how to proceed with all the steps are <a href="https://hightrust.id/en/support/preparing-to-enable-the-hightrust-id-digital-wallet/">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Signing in with the hightrust.id&nbsp; 
<p>In the following example, I will sign in to a social and healthcare mobile application called Maisa. It is a personal health record (PHR) application used by some of the largest public health care regions. The app requires strong authentication due to the sensitive information it contains. Here are a few observations of the procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maisa uses the Suomi.fi identity brokering service to provide all of the different strong authentication methods available. Since I use a mobile app to access the service, I must ensure that hightrust.id uses the app option. If using Maisa via computer, I would choose the QR-code scanning option and scan the QR-code from the computer screen using my phone. If I had several cards scanned in the hightrust.id application, I would choose the card manually, but since I have only one, it is selected automatically. Notice that the national ID card does not contain the social security number (HETU) but a SATU identifier (FINUID, Finnish Unique Identification Number). The SATU identifier will be changed to HETU in the background, utilising the national population information system. Face ID, fingerprint, or mobile device security code can be used to accept sending SATU to the population information system. After the SATU to HETU conversion, I need to give permission to send HETU information to Maisa. After this, I can start to use the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The authentication operation did not require typing any information such as passwords or PIN codes since I have the Face ID option on my smartphone. Other options would have been a fingerprint or typing the smartphone’s security code. In both cases, the operation is effortless and does not require the user to remember any additional passwords or codes that he does not know already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id vs. other Strong Authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>Hightrust.id is not the only ID document-based authentication method on the market. Suomi.fi offers the HST card method, but the downside is that it requires a physical card and a card reader device, which is not handy for me to carry outside my home.&nbsp; Also, there are various methods based on ID document scanning and taking pictures and videos of my ID documents and myself. These methods have many benefits, such as providing reliable authentication methods for people from countries outside of Finland and even outside of Europe and letting them use documents like passports, ID cards and driver’s licenses to verify their identity. However, even though many of these methods rely on advanced technologies, they are not officially certified strong authentication methods in Finland. You can read more about the ID document-based authentication methods <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/understanding-id-document-verification/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here</span>">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BankID has traditionally been the most popular strong authentication method in Finland. It has been used since the 1990s, and most eService users in Finland are very familiar with it. Since BankID enables access to users’ bank accounts, the current recommendation is to use it carefully and only for the bank’s services. The other strong methods, including mobile certificates, hightrust.id and identification cards, should be used for everything else. They work practically everywhere except when logging into online banking. Lately, the mobile certificate method has gained popularity alongside BankID. If criminals gain access to your mobile certificate, they will get access to your online services, but not your bank account. HST card and the hightrust.id methods also offer their benefits. It is always a good idea to have several strong authentication methods available. This is important not only for safety reasons, but also for situations when the bank service is unavailable, for example, during a service break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the table below for the basic characteristics of the different strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The card must be assigned after the 31st of August 2021&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Depending on the solution. Not all three are required during one session. OTP = One Time Password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Mobile card readers are not very practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical part of any digital solution is the cost. Nothing comes for free, and the service provider must pay something to the identity broker service operators, Suomi.fi (public sector services) or the Finnish Trust Network (FTN, private sector services) to provide strong authentication methods for their clients. Sometimes, this includes an additional transaction-level fee paid per authentication transaction. But sometimes, we users must also pay a small fee for our chosen methods. See the table below for the basic pricing principles of strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>



Method&nbsp;
User fees&nbsp;
Service provider fees in FTN&nbsp;


HST card&nbsp;
HST card fee once every 5 years&nbsp;<p></p>

<p>Prices checked and accurate as of 2025/04/11&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Hightrust.id is a quick and convenient way to sign in to online services, especially when using online services on a mobile device. For those that already have a HST card, it is a great alternative to other sign in methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital identity management and payment industry is constantly changing. Criminals are constantly developing new, innovative ways to hack into our bank accounts to steal our money. Usually, when security is increased, it means more steps for the user to log in. This in turn makes it more difficult to use services. We need innovations like hightrust.id to provide a solution that combines security, convenience and efficiency so that we can use electronic services with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>

  Tawazun Council and Thales Sign Agreement to Establish Ground Master Air Surveillance Radar Production Facility in UAE
prezly

Wed, 05/21/2025 - 15:00


             
 As part of the Tawazun Economic Program, Thales Emarat Technologies announces its investment in a state-of-the-art factory to produce Ground Master series air surveillance radars. 
 The facility is expected to be fully operational by 2027, enhancing the UAE’s sovereign and manufacturing capabilities. 
 This strategic cooperation agreement signed between Tawazun Council and Thales aims to strengthen partnership and support local production. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Abu Dhabi, 20 May 2025 – Tawazun Council and Thales, have signed a cooperation agreement to produce locally advanced Ground Master series air surveillance radars. This agreement supports the UAE’s vision to boost local manufacturing and develop national defence capabilities.</p>
<p>The signing took place during the fourth edition of "Make it in the Emirates 2025," with Matar Ali Al Romaithi, Sector Chief of Defence and Security Industry Affairs at Tawazun Council, and Abdelhafid Mordi, CEO of Thales in the UAE, alongside representatives from both sides.</p>
<p>This reflects Thales’ commitment to supporting the UAE’s vision of advancing manufacturing capabilities through innovation and industrial excellence.</p>
<p>The Ground Master radars are internationally recognized for their reliability, superior performance, mobility, and adaptability to diverse missions, positioning them amongst the world’s leading air surveillance and defence systems. The facility is scheduled to be fully operational by 2027, where it will assemble, test, and qualify advanced air surveillance radars to meet both domestic and export markets needs.</p>
<p>This factory will serve as a strategic asset, bolstering the UAE’s defence manufacturing capabilities, enhancing self-sufficiency in critical technologies, and providing flexibility to address varying operational requirements.</p>
<p>A core pillar of Thales Radar Centre of Excellence’s expansion is the development of Emirati talents. Thales places localization at the heart of its growth strategy through advanced training programs and sustainable professional career development, building specialized local expertise in advanced radar technologies in support of the UAE’s National Defence Strategy and its vision of a highly capable, future-ready national workforce. As the project is not only focused on building the radar system, but also on qualifying domestic suppliers, it further contributes to strengthening the national industrial base and promoting long-term self-reliance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commenting on the agreement, Matar Ali Al Romaithi, Sector Chief of Defence and Security Industry Affairs at Tawazun Council, said: “The expansion of Thales’ Radar Centre of Excellence reflects the strength of the UAE’s defence industrial strategy and its regional leadership in advanced technologies. This initiative enhances national capabilities in air surveillance radar systems while creating significant opportunities for local companies to grow, innovate, and compete globally.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hervé Dammann, Executive Vice-President, Land and Air Systems said: “Thales is proud to contribute to the growth of the UAE’s industrial defence ecosystem by advancing local capabilities, in-line with the national vision. The expansion of our Radar Centre of Excellence, through the establishment of a new production facility, marks a major milestone – from integration, testing, manufacturing to lifecycle support. This investment reinforces the UAE’s sovereignty in critical defence technologies, strengthens the national supply chain, embarks UAE talents and deepens local expertise in advanced radar systems.”</p></blockquote>

			<p>London, 21st May 2025 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group</a>, the leading global financial services provider, has announced the acquisition of a majority stake in <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading enterprise-grade tokenization solutions provider. The transaction, which will see Apex Group have 100% control over the next three years, follows the initial investment and strategic partnership with Tokeny announced in December 2023. This process marks a significant deepening of the relationship as Apex Group commits to lead the institutional adoption of tokenized finance.</p>
<p>This strategic milestone, where Apex Group will now take a controlling interest in Tokeny, is a clear signal of the firm’s belief in the transformative potential of tokenization for asset managers and institutional finance. It also reflects a broader commitment to delivering turn-key digital infrastructure that simplifies and accelerates the shift to greater liquidity and distribution across geographies. Both Tokeny talent and technology will become part of Apex Group enabling an effective integration within the firm to efficiently meet client needs.</p>

		 
	 
    As a majority owner, Apex Group is enhancing its ability to deliver comprehensive, future-proof solutions to our clients.

			<p>Since the initial partnership announcement, Tokeny has seen growing adoption of its technology and standards by leading financial institutions. Its chain-agnostic infrastructure has been integrated into Apex Group’s offerings and deployed to tokenize assets for clients.</p>

The firm offers a full suite of capabilities covering the issuance, transfer, and lifecycle management of tokenized securities, enabling clients to tap into new liquidity channels and enhance operational efficiencies.</p>

		 
	 
    Expanding our partnership to now being part of Apex Group enables us to move faster and serve more institutions with a truly global footprint. In the last six years, we’ve built a robust tokenization infrastructure and an active ecosystem of partners. But to bring tokenization to scale, institutional distribution and credibility are key — and that’s exactly what Apex Group brings to the table. We’re proud to align with their vision to deliver tangible innovation to the financial industry.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>The acquisition of Tokeny is a foundational step in Apex Group’s future strategy to lead the transformation of asset servicing by leveraging Web3’s blockchain technology, decentralized protocols, smart contracts and distribution to enhance efficiency, security and transparency.</p>

<p>Meet Rachel—an asset manager onboarding a boutique investment fund with international stakeholders. Before she can move forward, Rachel must navigate KYC, KYB, and AML checks to stay compliant. It’s a complex process, and mistakes can mean fines or reputational risk.</p>



<p>Here’s how Rachel’s experience differs when using manual methods versus iComply’s compliance platform.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 1: Collecting Client Information 



<p>Manual Process: Rachel emails forms, requests documents, and waits for incomplete responses. She sends follow-ups, and the back-and-forth delays onboarding.</p>



<p>With iComply: Rachel sends a secure, custom-branded onboarding link. The platform guides the client through document uploads and verifies everything in real time.</p>



<p>Result: Onboarding is fast and complete—no delays or missing data.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 2: Verifying Ownership 



<p>For corporate clients, KYB compliance requires identifying all beneficial owners with 25% or more ownership.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel searches public records, cross-references shareholder lists, and struggles with foreign registries.</p>



<p>With iComply: The system pulls corporate filings and ownership details globally in seconds, even revealing hidden layers like trusts or holding companies.</p>



<p>Result: Rachel gets an audit-ready overview of the business structure without manual digging.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 3: AML Screening 



<p>AML regulations require checking clients and stakeholders against sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media lists.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel manually inputs names into multiple databases and spends hours reviewing false positives.</p>



<p>With iComply: The platform screens individuals automatically and filters out irrelevant matches, flagging only genuine risks.</p>



<p>Result: Fewer false positives, faster resolutions, and more focus on real risks.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 4: Recordkeeping and Reporting 



<p>Compliance regulations require asset managers to store records securely and generate detailed reports during audits.</p>

<p>“We are here with you with this comprehensive blog post. In this guide, we will tell you our discovery about the role of ID Document Liveness Detection.”</p>
<p>Hello dear readers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rise of modern technology, new innovative methods of security have been developed to defeat cyber criminals. From multiple-factor authentication to facial ID recognition, we have all types of security.</p>
<p>One such groundbreaking method of security that has revolutionized the way we fight against fake identities is ID Document Liveness Detection.</p>
<p>We have prepared this guide for its detailed explanation. Stay connected with us till the end….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What ID Document Liveness Detection Claims About It? 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection SDK is mainly hailed as an innovation in technology that is used to ensure the presented ID is real during the verification. Driven by this technology, a <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">fake ID detector</a> scans the presented documents and then applies OCR on them to extract their text.</p>
<p>When the text is extracted, the system verifies and marks the documents and issues them for further processing. This technology is being used in all institutions, from banks to educational institutions, and from such institutions to finance.</p>
<p>When we present our stance in front of users, many of them raise a simple question: how does this technology stop identity fraud? Hoping! You will also ask us this question.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the next section is the answer to your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How ID Documents Liveness Detection Stops Identity Fraud? 
<p>This section is a detailed part of this blog. In which we will describe the role of ID document Recognition SDK in preventing fraud in detail.</p>
 1. Artificial Intelligence Integration 
<p>When it comes to AI, we don’t think that there is any field where it has not left its everlasting impact. We can all understand this. Luckily! ID Recognition also integrates AI and its advanced algorithms. These algorithms are trained to provide real-time insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, we can say that: from anyone’s entrance to returning from any institution, the system records all movements of them. Furthermore, AI is exclusive to providing faster results. We mean to say you can get anyone’s insights within a few seconds. Isn’t it great..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Better Document Analysis 
<p>There is a huge difference between document analysis and better document analysis. Did’t understand? Let us make you understand. If we give you some documents and say you to find whether they are fake or real. You might take a lot of time and could even miss subtle signs of tampering.</p>
<p>However, when you use this technology of ID recognition, the advanced algorithms analyze several features from A to Z, including;</p>
 
 Watermark 
 
 
 Hologram 
 
 
 Microtext 
 UV features 
 
<p>And so on….</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s ask a very simple question: Is such detection exclusive to humans? Absolutely not! So, this detection is the best feature of this technology.</p>
 3. Enhanced User Experience and Compliance 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document Recognition SDK</a> not only strengthens the security but also enhances the user experience and compliance by making the verification simple and fast. This technology ensures consistent and smooth compliance onboarding while meeting strict regulatory standards such as KYC(Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).</p>
<p>Such efficiency and speed of this technology streamlines the process of verification that making it easy for both businesses and customers to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Reduced Costs 
<p>One of the greatest roles of this technology is reducing the costs. A fake ID scanner is integrated with advanced machine learning models that reduce the need for manual verification. Additionally, the agencies don’t need to hire extra labor staff for manual verification. This feature eliminates the tension of errors committed by humans during verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What About Our Service? 
<p>After hearing the role of this technology, many users probably think about how they can make use of this cutting-edge technology. This is where we provide them with <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>(a face and ID recognition algorithm developer).</p>
<p>Our service is driven by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a>-evaluated algorithms.

To defeat them, marketers can heavily benefit from <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID Document Liveness Detection SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Our Final Thoughts 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection plays a crucial role in preventing fraud and defeating online attacks made by criminals. This technology effectively extracts text from ID documents and then lets the system mark them for further processing.</p>
<p>This technology plays a great role that we have discussed in this guide in detail. This section starts from AI integration and ends with reduced costs. This role is such a groundbreaking one. However, many users remain confused about how to get such benefits.</p>

<p>In 2025, the competition between the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/">Nintendo</a> switch vs switch lite continues to captivate gamers. Each device has its unique strengths and weaknesses, catering to different audiences. While the Switch offers enhanced features like TV connectivity and detachable Joy-Con controllers, the Switch Lite boasts a more affordable price point and a compact design, perfect for on-the-go gaming. In this article, we will benchmark both devices to help you determine which Nintendo Switch wins in 2025. Whether you prioritize performance, portability, or price, understanding the differences between switch vs switch Lite is essential for making an informed decision.</p>



 Key features of the Nintendo switch lite 



<p>The Nintendo Switch Lite is designed specifically for handheld gaming, making it a popular choice among gamers seeking portability.</p>



 Design and specifications of switch vs switch lite 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/hardware/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> features a sleek, compact design that prioritizes portability, making it an excellent choice for gamers who are always on the move. Weighing just 0.61 pounds, it is significantly lighter than its counterpart, the standard Switch.

<p>The Bonk airdrop, one of the largest in <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>’s history, distributed 50% of its total supply to community members, significantly boosting its popularity and Solana’s network activity. Below is everything you need to know about the Bonk coin airdrop, including its history, eligibility, how to claim tokens, risks, and current status.</p>



 What is Bonk Airdrop? 



<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/vi/currencies/bonk1/">Bonk coin</a> airdrop was a massive token distribution campaign launched on Christmas Day 2022, with distribution completed by January 2023. It allocated 50% of BONK’s total supply (50 trillion out of 100 trillion tokens) to various Solana community members to promote engagement and reward active participants.</p>









 Overview of Bonk Coin and its purpose 



<p>Bonk Coin (BONK) is a Solana-based meme coin launched on December 25, 2022, designed to be a community-driven, and inclusive cryptocurrency. Inspired by meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK markets itself as “the dog coin of the people,” aiming to counter toxic tokenomics and foster widespread adoption. As of May 14, 2025, BONK ranks among the top meme coins, with a market cap of approximately $2.4 billion and a circulating supply of ~94.12 trillion tokens (after burns from an initial 100 trillion).</p>



<p>Bonk coin airdrop was created with the following goals to enhance the Solana ecosystem and engage its community:</p>



 Community Empowerment 



<p>Promote inclusivity by rewarding active ecosystem participants, countering centralized tokenomics common in some Web3 projects.</p>



 Revitalize the Solana Ecosystem 



<p>Launched post-FTX collapse, Bonk coin airdrop aimed to boost Solana’s network activity, achieved with spikes in transactions and active addresses in December 2023 and March 2024.</p>



<p>Serve as a utility token across Solana’s DeFi, NFT, and gaming sectors, enhancing interoperability.</p>



 Drive Meme Coin Culture 



<p>Leverage meme culture to create hype and engagement, drawing inspiration from Dogecoin’s lighthearted ethos.</p>



<p>Foster a loyal community through events like BONKMAS (a token burn campaign started November 15, 2024) and social media presence on X (@bonk_inu), Telegram, and Discord.</p>



 Incentivize Participation 



<p>Offer rewards via staking (e.g., Token Launchpad for airdrops) and integrations in projects like BonkSwap and Bonk Earn (BERN).</p>



<p>Support developers and artists through grants and community initiatives.</p>



 Deflationary Mechanism 



<p>Implement token burns to reduce supply and potentially increase value, addressing meme coin inflation concerns.</p>



 Historical context of the Bonk coin airdrop in the <a href="https://blog.herond.org/cryptocompare-best-bitcoin-price-tracker-2025/">crypto</a> market 



<p>The Bonk (BONK) airdrop, launched December 25, 2022, and completed January 2023, was a pivotal event in the crypto market during a bear market and Solana’s post-FTX crisis. With Bitcoin and Ethereum at lows (~$16,000 and ~$1,200), Solana’s SOL crashed from ~$36 to below $10, its ecosystem faltering. Meme coins like Dogecoin were fading, needing utility to survive, while airdrops were popular but scam-prone. Bonk coin airdrop, distributed 50 trillion tokens (50% of its supply) to ~297,000 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/browser-based-wallets-quick-and-easy-access-to-your-crypto/">wallets</a>, targeting NFT holders, traders, and developers. </p>



<p>Launched on Christmas Day, it aimed to revive Solana and spread ownership, gaining traction via X and Reddit. It drove a 7,303% Bonk coin airdrop price surge in 2023, boosted Solana’s activity, and fueled the 2024 meme coin season with tokens like Popcat. Scams and volatility emerged as challenges. The airdrop’s scale and timing made it a model for meme coins, aiding Solana’s recovery and BONK’s lasting impact through events like BURNmas (2024).</p>

For the project itself, widespread distribution through airdrops helps achieve greater decentralization and community ownership, potentially increasing long-term resilience and grassroots support for Bonk’s continued development and utility expansion.</p>









 Potential rewards and community engagement

Events like BURNmas, targeting 1 trillion $BONK burns in 2024, may further increase token value. Airdrops also provide access to Solana’s ecosystem, enhancing portfolio diversification. Community engagement is key, connecting users through @bonk_inu on X, Telegram, and Discord, where they share strategies and celebrate gains. However, participants must be cautious of scams and tax implications to maximize their rewards.</p>

 Data theft and how to protect data in the face of increasing cases of data theft<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/data-theft"></a> 



 Recent Scandal in Argentina Highlights a Massive Digital Trust Gap 



<p>In a striking case that has stirred political and cybersecurity circles alike, Argentine authorities are investigating a social media influencer for allegedly misusing the CUITs (tax IDs) of five provincial governors to facilitate clothing imports under fraudulent barter agreements.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/investigan-a-una-influencer-por-usar-los-cuit-de-cinco-gobernadores-para-importar-ropa-de-canje/">La Voz</a> article, the influencer was able to initiate import operations by impersonating state authorities, a move that points to critical failures in identity verification and data authenticity across public sector systems.</p>



<p>This incident isn’t just a political scandal — it’s a technological wake-up call.</p>



 



 What’s the problem: Identity in a Web2 World Is Broken 



<p>Let’s break down what went wrong:</p>



 
 Static identifiers (like CUITs) are publicly known and easily misused. 



 No decentralized verification mechanism exists to confirm who is behind a given request. 



 Paper-based or email-based authorizations can be forged or socially engineered. 



 Lack of auditability and tamper-resistance in public records. 
 



<p>In short, Web2 identity systems were never designed for integrity-first governance.</p>



<p></p>



 Extrimian Solution: Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity (DID) 



<p>This is where Extrimian’s technology stack comes in — providing next-generation digital identity solutions built for trust, transparency, and tamper-resistance.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) </a>and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, institutions and individuals can cryptographically prove who they are, what roles they hold, and what permissions they’ve been granted.</p>



 What this looks like in practice: 



 
 Governors or their offices issue verifiable credentials signed with cryptographic keys. 



 These credentials confirm roles, permissions, or authority to engage in specific transactions (e.g., import operations). 



 Customs systems or regulatory APIs validate these credentials in real time. 



 No credential = no action. 



 And any attempt to forge or reuse expired credentials fails cryptographic validation instantly. 
 



<a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/"></a>Verifiable Credentials for Decentralized Digital Identity circuit<br>



 Why does a new data security system matter now? 



<p>Public institutions, regulatory bodies, and private sector players are increasingly vulnerable to identity-based fraud, whether it’s:</p>



 
 Fake authorizations for import/export activity. 



 Impersonation of officials for grants or tenders. 



 Abuse of state data for reputation laundering. 
 



<p>The Extrimian DID/VC framework prevents this by design:</p>



 
 Every claim is traceable, verifiable, and revocable. 



 You control your identity, but institutions can trust it without intermediaries. 



 AI systems or customs logic can automatically validate credentials without human review. 
 



 



 How does Extrimian Technology work for data security? 



 – Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): 



<p>A new standard for digital identity, DIDs are globally unique, user-controlled identifiers that don’t rely on central registries. Unlike CUITs or email addresses, DIDs can’t be spoofed.</p>



 – Verifiable Credentials: 



<p>Credentials (like “Governor of Córdoba”) are digitally signed and timestamped. They’re issued by a trusted entity and can be shown (and validated) without revealing unnecessary personal data.</p>



 –  Interoperability &amp; Compliance: 



<p>Extrimian builds on <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">W3C standards </a>and works with Hyperledger, Ethereum, and other Web3 protocols — making the stack fit for enterprise and government adoption.</p>



 



 Use Case: Protecting CUITs and import authorizations 



<p>Let’s reimagine the current scandal with Extrimian in place:</p>



Current ProblemExtrimian SolutionCUITs misused to authorize importsCredentials would require live cryptographic validationNo verification of who submitted paperworkEvery credential includes signer metadata and roleFraudulent authorization slips throughInvalid credentials are immediately rejected at the protocol layer



<p>The result? No more impersonations. No more unchecked imports.</p>



 



 What is the best Data Theft and Security solution? 



<p>The CUIT scandal is emblematic of a global challenge. As governments digitize, identity without verification is a liability. By integrating <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs</a>, institutions don’t just stop fraud — they build digital trust for the AI era.</p>

<p>What if the real threat in the Hindu Kush Himalayas isn’t war, but collapse? What happens when melting glaciers, volatile politics, and fraying ecologies converge? Can we imagine security beyond borders — rooted in shared rivers, anticipatory governance, and a planetary ethic of care? What risks are we still refusing to&nbsp;see?</p><p>In June 2024, Dark Matter Labs was commissioned to develop a 75-year situational risk profile of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH). The goal was to identify the potential of catastrophic risk in the region, i.e. to map a complex terrain of cascading environmental threats, political instability, and social vulnerabilities that might, under certain pressures, tip into systemic crisis. One aspect we sought to explore was how water insecurity could add to political tensions and even lead to conditions for conflict in the&nbsp;region.</p><p>At the time, we chose not to share the full analysis publicly. Some of the risk intersections we identified, particularly around water infrastructure, migration corridors, and conflict hotspots, felt too sensitive, too easily misinterpreted or potentially weaponised. However, given the return of heightened conflict between India and Pakistan, it feels important to share at least part of our analysis. The objective is not to claim prescience or take sides but help shift the conversation away from land and borders to something much more oriented towards the socio-ecological continuities in the region that are hurtling towards systemic collapse. We offer this summary of our learnings in relation to the ongoing conflict.</p>Figure 1. The Hindu Kush Himalayas. Image by Nieves López Isquierdo¹. An Overview of Recent&nbsp;Events <p>On April 22, 2025, gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in the Himalayan resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing 25 visitors and a local guide². The brutality of the incident has shattered any evidence of tenuous calm in the region — a narrative that the Indian government has promoted since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 (which revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy). The Indian government blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-proscribed terrorist organisation based in Pakistan, for the attack. Within days, New Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting the attackers and launched a diplomatic and economic offensive. India downgraded ties, expelled Pakistani diplomats, sealed its land borders, and suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty — a crucial water-sharing arrangement between the countries that had previously survived three major wars between the two nations³. Pakistan, denying any involvement, bristled at the accusations and retaliated in kind. It closed its airspace to Indian flights, halted all trade, and nearly put a 50-year-old bilateral peace treaty, the Simla Agreement, on&nbsp;hold⁴.</p><p>For ordinary people on both sides of the border, the sudden freefall in relations and outbreak of military hostilities has been alarming. In some regions, air raid sirens and border skirmishes have become nightly occurrences⁵. Even far from the conflict zone, the social fabric has been strained. The killings have opened up India’s already frayed religious and ethnic fault lines. In some Indian cities, anger over the Pahalgam killings has spilled into mob violence and xenophobia. Muslims, especially Kashmiris, living in places like Punjab and New Delhi, have found themselves harassed, assaulted, or shunned, as many Indians scapegoat them for the actions of militants⁶. Social media disinformation and the use of AI-manipulated content and deepfakes has been rampant on both sides, which has only fuelled polarisation and jingoism⁷.</p> Entangled Continuums / Systemic&nbsp;Risks <p>As the two nations trade fire and fury, a deeper crisis continues to unfold. HKH spans 3,500 kilometers across eight countries, towering as the planet’s ‘Third Pole’ with its vast ice fields and alpine ecosystems. It is an awe-inspiring landscape of glaciers, snow-fed rivers, and narrow valleys teeming with life — and risk. Even before the latest military flare-up, scientists and strategists had been sounding alarms about a cascading chain of environmental threats. Climate change is hitting the HKH region hard and fast. Average temperatures in the mountains are rising faster than the global average and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. If the world manages to limit global warming to +1.5°C, the Himalayas will likely experience about +2.0°C — enough to irreversibly alter its ecology. The spillover effects of such warming are already evident and will intensify: a third of all Himalayan glaciers could vanish, monsoon patterns are turning more erratic with heavier bursts of rain and longer droughts, and mountain disasters like landslides and flash floods are on the rise. All of this directly threatens the livelihoods and cultures of upland communities who have contributed almost nothing to global emissions but face outsize consequences.</p><p>Nowhere is the climate impact more dramatic than in the glaciers themselves. The HKH region holds about 73,000 square kilometers of glacier, a crucial store of fresh water that feeds Asia’s great rivers and provides water to over 240 million people in the HKH mountains, and an estimated 1.65–2 billion people downstream, affecting populations as far south as Vietnam. These glaciers are in rapid retreat. Recent assessments show that glacier loss in the 2010s was 65% faster than in the previous decade. By mid-century, the region is expected to hit ‘peak water’ — meaning melting glaciers will swell rivers to a maximum — after which water flows decline steadily as the ice reserves dwindle. If global warming is kept to 1.5–2°C, the Himalayas will still lose about 30–50% of their glacier volume by 2100. This is already an impossible target to meet. On the current trajectory of around 3°C of warming, up to three-quarters of the glacier ice could disappear by the end of the century. Such a loss would be catastrophic, causing both dangerous flooding in the near term and severe water shortages and food insecurity for decades thereafter. Food and water security for the HKH depend on the seasonal meltwater from glaciers. As one report starkly put it, “the people living in these mountains who have contributed next to nothing to global warming are at high risk” — and current adaptation efforts are nowhere near enough to help them&nbsp;cope.</p>Figure 2. Geodetic mass balance of glaciers in each region of the HKH and for the whole region (inset) for 1975–1999, 2000–2009, and 2010–2019. The size of the bars and their colour depend on changes in the average mass balance, expressed in metres water equivalent per year (m w.e. per year). The vertical black lines show the uncertainty. The bold numbers beside each basin give the glacier region in the Randolph Glacier Inventory⁸.Figure 3. Overview of all recorded cryospheric events in the HKH since&nbsp;2015⁹.<p>In such a fragile landscape of risk, India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is particularly ominous. The Indus River and its tributaries support 80 percent of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan as well hydropower. Pakistani officials warned that any attempt by India to choke the Indus River would be taken as an “act of war” and met with “full force”¹⁰, and are in the process of finalising a legal response¹¹. In other words, water — the most basic of shared resources — has become a potential weapon, and it is portentous for other resource wars to escalate in a time of climate-induced scarcity. Similarly, consider the Brahmaputra River (known as Yarlung Tsangpo in China) which winds from Tibet into India and Bangladesh. China’s construction of mega-dams upstream and its plans to possibly divert waters have caused consternation in India, which has responded with its own infrastructure projects in the region (notably the construction of India’s longest under-river tunnel across the Brahmaputra¹²). The risk here is that 50% of the Brahmaputra’s catchment is in Chinese-controlled territory. While not explicitly weaponised as in the case of the Indus Water Treaty, there is a threat to India and Bangladesh if Beijing opts to exert too much control. Climate change, in this context, is a risk multiplier: more erratic monsoons and faster glacial melt could lead to sudden floods one decade and crippling droughts the next, without any nation firing a shot. Or worse: forcing one side or both to push towards hot war. All the countries of the HKH are thus bound in a high-stakes environmental lottery. Upstream actions create downstream impacts, and an extreme event in one place — be it a cloudburst, landslide, or outburst flood from a glacial lake — can send ripples of disaster through valleys that span multiple&nbsp;nations.</p><p>It is also important to recognize how multiple hazards stack onto vulnerable mountain populations. A recent multi-hazard assessment of the HKH found that nearly half (around 49%) of the region’s people are exposed to more than one type of natural hazard — often simultaneously. Only 19% of the population resides in the safest third of the land area, whereas one-fifth live in the most dangerous 9% of land where floods, landslides, and wildfires overlap¹³. Many of the high-risk zones are precisely the densely populated mountain valleys and foothill corridors where development has concentrated. For example, the Kashmir Valley, Nepal’s Middle Hills, and parts of the Hindu Kush in Pakistan all feature towns and farmlands squeezed between steep slopes and flood-prone rivers. When heavy monsoon rains come or when a glacier lake suddenly bursts its banks, the damage can be enormous and quickly crosses borders. This was evident in 2010 when epic floods in Pakistan (triggered by unusual monsoon patterns linked to a warming atmosphere) affected 20 million people and even impacted parts of Indian Kashmir downstream. Likewise, a major landslide or earthquake in the Himalayas could dam rivers or reroute them, with downstream countries helpless to prevent flooding. Such cascading disasters are not hypothetical&nbsp;; they are a question of when, not if. Each event can act as a threat multiplier: displacing communities, straining governments, and potentially fueling social unrest or migration that ignites new conflicts (fig.&nbsp;4).</p>Figure 4. An illustrative 50-year Risk Profile for the HKH. Image by Prateek Shankar, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.<p>The Pahalgam terror attack and the ensuing military standoff occurred against such a backdrop of environmental fragility. In a very real sense, the skirmishes over borders and the looming crisis over glaciers are part of a single continuum of risk. Both stem from hyper-stressed systems that are increasingly interlinked. The HKH region faces an ‘entangled continuum’ of threats where a trigger in one domain (e.g., security) can exacerbate vulnerabilities in another (e.g., water and climate), and vice versa. It is no coincidence that as India and Pakistan were trading fire, they were also trading accusations over water and power supply. Nor is it a coincidence that even as soldiers were entrenched on the frontiers, families were worried about blackouts and crop irrigation back home. In this environment, a narrow focus on conventional, ‘hard’ security threats alone begins to look dangerously myopic.</p><p>This is why the lens of the nation-state, though institutionally powerful, is insufficient to understand what is happening in the region. The rivers of the HKH do not follow treaties or the speeches of political leaders in Delhi and Islamabad. They swell, split, and migrate. So do its communities, its vulnerabilities, and its threats. Treating each skirmish, each event, and each border incident as a contained political dispute misses the deeper story: the systemic weakening of a shared ecological and civilisational fabric. In the days following the Pahalgam attack, much of the attention had focused on questions of accountability and justice. But as long as that attention remains bounded by flags and frontiers, it misses this larger terrain of risk. This is and cannot be a region defined by conflict. It is defined by continuity. Migratory routes, trade flows, shared cosmologies, and mountain knowledge: these threads have always connected lives across what are now hard and militarized borders. The recent outbreak of conflict is not just the resurfacing of old grievances, but the fraying of such threads under new and regionally shared pressures — pressures which are barely acknowledged in public discourse in the&nbsp;region.</p>Figure 5. Development pathways and possible scenarios for the Hindu Kush Himalayas in&nbsp;2080¹⁴.<p>As an informed public and as stakeholders in this region’s future, we must push our leaders to recognize the continuum of risk, these risk commons. It is no longer enough to simply ‘defeat terrorism’ or ‘secure the border’ in a vacuum. Security in the HKH needs to be reconceived as ecological and human security, requiring principled and mediated dialogue and joint strategies that span from the highest mountain peak to the lowest floodplain. Instead of viewing each other as primary threats, countries of the HKH — and more importantly their leaders — may need to see that they face a common threat which is the entangled crisis of climate warming, a more volatile planet, and the cascading disasters it will bring. We must imagine a renewed sense of planetary security that recognises the entanglement of these risks and our shared futures (e.g. shared data infrastructures, anticipatory risk modeling, whole-systems analysis and bold diplomatic innovation). Ultimately, a bullet fired or a treaty broken in anger is not just an act against a rival nation but against the shared life-support systems that all nations depend&nbsp;on.</p><p>This blog was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zehra-zaidi-obe-7255a5137/">Zehra Zaidi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-shankar/">Prateek Shankar</a> (who are British-Pakistani and Indian respectively).

 IDnow’s collaborative research project, MAMMOTH, which explores ways of addressing bias in face verification systems, comes to an end in Autumn 2025. Here, we share a summary of the findings so far, and what it could mean for a more inclusive future of identity verification. 



 



<p>Face verification has emerged as an indispensable way for businesses to quickly and securely prove the identity of their customers. There are multiple reasons for its widespread adoption, including enhanced security, reduced operational costs, and elevated user experiences.</p>



 What is face verification and when is it used?&nbsp; 



<p>Face verification is a form of biometric technology that uses the unique features of a face to confirm an identity. In the context of remote identify verification, it involves capturing a digital image of a person’s face, often in real time, and comparing it to the identity photo extracted from a submitted identity document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘one-to-one’ matching process of face verification differs from the ‘one-to-many’ matching technique of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">face recognition,</a> which involves identifying an individual from images of other individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When combined with liveness detection, 3D depth analysis, and AI-powered pattern recognition, face verification can verify identity documents and the actual person behind them to dramatically reduce account takeovers, synthetic identity fraud, and impersonation attempts while creating a seamless customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">banking onboarding </a>to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">airport security</a>, face verification can transform time-consuming identity checks into seamless moments of trust. Beyond its commercial benefits, face verification offers significant social and economic advantages. It is particularly transformative in regions where many lack traditional forms of ID, providing an accessible means to verify identity and unlock services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, despite its widespread use, many face verification systems are still underperforming for specific demographics, such as darker skinned people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, a 2019 study by MIT Media Lab discovered that while face verification error rates for white men were just 0.8%, they jumped to <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/news/biased-technology-automated-discrimination-facial-recognition#:~:text=The%20error%20rate%20for%20light,published%20by%20MIT%20Media%20Lab.">34.7% for darker skinned women</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demographic bias isn’t just a technical flaw – it undermines the right to equal access to essential digital services, such as opening bank accounts or registering for welfare or health services.</p>



 Undertaking a MAMMOTH project. 



<p>In 2022, alongside 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">IDnow set out to break down these barriers of bias</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency of the European Commission, the goal was to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2025, I attended the&nbsp;‘<a href="https://mammoth-ai.eu/2nd-mammoth-webinar/">Addressing visual bias in Biometric Identity Verification</a>‘ webinar to share some of the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025W/SynRDinBAS/papers/Moussa_Face-swapping_based_Data_Augmentation_for_ID_Document_and_Selfie_Face_WACVW_2025_paper.pdf">findings</a> from the project, discuss how face verification biases arise and what can be done to address them.&nbsp;I was excited to share a solution to this very real problem in the digital world.</p>



 What’s the problem? Skin tone bias in ID verification. 



<p>State-of-the-art face verification models trained on conventional datasets show a significant increase in error rates for individuals with darker skin tones. This is due to an underrepresentation of minority demographics in public datasets. This lack of diversity in the data makes it difficult for models to perform well on underrepresented groups, leading to higher error rates for people with darker skin tones. This reinforces the urgent need for targeted solutions that address demographic imbalance in training data.</p>



 What’s the solution? The power of representation. 



<p>Ensuring face verification models are trained on a balanced dataset of images featuring characteristics typically absent from public datasets significantly improves model performance overall. For instance, as identity card photos may undergo color transformations applied by issuing bodies (e.g., governments), skin tone plays an important role, particularly if the calibration is not optimized for darker skin tones. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This miscalibration can create inconsistencies between the captured selfie image and the individual’s appearance in the ID card photo, especially for those with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows that training using a demographically balanced real-world dataset that mirrors the specific characteristics and variability of identity card images can ensure more accurate and fair recognition for individuals with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this issue, IDnow proposed using a ‘style transfer’ method to generate new identity card photos that mimic the natural variation and inconsistencies found in real-world data. By augmenting the training dataset with synthetic images, it not only improves model robustness through exposure to a wider range of variations but also enables a further reduction of bias against darker skin faces. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Various experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets reveal that fine-tuning state-of-the-art face verification models with the proposed methodology yields an 8% improvement in verification accuracy, while requiring only 25% of the original training data. In doing so, the accuracy gap between skin tone groups was reduced by more than 50%, ultimately leading to a fairer face verification system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incorporating learnings from the MAMMOTH project has enabled us to improve the IDnow face verification system so that we may better address ethnically diverse markets in Europe and beyond.</p>

 A synthetic solution to a real-world problem. 



<p>As the global adoption of biometric face verification systems continues to increase across industries, it’s crucial to ensure that these systems are accurate and fair for all individuals, regardless of skin tone, gender or age. By focusing on designing balanced, ID card-specific training datasets and leveraging synthetic data augmentation techniques, such as style transfer, we can significantly reduce bias and improve the robustness of these models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, without a legal framework to ensure ethical standards are adhered to, even the greatest technological breakthrough will fall short of making a long-lasting social and economic impact. We are proud of the work we are doing to reduce bias in face verification systems and are hopeful that <a href="https://such%20guidance">such guidance</a> will become standard in global regulations, such as the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MAMMOTH project ensured all security measures were followed to protect data and comply with internationally accepted standards and privacy regulations, including GDPR.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing series highlighting key contributors to the House Party Protocol (HPP), we spoke with Terry Kim, CEO of AlphaQuark, a core partner in the HPP ecosystem. AlphaQuark has positioned itself at the intersection of real-world assets (RWA), NFTs, and smart financial infrastructure, delivering tools to bring traditional asset valuation into the on-chain world. In this interview, Terry outlines how AlphaQuark is evolving alongside HPP, and why L2 scalability, AI integration, and cross-chain connectivity are unlocking the next frontier for tokenized assets.</p><p>Q1: How would you describe AlphaQuark’s role within the HPP ecosystem?<br>Terry Kim: AlphaQuark was built with a clear mission: to bridge real-world asset value into the blockchain economy. Within HPP, we act as the asset intelligence layer. We’re building not only tokenization systems but also pricing models, data integration tools, and evaluation protocols that let real-world assets interface with smart contracts. The result is a deeper connection between tangible value and programmable finance. In many ways, we’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that’s about verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: How does AlphaQuark benefit from the transition to HPP Layer 2?<br>Terry Kim: L2 opens up much-needed bandwidth for complex asset logic. Valuation data changes frequently. Compliance checks, liquidity modeling, and even AI-based risk assessments all require more than static smart contracts. HPP Layer 2 gives us the ability to deploy more advanced contract logic and integrate AI agents without bottlenecking performance. It’s the infrastructure upgrade we needed to take AlphaQuark from issuing assets to operating living, evolving asset networks.</p><p>Q3: What is the possible shift for AlphaQuark after the launch of HPP?<br>Terry Kim: HPP marks a major turning point for us. We’ve always focused on building infrastructure for decentralized value, and with HPP Layer 2, we can now do that at scale and with far more sophistication. We’re not pivoting from traditional finance — we’re fully committing to building natively within Web3. This means optimizing for composability, data streaming, and AI-native integrations rather than relying on legacy compatibility. It’s a natural evolution of where we’ve been&nbsp;headed.</p><p>Q4: What makes AlphaQuark uniquely suited to contribute to a unified data and AI-first ecosystem like HPP?<br>Terry Kim: We’re already working with datasets that traditional DeFi protocols can’t handle: appraisal records, legal certificates, and real-world transaction history. Bringing these into the HPP ecosystem means integrating them with AI agents and verifiers. It also means building a common language for “what is valuable” across both human institutions and autonomous protocols. That’s a challenge we’re trying to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Q5: What are some specific industries where AlphaQuark’s RWA infrastructure is seeing the most traction?<br>Terry Kim: Real estate is a big one, not just tokenizing properties, but bringing appraisal logic, loan terms, and insurance factors on-chain. We’re also seeing interest from insurance platforms, IP marketplaces, and even ESG data providers. They all need trust-minimized ways to package and transfer value. That’s what we will&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Q6: How is AlphaQuark leveraging smart contracts for asset valuation, and how will this evolve with L2?<br>Terry Kim: Right now, we use smart contracts to define valuation rules and create standardized RWA token formats. With HPP L2, we’ll be able to dynamically update those contracts with AI-supplied data. Imagine smart contracts that evolve based on real-time economic indicators, appraisal updates, or audit streams. We also see tremendous potential in AI-powered oracles, which can serve as a dynamic verification and data delivery layer for valuation logic. This will give RWAs a much more intelligent and adaptive pricing mechanism.</p><p>Q7: How do you approach data validation and compliance when bridging off-chain assets on-chain?<br>Terry Kim: We apply a mix of off-chain attestations, oracles, and verified issuers. The HPP ecosystem dramatically improves this with W3DB’s Verification-as-a-Service and Booost’s identity frameworks. That’s the beauty of an integrated ecosystem: we don’t have to build everything ourselves—we just connect to other verified components.</p><p>Q8: How do you see AlphaQuark integrating AI and autonomous agents?<br>Terry Kim: In two ways. First, AI will help process valuation data faster, especially in volatile or emerging markets. Second, autonomous agents can execute strategies like rebalancing asset portfolios, flagging suspicious price anomalies, or even initiating compliance actions. The endgame is programmable value, and AI is the logic layer that makes that&nbsp;real.</p><p>Q10: In 3–5 years, what role do you hope AlphaQuark will play in the future of on-chain finance?<br>Terry Kim: I hope we become the trusted layer for pricing and packaging real-world value. Whether it’s a digital twin of an asset, a structured NFT portfolio, or an AI-driven risk model, I want AlphaQuark to be the valuation oracle that DeFi and TradFi both trust. That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><blockquote>We’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that involves verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-interview-with-alphaquark-ceo-on-real-world-assets-in-the-age-of-hpp-41b144c8f753">Open House: Interview with AlphaQuark CEO on Real-World Assets in the Age of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>That’s not a defense of centralization; it is a challenge to how we think about centralization vs decentralization, and how we define progress in enterprise systems and platform design. In tech, success is often framed in terms of scale, speed, and adoption. The bigger you grow, the more central you become. And we rarely stop to ask: Is that centralization a feature… or a failure of imagination?</p>



<p>This is the third post in a series about decentralization in enterprise systems, not as an ideal, but as a spectrum of tradeoffs we all navigate:</p>



 
 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/04/29/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a>, I argued that flexibility is more valuable than ideological purity. We need systems that can move between centralized and decentralized states. 



 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/cost-of-decentralization/">How Decentralized Are You Willing to Pay For?</a>, I explored what that flexibility actually costs in time, money, tooling, and culture. 
 



<p>Today, I want to take a step back and ask: Why is it so hard to justify decentralization in the first place? What are we really rewarding when we call a system “successful”?</p>



 Success Metrics That Skew Centralized 



<p>Let’s be honest: most of our current incentives favor centralization. Consider how we measure success in enterprise or platform strategy:</p>



 
 Market share → the more users you serve, the more value you’re assumed to create 



 Efficiency → fewer systems, fewer teams, tighter control 



 Reliability → built-in resilience that looks like robustness, even when it’s just concentration 



 Governance → top-down visibility, fast decision-making, single owners 
 



<p>These are all perfectly reasonable goals. But these goals bias us toward consolidation. And once centralized systems become dominant, they become self-reinforcing; technically, economically, and even culturally.</p>



<p>That said, even centralized dominance is rarely permanent. In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1587956.Clockspeed_?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=OMLFbrDB1m&amp;rank=1">Clockspeed</a> (have you read that book? No? You should.), Charles Fine argues that competitive advantage, whether it comes from control of the supply chain, platform dominance, or speed to market, is always temporary. The faster your environment moves, the more critical it becomes to reconfigure quickly. That makes modular systems, distributed governance, and optionality not just design preferences, but survival traits.</p>



<p>In that light, centralization might get you to success, but it won’t keep you there.</p>



 What’s the Alternative? Success as a Balancing Act  



<p>So let’s ask a different question:</p>



 
 What if success isn’t just about growth, but instead about sustaining healthy tension between centralized power and distributed control? 
 



<p>That’s what good governance often looks like. It’s not pure autonomy or rigid hierarchy. It’s a structure that lets people collaborate without collapsing into uniformity.</p>



<p>This isn’t a utopian call for federating all the things. It’s a call to recognize when centralization is helping and when it’s masking fragility, dependency, or misalignment.</p>



<p>We decentralize within organizations all the time:</p>



 
 We spin up new product teams 



 We delegate budget and decision-making to local units 



 We distribute accountability through OKRs and KPIs 
 



<p>But we do it with clear guardrails, shared incentives, and coordination models. In those cases, decentralization is seen as a sign of maturity, not a threat.</p>



<p>So why do we treat infrastructure decentralization like chaos? (Probably because we don’t do it well, but we can fix that.)</p>



 What This Means for Architecture (and the Org Chart) 



<p>If we accept that centralization is often the default path, not necessarily the best one, then we need to build systems that allow for intentional divergence.</p>



<p>That means:</p>



 
 Designing systems that don’t break when more than one authority exists 



 Structuring metrics to reward adaptability, not just consolidation 



 Treating decentralization not as risk, but as a capacity for complexity 
 



<p>And yes, it also means knowing when centralization is a good choice because it simplifies the right things, not everything.</p>



 Rethinking the Goal 



<p>You don’t need to decentralize your stack into a thousand services. (Good gravy, can you even imagine the insanity?) But you do need to ask:</p>



<p>Are we building systems that grow toward concentration by default because that’s easier to explain, easier to pitch, or easier to measure? Or are we designing for the kinds of success that hold space for flexibility, autonomy, and resilience?</p>



<p>If centralization is the only outcome we allow ourselves to count, we’re optimizing for a world where fragility just looks like efficiency … until it doesn’t. </p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hey everybody, welcome back. This is the third episode in our series on centralization and decentralization, and the balance between the two.</p>



<p>If you’re just tuning in now, here’s what you’ve missed:</p>



 
 In episode one, we explored why resilience isn’t about being centralized or decentralized. It’s about being able to move between the two models when circumstances change. 



 In episode two, we looked at the real cost of building that kind of flexibility. Because optionality isn’t free. It takes planning, coordination, and a willingness to invest before you need it. 
 



 



 Why Is Decentralization a Hard Sell? 



<p>[00:01:01]<br>And that brings us to today’s topic. Why is decentralization often still such a hard sell, especially inside enterprises?</p>



<p>[00:01:09]<br>One answer is because most of our success metrics reward centralization.</p>



<p>[00:01:15]<br>If we don’t challenge how we’re defining success, we’re going to keep optimizing for systems that look great—right up until the point that they don’t.</p>



 



 Centralization and Scale 



<p>[00:01:22]<br>Let’s talk about that in tech. We don’t just love things at scale; we know how to do things at scale fairly well.</p>



<p>[00:01:31]<br>When we’re working with centralized systems, we know the playbook:</p>



 
 Throw more hardware at it 



 Replicate the databases 



 Spin things up in other regions 



 Set up failovers, caching, and routing magic to absorb traffic 
 



<p>And that totally works—up to a point. Even when control is centralized, we’re very good at scaling the infrastructure around it.</p>



<p>[00:01:50]<br>When it comes to decentralized models, we know how to do that too. We just don’t plan that way as often.</p>



<p>[00:01:56]<br>At least not anymore. Think about the protocols from the early days of the Internet: DNS, BGP, SMTP. They’re not flawless or simple, but they work at global scale because they were built to distribute control and survive failure.</p>



<p>[00:02:14]<br>Everyone gets a piece of the responsibilities in those protocols. Everyone can operate within a shared structure. That’s decentralized centralization, and we did it really well.</p>



 



 The Problem with Success Metrics 



<p>[00:02:25]<br>But now, today’s challenge: most of the success metrics we use today, especially in enterprise systems, still push us towards centralization.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>Why? Because it looks faster, is easier to explain, and is a lot easier to report on.</p>



<p>[00:02:40]<br>But when success is only measured by how tightly we can control the system, we end up building architectures that aren’t particularly flexible. And that’s a problem.</p>



 



 Centralization Helped Us Grow—But Does It Still? 



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Now let’s step back for a moment. You might be thinking, “Well, yes, but centralization is what helped us grow as a company, helped us grow at speed.” And yes, you are absolutely right. Centralization often is what helps organizations move fast, simplify complexity, and work at scale. It gives you:</p>



 
 Clean handoffs 



 Predictable systems 



 Fewer moving parts 



 Optimized performance without needing to get everyone to agree on everything 
 



<p>And when you’re trying to move quickly, those things are real advantages.</p>



<p>[00:03:19]<br>But the thing is, those advantages—whether from your infrastructure perspective or your market perspective—don’t last forever.</p>



<p>[00:03:30]<br>Markets might shift, regulations might change, vendor lock-in might become a liability, and the systems that helped you grow start to hold you back.</p>



<p>[00:03:40]<br>There’s a great idea from supply chain strategy that applies here: the faster your environment moves, the more important it becomes to reconfigure quickly.</p>



<p>[00:03:48]<br>And that’s where centralized success starts to crack—not because it failed technically, but because it couldn’t adapt fast enough.</p>



<p>[00:03:56]<br>So the question isn’t, “Didn’t centralization help us grow?” It’s, “Can we keep growing without the ability to be a little bit more flexible?”</p>



 



 Decentralization in Organizations 



<p>[00:04:07]<br>It’s kind of funny—we decentralize all the time, but just not when it comes to our infrastructure and definitely not our identity infrastructures.</p>



<p>Inside organizations, we break up control and distribute responsibility on purpose:</p>



 
 Teams have their own budgets 



 Product groups make roadmap decisions 



 Key performance indicators are set at the department level, not just at the company level 
 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Why? Because trying to control everything from the top down slows you down. It’s more sustainable to align goals than to micromanage every function.</p>



<p>Take a typical enterprise product org as an example. One team focuses on mobile, another on partner integrations, a third on internal tooling. Each team moves independently within shared priorities. They don’t all escalate to the CIO to push code; they’re trusted to make decisions locally based on their goals and context. We don’t call that chaos—we call that autonomy and maturity.</p>



<p>[00:05:05]<br>Think of it like a city: every neighborhood has its own character, maybe its own rules, but they follow the same traffic lights, zoning laws, public services. That’s decentralization with coordination.</p>



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The control, to an extent, is distributed. If we can do this with people and even in governments—if we can handle distributed authority in complex orgs—why does decentralizing infrastructure sometimes feel so risky? It’s not because we can’t do it. It’s because we haven’t applied the same thinking to systems that we apply to teams of people.</p>



 



 Building Flexibility into Identity 



<p>[00:05:42]<br>If centralization has been our default version of success, what does success look like when you build in the flexibility to decentralize?</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>It doesn’t mean blowing up your current architecture, because that would probably be bad and you wouldn’t get very far.</p>



<p>[00:05:56]<br>It doesn’t mean ditching your identity provider or rebuilding everything from scratch, because that also wouldn’t make you very popular and probably wouldn’t get you very far. But it does mean designing for modularity and movement.</p>



<p>[00:06:07]<br>A successful, flexible identity system might include:</p>



 
 Federated logins that work across partners but don’t collapse if one party changes their trust model 



 Credential issuance that’s anchored to your core directory but usable outside your domain 



 Policy enforcement that supports delegation, so different teams or regions can adapt without rewriting global configurations 



 Flexible authentication layers that can shift to support new protocols without breaking legacy systems 
 



<p>[00:06:42]<br>Another good example of flexible identity systems that don’t require a centralized focus.</p>



<p>[00:06:49]<br>Ask yourself in your organization:</p>



 
 Can you change identity providers without breaking logins for 50,000 users? 



 Can you delegate trust without rerouting everything through one central system? 
 



<p>[00:07:03]<br>Are you prepared to adapt when legal or business requirements shift, or will you end up frozen and need to make a plan on the fly?</p>



<p>[00:07:14]<br>Being able to say “yes” to those things—that’s what success with flexibility looks like.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You don’t have to decentralize everything—and probably shouldn’t. But if your architecture can accommodate controlled divergence and flexibility, you’re set up for long-term success.</p>



<p>[00:07:43]<br>That’s what matters. That’s what’s really cool.</p>



<p>[00:07:46]<br>Here’s the takeaway from today.</p>



<p>[00:07:50]<br>Centralization isn’t the enemy. But if success only counts as scale, simplicity, or speed, that story can get brittle quickly.</p>



<p>[00:08:03]<br>We already know how to decentralize in our org charts and delegate decisions without chaos. We just haven’t always brought that thinking into our infrastructure and identity systems—but we could.</p>



<p>[00:08:15]<br>Success doesn’t have to mean one system to rule them all. It can mean systems that adapt without starting over. That adaptability only works when you’ve got governance built in to support it.</p>



<p>[00:08:30]<br>Our technology is almost good enough—sometimes more than good enough. But shared control takes more than configuration files. It takes structure, accountability, and intention.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:08:53]<br>And remember, resilient systems don’t just run well—they recover well and grow on purpose.</p>

We had ambitious timelines, and as is often the case with complex projects, the path has had its twists and turns.

We had these grand ambitions in Berlin, thinking we’d have much more to share publicly by now, and that hasn’t quite happened. I’m interested in discussing what we bumped into. What were our blockers? We’ve still made progress, but what prohibited us from moving as quickly as we initially thought?</p><p>Gurden: I can start… I think the process, looking back, has been very human. Let’s be honest, this period, at least in Berlin, had holidays almost every week. Arianna took some time off, and I think some of us got sick. So, if we’re slow, that’s one reason. But secondly, and this was a blessing in disguise for me as the newest team member, I got time for my mind to slowly digest everything. Arianna and I talked about this — this pace allowed our perspective to mould in a nice way, rather than forcing something out.</p><p>I’m very happy that after our workshop, we published the first blog and got a really good signal. Many people commented, liked, and shared it on LinkedIn, and some reached out directly via email. That itself shows what we’re building is on a good path. Then you, Michelle, who is working painstakingly on the Many-to-Many System mega model and documenting your thought process — stopping at key milestones and briefing us. This allowed all three of us to bounce ideas off each other, crystallising, and navigating as we go. Arianna and I started wireframing, which is our way to think out loud, understand, and prioritise.</p><p>But, there’s so much content, so we asked a question to try and help us simply and hone into the real essence — “What needs to be on the homepage?” We started with the journey from the workshop, and we’re evolving. Our first wireframe to what we have now — it’s becoming very tangible. The tangibility has increased a lot since the workshop. It’s getting more visual and taking on a website-like frame. My feedback on the earlier design was that there was too much, maybe 10 buttons, and now it’s becoming more focused. That’s definitely positive. As a coder, I can imagine how we’ll set up the system, the database. I’m looking forward to validating it with other human&nbsp;beings.</p>Thinking through prototyping, going from stories to wireframing steps in the narration<p>Arianna: I can go next. After the workshop, we came to realise how complex it is to navigate the vast amount of information we’re dealing with, especially when it comes to understanding what a person wants, and what they’re struggling with or needing. These two aspects are deeply intertwined, but they unfold across many layers of&nbsp;detail.</p><p>At one point, we found ourselves with a triple navigation system, full of sub-navigations. It became clear that this structure, instead of helping, would likely add confusion; even for someone already familiar with the content but searching for something specific.</p><p>Therefore we spent a lot of time rethinking categorization and identifying different types of information. We started asking: is this one website, one narration explanation? Or could we introduce a double narration including tools and needs? That’s when it clicked — we actually need stories. Not just technical explanations or dry structures.</p><p>The knowledge Michelle, Annette, and Angela bring is full of stories — rich, lived, and layered. And stories are powerful, especially for someone new to a platform. They provide orientation, connection, and&nbsp;meaning.</p><p>Michelle: I want to quickly revisit what you were saying, Gurden, about the time to digest. It’s fascinating, and I’m making a meta-point here. I’ve been trying to digest everything we’ve learned over the past multiple years into our Many-to-Many System. In almost every fifth slide, I’m thinking, “We didn’t all have enough time to digest this at the time we were doing it.” And I’ve realised that’s a key point because of so many unfulfilled potentials. It created a real centralisation because if the whole collaboration didn’t fully understand what was going on, knowledge tended to centralize back into a few people. So, at the end of the day, learning happens at the pace humans can learn, mixed in with all the other stuff they have going on in their lives. As a meta-reflection, we just have to keep reminding ourselves that no matter how good the structures or digital tools are, a collaboration is ultimately about humans. That’s always going to be a&nbsp;factor.</p><p>In terms of the process of building this system, I liked what both of you were saying about refinement, categorization, and creating intelligent information architectures. How do we make this so that someone can actually enter this world and find their way around? For me, that has been the hardest part — consistently zooming in and zooming out. Thinking about something at the highest conceptual, strategic level, all the way down to what we learned, how we structured it, and then how we put this information onto a website where people know what button to push. This is a very wide-spanning problem&nbsp;space.</p><p>The last thing is this concept Arianna alluded to: we’ve been bouncing ideas around. The three of us have been pushing ahead in our own parts but checking in regularly. Frankly, without those check-in moments, none of this could have progressed. It’s so dense that it needs more than one brain on it at a time to untangle&nbsp;it.</p>Bouncing ideas around, but with precise meaning and positionalities<p>Gurden: Yes, what both of you said resonates with me. We’re calling it “systems,” but humans are at the center and heart of everything. That’s who we’re making it for. In our wireframing, we concluded that the first thing is the mindset people are coming from, and then we came to stories because that’s what humans connect&nbsp;with.</p><p>It’s been great having you both to bounce ideas and discuss any confusion. But I’ll highlight this as a challenge as well: when we put this website out, there will be one brave person going through it by themselves, most likely. How this website gives that companionship is something we’ve been thinking about. We’ve used words like “guide” and “field guide.” Maybe the brand and design should embody this — like, “Hey, we’re here, we understand it’s a hard, human thing, and we’re here to&nbsp;help.”</p><p>Michelle: Maybe that’s a great place to kind of end this blog? By asking, has anyone seen that done well? Does anyone know of any really great digital spaces that are trying to be a guide to help people navigate complex information, especially in a collaborative or shared, multi-person context? I&nbsp;haven’t.</p><p>Gurden: A lot of sites have that chatbot thing pop up on the right. I absolutely hate it; for me, that is not the answer. Maybe the bot is getting smarter with AI, but I don’t think that’s enough for our&nbsp;case.</p><p>Arianna: It’s about creating an ongoing, embodied story. One that offers orientation, not just information. At the same time, it needs to provide usable tools. So there’s a dual role: guiding through narrative, and supporting through function.</p><p>Not just about simplifying the complexity, but offering clarity and companionship within&nbsp;it.</p><p>On that note, we’ll pause this reflection. The journey continues, and the challenge of creating a truly supportive and navigable digital space for complex collaboration is one we’re embracing. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

@Thales

<p><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today announced the release of the <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-threat-report">2025 Thales Data Threat Report</a>, its annual report on the latest data security threats, trends, and emerging topics based on a survey conducted by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research of more than 3,100 IT and security professionals in 20 countries across 15 industries. This year’s report found that nearly 70% of organizations view the rapid pace of AI development1 —particularly in generative AI—as the leading security concern related to its adoption, followed by lack of integrity (64%) and trustworthiness (57%). ​ </p>
<p>The 2025 Thales Data Threat Report results reveal a major focus on the transformative impact of AI, especially GenAI, which relies heavily on high-quality, sensitive data for functions like training, inference, and content generation. As agentic AI emerges, ensuring data quality becomes even more critical for enabling sound decision-making and actions by AI systems. Many organizations are already adopting GenAI, with a third of respondents indicating it is either being integrated or is actively transforming their operations. </p>
<p>Organizations Embrace GenAI, Taking on Greater Security Risks Amid Rapid Adoption</p>
<p>As GenAI introduces complex data security challenges and offers strategic opportunities to strengthen defenses, its growing integration marks a shift among organizations from experimentation to more mature, operational deployment. While most respondents said rapid adoption of GenAI is their top security concern, respondents in the more advanced stages of AI adoption aren’t waiting to fully secure their systems or optimize their tech stacks before forging ahead. Because the drive to achieve rapid transformation often outweighs efforts to strengthen organizational readiness, these organizations may be inadvertently creating their own biggest security vulnerabilities. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The fast-evolving GenAI landscape is pressuring enterprises to move quickly, sometimes at the cost of caution, as they race to stay ahead of the adoption curve,” Eric Hanselman, Chief Analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research, said. “Many enterprises are deploying GenAI faster than they can fully understand their application architectures, compounded by the rapid spread of SaaS tools embedding GenAI capabilities, adding layers of complexity and risk.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Seventy-three percent of respondents report investing in AI-specific security tools, either through new budgets or by reallocating existing resources. Those prioritizing AI security are diversifying their approaches: over two-thirds have acquired tools from their cloud providers, three in five are leveraging established security vendors, and nearly half are turning to new or emerging startups. Notably, security for generative AI has quickly risen as a top spending priority, securing the second spot in ranked-choice voting, just behind cloud security. This shift underscores the growing recognition of AI-driven risks and the need for specialized defenses to mitigate them.</p>
<p>Data Breaches Show Modest Decline, Though Threats Remain Elevated</p>
<p>While data breaches remain a significant concern, their frequency has slightly decreased over the past few years. In 2021, 56% of surveyed enterprises reported experiencing a breach, but that figure has dropped to 45% in 2025. Additionally, the percentage of respondents reporting a breach within the last 12 months has fallen from 23% in 2021 to just 14% in 2025. </p>
<p>Malware continues to lead as the most prevalent threat, maintaining its top position since 2021. Phishing climbed to second place, overtaking ransomware, which now ranks third. When it comes to the most concerning threat actors, external sources dominate—hacktivists hold the top spot, followed by nation-state actors. Human error, while still significant, has dropped to third, down one position from the previous year. </p>
<p>Vendors Pressed on Post-Quantum Readiness as Encryption Strategies Are Reassessed </p>
<p>The 2025 Thales Data Threat Report reveals that most organizations are increasingly concerned about quantum-related security risks. The top threat, cited by 63% of respondents, is future encryption compromise—the risk that quantum computers could eventually break current or future encryption algorithms, exposing data once considered secure. Close behind, 61% identified key distribution vulnerabilities, where quantum advancements could undermine the secure exchange of encryption keys. Additionally, 58% highlighted the “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) threat, where encrypted data intercepted today could be decrypted in the future. In response, half of organizations are assessing their encryption strategies, and 60% are actively prototyping or evaluating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) solutions. Only one-third, however, are placing their trust in telecom or cloud providers to manage the transition. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The clock is ticking on post-quantum readiness. It’s encouraging that three out of five organizations are already prototyping new ciphers, but deployment timelines are tight and falling behind could leave critical data exposed,” Todd Moore, Global Vice President, Data Security Products at Thales, said. “Even with clear timelines for transitioning to PQC algorithms, the pace of encryption change has been slower than expected due to a mix of legacy systems, complexity, and the challenge of balancing innovation with security.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While this year’s survey results indicate improvements in security posture, much more is needed to elevate operational data security to fully support the capabilities of emerging technologies such as GenAI and to pave the way for future innovations.</p>

 What is the problem with the higher education credentials verification? 



<p>Weeks of time-consuming, error-prone effort shouldn’t be required to verify academic records. But from 2022 to 2025:</p>



 
 \$600 M+ lost annually to fabricated diplomas. 



 5–14 days for each manual verification. 



 Under 50 % of universities use multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



 Higher Education Degree and Certification Datacheck: 



<p>This article illustrates how decentralized identity (SSI) and Extrimian’s solutions eliminate these pain points with real-world numbers, self-evident steps, and a path to instant, fraud-proof verification.</p>



 



 1. Why traditional Verification System Fails? 



 1.1 Credential Fraud Runs Wild 



 
 \$600 M+ lost each year to fake or altered diplomas. 



 30 % of job candidates forge degrees on resumes (<a href="https://www.resumebuilder.com/resume-examples/1-4-americans-have-lied-on-their-resume/" title="">ResumeBuilder, 2023</a>). 
 



 1.2 Manual, Slow Workflows 



 
 5–14 days per transcript or diploma order. 



 $20–$30 fee per manual verification. 
 



 1.3 Security &amp; Compliance Loopholes 



 
 Centralized databases are easy targets. 



 Less than 50 % MFA implementation (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 



 Email and fax expose personal data to interception.

 2. What is Decentralized Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity decentralizes control: credentials live in students’ digital wallets, not in some central silo.</p>



 
 Fraud-proof: Cryptographic signatures keep out tampering. 



 Instant verification: Verify authenticity in seconds. 



 Selective disclosure: Reveal only what’s needed (e.g., “Graduated 2025” without full transcript). 



 Built-in compliance: Complies with GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD by design.

 Why Phishing-Resistant MFA Isn’t Optional Anymore  
<p>The escalating sophistication of phishing and social engineering attacks has pushed organizations towards stronger authentication methods. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly solutions leveraging FIDO2/WebAuthn standards, is a big leap forward in security posture.<br><br>Many organizations utilize hardware-based FIDO2 authenticators like YubiKeys by Yubico, widely recognized as a gold standard for physical tokens, preventing credential theft and account takeover at the point of authentication. Deploying any security key represents a serious commitment to security, effectively neutralizing threats that rely on stolen passwords or easily intercepted one-time codes.</p>  
 The Broader Picture of Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
Achieving true end-to-end security requires a strategy that extends beyond the initial implementation of phishing-resistant authentication methods. While these methods are a critical defense, organizations often discover that phishing-resistant authentication&nbsp;
alone
&nbsp;is not enough to address all security and operational aspects.
<br>
Specifically, when deploying physical hardware authenticators, which are a common way to achieve strong phishing resistance, organizations can encounter significant operational complexities.<br><br>These "Day 2 problems" involve managing these physical tokens across their entire lifecycle, a challenge that can be particularly acute within large or widely distributed teams. It’s important to understand that these are not shortcomings of any particular brand of hardware authenticator, but rather inherent complexities in managing any physical security hardware at scale
<br> 
 Challenge 1: Secure Onboarding and YubiKey Provisioning  
<p>Getting the right key into the hands of the right user securely is the critical first step.</p> 
  
  The Identity Verification Imperative: Before a YubiKey is issued (in person or shipped), organizations must be certain of the recipient's identity. Standard procedures may not suffice, especially for remote workers. How do you reliably verify someone you've never met?  
  Risk of Mis-Provisioning: Relying on known weak checks like email or simple attestations (KBA) creates risk. An incorrectly provisioned key compromises the entire security model from the start, potentially handing access directly to an attacker impersonating a new employee.  
  
 Challenge 2: Navigating Ongoing Identity Lifecycle Management  
<p>The physical nature of YubiKeys introduces critical ongoing management needs.</p> 
  
  Loss, Theft, Damage, and Lockouts: YubiKeys can be lost, stolen, damaged, or even locked due to too many failed PIN attempts or forgotten credentials. Each of these scenarios requires a secure recovery process, particularly for remote users.  
  Administrative Overhead: Tracking inventory, managing assignments, handling secure revocation for lost/stolen tokens or for departing employees, and ensuring firmware updates add complexity and usually require manual processes to avoid security gaps.  
  
 Challenge 3: Phishable Recovery Methods Undermine Security  
<p>Perhaps the most significant challenge arises when a user loses their YubiKey, especially if it's their primary or even sole FIDO2 authenticator.</p> 
  
  The Recovery Conundrum: YubiKeys are designed to be resistant to remote attacks. This strength means recovery processes must not create a weak link that attackers can circumvent.  
  The Pitfall of Phishable Fallbacks: In the case of a lost YubiKey, reverting back to easily phished methods like SMS/voice OTPs, email links, or security questions for recovery completely undermines the security gains provided by the YubiKey. Attackers know to target these weak recovery paths.  
  The Need for Verified Recovery: A truly secure system requires a recovery process that incorporates strong, multi-factor identity verification. Only after strong identity assurance should you allow legitimate users to regain access or register a new key. This will keep the door closed to social engineering or deepfake attacks.  
  
 YubiKeys Need Integrated Credential Management and Identity Verification  
<p>This guide explores how integrating a dedicated identity assurance platform like HYPR can effectively bridge these management and identity verification gaps. By complementing your Yubico deployment, HYPR helps manage these credentials in your environment and integrates &nbsp;multi-factor identity verification into the key lifecycle moments, ensuring your investment in phishing-resistant hardware delivers its full security potential.</p> 
<p>Let's see how the HYPR Identity Assurance platform addresses the gaps.</p> 
 Secure Onboarding and Hiring with Candidate Verification  
<p>How do you confidently issue a powerful security key like a YubiKey to a new employee, especially one working remotely, without creating an undue security risk or friction? Legacy methods relying on KBA, email verification, manager approvals, or even just shipping a key to a home address lack the level of identity verification needed, to be sure you don’t fall victim to a social engineering attack.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s customizable Identity Verification (IDV) integrates directly into your onboarding flow, before any credentials, including a YubiKey, are provisioned. This isn't just a simple check; this verification involves multiple checks of various factors, in a layered approach, that is tailored exactly to your organization's risk tolerance:</p> 
 Device Check  
<p>HYPR first detects the device the user is on to do the verification, and can check if it is the expected device.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>A geolocation location detection is performed and compared against expected location. Radius distance from expected location can be customized.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Users are prompted to scan a government-issued ID (driver's license, passport) using their smartphone. HYPR analyzes the document for authenticity, checking security features and tampering evidence, and checks the validity of the document against national databases.</p> 
 Biometric Facial Recognition  
<p>To ensure the person presenting the ID is its rightful owner, HYPR employs facial biometric matching, comparing a live selfie capture to the photo on the ID document or in your own data stores. Additionally, liveness detection prevents spoofing attempts while using photos or videos.</p> 
 Manager Attestation  
<p>Combine live video verification and a secure chat, seamless experience human verification transaction. Supervisors or IT can attest to the identity of their team members, adding an extra layer of assurance.</p> 
 Example: Onboarding with HYPR  
<p>Imagine a new remote hire receives an onboarding link on their first day. They are guided through the HYPR identity verification. Only upon successful verification is their identity confirmed, allowing subsequent steps like registering their primary authentication methods, like their assigned YubiKey.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This process securely binds the verified physical identity to the digital identity and the associated credentials. It drastically reduces the risk of provisioning keys to fraudulent accounts and establishes a trusted foundation for the user's entire lifecycle.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Build Phishing-Resistant Account Recovery Workflows  
<p>As mentioned previously, the security gains of YubiKeys are instantly nullified if a user who loses their key can recover their account using phishable methods like SMS OTPs, email links, or knowledge-based answers (KBAs). We know attackers actively target these weak recovery paths at the help desk or user levels.</p> 
<p>HYPR eliminates this vulnerability by ensuring recovery processes maintain the same high level of security as primary authentication. When a user needs to recover access (e.g., after losing their YubiKey), they leverage other already registered and verified strong authentication factors managed by HYPR as well as a re-verification of identity:</p> 
 Multi-Factor Recovery  
<p>Recovery typically involves using the HYPR mobile application on a registered smartphone, protected by device biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint) or a secure PIN, potentially combined with other factors or contextual checks depending on policy. Should more identity assurance be needed, HYPR can also push the user through an identity re-verification process.</p> 
 Self-Service Enablement  
<p>To reduce the burden on IT teams, users can securely initiate recovery themselves through a guided, secure workflow, often without needing costly or time-consuming help desk intervention.</p> 
<p>In cases where a YubiKey is lost, damaged, or needs to be replaced, users can quickly register a new device once their identity is re-verified through a secure recovery flow.</p> 
<p>For scenarios where a device is locked, for instance after too many failed PIN attempts or a forgotten PIN, recovery can still be handled efficiently through a help-desk–driven approach. With HYPR Affirm, this process is safeguarded by strong identity verification, ensuring only the rightful user regains access.<br>Account recovery becomes as resistant to phishing and social engineering as the initial login, preserving the integrity of the entire security system. This directly addresses the most significant operational and security pain points associated with hardware token deployments.</p> 
 Beyond Login: Contextual Awareness and Continuous Authentication  
 Dynamic Trust  
<p>Security isn't static. HYPR can optionally integrate risk signals from devices, users, and browsers, to provide continuous authentication and adaptive access control, even after a successful YubiKey login.</p> 
 Risk Signals  
<p>Factors like device health (e.g., integrating with endpoint detection and response tools like CrowdStrike), geographic location ("impossible travel" scenarios), network reputation, and even behavioral signals can inform a real-time risk score.</p> 
 Adaptive Risk Policies  
<p>Based on this score, HYPR can dynamically adjust security requirements. A low-risk login might proceed seamlessly after the initial YubiKey tap, while a higher-risk scenario could trigger a request for an additional factor or limit access privileges. This allows organizations to balance security posture with user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Streamline YubiKey Management: From Friction to Flow  
 User-Driven YubiKey Enrollment &amp; Renewal  
<p>HYPR turns YubiKey onboarding into a self-service experience. End users pair their YubiKeys, automatically enroll X.509 certificates, and enjoy seamless certificate renewals, with no routine IT involvement required and continuous access guaranteed.</p> 
 Bird’s-Eye Admin Visibility  
<p>While day-to-day enrollment and renewals run themselves, HYPR’s Console Integration gives administrators a consolidated dashboard of every YubiKey enrollment, certificate status, and recent identity verification events. This eliminates the need for spreadsheets point tools.</p> 
 Graceful Deprovisioning  
<p>Rather than manually “removing” keys from the admin console (which doesn’t revoke the certificate on the device), HYPR enable endpoint-driven deprovisioning. Users retire lost or retired keys directly from their workstation, ensuring true on-device certificate removal when possible.</p> 
 Resilient Multi-Factor Backup  
<p>Users can register multiple authenticators as primary and backup. YubiKeys plus HYPR is an ideal combination, so if one factor goes missing, users still authenticate securely through another, dramatically cutting lockouts and support tickets.</p> 
 Achieve End-to-End Phishing Resistance with HYPR  
<p>The journey towards zero trust cybersecurity demands more than just deploying strong authentication factors; it requires a holistic approach that secures the entire identity lifecycle. YubiKeys represent a vital component in this strategy, offering unparalleled phishing resistance at the point of login. However, as we've explored, their true potential is only fully unlocked when paired with solutions that address the critical challenges of high-assurance identity verification and streamlined lifecycle management.</p> 
 Key Steps to Optimize Yubikey Deployments  
<p>Moving from understanding these challenges to implementing effective solutions requires a deliberate approach made custom for your environment. As you consider how to optimize your YubiKey deployment or plan a new one, here are some suggested actionable steps to take:</p> 
  
  Assess Your Current Reality: Honestly evaluate your existing processes. 
    
    Where does friction exist in your YubiKey issuance and management?  
    How are you currently handling remote employee onboarding and identity proofing?  
    Map out your current account recovery workflow. Does it rely on phishable factors like SMS or security questions?<br>Identifying these specific pain points is the first step.  
      
  Define Your Identity Assurance Needs: Determine the level of certainty required when verifying identities.&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Is a basic check sufficient, or do compliance regulations and risk levels demand high-assurance methods like biometric verification against government IDs, especially for privileged users?  
      
  Chart the Full User Lifecycle: Document every stage where a user interacts with credentials, particularly YubiKeys. Pinpoint potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in provisioning, replacement, temporary access needs, and deprovisioning.  
  Scrutinize Your Recovery Strategy: This is paramount. If your recovery process undermines your FIDO2 investment, it needs immediate attention. Define requirements for a truly phishing-resistant recovery mechanism.  
  Identify Integration Requirements: List the key systems (your Identity Provider (IdP), HR Information System (HRIS), endpoint security tools) that any management and identity verification solution must seamlessly integrate with.  
  
 Key Questions to Ask Potential Solution Providers  
<p>Armed with your internal assessment, engage vendors with targeted questions to understand how their solutions address these challenges, that are specific to your environment, when integrating with YubiKeys:</p> 
  
  Onboarding &amp; Identity Proofing:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How specifically does your solution verify the identity of remote users before a YubiKey is provisioned to them?  
    What methods (e.g., document scanning, liveness checks, data validation) do you employ to achieve high assurance, and how is this verified identity securely linked to the user's account and key?  
      
  Secure Account Recovery:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Describe your workflow for a user who has lost their YubiKey. Importantly, how do you enable secure, self-service recovery without falling back on phishable factors like SMS, email links, or KBAs?  
    How is phishing resistance maintained throughout?  
      
  Lifecycle Automation:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Explain how your platform automates YubiKey provisioning and deprovisioning by integrating with systems like our IdP based on user lifecycle events (joiners, movers, leavers).  
      
  Lost/Stolen Key Management:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    What is the secure process within your system for handling lost or stolen YubiKeys, including issuing replacements and potentially providing secure temporary access?  
      
  Integration &amp; Visibility:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your solution integrate with [mention your specific IdP, e.g., Okta, Entra ID]?&nbsp;  
    Can it provide a unified administrative view of YubiKeys alongside other authentication methods?  
      
  User Experience:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How do you ensure these necessary security steps (IDV, secure recovery) are implemented with minimal friction for the end-user?  
      
  Scalability &amp; Compliance:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your platform scale to manage potentially thousands of YubiKeys?  
    What specific reporting and audit logs are generated to help meet compliance requirements?

<p>A Real-World Story of Scale, Trust &amp; Blockchain in Action</p>







<p></p>



<p>Earlier this month, over 3.1 million students across Maharashtra received their SSC and HSC exam results online. Dhiway had the opportunity to build and manage the backend infrastructure for this release in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/navneet-education-ltd-/">Navneet Education Limited</a></p>



<p>It was a significant milestone — not just in terms of volume, but because of what it represented:</p>



 
 The need for reliable and fast access 



 The demand for tamper-resistant, verifiable documents 



 And the expectation of a seamless digital experience for every student 
 



 <br>The Task 



<p>Navneet approached us with a clear challenge: Can you help us publish board results for millions of students — quickly, securely, and without system failure?</p>



<p>They also wanted each result document to be verifiable using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> blockchain, to ensure long-term trust and authenticity. This meant handling high user concurrency, delivering fast response times, and ensuring every student could access and download their results without delay.</p>



 <br>Our Approach 



<p>We focused on three core principles: Performance, resilience, and trust.</p>



<p>Here’s how we addressed them:</p>



 
 Cloud-native setup using AWS, with auto-scaling and rate-limiting to manage traffic surges 



 Multi-layer caching to support sub-second response times 



 Client-side rendering, where appropriate, to reduce backend load 



 QR code integration on result PDFs, backed by blockchain hashes 



 Mobile-first design to support access from any device, even in low-bandwidth areas 
 



<p>We also ran extensive load tests with JMeter, simulating double the expected traffic to ensure we were prepared.</p>



Results at scale, delivered with speed and trust — 3.1 M+ students, zero downtime.



<p></p>



<p>Over two separate days of results publication, the system was resilient and provided a positive experience to students anxiously awaiting their results and seeking to download the documents.</p>



 <br>Why Blockchain? 



<p>Every result PDF included a QR code linked to a verifiable digital record anchored on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> Blockchain, built for trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>This ensured that:</p>



 
 Each result document was tamper-resistant 



 Verification could happen instantly, from anywhere, without needing to log into a portal 
 



<p>We didn’t use blockchain as a buzzword. We used it to add real value, adding a layer of trust and permanence to a document that often marks a turning point in a student’s academic journey.</p>



 <br>Key Takeaways 



 
 UX and accessibility are critical – A smooth front-end experience is essential; users only benefit from fast systems if they can easily access and use them. 



 Verification matters – Especially in education, where credentials must be trusted and stand the test of time. 



 Scale is manageable – With the right preparation and infrastructure, even millions of concurrent users can be served reliably. 
 



 <br>Looking Ahead 



<p>This project brought together everything we care about at Dhiway-infrastructure: digital trust and solving meaningful, real-world problems. Together with Navneet and the Maharashtra State Board, the Dhiway team has demonstrated a new way of managing examination results and created a positive experience for the students and their guardians.</p>



<p>If you’re exploring how to deliver results, certificates, or credentials secure and scalable way, we are happy to share what we’ve learned.</p>

Since then, we’ve progressed into deeper development and analysis. Through this process, we’ve revisited our technical assumptions, stress-tested the economics, and re-evaluated how HPP can best scale and integrate into the broader ecosystem.</p><p>After careful consideration, we believe a strategic course correction is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing AIP-22, a proposal to migrate HPP’s infrastructure roadmap from OP Stack to ARB Stack (Arbitrum) and realign HPP’s future with the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p><p>This is not just a launch decision but a long-term directional shift.</p> Why We’re Proposing the Shift from OP Stack to ARB&nbsp;Stack   Performance Flexibility for AI-Driven Use Cases: ARB Stack offers greater control over block time and execution parameters, essential for data-heavy and AI-coordinated workloads. This flexibility allows us to tailor performance as needed, which is especially important as HPP grows beyond traditional smart contracts into intelligent agents and real-time data environments.  Smarter Resource Management: ARB Stack allows for more efficient resource allocation across compute and storage, enabling us to scale HPP without incurring unnecessary overhead. It supports the kind of modular, elastic architecture needed for future-facing protocol&nbsp;design.  Ecosystem Maturity &amp; DeFi Synergy: Arbitrum’s L2 ecosystem is the most active in the space, particularly in DeFi, and aligns closely with HPP’s vision to become a backbone for data, liquidity, and AI infrastructure. Migrating to ARB Stack positions HPP within an already thriving ecosystem and deeply integrated into the broader Ethereum&nbsp;economy.  Network Effects &amp; Onboarding Opportunities: Migrating now allows HPP to tap into a much broader pool of users, developers, partners, and liquidity providers. We see Arbitrum as a key network for onboarding both Web3-native builders and data-first AI projects, which are central to HPP’s&nbsp;mission.  Strategic Collaboration Potential: Our collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs is already underway. This opens up technical alignment and potential access to grant programs, integration support, and co-marketing opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem.   AIP-22 Summary <p>To finalize this shift, we are bringing the decision back to the community through AIP-22. This proposal asks the community to vote on whether HPP should migrate its future development from OP Stack to ARB Stack as its official Layer 2 infrastructure.</p>  Proposal: Confirm ARB Stack (Arbitrum) as the official L2 infrastructure for&nbsp;HPP  Reasoning: Greater technical flexibility, onboarding opportunities, and strong ecosystem alignment  Voting Period: May 21st via Snapshot (<a href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth">https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth</a>)  Eligibility: To participate in the vote, you must hold your <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%24AERGO&amp;src=cashtag_click">$AERGO</a> tokens before 17:00 PM KST / 8:00 AM UTC on May&nbsp;21st.  <p>We recommend participating in the vote using MetaMask, Phantom, or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet.

<p>Maritime trade is of critical importance to the economies of Asia. With Singapore positioned at the heart of major global shipping routes, the need for security at the Straits remains a top priority for the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).</p>
<p>On 28 March 2025, Thales was awarded a contract through ST Engineering (STE) to provide the Republic of Singapore Navy with a Mine Counter Measures system, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/defence-and-security/naval-forces/underwater-warfare/pathmaster-unmanned-mine">Pathmaster</a>, which includes the M-Cube mission management system and TSAS towed sonars combined with the MiMap sonar data analysis tool, which will be fitted on ST Engineering’s unmanned surface vehicle. </p>
<p>Thales will also provide tools to manage mine databases and library. These will be reinforced with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to facilitate target detection and identification, easing the workload of operators. The system will be supported by the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/defence/press_release/thales-local-defence-hub-reinforce-defence-services-capabilities">Thales Singapore Defence Hub</a> for maintenance and service and to develop compatible applications that can seamlessly interface with the RSN’s systems. </p>
<p>As seas become increasingly congested and navies face unexpected threats and challenges, mine countermeasures have become a key discipline to ensure the sovereignty and safety of Singapore’s sea lines of communication. The intelligent system is renowned for its incomparable level of detection and low false alarm rate. The Thales Pathmaster solution is the world’s first sea-proven system and is currently already in service with the British Royal Navy and the French Navy, under the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/defence-and-security/press_release/thales-delivers-worlds-first-autonomous-mine-hunting">Maritime Mine Countermeasure (MMCM)</a> programme. This contract is the first Pathmaster contract for Thales in Asia.</p>
<blockquote><p>"This latest contract award reflects the trust that the Republic of Singapore Navy places in Thales’ naval technologies. The Pathmaster system represents a significant step in the RSN’s vision for an autonomous system of systems, offering enhanced operational capabilities while reinforcing the safety of their personnel. As the first Pathmaster system in the Asian region, Thales strengthens its position as a key supplier to the Navy, addressing the operational needs of the navy in this area. Having successfully delivered multiple radars for major vessel programs in the past, today we are excited to take it a step further to ensure that Singapore stays at the forefront of mine warfare in the region, safeguarding the nation’s maritime routes.” Sébastien Gueremy, VP Underwater Systems, Thales.  </p></blockquote>

<p>“This comprehensive blog post will tell you what ID Document Recognition is, its working scenario, and some benefits.”</p>
<p>Identity verification has become the cornerstone for secure access and online digital transactions. In this era, where cyber threats and data breaches are increasing, agencies and institutions are moving toward the most reliable solutions.</p>
<p>Among them, one of the most critical technologies that fight against such attacks is ID Document Recognition.</p>
<p>Wondering about what this is? If yes! Buckle up! This blog post is for you. In this guide, we will explore everything about this technology, including its overview, working process, and role in online security.</p>
<p>So, let’s proceed further…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition: A Brief Overview 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document recognition SDK</a> is an innovative technology that refers to the process of automatically verifying and identifying personal documents, such as passports, ID cards, and driver’s licenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this process is implemented, agencies and institutions come to know whether such documents presented by a user are real or fake. This innovative technology ensures security enhancement in every field of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition Process 
<p>Now you would probably be thinking, what is the technology behind the ID Document Liveness Detection SDK? To answer your question, we have explored our guide through this section. Read it carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Document Capture 
<p>In this first step, institutions capture high-quality images of documents using scanners or high-resolution cameras. Both the front and the back are captured by this scanner.. It takes a few minutes as documents, as the most important and personal information is engraved on such documents. This first step is also implemented by ensuring the clarity of the documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Extract the Text 
<p>In this second step, the important information engraved on these documents is extracted. As far as our doubt goes, you will surely ask, how such data is extracted from these scanned papers? Right? Luckily, nowadays, we have another innovative technology that is used to extract text from scanned papers. This technology is named <a href="https://picturetotext.info/blog/what-is-ocr-technology">OCR(Optical Character Recognition)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Analyze the Data 
<p>Once the extraction is done, the next step is to analyze and verify the data. The system compares this data against known templates, databases, and pre-configured rules. It verifies whether barcodes and QR codes, Font and layout alignment, and other features are real or fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Liveness Detection And Face Matching 
<p>This is the most important stage of verification in which the presence of the users is ensured. Systems now incorporate liveness detection along with facial recognition ID verification. This facial ID verification identifies whether the users during verification are physically present and using the real ID images or not. This facial ID recognition has two different types. Active liveness detection and passive liveness detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Decision And Result Generation 
<p>After passing through all technical verification steps, the final step is about making the decision and generating the results. If everything is aligned with the valid rules, the agencies or companies mark the documents as authentic and verified. This decision is generated within a few seconds, ensuring the seamless authentication process.</p>
<p></p>
 Why ID Document Recognition Matters? 
<p>In this section, we will throw light on why the <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID document liveness detection SDK</a> matters. There are countless benefits of this technology. We will discuss a few of them below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Fraud Prevention 
 
 
<p>As hinted in the previous sections, this cutting-edge technology is implemented to prevent fraud, especially in finance and educational institutions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Build Customer Trust 
 
 
<p>Once the fraud is prevented, it automatically builds customer trust. They heavily believe in the systems and make their investments without fear of anything.</p>
 
 
 Cost Saving 
 
 
<p>Agencies use a fake ID detector that is budget-friendly. Such detectors eliminate the need for hiring extra security staff. In short, you can add the extra layers of security without breaking your bank.</p>
 
 
 KYC Compliance 
 
 
<p>ID recognition supports compliance with KYC and ensures the customer’s identity. This helps businesses meet regulatory standards, preventing illegal activities.</p>
 
 
 Streamlined Onboarding 
 
 
<p>Automated ID Document verification makes the onboarding process faster and easier for users. This feature reduces friction and improves customers’ overall experience.</p>
<p></p>
 Pros And Cons of ID Document Recognition 
<p>This section of the blog is all about some pros and cons of ID document liveness detection. We will discuss them briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Pros&nbsp; 
<p>This technology prevents fraud concerning spoofing images and videos.</p>
<p>It is used as the international authentication method, not only as a national ID authentication.</p>
<p>The system can confirm the possibilities of information from external registers.</p>
<p>Passwords can be reset using the recheck of selfies and videos.</p>
<p>This technology incorporates AI and ML for better and faster results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cons&nbsp; 
<p>Some solutions require the user’s ID document information to be stored.</p>
<p>The initial registration can sometimes be very difficult.</p>
<p> Agencies need a phone with NFC functionality for chip scanning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Weekly AMAs &amp; Community-Driven Direction <p>As part of our commitment to weekly AMAs, we’re continuing to update the community on progress, direction, and your top questions. This session focused on the upcoming vote, our Layer 2 (L2) direction, ongoing developments around HPP, and a few fun curveball topics from the community.</p> 1. AIP-22 Vote: Building on&nbsp;Arbitrum <p>This week's big announcement was the launch of a Snapshot-based community vote, this time to decide whether Arbitrum will be the foundation for our Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Why Arbitrum?<br>Ben explained the rationale behind this proposed direction:</p>  High transaction volume and network&nbsp;activity  A mature ecosystem with strong infrastructure support  Backing from the Arbitrum Foundation — including marketing and dev coordination  A thriving developer and user community  <blockquote>“We put Arbitrum through rigorous due diligence and compared it with other options. The traction and support were simply unmatched.”</blockquote><p>🗓️ Voting&nbsp;Details:</p>  Make sure your Aergo tokens are in a Snapshot-compatible wallet before May&nbsp;21  The outcome will determine whether Arbitrum becomes the base for Aergo’s new Layer&nbsp;2  <p>The team supports this direction, but it’s ultimately the community’s decision.</p> 2. HPP: What’s Happening Now? <p>We also touched on House Party Protocol (HPP), which marks the public blockchain’s shift into a modern, AI-first architecture.</p><p>The previous vote confirmed:</p>  A token contract&nbsp;upgrade  A new, forward-looking token&nbsp;model  Expand into&nbsp;L2  <p>Ben emphasized that:</p>  The new token(House Party Protocol) will come with a new&nbsp;ticker  A 1:1 token swap will take place in late&nbsp;2025  The Living Roadmap (a public Google Sheet) is available for real-time progress&nbsp;tracking  <blockquote>“HPP isn’t just a rebrand. It’s a major leap forward — aligning us with the future of decentralized AI and intelligent data infrastructure.”</blockquote> 3. What About Aergo’s Enterprise Clients? <p>There was a common question: “Does this mean the enterprise side of Aergo is shutting&nbsp;down?”</p><p>The answer is a clear&nbsp;no.</p>  The Aergo Enterprise Team continues operating  Government and enterprise clients remain unaffected  The changes (vote, token, HPP) are all focused on the public chain&nbsp;only  <blockquote>“Enterprise systems keep running exactly as expected. We’re evolving the public chain — not touching enterprise infrastructure.”</blockquote> 4. Are We Still Focused on&nbsp;Korea? <p>While Aergo has strong roots and visibility in Korea, being listed on all licensed Korean exchanges, the project has always had a global&nbsp;focus.</p><p>Ben clarified:</p>  Aergo is listed on major global platforms like Coinbase and Crypto.com  There’s no “Korea-only” strategy — just strong local trading&nbsp;activity  Future marketing will work to further globalize the&nbsp;brand  <blockquote>“We’re working hard to break the ‘Korean project’ label. Our reach and ambition are&nbsp;global.”</blockquote> 5. AI + Blockchain in Agriculture? Let’s&nbsp;Talk <p>A surprise community question asked about the role of AI and blockchain in farming and agriculture. Here’s what Ben had to&nbsp;say:</p>  AI can monitor crops and livestock 24/7, reducing labor costs and improving food&nbsp;quality  Blockchain enables traceable supply chains, storing data like pesticide usage, logistics, and&nbsp;more  Together, they can optimize farming and distribution with precision  It’s an underexplored but high-potential use case for AI +&nbsp;Web3.   6. Listings: Any&nbsp;News? <p>Inevitably, someone asked about Binance spot listings. Here’s the&nbsp;update:</p>  Token listings are controlled by exchanges, not&nbsp;projects  Paying for listings often leads to bad outcomes for builders, teams, and other stakeholders  Aergo is already re-listed on Binance Futures, as well as many spot markets&nbsp;globally  No new listing news at this&nbsp;time  <blockquote>“We want to be on every trusted platform — but we don’t control listing decisions. No promises, no paid shortcuts.”</blockquote> ✅ Final&nbsp;Words <p>We’re excited about what’s ahead, and your participation makes it all possible. This vote on Arbitrum is a major decision point. It represents a potential new layer of scalability, community alignment, and long-term growth.</p><p>Remember: Get your tokens ready for Snapshot by May 21.<br>Check the Living Roadmap anytime to follow our development progress.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-7-recap-aip-22-vote-arbitrum-l2-and-the-future-of-hpp-7d51bf9a3408">AMA #7 Recap: AIP-22 Vote, Arbitrum L2, and the Future of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Thales inaugurates GenF, a first step towards nuclear fusion energy
prezly

Thu, 05/15/2025 - 12:00


             
 Thales, a global leader in high-power lasers, will inaugurate GenF on Thursday 15 May 2025 in Le Barp (Bordeaux). GenF aims to take a major step toward in developing a new energy source that is safe, abundant, competitive and low-carbon, through inertial confinement nuclear fusion. 
 GenF is working in collaboration with the CEA, CNRS, École polytechnique and the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region to design a first inertial confinement fusion reactor.  
 Thales is contributing its expertise in high-power lasers, developed at its Élancourt site, which enabled the company to build the world’s most powerful laser system, currently in operation in Romania. 
 
<p>Energy production through nuclear fusion is now identified as one of the solutions to address two crucial challenges: the need to reduce global carbon emissions and the ever-increasing energy demand across various sectors of the economy, such as transport, construction, agriculture and the digital industry. According to the IEA (International Energy Agency), electricity consumption by data centres is expected to more than double by 2030, particularly due to the rise of AI.</p>
<p>Nuclear fusion is therefore regarded as a tremendous opportunity to create a new energy source that is safe (it carries no risk of runaway reactions), abundant (its resources are widely available in nature), competitive and low-carbon (it emits no greenhouse gases). Furthermore, nuclear fusion generates one million times less radioactive waste than fission, and this waste can be eliminated more quickly.</p>
<p>To achieve nuclear fusion, extensive research is being carried out on two methods: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The inertial confinement method requires the use of high-energy lasers to compress matter and reach the thermonuclear conditions required for fusion. Significant scientific progress is still needed for this method of energy production to be deployed.</p>
<p>To ensure that France remains one of the pioneering countries in this field, the government, via BPI France, launched a call for projects on "innovative nuclear reactors" in June 2023, under the France 2030 initiative. Drawing on its expertise in high-power lasers, Thales submitted the TARANIS project, in partnership with the CEA, the CNRS and École polytechnique, to demonstrate the feasibility of designing a first inertial confinement nuclear fusion reactor. The project was selected in February 2024, giving it access to a €18,5 million budget for its initial development phase. To bring together the essential complementary expertise, Thales created the company GenF, officially launched in January 2025, and signed a first contract worth several million euros for the development of its fusion laser.</p>
<p>GenF will progress through three development phases:</p>
 
 By 2027, GenF plans a first phase of modelling and simulation, calibrated through experiments on existing facilities such as LMJ; 
 From 2027 to 2035, a second phase will focus on the maturation of fusion technologies such as multiple laser synchronisation, the production of cryogenic targets and the development of new materials for the reactor wall; 
 From 2035, a third phase could lead to the scaling-up of the reactor, with the construction of a first prototype. 
 
<p>GenF currently brings together around ten scientists, engineers and industrial experts and involves about forty people from all the institutions combined. The company will inaugurate its premises in Le Barp (Bordeaux) on Thursday 15 May 2025, with support from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Council—region that already brings together many areas of expertise in nuclear fusion, including the Centre Lasers Intenses et Applications (CELIA – CNRS/University of Bordeaux/CEA) and the Centre d’Études Scientifiques et Techniques d’Aquitaine (CESTA – CEA).</p>
<p>Thales has 40 years of experience in high-power lasers. From design and development to installation, team training and operational support, Thales masters the entire high-power laser expertise chain, which includes laser sources from 10 TW to 10 petawatts, beam transport lines, target focusing optics and quality control systems. Thales has also been active in nuclear fusion for over 25 years, particularly as a lead contractor for subassemblies as part of the Laser Mégajoule programme, a research initiative on inertial confinement fusion developed by the CEA. In addition, at its Vélizy and Thonon sites, Thales develops high-power electronic tubes for magnetic confinement fusion reactors, including for the international ITER demonstrator.</p>

Thu, 05/15/2025 - 11:00


             
 Serbia and Montenegro Air Traffic Services SMATSA will use Thales’s modular Air Traffic Management (ATM) solution, TopSky – ATC One complemented by TopSky – Sequencer powered by AI, to enhance its operational capabilities, optimize air traffic flow management, increase runway capacities, and reduce delays.  
 This future-proof, scalable solution positions SMATSA at the forefront of air traffic management, ensuring safety, efficiency, and sustainability. 
 SMATSA also joins the upgraded TopSky - ATC user group, to help shape the future of ATM systems.

<p>Thales’s TopSky - ATC One offering, complemented by TopSky – Sequencer, will modernize SMATSA’s air navigation infrastructure. It introduces advanced software and features designed to optimize air traffic flow management, maximize runway capacities, and minimize delays. These improvements will not only support SMATSA's operational goals, but will also enhance safety, productivity, and decision-making capabilities across the air traffic network.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that SMATSA selected the TopSky - ATC One offering is its modular, open-architecture design, which ensures that the platform will remain adaptable, scalable, and future-proof. This enables SMATSA to continuously evolve its ATM system, in line with emerging technologies, regulatory requirements, and the ever-growing demands of air traffic management.</p>
<p>SMATSA’s move to the upgraded TopSky - ATC One offering also means joining the group of Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) using Thales’s TopSky – ATC One. This structure fosters collaboration, shared decision-making and ownership. By adopting this collaborative and unified solution, SMATSA can leverage a single baseline product that evolves according to a shared roadmap of future upgrades. This ensures alignment with industry regulations and the collective needs of the air navigation community.</p>
<p>Alongside the technological upgrade, SMATSA is also committed to workforce development. The upgrade will provide extensive market-relevant training and strategic workforce management initiatives, focusing on attracting young talent and improving gender diversity in the aviation sector. As part of its broader inclusivity efforts, SMATSA aims to increase the representation of women in the aviation industry, positioning itself as an employer of choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proud to partner with Thales for this significant upgrade of our air traffic management system,” said Raša Ristivojević, SMATSA CEO. “The TopSky - ATC One system will modernize our operations, allowing us to better manage air traffic and enhance our service quality. This is an important step forward in ensuring SMATSA continues to meet the growing demands of regional traffic, while also investing in our workforce and promoting inclusivity in the sector.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We are excited to see SMATSA adopt our TopSky - ATC One offering, a solution that will keep them at the forefront of air navigation services,” said Youzec Kurp, Vice President of Airspace Mobility Solutions at Thales. “This upgrade demonstrates SMATSA’s commitment to technological innovation, operational excellence, and its vision for a sustainable, future-ready air traffic management system.”</p></blockquote>

  Thales powers one million digital payment experiences with Vipps mobile wallet in Norway
prezly

Thu, 05/15/2025 - 09:00


             
 Thales fully supports the success of Vipps, Norway’s leading mobile wallet, which has enabled over one million users for mobile contactless payments since December 2024.  
 Vipps wallet users are the first to benefit from a third-party mobile contactless payment solution on iOS, enabled by Thales D1 technology that securely digitizes payment cards on smartphone.  
 This milestone highlights Thales’ continued leadership in digital payments and its commitment to support fast, large-scale innovation in partnership with financial players. 
 
<p>With the launch of NFC payments for iPhone and Android devices, Vipps became the first third-party wallet on iOS to offer this feature—an industry first. Behind this innovation, Thales provided the technology foundation, its D1 platform, that made this achievement possible, ensuring a smooth, secure, and scalable experience for Norwegian consumers. </p>
<p>A breakthrough in everyday payments</p>
<p>In just 24 hours after the launch, more than 200,000 digital cards were activated—clear proof of the demand for simple and secure digital payments. Behind the scenes, Thales D1 technology enabled users to get a digital payment card - just in few seconds - on Vipps’ wallet, and proceed with contactless payment at shops, getting on top real time transaction notification on their iPhones. Since the launch, Vipps users enjoy a fast and convenient alternative to traditional mobile wallets for everyday purchases.</p>
<p>Currently supporting Norway’s domestic BankAxept cards, Vipps will expand to include international schemes such as Visa and Mastercard in the coming months, broadening its reach and usability across borders. </p>
<p>Thales D1 platform boosting innovation ​ </p>
<p>Built for innovation, the D1 platform supported Vipps by adding contactless payment to their wallet. This showcases the platform's ability to consistently add new innovative use cases, while providing a scalable and secure solution that grows with customer needs.</p>
<p>The D1 platform is cloud-based and works in real time, making it easy to integrate with existing systems. It helps Thales customers respond to today’s expectations for secure, flexible, and instant payment services — such as modern card issuing, tokenization, or transaction control — while also preparing for the future of payments.</p>
<p>Trusted collaboration driving success</p>
<blockquote><p>“Everything we do at Vipps is about simplifying life for people and businesses. Hitting one million users for contactless payments shows that this is something people really want. Now, we are looking forward to when our users can add Visa and Mastercard to Vipps, enabling them to tap their phones and pay with Vipps across the world. Our collaboration with Thales has been key to making all this happen.” Rune Garborg, CEO of Vipps MobilePay.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Driven by strong collaboration between our teams, we successfully met ambitious launch timelines and proved the strength of our operations — delivering a reliable, high-performance service that handled both the surge in demand at launch and the steady, high-volume usage that continues today.he D1 platform is also a key enabler of innovative digital payment services, helping financial players expand and thrive in an increasingly competitive payments landscape." François Chaffard, Vice President Digital Payment Services at Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>With this milestone, Thales reaffirms its role as a trusted partner in the future of digital payments, helping financial institutions offer flexible, future-ready solutions that meet consumers’ evolving expectations.</p>

<p>Digital banking has never moved faster. For platforms powering fintechs, neobanks, and embedded financial services, onboarding new customers quickly and securely is essential, not only for user experience but also for compliance.</p><p>That’s where KYC, or Know Your Customer, comes in—the set of identity verification steps financial institutions are legally required to perform before offering services like bank accounts, credit, or investment tools. It's a critical part of protecting against fraud or money laundering. </p><p>However, while some digital services have advanced rapidly, the identity verification tools that power KYC have lagged behind. Most platforms still rely on artificial intelligence to analyze images of physical documents, a patchwork process that creates friction for users and uncertainty for compliance teams. As fraud tactics become more sophisticated, these systems are showing their limits.</p><p>It’s time to modernize how identity is verified online, and that starts with mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), a secure and verifiable form of digital identity issued by state governments.</p> The Bottleneck in Digital Onboarding <p>If your current onboarding flow involves photo uploads and long processing times, you’re likely to see drop-off and risk.</p><p>Even the best AI-powered verification tools struggle with edge cases, false rejections, and new forms of fraud. Meanwhile, generative AI is making it easier than ever to spoof IDs and deepfake “live” videos that pass existing checks.</p><p>The impact is real: one study found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signicat.com/the-battle-to-onboard-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">over half of users abandon onboarding</a>&nbsp;when it becomes too slow or confusing. For digital platforms competing for users, these delays can directly impact revenue and retention.</p> mDLs: Trust That’s Built In <p>Mobile driver’s licenses are verifiable digital credentials issued by state governments and stored on a user’s smartphone. Unlike photos of paper IDs, they’re cryptographically signed, instantly verifiable, and privacy-preserving. This allows relying parties such as banks, fintechs, and marketplaces to instantly confirm authenticity without storing or interpreting sensitive user data.</p><p>For digital platforms, this means:</p>  Instant verification: no photos or manual review needed  Reduced fraud: credentials are cryptographically bound to specific devices  Streamlined UX: users can verify in seconds without leaving your flow  Privacy-first: only necessary data (ex. age, name) is shared  Compliance-ready: aligns with evolving KYC/AML requirements  <p>With more than <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/digital-ids-are-here-but-where-are-they-used-and-accepted?utm_source=chatgpt.com">5.6 million Americans now holding mDLs</a> and TSA actively accepting them at airports, real-world adoption is accelerating.

<p>The FBI is raising the alarm over an escalation in North Korean nation-state threat actors leveraging generative AI, laptop farms, and deepfakes to successfully infiltrate large companies through remote job applications, despite widely available solutions that can thwart such attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/gartners-right-why-workforce-identity-verification-cant-wait/">this threat</a> before. But according to a recent <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/">Cyberscoop.com</a> report, it’s getting worse. Thousands of North Korean operatives have secured jobs at more than a hundred Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Using stolen or synthetic identity information and generative AI, these impostors produce polished LinkedIn profiles and identity credentials. Deepfake technology is used for video calls, sometimes unconvincingly, though not often enough. Laptop farms in the US enable the infiltrators to spoof local IPs. Moreover, the imposters usually excel at the actual job, supported by an entire pod of 10 to 20 operatives performing the work for the fraudulent identity behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Speaking on a panel at the RSA Conference 2025, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-warns-north-korean-agents-030300546.html">FBI Special Agent</a> Elizabeth Pelker reported that when employers find out these imposters may be agents, they often hesitate to terminate them. “I think more often than not, I get the comment, “Oh, but Johnny is our best performer. Do we actually need to fire them?’” There are plenty of reasons to say an easy yes.</p>
 Fake Workers, Real Money 
<p>According to WIRED, each impostor and pod can send as much as<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-stole-your-tech-job-ai-interviews/"> $3 million</a> a year back to Pyongyang just in wages. In Cyberscoop’s estimation, that could be as much as <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/#:~:text=A%20thousand%20IT%20workers%20earning,different%20organizations%20concurrently%2C%20Carmakal%20said.">$100 million</a> funneled annually to the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>However, these operatives also use their corporate footholds to exfiltrate data and intellectual property, plant malware, and occasionally threaten executives with blackmail. They can also act on a larger scale, disrupting critical services or infrastructure. It’s no wonder the FBI is offering <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/dprk-it-workers">up to $5 million</a> for information that leads to the disruption of these operations.</p>
<p>It’s alarmingly easy to generate the identities used in these scams. Once the purview of skilled operatives, a steady flow of corporate data breaches coupled with the rise of “crime-as-a-service” outfits means even non-experts can leverage realistic personas complete with fabricated LinkedIn profiles, convincing virtual backgrounds, and digitally manipulated identity documents. And at <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-synthetic-identity-creation/">sites like</a> personnotexist[.]org, even people with no image manipulation experience can easily generate <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/north-korean-operatives-deepfakes-it-job-interviews">deepfake personas</a> for use in video.</p>
<p>For businesses increasingly reliant on remote teams, the sophistication of these outfits represents a significant threat. By some industry estimates, 40% of all cybercrime incidents in 2024 involved deepfake infiltration. At an average cost of<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1417720/worldwide-cost-per-record-by-initial-attack-vector/"> $4.99 million</a> per incident caused by malicious “insiders” like fraudulent remote workers, it can add up. For US-based companies, the average cost of a data breach tops <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$9 million</a>. As it stands, 34% of companies in North America report suffering a data breach that cost them between $1 million and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">$20 million</a> in the past three years. As many as <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/insider-threat-report-2024/">one in three</a> breaches now involve insiders.</p>
<p>Once breached, organizations face the loss or theft of data, compromised networks, ransomware, and blackmail. That’s before lawsuits or regulatory fines, reputational damage, and the fallout from lost customer trust, shattered shareholder confidence, and derailed strategic initiatives.</p>
 ‘How Ugly Is Kim Jong Un?’ Why Most Security Measures Fail 
<p>Identifying fake job candidates requires innovation and skepticism. Red flags include discrepancies between identity information and the candidates themselves. According to Cyberscoop, examples can consist of a person with a complicated Polish name who, in a Zoom call, turns out to be a military-age male Asian who can’t pronounce it.</p>
<p>When deepfakes are in use, telltale signs can be sudden jerkiness or a disconnect between audio and video. It’s also not uncommon for candidates to be fed answers to questions, creating latency as they read onscreen prompts. As a counter measure, some hiring managers ask candidates to hold up identity credentials to match face with identity. But the same AI tools behind the deepfakes can also be used to create counterfeit credentials, of course.</p>
<p>According to researchers, asking a candidate to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-job-seekers-flooding-market-artificial-intelligence/">wave their hand</a> in front of their face can reveal deepfake inconsistencies. Another tactic: asking unexpected questions like, “How ugly is Kim Jong Un?” Perhaps unsurprisingly, it can be enough of a curve ball to instantly trigger operatives to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/asking-remote-job-candidates-this-shocking-question-could-save-your-company-big-bucks-security-expert-says">disconnect</a> from the call abruptly. The technique is effective because North Korean agents are prohibited from saying anything negative about their leader. When asked to criticize him, they typically end the interview immediately rather than risk punishment for appearing disloyal.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Of course, that might not always work, nor is it ever enough.</p>
<p>Today’s typical security protocols—basic ID verification, standard biometric checks, and interview procedures—are no match for increasingly sophisticated deepfake schemes. Attacks now employ presentation attacks for printed and emailed identity credentials, voice cloning, face swapping, and manipulation of captured video of a legitimate user or candidate.</p>
<p>They can also include injection attacks to manipulate data streams between the camera or scanner and authentication systems. Fraudsters with access to an open device, for example, can inject a passing fingerprint or face ID into the authentication process—or text-to-speech tools to manipulate cloned voice samples—bypassing security measures and gaining unauthorized access to corporate networks and services.</p>
 What It Really Takes to Defeat Deepfake Identities 
<p>As I mentioned, the strongest countermeasure against deepfakes and workforce identity fraud in all its forms is already widely available: advanced biometric authentication, securely linked to verified identities. 1Kosmos is a case in point. Our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> solution leads potential employees through a mobile-first enrollment process in which they scan driver’s licenses, social security numbers, national identity documents, passports, or other government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Automated workflows then verify the data, including any associated pictures and RFID-chip data, across more than 2,500 different identity documents <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/supported-documents/">from over 150 countries</a> with over 99% accuracy. These verified individuals are linked to a facial biometric that is dynamically compared to the photo on valid credentials, and the bound identity is then encrypted with the user’s private key and stored in our private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>Passive liveness detection spots subtle digital markers indicative of manipulated images. Detection methods prompt users to perform specific, randomized actions—confirming genuine human presence at enrollment and, if desired, as a login measure for video interviews or meetings. Fraudulent identities are flagged during the time of capture. Our solutions are also built on the only platform certified to NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF, FIDO2, and iBeta ISO/IEC 30107 standards with an SDK and standard APIs to avoid security exploits and prevent vendor lock.</p>
 Facing the Future: Stopping Deepfakes Before They Start 
<p>Unchecked, the epidemic of fraudulent job candidates threatens hiring integrity, cybersecurity infrastructure, and corporate reputations worldwide—and it will only get worse. According to <a href="https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/how-fake-ai-job-applications-pose-risks-for-employers/91173748">Gartner</a>, 1 in every 4 job applicants will be fake by 2028. When you consider other “enhancements” made by otherwise legitimate job candidates, the need for objective, bullet-proof identity proofing grows more critical.</p>
<p>Along with fostering a culture of cybersecurity vigilance throughout the organization (looking at you, HR), implementing widely available biometric technologies that adhere to exacting identity verification standards offers the best—well, only—surefire way to defeat ever-evolving threats from workforce fraud, North Korean and otherwise. Which means the next time you ask a job candidate, “How fat is Kim Jong Un?” it’ll just be for the fun of it.</p>

 How Weak Identity Security Posture Affects Organizations&nbsp;  
<p>The report paints a clear picture: fraudsters are refining their strategies, targeting high-value credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities across all channels. Several statistics stand out, demanding immediate attention from security and risk leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
 How Compromised Credentials Lead to The Rise of Identity Fraud  
  
  A particularly alarming trend highlighted is the increasing exposure of government-issued IDs in data breaches. In 2024, 31% of US data breaches included driver's licenses or other state IDs, a sharp rise from 19% in 2023.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  For years, presenting a physical ID or a scan of one has been a common identity verification step. However, when the digital versions of these documents are readily available to criminals due to breaches, relying solely on document verification becomes dangerously inadequate. <br><br>  
  Fraudsters can now more easily acquire the very credentials used in traditional proofing processes, making it essential to layer additional, dynamic verification methods.  
  
 How Fraudsters Use ID Spoofing and KBA To their Benefit  
<p>Fraudsters are becoming more adept at impersonating legitimate customers, and legacy verification methods are failing to stop them. The TransUnion survey found:</p> 
  
  55% of knowledgeable business leaders reported that call spoofing to impersonate a customer became more common in the past year.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  58% reported that the use of stolen personal information to pass knowledge-based authentication (KBA) became more common.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
  
  The Implication: These two statistics are intrinsically linked. Widespread data breaches have made personally identifiable information (PII) – the foundation of KBA questions like "What street did you grow up on?" or "What was your first pet's name?" – easily accessible to criminals. Simultaneously, spoofing technologies allow fraudsters to appear as legitimate callers. Relying on information recall (KBA) or caller ID is no longer a viable defense mechanism. Knowledge is not identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Call Centers and Help Desks Are Now Prime Targets of Identity Fraud  
<p>The human element in customer service remains a key target. The report reveals a significant increase in attacks targeting call centers:</p> 
  
  The percentage of high-risk calls into US call centers surged by 33%, rising from 4.5% in 2023 to 6.0% in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  This coincides with 43% of knowledgeable business leaders indicating fraudsters increased their attacks on call centers over the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Understanding the Risk: Call centers and internal help desks often handle sensitive requests, including password resets, account changes, and information verification; actions that provide direct pathways for account takeover if compromised. The pressure on agents to provide quick support can conflict with rigorous security protocols, creating vulnerabilities that fraudsters exploit through social engineering and impersonation. The report also notes the specific risk posed by non-fixed VoIP calls, which are harder to trace and showed a high percentage of fraud risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 How to Ensure Identity Assurance For Your Organization  
<p>The insights from the TransUnion report demand a fundamental shift in how organizations approach identity security. Reactive measures and outdated techniques are insufficient. The goal must be Identity Assurance: establishing ongoing, high confidence in a user's identity across their entire journey through orchestrated, risk-appropriate verification.</p> 
 1. Adopt Identity Verification Solutions with Journey Orchestration  
<p>Given that even physical IDs can be compromised and personal knowledge is widely available, modern IDV must be dynamic and context-aware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Move Beyond Static Checks: Merely scanning a driver's license is no longer enough. Effective solutions must layer multiple verification techniques. This includes document authentication (checking security features as well as against a reliable database), biometric verification (matching a live selfie to the ID photo), crucial liveness detection (to prevent spoofs using photos/videos), and potentially cross-referencing with trusted data sources or device intelligence.  
  Orchestrate Based on Risk: Not all interactions carry the same risk. Identity verification shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Implement solutions that allow for fine-grained policies based on the specific action (e.g., onboarding vs. login vs. password reset), the user's privilege level, and real-time risk signals (like device health or location).  
  
 2. Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) is Broken  
<p>The data is clear: KBA is fundamentally broken. The sheer volume of breached PII, combined with the power of AI to gather and correlate information, makes relying on secret questions a critical vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Embrace Stronger Factors: Organizations must transition to phishing-resistant authentication methods. This includes passwordless, FIDO-certified authenticators like device-based biometrics or security keys, which prove possession of a trusted factor rather than relying on easily compromised knowledge.  
  Secure Recovery: Critically, this applies to recovery processes too. Using KBA for account recovery negates investments in strong primary authentication. Secure recovery must leverage other verified, phishing-resistant factors.  
  
 3. Harden Call Center and Help Desk Defenses Interactions  
<p>The sharp rise in high-risk calls targeting support channels necessitates specific countermeasures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Empower Agents with Better Tools: Equip support staff with integrated tools that provide stronger identity verification methods than simply asking KBA questions or trusting caller ID.  
  Implement Risk-Based Authentication: For high-risk requests (like credential resets or changes to sensitive account information), trigger strong step-up authentication challenges that cannot be easily socially engineered. This could involve pushing a notification to a user's registered and trusted device for biometric approval.  
  Orchestrate High Risk Workflows: Implement workflows that escalate high-risk verification scenarios. This might involve requiring approval from an employee's pre-verified manager through a secure channel or routing the interaction to a specialized risk team equipped with advanced verification tools.  
  
 Upgrade Your Security Posture with Identity Assurance  
<p>The TransUnion H1 2025 State of Omnichannel Fraud Report serves as a stark reminder: identity is the new security perimeter, and it's under constant attack. The rise in compromised identity documents, the blatant failure of KBA, and the relentless targeting of support channels demand immediate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations can no longer afford incremental improvements to outdated security models. A paradigm shift towards proactive Identity Assurance is essential for survival and growth. This means embedding strong, phishing-resistant identity verification across the entire user lifecycle, orchestrating verification based on risk, and eliminating reliance on easily compromised factors like passwords and shared secrets.<br><br>Discover HYPR’s Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
<p>HYPR, The Identity Assurance Company, is built to address these modern challenges head-on. Our platform delivers FIDO-certified, passwordless MFA, integrates high-assurance identity verification methods, and enables sophisticated journey orchestration to ensure the right users gain access, securely recover accounts, and interact safely across all channels, including vulnerable support touchpoints.</p> 
<p>Don't let legacy vulnerabilities dictate your security posture. Embrace Identity Assurance and build a resilient defense against the evolving threats highlighted by TransUnion.</p> 
 Key Takeaways:  
 1. Static Identity Verification is Obsolete  
<p>Reliance on physical IDs or static document scans is increasingly less secure due to the amount of stolen PII credentials online. Identity verification must use a multi-layered approach that includes biometrics, liveness detection, and real-time risk assessment.</p> 
 2. Knowledge-Based Authentication is Broken  
<p>Breached data and data aggregated by AI have rendered knowledge-based authentication nearly useless. Organizations must adopt phishing-resistant factors like biometrics and FIDO2 passkeys.</p> 
 3. Call Centers and Helpdesks Are the New Frontline  
<p>The increase in spoofed calls and VoIP abuse increases the fraud risk for both call centers and help desks. Organizations must implement risk-based step-up authentication and use tools that provide more secure identity verification methods.</p> 
 4. Identity Assurance is the New Standard  
<p>The security focus must shift from one-time, static checks to continuous identity assurance across the user journey. Modern IDV solutions must be adaptive and risk-aware to meet the challenges of the current threat landscape.</p>

<p>The crypto world moves fast—but so do regulations. One of the most impactful regulations for crypto businesses today is the FATF Travel Rule. It’s not just another checkbox to tick—it’s a global mandate designed to increase transparency and reduce financial crime in digital assets. If you’re a crypto asset service provider (CASP), understanding and complying with the Travel Rule isn’t optional—it’s essential to staying competitive and credible.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through what the Travel Rule requires and how you can stay compliant without slowing down your operations or alienating your customers.</p>



<p></p>



 What Is the FATF Travel Rule? 



<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requires that CASPs—such as crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians—collect and share certain information about the originators (senders) and beneficiaries (recipients) of crypto transactions over a specified threshold.</p>



<p>Think of it as the crypto equivalent of wire transfer rules in traditional banking. When funds move between two institutions, basic identifying information must travel with them.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>



 
 Threshold Amount: The Travel Rule applies to crypto transactions over USD/EUR 1,000 (or local equivalent). 



 Required Information:
 
 For the Sender (Originator): Full name, wallet address (or unique account ID), physical address or national ID number, and transaction purpose if required by local regulations. 



 For the Recipient (Beneficiary): Full name, wallet address, and additional details if needed. 
 
 



 Cross-Border Compliance: The rule applies across jurisdictions, meaning you need to ensure both sides of the transaction are compliant, even if the recipient CASP is in a different country. 
 



<p></p>



 Why Compliance Matters 



<p>Failing to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, or even being cut off from global markets. But it’s not just about avoiding punishment—it’s about building trust. The Travel Rule is designed to make the crypto ecosystem safer by preventing money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. For CASPs that want to thrive, being seen as compliant builds credibility with regulators, partners, and customers.</p>



<p></p>



 The Challenges of Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>Travel Rule compliance isn’t without hurdles:</p>



 
 Data Sharing Complexities: Sharing sensitive customer information across borders requires secure systems that comply with privacy laws like GDPR. 



 Transaction Delays: Manual verification can slow down transactions, frustrating customers and introducing operational inefficiencies. 



 Interoperability Issues: Ensuring compliance across different CASPs and jurisdictions can be tricky, especially if the other party uses different systems. 
 



<p>But these challenges don’t have to hold you back.</p>



<p></p>



 How iComply Simplifies Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>iComply’s end-to-end solution for KYC, KYB, and AML goes beyond basic compliance—it makes Travel Rule compliance smarter and faster with edge computing technology. Here’s how it works:</p>



 
 Seamless Data Collection and Verification<br>Instead of relying on third-party subprocessors that introduce data privacy concerns, iComply verifies and authenticates sender and recipient data locally on the client’s device using edge computing. This ensures that sensitive information is encrypted and verified before it leaves the device—minimizing data exposure risks and ensuring compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA​. 



 Real-Time Screening and Alerts<br>iComply automatically screens transaction participants against global watchlists, PEP databases, and adverse media sources in real-time. Suspicious activity? Immediate alerts are sent to compliance officers to take action without interrupting transaction flow​​. 



 Interoperability and API Integration<br>iComply integrates easily with other CASPs’ compliance systems using its robust API. Whether your counterpart is using a different solution or in another jurisdiction, you can ensure data flows securely and meets FATF standards​​. 



 Automated Reporting and Audit Trails<br>Generate audit-ready reports with one click. Every verification step is logged and time-stamped, making it easy to prove compliance during regulatory inspections​​. 



 Configurable Rules Based on Jurisdiction<br>Compliance isn’t one-size-fits-all. iComply allows you to configure data requirements based on the jurisdiction of the sender and recipient, ensuring you meet local and international requirements. 
 



<p></p>



 Travel Rule Compliance in Action: A Case Study 



<p>Let’s look at how compliance plays out in real life.</p>



<p>Scenario: Alex, a customer of a U.S.-based crypto exchange, sends $5,000 in BTC to a friend’s wallet held at a European exchange.</p>



<p>Without iComply:</p>



 
 The compliance team manually collects Alex’s data, verifies it, and emails it to the European CASP. This takes time and risks data breaches during transmission. 



 If the receiving exchange uses a different system, compatibility issues may arise, delaying the transaction further. 
 



<p>With iComply:</p>



 
 Alex’s data is encrypted and authenticated directly on the exchange’s app using edge computing. No unnecessary data transfers. 



 iComply verifies the transaction participants in real-time and sends a secure compliance packet directly to the European exchange—fast, secure, and compliant. 
 



<p>The result? Faster transactions, stronger security, and a frictionless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Why Choose iComply? 



<p>iComply’s platform doesn’t just help you comply—it optimizes your entire compliance workflow. By using edge computing, automated risk screening, and seamless integration, iComply simplifies Travel Rule compliance without sacrificing security or efficiency.</p>



<p>In the fast-moving world of crypto, compliance isn’t just a necessity—it’s a competitive advantage. Ready to stay ahead of the curve and build trust with your users and regulators? Let’s make compliance work for you.</p>

 How you comply with anti-money laundering measures, and conduct identity verification is about to change forever. Are you ready for the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation? 



 



<p>The regulatory landscape for financial services will undergo the biggest change to date, when the <a href="https://accountancyeurope.eu/publications/navigating-the-eu-anti-money-laundering-regulation/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a> replaces the current directive-based approach in 2027.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike previous approaches, where Anti-Money Laundering Directives (the most recent being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) required national implementation, the AMLR will apply directly across all EU member states, resulting in a more harmonized approach to combating financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For financial institutions, AMLR represents both a significant compliance challenge and a strategic opportunity to modernize, and perhaps more importantly, harmonize identity verification processes. With implementation less than two years away, understanding the key changes and beginning preparations now is essential for a smooth transition.</p>



 5 main changes under AMLR: What’s new? 



<p>The AMLR brings several fundamental shifts in how financial institutions must approach customer identification and verification:</p>



 1. From directive to regulation. 



<p>Current approach: The AMLDs require implementation through national legislation, which leads to variations in interpretation and therefore different requirements across EU member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: AMLR will apply to all member states without national implementation, which, in theory, will create a single, consistent rulebook for AML compliance across the EU.</p>



 2. Enhanced due diligence requirements. 



<p>Current approach: European financial services adhere to a risk-based approach to enhanced due diligence (EDD), with some flexibility in implementation. In practice, this means that EDD is required for high-risk customers, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed persons</a> (PEPs) or those from high-risk jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: There will be more prescriptive requirements for customer due diligence, with specific mandates for identification methods and verification processes.</p>



 3. Stricter beneficial ownership rules. 



<p>Current approach: Varied thresholds and requirements for identifying beneficial owners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Standardized approach with clearer definitions and lower thresholds for beneficial ownership identification.</p>



 4. Expanded scope to include crypto. 



<p>Current approach: Anti-money laundering directives were focused primarily on traditional financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Broader coverage including crypto-asset service providers and other previously exempted entities.</p>



 5. Stronger enforcement mechanisms. 



<p>Current approach: Varied enforcement penalties, fines and punishments across member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: More consistent penalties and enforcement mechanisms, with greater coordination through the new <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en">Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</a> Due to start operations from summer 2025, the AMLA will have a staff of 400 and will centralize AML efforts, coordinate national authorities and conduct cross-border investigations.</p>

 The 3 pillars of AMLR-compliant identification. 



<p>At the heart of AMLR is a fundamental shift in how financial institutions verify customer identities. It’s worth noting that AMLR will not be regulating KYC methods per se but merely adhering to the eIDAS 2.0&nbsp;identity framework. AMLR prescribes three compliant identification methods:<br></p>



 1. EUDI Wallet. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDIW) represents a significant advancement in digital identity management. This user-controlled mobile application will allow EU citizens to store, and share verified identity credentials securely. The EUDI Wallet must meet either substantial or high assurance levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Customers will be able to prove their identity using government-issued digital credentials&nbsp;  



  Verification can happen remotely in an instant&nbsp;  



  Higher levels of assurance for digital onboarding&nbsp;  



  Reduced manual verification processes<br>  



 2. Notified eID systems. 



<p>Notified <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">Electronic Identification (eID) systems</a> provide secure digital identity verification through nationally recognized schemes. There are more than 27 eID systems across Europe, each with varying levels of assurance. Under the eIDAS 2.0 regulation and the upcoming AMLR, these systems are being brought under a single, interoperable EU framework to support cross-border KYC and customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be accepted for KYC purposes, eID systems must meet at least a “substantial” or “high” level of assurance, as defined by EU technical standards. This ensures that financial institutions and other obliged entities can rely on trusted digital identity methods for remote onboarding and customer due diligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Recognition of national eID schemes across borders&nbsp;  



  Standardized levels of assurance&nbsp;  



  Simplified customer onboarding for customers with existing eIDs&nbsp;  



  Reduced document verification requirements<br>  



 3. Trust Services. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">Trust Services</a>, as defined under&nbsp;eIDAS, provide the foundation for secure and authentic digital transactions through&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES),&nbsp;electronic seals,&nbsp;timestamps, and other regulated services. These play a key role in enabling&nbsp;secure identification under AMLR, particularly via&nbsp;QES&nbsp;and&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA), which allow trusted identity and attribute information to be shared digitally across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable these services, a&nbsp;Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)&nbsp;is responsible for verifying the individual’s identity — whether through&nbsp;notified eID, an&nbsp;EUDI Wallet, or traditional documents such as a&nbsp;passport. This identity proofing must comply with&nbsp;high-assurance standards, which may involve&nbsp;video identification,&nbsp;automated verification, or&nbsp;in-person validation, as set out in&nbsp;eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts&nbsp;and&nbsp;ETSI technical standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way, QTSPs offer a legally recognized and privacy-preserving path to AML-compliant digital onboarding — even for users without a national eID or EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Enhanced security for digital transactions&nbsp;  



  Legal recognition equivalent to handwritten signatures&nbsp;  



  Improved document integrity and non-repudiation&nbsp;  



  Streamlined digital processes with legal certainty&nbsp;  



<p>The significance of these three pillars cannot be overstated. Financial institutions that implement as many options as possible will provide customers with maximum flexibility while ensuring full compliance with AMLR requirements. As the majority joint venture partner of IDnow Trust Services AB – a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP), IDnow is uniquely positioned to support all three identification methods as a single vendor, offering a comprehensive solution for full AMLR compliance.</p>



<blockquote><p>By beginning preparations now, organizations can ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework while minimizing disruption to operations and customer experiences. With the right partners and a proactive approach, AMLR compliance can become a catalyst for digital transformation rather than just another regulatory burden.</p>Uwe Pfizenmaier, Product Director at IDnow and Registration Officer at IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>

 How businesses can prepare today for a more compliant tomorrow. 



<p>Although there are still two years until the 2027 deadline, the complexity of AMLR implementation means preparation should begin now. Here are key steps financial institutions should take:</p>



 1. Conduct a gap analysis.&nbsp; 



<p>Assess your current AML processes against AMLR requirements to identify areas needing improvement. This includes:&nbsp;</p>



  Reviewing existing customer identification methods&nbsp;  



  Evaluating beneficial ownership identification processes&nbsp;  



  Assessing risk assessment methodologies&nbsp;  



  Examining transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Reviewing staff training programs<br>  



 2. Budget planning.&nbsp; 



<p>For many financial institutions, AMLR compliance will require investment in new technologies and processes. As such, they need to ensure they:&nbsp;</p>



  Allocate resources for technology upgrades&nbsp;  



  Budget for staff training and potential new hires&nbsp;  



  Consider consulting services for specialized expertise&nbsp;  



  Plan for ongoing compliance costs<br>  



 3. Team training and awareness. 



<p>Begin building internal knowledge and expertise:&nbsp;</p>



  Educate compliance teams on AMLR requirements&nbsp;  



  Raise awareness among executive leadership&nbsp;  



  Develop training programs for customer-facing staff&nbsp;  



  Establish clear ownership of AMLR implementation<br>  



 4. Technology assessment.&nbsp; 



<p>Evaluate your current technology stack against future requirements. Do you have one of three AMLR-compliant ways of verifying identities implemented in your technology stack? Sooner rather than later, businesses should:&nbsp;</p>



  Assess identity verification systems for AMLR compatibility&nbsp;  



  Review customer due diligence technologies&nbsp;  



  Evaluate transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Consider integration requirements for new identification methods  



 IDnow’s unique position: Why being a QTSP matters. 



<p>A QTSP, such as IDnow Trust Services AB, is an organization that has been officially recognized by a national supervisory body to provide trust services that meet the strict requirements of the eIDAS regulation. This qualification involves rigorous assessment of security practices, technical capabilities and organizational reliability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-trust-services-ab-certified-qtsp-eu/">QTSP since 2024,</a> IDnow Trust Services AB holds a privileged position in the AMLR compliance landscape.&nbsp; For financial institutions preparing for AMLR, working with IDnow and its QTSP offers several competitive advantages:</p>



  Comprehensive compliance coverage: IDnow can provide all three prescribed identification methods (EUDI Wallet, eID, and Trust Services)&nbsp;  



  Legal certainty: Qualified trust services are considered critical infrastructure and have the highest level of legal recognition across the EU&nbsp;  



  Reduced compliance risk: Working with a qualified provider reduces the risk of non-compliance&nbsp;  



  Future-proof solutions: As regulations evolve, QTSPs tend to actively drive change and are the first to adapt and ensure continued compliance&nbsp;  



  Simplified vendor management: One single provider for multiple compliance requirements&nbsp;  



<p>With a long history in enabling financial services customers to comply with AML regulations,&nbsp; IDnow is actively preparing to support clients through the AMLR transition, with ongoing development of compliant solutions and close engagement with regulatory authorities.</p>



 Next steps: Your AMLR readiness checklist. 



<p>To begin your AMLR preparation journey, consider this initial checklist:&nbsp;</p>



  Assign responsibility: Designate an AMLR implementation team or leader&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Stay informed: Subscribe to regulatory updates and industry guidance&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Assess current state: Document existing identification processes and technologies&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Identify gaps: Compare current capabilities with AMLR requirements&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Develop a roadmap: Create a phased implementation plan through 2027&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Engage with partners: Begin discussions with technology providers about AMLR solutions&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Budget for change: Ensure financial planning includes AMLR implementation costs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Monitor developments: Stay alert for regulatory guidance and industry best practices  



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>In the not-too-distant future, only three methods of identity verification will be allowed. Orchestrating each method in order to offer fallbacks and different ways of issuing Trust Services will therefore become key for the future of AML onboarding in EU.</p>Johannes Leser, Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>



 Prepare today to succeed tomorrow. 



<p>While for many, AMLR will pose a significant compliance challenge, it also offers an opportunity to modernize and future-proof identity verification processes, enhance security and improve customer experiences. Financial institutions that approach AMLR strategically, rather than as a compliance box to check, can gain competitive advantages while strengthening their defences against financial crime and fraud that is becoming more sophisticated by the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last week, I wrote about how the real innovation is in centralized vs decentralized, it’s in building systems that can move between them. Flexibility and resilience go hand in hand. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a> if you missed it.</p>



<p>This week, we’re taking that one step further: If flexibility or even malleability is the goal, how much are you willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Decentralization sounds empowering, and it is, but when you start pricing out the staff, contracts, and duplicated infrastructure required to make it real, it’s enough to light your hair on fire. But if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s this: centralization is comfortable, right up until it isn’t. The question isn’t whether decentralization is an all-or-nothing decision. Instead, you should ask how much of it you actually need, and whether you are building toward that, or are you hoping you’ll never be put to the test?</p>



 The Control We Live Without (Until We Can’t) 



<p>Most enterprise stacks are built on convenient centralization because it works. Until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>And to be fair, many centralized platforms aren’t fragile at all. Cloud providers like AWS or Azure, DNS services like Cloudflare, and global CDNs like Akamai offer incredible built-in resilience, failover, and distributed design, and for many organizations, that’s more than enough.</p>



<p>So when I talk about decentralization, I’m not saying “don’t use centralized platforms.” I’m asking:</p>



 
 Where does your dependency go beyond what the platform guarantees? 



 Where are you relying on a single identity flow, a proprietary API, or a vendor relationship that isn’t as durable or visible as you’d like? 
 



<p>Here are just a few common areas where centralization is accepted, sometimes wisely, sometimes dangerously.</p>



 Current Dependencies: What’s Normal (and Risky) 



Stack ComponentTypical Centralized ProviderWhy We Accept ItWhat It Takes to DecentralizeCloud InfrastructureAWS, Azure, GCPCost efficiency, built-in toolingMulti-cloud design, duplicated environmentsDNSCloudflare, Route53Stability, DDoS protectionRedundant providers, failover planningIdentity ProviderOkta, Entra, PingPolicy enforcement, ease of useFederation, verifiable credentials, trust governanceRouting &amp; CDNAkamai, CloudflareSpeed, coverageCustom PoPs, peering strategiesMessaging / CommsTwilio, Zoom, MicrosoftUnified experienceProtocol bridging, diverse vendor integration



<p>The point isn’t to avoid centralization. It’s to understand where you’re exposed, and whether you can live with that. I can’t answer that for you, but you can and should start answering it for your org.</p>



 The Real Cost of Optionality 



<p>There’s no shame in being centralized; there is shame in not being able to recover from locked-in choices. The value of decentralization shows up when:</p>



 
 A vendor outage takes down your login page 



 A change in platform policy breaks your consent flows 



 A new law forces you to isolate systems by country 



 A key provider is acquired, and your roadmap disappears overnight 
 



<p>Decentralization can offer you a way out or at least a way forward. But you only get that if you build for it. And yes, that comes with a cost. TANSTAFL.</p>



<p>Some of those costs include:</p>



 
 Financial: Redundancy means paying for parallel paths, including multiple vendors, more complex SLAs, and sometimes a few features you don’t use every day. 



 Operational: Diverse systems mean more moving parts. Teams need more discipline. More observability. Less “set and forget.” 



 Strategic: Procurement has to prioritize flexibility over feature count. Architecture has to balance performance with fallback. 
 



<p>And let’s not forget the cost of interoperability. The cost of decentralization isn’t just financial. You also need systems that can communicate across platforms, formats, and protocols.</p>



<p>Decentralization means maintaining systems that can work across different environments, many of which weren’t built with each other in mind. Your <a href="https://openobserve.ai/articles/observability-stack-understanding/">observability stack</a> needs to normalize across cloud regions. Your CI/CD pipelines need to deploy to more than one provider. And of course, your auth system needs to handle more than one flavor of token.</p>



<p>You’re not just buying a second system, you’re buying the glue. That glue, however, can be expensive. But it’s what turns “Plan B” into an actual option.</p>





 This Is Achievable, But Only If You Know What You’re Buying 



<p>The good news? You don’t need to decentralize everything. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. But you should know what you’re trading off.</p>



<p>Think of decentralization as buying protection against:</p>



 
 Lock-in: pricing hikes, roadmap divergence, license changes 



 Regulatory shifts: data residency rules, cross-border controls 



 Platform instability: outage, acquisition, end-of-life surprises 



 Geopolitical risk: sanction-driven service denial, regional throttling 



 Value misalignment: privacy erosion, surveillance, ethical conflicts 
 



<p>That’s not FUD. It’s a checklist that helps you determine where decentralization is a strategic safeguard and where centralization is still worth the risk.</p>



 Choose Your Investment Level 



<p>There’s a spectrum here. Not every organization needs multi-cloud failover, decentralized identity, and DNS across five providers. But every organization needs to ask:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure becomes an existential risk? 



 And what would it take to make that risk optional rather than inevitable? 
 



<p>You shouldn’t be looking for decentralization for its own sake. You’re looking for just enough optionality to survive a change in vendor policy, regulation, or business direction without rebuilding your stack from scratch. Ultimately, every team needs to decide how much of the cost of decentralization is justified by the control they gain.</p>



<p>Every small investment buys you breathing room. And breathing room is what makes resilience possible.</p>



 Closing Thought: Buy Control Before You Need It 



<p>You don’t have to decentralize everything. You probably can’t.</p>



<p>But if your entire digital operation depends on a single cloud region, vendor, or IdP that no one knows how to replace, then you’re not buying control; you’re borrowing it and hoping nothing goes wrong.</p>



<p>So, how much of the cost of decentralization are you willing to pay before you’re forced to?</p>



<p>Because waiting until you have to pay is rarely the cheapest option.</p>



<p>Bonne chance, mon ami!</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it. Welcome back! If you caught the last episode, you’ll remember that we talked about how the real innovation isn’t choosing between centralized or decentralized identity systems—it’s about the ability to shift between the two.</p>



<p>[00:00:44]<br>If you didn’t hear that episode, no worries. Here’s the short version:</p>



 
 When I talk about centralization, I’m not just talking about infrastructure, but also controls. 
 



<p>[00:00:56]<br>A centralized identity system relies on one authority—one identity provider, one source of truth, one way to enforce access. Everything flows through a single control point.</p>



<p>[00:01:06]<br>In decentralized models, control is distributed.</p>



 
 You might issue credentials that can be independently verified and used. 



 You might support federation or allow for local policy decisions. 



 All of that isn’t chaos—it’s coordination across more than one authority. 
 



<p>[00:01:24]<br>Most enterprise systems fall somewhere in the middle. It’s not a question of which is better, but how much flexibility you’ve built into your dependencies and whether you’re ready to shift between centralized and decentralized models when needed.</p>



<p>[00:01:39]<br>And just to clarify, if your mind jumps straight to blockchain when I say “decentralized identity,” you can let that go. That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>



 



 The Cost of Flexibility 



<p>[00:01:51]<br>Today, we’re building on that story, because flexibility to shift between these two models isn’t free.</p>



<p>[00:01:58]<br>In enterprise identity systems especially, the cost of decentralization can sneak up on you—until one day, it’s the only thing you can do.</p>



<p>[00:02:09]<br>Centralization absolutely works—right up until it doesn’t. Most enterprise systems are mostly centralized by design because:</p>



 
 It scales 



 It’s familiar 



 It’s easier to manage and deploy 
 



<p>[00:02:27]<br>You pick a cloud provider, configure your identity flows, and build tools that make daily life easier for your teams. All reasonable decisions.</p>



<p>[00:02:37]<br>But centralization comes with trade-offs that don’t always show up on your architecture diagram.</p>



 
 They show up when your vendor changes policies 



 When a regulator demands regional data isolation 



 When the company that owns your login page gets acquired and suddenly nothing is where it used to be 
 



<p>[00:02:56]<br>That’s when the invoice for centralization shows up. If you’ve prepared for it, great. If not, keep listening.</p>



 



 Trade-Offs and Hidden Costs 



<p>[00:03:09]<br>Let’s talk about those trade-offs and where they show up.</p>



<p>[00:03:15]<br>Most organizations don’t decide to centralize everything all at once. It usually happens gradually—through tool choices, vendor decisions, and policies that favor simplicity.</p>



<p>[00:03:36]<br>You pick AWS or Microsoft Azure because they offer global infrastructure and built-in security.<br>You standardize on a single identity provider for simplified access control and audit logging.<br>You rely on a CDN, DNS service, or messaging platform—not because you want lock-in, but because it works and provides redundancy.</p>



<p>[00:04:09]<br>Those normal decisions can quietly create dependencies that are hard to unwind.</p>



<p>[00:04:18]<br>Centralization feels efficient, but it means you’re betting on your vendors never changing, your regulators staying predictable, and your systems remaining static.</p>



<p>[00:04:44]<br>The real question isn’t “Did we centralize too much?” It’s “Do we know which parts of our systems are built around a trust that hasn’t been stress-tested yet?”<br>That’s where decentralization—or even just having a plan for it—starts to pay off.</p>



 



 What Does Decentralization Actually Cost? 



<p>[00:04:52]<br>Decentralization isn’t just a design pattern or a configuration flag.<br>It shows up in:</p>



 
 How you hire teams 



 How you build systems 



 How you buy SaaS applications 



 How you plan for the future 
 



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Let’s talk about three kinds of cost:</p>



 Financial Cost 



<p>[00:05:09]<br>Redundancy means paying for more than one way to do something—running services in two cloud regions, contracting with two vendors for the same function.<br>This can look inefficient on a spreadsheet, but it’s really trading short-term inefficiency for long-term adaptability.</p>



 2. Operational Cost 



<p>[00:05:38]<br>Decentralized systems require discipline.</p>



 
 You have more services to coordinate 



 You need more observability 



 You need standardized policy enforcement<br>It’s not just a technical tax—it’s a cultural shift. 
 



<p>[00:06:06]<br>Assume failures will happen and design recovery plans before they do.</p>



 3. Strategic Cost 



<p>[00:06:11]<br>This is the hardest to measure.<br>Decentralization forces you to ask:</p>



 
 Do we want flexibility or feature velocity? 



 Are we optimizing for today’s comfort or tomorrow’s resilience? 



 Are we willing to make architectural choices that look less efficient but give us options when it counts? 
 



<p>[00:06:44]<br>If this sounds like tomorrow’s problem, you’re not alone—but chances are, you’ve already run into some version of this.</p>



 



 Real-World Scenarios 



<p>[00:06:59]<br>If you’ve ever had to “duct tape” your way out of a dependency, you’ve already felt the cost of not being flexible between centralization and decentralization.</p>



<p>[00:07:33]<br>This isn’t about building redundant systems for fun—it’s about investing in flexibility before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:07:39]<br>If the cost feels high now, ask: What will it cost to do it later, under pressure?</p>



 



 The Value of Optionality 



<p>[00:07:47]<br>Optionality is where decentralization pays off.</p>



 
 It’s not about building a parallel universe 



 It’s about designing systems with room to move 
 



<p>[00:07:53]<br>Examples include:</p>



 
 Backup login methods that don’t rely on a single provider 



 The ability to issue credentials even when your main service is down 



 Flexibility to shift data storage between jurisdictions without breaking compliance 
 



<p>[00:08:14]<br>If you’ve built in flexibility, you can adapt when something breaks. But it doesn’t come for free—it costs more planning, more conversations with legal and compliance, and more thoughtful procurement.</p>



<p>[00:08:32]<br>Sometimes, it means building things twice or building the glue that holds them together. But it gives you control before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:08:51]<br>It’s not overengineering—it’s building systems that don’t panic when the default plan fails. Because the default plan will fail.</p>



 



 A Personal Example 



<p>[00:09:03]<br>Let’s make this personal.<br>If you’ve worked in a high-security enterprise, you know the drill:</p>



 
 Company-managed device 



 Lockdown browser 



 VPN required for everything 
 



<p>[00:09:28]<br>It works—until you need to join a Google Meet with an external standards body and Google is blocked, or you need to access a shared document on a non-whitelisted domain.</p>



<p>[00:09:40]<br>Suddenly, your secure device becomes a wall—not because the technology failed, but because the policies are too rigid.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>Imagine if you could submit for an exception—pre-modeled, well-governed, and aligned with business risk—without endless meetings and exceptions.<br>That’s what optionality would look like: not chaos, but structured flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:10:29]<br>Decentralization isn’t about removing control. It’s about creating trusted, intentional ways to shift it around when necessary.</p>



 



 Final Takeaway 



<p>[00:10:37]<br>Buy the control you need before you need it.</p>



 
 You don’t need to decentralize everything 



 You probably can’t and shouldn’t 



 But you do need to know where your dependencies live 
 



<p>[00:10:54]<br>When something goes sideways—a vendor acquisition, regulatory shift, or trust breakdown—you’ll want options.<br>And options must be built ahead of time.</p>



<p>[00:11:06]<br>Ask yourself:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure is an existential risk? 



 What would it take to make that risk optional instead of inevitable? 
 



<p>[00:11:15]<br>Even a small investment in flexibility buys you more breathing room—and breathing room is what makes resilience possible, not just technically but also operationally and strategically.</p>

             April 2025   
	 
		 
			 Is the UAE Taking the Lead in the Tokenization Race? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As you know, the U.S. is now pushing to become the crypto nation. It has capital, advanced bitcoin mining infrastructure, and some of the largest crypto-companies, but regulatory and political uncertainties continues to slow institutional adoption.</p>
<p>The EU has legal frameworks in place, but not simplicity. The complicated regulation works well for large financial players, however, it is proving a challenge for the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>
<p>The UAE is taking a different approach, and it might just win the race. Rather than over-regulating or under-defining, it’s applying simple rules but selective authorizations, welcoming builders, and creating an environment where innovation can scale, fast.</p>
 A competitive edge built on openness and infrastructure. 
<p>We’ve just returned from Token2049 and RWAfi Live in Dubai, and one message is clear: The UAE is building the future of blockchain, faster, bolder, and more business-friendly than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>With 72 free zones, including DIFC, ADGM, and VARA, the UAE has created a system where local chambers of commerce and rulers compete to attract innovators. This friendly competition is pushing real-world asset tokenization forward. Project owners select the best place depending on their needs, and get access to a new blockchain-powered “American dream”.</p>
<p>Here are some recent innovation examples:</p>
 
 The <a href="https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/news-media/dubai-land-department-and-dubai-virtual-assets-regulatory-authority-collaborate-to-enhance-leadership-in-the-real-estate-sector-and-virtual-assets-regulation?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#/">Dubai Land Department and VARA</a> are integrating real estate registries with blockchain. That means compliant, onchain property title transfers are now possible. 
 The <a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/innovation/tokenisation-regulatory-sandbox?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">DFSA</a> has launched a dedicated regulatory environment to test tokenized securities like real estate shares, sukuk, and fund units, all under full overview. 
 <a href="https://www.ihcuae.com/media-centre/press-releases/ihc-adq-and-fab-pioneer-uae-dirham-backed-stablecoin-for-the-digital-economy?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#:~:text=Abu%20Dhabi%2C%20UAE%2C%2028%20April,(subject%20to%20regulatory%20approval).">AE Coin</a>, a UAE Dirham backed stablecoin launched by FAB, ADQ, and IHC, is now live. This lays the foundation for compliant onchain payments at scale. 
 
<p>These aren’t isolated pilot projects. They are live infrastructure built to attract capital, global talent, and institutional adoption, and it’s working. From crypto startups to major financial institutions, builders are relocating to the UAE to benefit from its simple, selective, and scalable regulatory environment.</p>
 RWA: From trend to reality 
<p>At Tokeny, we are proud to help power this transition. Our infrastructure built on the ERC-3643 standard, enables institutions to:</p>
 
 Launch compliant RWA tokens with embedded control logic. 
 Execute atomic swaps between tokenized assets and regulated stablecoins. 
 Scale distribution across jurisdictions while enforcing compliance at every step. 
 
<p>At RWAfi Live during Token2049 Dubai, leaders from the DFSA, FSRA and MESA regulators shared a panel to discuss the future of onchain finance. The main takeaway? Regulation is not a blocker if you use the right tech. It’s the foundation for compliant onchain adoption.</p>
<p>This shift is happening faster than many expected, and the UAE is leading it.</p>
<p>For those of you who have missed this incredible panel, and the demos of the ERC3643 Association, <a href="https://youtu.be/viLyPOjuQRU?t=9760&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">watch the livestream here</a>.</p>

   As part of Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment (OSIC) to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks, we are making changes to improve our architecture related to developer organizations. 

 On May 22, 2025, our new Integrator Free Plan will become the default organization type when you sign up on developer.okta.com. If you are actively using an Okta Developer Edition org, please create

  <p>As part of <a href="https://www.okta.com/secure-identity-commitment/">Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment</a> (OSIC) to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks, we are making changes to improve our architecture related to developer organizations.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2025, our new Integrator Free Plan will become the default organization type when you sign up on developer.okta.com. If you are actively using an Okta Developer Edition org, please create an Integrator organization and migrate to it. The Okta Developer Edition <a href="https://developer.okta.com/terms/">terms of service</a> will also be updated to clarify: neither your old Developer Edition organization nor your new Integrator organization is meant for production use cases.</p>

 New Okta developer organization types tailored for you 

<p>We’ve redesigned our developer orgs to better fit how you build. Whether you’re testing app integrations, validating identity flows, or preparing for OIN submission, the new Integrator Free Plan is purpose-built for iterative development—not production deployment.</p>

<p>This new structure reflects real-world developer needs:</p>

 
   A clean, focused environment optimized for building and validating integrations 
   Terms that match typical pre-production use cases 
   Streamlined signup and org management aligned with how developers work today 
 

<p>By moving to an Integrator organization, you’ll get an environment that’s aligned with modern dev workflows—simpler, more relevant, and built to support how you build.</p>

 Integrator organization benefits 

<p>This new organization structure will come with a number of benefits, such as improving integrator access to Okta support resources and expanding developer access to Okta product offerings for testing purposes.</p>

 Deprecating Okta Developer Edition organizations 

<p>In July 2025, existing Okta Developer Edition organization will be deactivated. At this time, you will lose access to your old Okta Developer Edition organization and all resources in it..</p>

 How to migrate your resources from Okta Developer Edition to Integrator Free Plan 

<p>Creating an Integrator Free Plan organization will give you a clean slate to test and develop in. However, you might want to replicate setup steps that you’ve performed in your Okta Developer Edition organization to continue work in progress. Several options are available for migrating your configuration from your Okta Developer Edition organization to your Integrator Free Plan  organization.</p>

<p></p>

 Migrating data is optional 

<p>If you want to discard the configuration and data from your Okta Developer Edition organization and start fresh in a new Integrator Free Plan organization, create a new Integrator Free Plan organization and begin using it. Your Developer Edition resources and configuration will be deleted when old organization are deactivated in July..</p>

 Re-create resources by re-running automation 

<p>If you automated the creation of resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization that you’d like to continue using in your Integrator Free Plan organization, your environment setup will be simple. Create an Integrator Free Plan organization, provide credentials to your setup tooling, and re-run that tooling.</p>

 Add automation for long-term management 

<p>If you created resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization by hand and you want to automate management of those resources going forward, this is a great time to build the tooling you want using  <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Terraform</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">PowerShell</a>. <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/blob/master/docs/okta.md">Terraformer</a> can help you generate Terraform configurations based on existing resources in your old organization.</p>

 Use our migration tool for one-off organization backup 

<p>If you’d like to capture a snapshot of your current Okta Developer Edition configuration, try <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dev-account-migration-tool">our migration tool</a>. It wraps the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> to create files representing all supported objects in your Developer Edition organization, and can use these backup files to automatically re-create many of the objects in your new Integrator Free Plan organization.</p>

 Migrate your public OIN Integration 

<p>If you have an integration in the <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">Okta Integration Network</a> associated with your Okta Developer Edition organization, sign up for a new Integrator Free Plan organization and contact Developer Support to request that your integration be migrated to your new organization. Developer Support will link your new organization to your integration so that you can easily update it as needed.</p>

<p>If you have been working on an integration for the Okta Integration Network but it has not yet been accepted, you are responsible for migrating your work in progress from your Developer Edition organization to an Integrator Free plan organization.</p>

 Cutoff dates for OIN submissions 

<p>As of May 22, 2025, no new OIN integration submissions will be accepted from developer orgs.  After May 22, you must use an Integrator Free Plan organization to submit OIN integrations.</p>

<p>If you have submitted an OIN integration from an Okta Developer Edition organization, it must be approved by June 9. Any submissions coming from Okta Developer Edition organizations that are still in Draft or In Review status on June 9 will be automatically rejected, and you will need to re-submit the same integration from an Integrator Free Plan organization.</p>

<p>Holochain Core &amp; Networking: Since the last Dev Pulse, we’ve published the first three releases of Holochain 0.5 with our new networking engine <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>. While the focus of this release was network reliability, the improvements we’ve made will mostly be felt as dramatically better DHT performance. In our tests, and tests in the field, it shows shorter and more consistent syncing times for DHT data. CPU usage appears to have decreased significantly as well. One of the team is calling it “a good step forward for Holochain”.</p><p>There is a new behavior with Kitsune2 and performance enhancement. When a new node joins a network, there’ll be a time of initial DHT synchronization, during which they won’t immediately get any new data published by their peers since they joined. This is because they haven’t advertised themselves as full-arc nodes yet and so won’t be targeted for publishing to. But once they’ve synchronized with the other peers, it “goes like blazes and data just appears like it was authored locally”, in the words of a team member. So new users should still expect data to sync slowly for the first few minutes; this is normal.</p><p>It’ll still be a bit before we recommend that app developers update their projects to Holochain 0.5 — we’re seeing some connectivity issues which we believe we’ve identified as a simple misconfiguration which we’ll correct, test, and hopefully release soon. We also still need to update the scaffolding tool. If you’re brave and want to get a head start on an existing app, you can read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.5 upgrade guide</a>.</p><p>In the Holochain 0.6 development line, the team is investigating bottlenecks in the conductor runtime. They’ve already addressed one long-standing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org">issue</a> of degrading performance as source chains grow — we’re now seeing a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org#issuecomment-2863047641">30-40% improvement</a> in ad-hoc dev testing, with possibly more improvements to come.</p><p>Testing: All of the test scenarios in Holochain 0.4 have been converted from our older TryCP-based scale testing framework to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/wind-tunnel?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wind Tunnel</a> , and we’re now in the process of updating them for Holochain 0.5, as well as streamlining the process for deploying Wind Tunnel client nodes with <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nomad</a>. Dev team members are setting up test machines all around the world, and we’re looking at options for increasing the number of test machines.</p><p>Dev Docs: Lastly, we’ve published some new documentation in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guide</a>:</p>  Working With Data: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/validation-receipts/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Validation Receipts</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/using-the-host-api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Host API</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cell-introspection/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cell Introspection</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cryptography-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cryptography Functions</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/miscellaneous-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Miscellaneous Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/must-get-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">must_get_* Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dht-operations/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT Operations</a> (an advanced guide)

<p>In the first release of 2025 we have improved log correlation, adding&nbsp;both a Session and Correlation identifier. These additions enable more effective log correlation, making it easier to trace the full flow of authentication and related events across both audit and diagnostic logs.&nbsp;Links to specific documentation for this logging improvement can be found in the release notes. As always, we aim to improve a wide array of items and make corrections to simplify the use of the Identity Platform. These are shown in detail from the release notes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For our long-standing customers, we are working to release updates to a number of SSO service modules. &nbsp;These are external elements which ease configuration or use of SSO within Identity Platform. Our IDaaS service naturally receives these updates as they are available, however, if you have a premises-based installation, we would ask you to open a Service Desk ticket to request the updated code for these external to SSO modules. We would also like to point out that the modules&nbsp;have only been tested on SSO 9.6.0 found within this IDS 2025.1 release of Identity Platform, so would encourage you to update your Identity Platform prior to updating the modules. If you have any questions, Operations is happy to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across private conversations with CISOs, CIOs, and heads of HR and identity, one issue continues to emerge as both urgent and unresolved:&nbsp;fake IT workers infiltrating enterprise environments&nbsp;under false or stolen identities.</p> 
<p>In many of these discussions, leaders admitted they’ve seen this problem up close, or know someone who has. Fake hires can linger undetected for months, perform well enough to avoid scrutiny, and quietly gain access to sensitive systems. Whether the goal is financial fraud, IP theft, or funding a foreign regime, the result is always dangerous: critical systems are compromised, trust is shattered, and the organization is left exposed.</p> 
<p>One of the most pressing challenges isn’t just how these bad actors get in, but&nbsp;who is responsible for stopping them. HR teams oversee hiring, but often lack the tools for identity verification beyond background checks. Security and IT teams are concerned about post-hire access and risk, but don’t own the onboarding funnel. The result? Confusion, finger-pointing, and growing vulnerability.</p> 
<p>Below I unpack four key insights from ongoing conversations with enterprise leaders who are trying to get ahead of this threat. If you’re in HR, IT, or security, these perspectives may sound familiar, and they offer a path toward better collaboration and stronger safeguards.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Insight #1: Worker Impersonation Has Become a Board-Level Concern: Why Directors Are Demanding Identity Verification  
<p>Executive leadership teams and boards of directors are no longer in the dark. High-profile media coverage in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/north-korean-spies-are-infiltrating-u-s-companies-through-it-jobs-e45a1be8">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/north-korean-it-workers-infiltrating-fortune-500-companies/">Fortune</a>, and other outlets has accelerated awareness and pressure. Directors are asking CIOs, CISOs, and HR leaders direct questions:</p> 
  
  Could this happen to us?  
  Have we already been compromised?  
  What safeguards are in place?  
  
<p>For companies in highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and defense, the scrutiny is even more intense. While some board members have suggested drastic measures, like requiring all new hires to verify their identity in person, most executives acknowledge that this alone won’t solve the problem. A more sustainable, digital-first strategy is needed.</p> 
 Insight #2: Who Owns Employee Identity Verification? Solving Accountability Gaps Across HR, IT, and Security  
<p>One of the most persistent issues? Nobody agrees on who owns the impersonation problem.</p> 
  
  Is it HR, responsible for hiring and onboarding?  
  Is it IT, responsible for managing account access?  
  Is it Security, who typically handles insider threats?  
  Or is it Legal or Compliance, given the regulatory exposure?  
  
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bojansimic/"></a></p> 
<p>The result is organizational paralysis, with each department assuming someone else is responsible, no one takes ownership, and the risk continues to grow unchecked. Some companies assign ownership to HR ops, only to discover their background check tools aren’t built for identity verification at scale. Others lean on security or insider threat teams, who are already overwhelmed and reluctant to take on additional responsibility without a clear mandate.</p> 
<p>The most successful organizations tackling this issue have one thing in common: collaborative, cross-functional alignment across HR, IT, and security, often driven by a central identity security program.</p> 
 Insight #3: Manual Identity Checks Can’t Stop Fake IT Workers: Why Traditional Onboarding Is Failing  
<p>When detection fails, prevention becomes a guessing game. Unfortunately, many companies are relying on labor-intensive, manual processes that don’t scale and are easy to bypass:</p> 
  
  Video-based interviews and onboarding: Helpful, but increasingly vulnerable to deepfakes.  
  In-person onboarding: Logistically difficult and only effective if the individual remains in the role.  
  Laptop shipping verification: Foiled when attackers use “mules” or remote access post-delivery.  
  Always-on video during virtual meetings: Easy to fake, hard to enforce.  
  Behavior-based 2FA triggers: Ineffective if the attacker already has valid credentials.  
  
<p>Worse still, many adversaries are using stolen identities purchased on the dark web or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ai-forgery-epidemic">leveraging GenAI to create fraudulent documents</a> that pass background checks. The impersonation problem is outpacing traditional onboarding controls.</p> 
 Insight #4: The Scope Is Vast – and Underreported: How Global Worker Impersonation Goes Undetected  
<p>While North Korean infiltration garners headlines due to FBI intervention, similar incidents are happening globally. Attackers from Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and other regions are using identical playbooks.</p> 
<p>There’s also a related phenomenon gaining steam: job stacking, where one person holds multiple jobs under a single identity, often outsourcing tasks to others for profit. These schemes can fly under the radar for months and result in confidential data being shared with unauthorized third parties.</p> 
<p>Many security teams remain reactive, addressing these issues only after something suspicious surfaces. Given that some experts estimate over 500,000 impersonators may be employed by U.S. organizations today, this approach is no longer tenable.</p> 
 6 Actions CIOs and CISOs Can Take to Prevent Employee Impersonation  
  
  Reverify All Identities Using Multi-Factor Signals&nbsp;<br>Conduct a phased identity verification process using device checks, location data, government ID scans, and manager attestation. Move beyond one-time checks.  
  Make Identity Security an Ongoing Priority<br>Identity assurance isn’t a one-and-done task. Apply Zero Trust principles to continuously verify the human behind the login.  
  Scrutinize Third Parties and Contractors<br>Treat contractors and gig workers with the same rigor as full-time staff. Consider biweekly or monthly identity reverification cadences.  
  Bridge the Gap Between HR, IT, and Security<br>Establish shared KPIs and workflows across departments to ensure no gaps in accountability exist.  
  Leverage Existing Security Tools for Continuous Verification<br>Correlate identity assurance signals from IDPs, EDR tools, and network monitoring systems to flag suspicious behavior.  
  Report Incidents and Collaborate with Industry Peers<br>Engage with communities like FS-ISAC and share learnings. Open dialogue is critical to closing industry-wide gaps.  
  
 Why Continuous Employee Verification Is Now Essential  
<p>Impersonation-based attacks are no longer rare, and they’re not going away. These threats are stealthy, scalable, and extremely difficult to detect using traditional HR or IT processes alone.</p> 
<p>The only path forward is one built on continuous identity verification, from day zero through every access point of the employee lifecycle. At HYPR, we believe trust must be earned continuously, not just at the time of hire.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is evolving fast, and Sui Blockchain is quickly becoming a standout in the Layer 1 space. If you’re wondering what all the buzz is about, you’re in the right place! In this guide, we’ll break down what Sui is, why it’s different from other blockchains, and how it could shape the future of decentralized applications.</p>

 What is Sui Blockchain? 



<p>Simply put, Sui Blockchain is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform designed to fix a lot of the issues we see with traditional blockchains. Unlike the older models that process transactions one after another, Sui can process transactions in parallel – meaning more speed, less waiting.</p>



<p>Built by Mysten Labs, Sui uses a special programming language called Move, which was designed to be fast and secure. It’s a Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it’s a foundational network that doesn’t need any other blockchain to operate. Sui is all about speed and scalability, so it’s ideal for decentralized apps (dApps) that need to handle lots of transactions quickly, like DeFi, NFTs, and even gaming.</p>

 Key Features of Sui Blockchain 



<p>When it comes to Sui Blockchain, what really sets it apart are its unique features that make it both fast and efficient. Whether you’re a developer looking for a reliable platform or a user wanting low-cost transactions, Sui offers just that and more. Let’s take a look at some of its key features that make it stand out in the crowded blockchain space.</p>



 
 Parallel Processing: Unlike older blockchains that handle one transaction at a time, Sui processes transactions in parallel, which makes it super fast. 



 Move Language: This programming language allows for secure and fast transactions, making Sui the go-to blockchain for developers. 



 Low Fees: Sui keeps transaction costs low, so you don’t have to worry about paying high fees every time you interact with the network. 



 Highly Scalable: Sui can process millions of transactions per second, which means it can handle a huge number of users and transactions without slowing down. 
 



 How Does Sui Blockchain Work? 



<p>Sui’s secret sauce is its parallel processing model. Instead of stacking up transactions one by one, it processes them at the same time, dramatically increasing transaction speed. This allows Sui to support high-demand activities like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi, where transactions happen quickly and need to be processed in real time.</p>



<p>Sui also uses a unique consensus mechanism called Narwhal-Tusk, which helps ensure data is available while making transactions even faster and more reliable.</p>

 Top Applications of Sui Blockchain 



<p>So, what makes Sui Blockchain a game-changer? Let’s explore some of its key features that highlight its potential and set it apart from other blockchain platforms.</p>



 
 DeFi (Decentralized Finance): Sui’s speed and low fees make it an awesome platform for DeFi projects. Imagine trading assets or lending/borrowing money with almost zero wait time and minimal costs. 



 NFTs: Because Sui handles high volumes of transactions quickly, it’s perfect for the fast-paced world of NFTs. Buying, selling, and trading digital assets can be done without the lag, giving users a smooth experience. 



 Gaming: If you’re into blockchain-based games, Sui can handle the real-time transactions needed for in-game purchases and trades, making gaming funnier and easier. 



 Web3: Sui provides the backbone for Web3 applications, giving developers the tools to build decentralized apps that are fast, secure, and scalable. 
 



 Sui Blockchain Ecosystem 



<p>The Sui Blockchain ecosystem is expanding rapidly, with a host of exciting projects already making waves. From DeFi platforms to NFTs and even GameFi, Sui is becoming a hub for innovation. Let’s take a closer look at some of the standout projects driving the growth of this ecosystem:</p>



 Scallop Lend 



<p>This decentralized lending platform is already showing strong promise, with over $62 million in total value locked (TVL). It allows users to borrow and lend digital assets, all with minimal fees and impressive returns. Scallop Lend has quickly become a go-to platform for those looking to dive into DeFi on Sui, offering both efficiency and ease of use.</p>



 Navi Protocol 



<p>Another project gaining traction within the Sui ecosystem is Navi Protocol, which focuses on decentralized borrowing and lending. With over $53 million in TVL, it’s clear that the platform is resonating with DeFi users. Navi is built with flexibility in mind, offering decentralized financial services that are both user-friendly and scalable. It’s a perfect example of what Sui’s low-cost, high-speed infrastructure enables in the DeFi space.</p>



 Cetus Protocol 



<p>As a decentralized exchange (DEX), Cetus Protocol is designed to offer fast and low-cost token swaps. What sets it apart is its focus on liquidity, allowing users to trade with minimal slippage. Cetus is already making a name for itself as one of the leading AMM exchanges on Sui, with a growing user base and increasing liquidity.</p>



<p>But these are just a few examples. The Sui ecosystem is constantly evolving, with more and more projects leveraging its scalability and speed. Whether it’s NFT platforms, Web3 applications, or new decentralized finance products, the future looks promising for Sui. As of early 2024, the total value locked (TVL) across the ecosystem has already surpassed $200 million, a clear sign of growing trust and adoption in the platform.</p>



<p>The rapid expansion of Sui’s ecosystem shows just how much potential this blockchain has to offer. As more developers come on board, we can expect even more innovative projects to emerge, further solidifying Sui Blockchain as a top contender in the blockchain space.</p>


 
 


 Why Sui Blockchain is a Top Contender 



<p>What makes Sui stand out in the crowded blockchain space? Its combination of speed, scalability, and low fees makes it a top choice for developers building dApps. It solves the issues that many older blockchains struggle with, like high transaction costs and slow speeds. Plus, its Move programming language gives developers the flexibility to build secure and innovative applications.</p>



<p>With its growing ecosystem and unique features, Sui Blockchain is definitely one to watch as the future of blockchain technology unfolds.</p>



 Tips for Using Sui Blockchain Safely 



<p>To make the most out of Sui Blockchain while keeping your assets secure, here are some key tips to follow:</p>



 
 Use Trusted Wallets: Always choose a reputable wallet that supports Sui to store and manage your assets. Look for well-known wallets with positive user feedback and strong security features. Be cautious of lesser-known wallets, as they may not offer the same level of protection. 



 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): To secure your accounts, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second verification step, making it harder for hackers to gain access to your wallet. Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy are great choices for 2FA. 



 Watch Out for Phishing Scams: Phishing scams are common, so always verify the authenticity of websites or communications related to Sui Blockchain. Ensure the URL is correct before clicking links, and avoid downloading files from suspicious sources. Real platforms never ask for your private keys or recovery phrase, so be wary of such requests. 



 Keep Software Updated: Regularly updating your Sui Blockchain wallet ensures you have the latest security features and fixes. Updates often address vulnerabilities and enhance functionality, so don’t neglect them. Always check for updates in your wallet’s settings or app store. 



 Backup Your Recovery Phrase: When setting up your wallet, you’ll be given a recovery phrase. Store this phrase securely offline, such as in a safe, and never share it with anyone. It’s the key to recovering your wallet if needed. 
 



<p>By following these steps, you can enjoy using Sui Blockchain with peace of mind, knowing your assets are protected from potential threats.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Sui Blockchain is a cutting-edge platform that offers impressive scalability, speed, and low-cost transactions, making it a great choice for developers and users alike. Whether you’re into DeFi, NFTs, or gaming, Sui has a lot to offer. If you’re looking to explore the world of Web3 and decentralized apps, Sui Blockchain is definitely worth a look!</p>

<p>Looking to manage your crypto securely and easily? MetaMask is the go-to solution for that! It’s a popular cryptocurrency wallet that lets you store and manage your digital assets while connecting you to decentralized apps (dApps). This guide will show you how to download MetaMask, set up, add networks, and fund your wallet, helping you to get started safely.</p>

 What is MetaMask? 



<p>Simply put, MetaMask is a wallet that stores your Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies based on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s available as a browser extension and a mobile app, which makes it super easy to connect with decentralized apps (dApps). You get full control over your assets since it is a self-custody wallet – meaning, you hold your private keys. This puts you in charge, so no one else can access your funds unless you give them permission. Then, some people may ask: “Is MetaMask safe?”.</p>



 Is MetaMask Safe? 



<p>Yep, MetaMask is pretty safe! Since it’s a self-custody wallet, you hold the keys to your crypto, so you’re in charge of keeping your funds secure. It also has security features like encryption to protect your transactions. Plus, this wallet works with hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, which means you can keep your private keys offline for extra protection. Of course, it’s super important to be careful of phishing scams and always store your recovery phrase in a safe place. As long as you follow basic security steps, this wallet is a reliable and safe way to manage your crypto.</p>

 How to Download and Set Up MetaMask 



<p>Setting up MetaMask is a straightforward process, and getting started with your new wallet only takes a few simple steps. Let’s go through the process:</p>



 
 Download MetaMask: Head to the official <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask website</a> and click on the “Download” button. Choose the right version for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and install it as an extension.<br> 



 Create Your Wallet: Once installed, open the extension and click “Get Started.” Follow the steps to create a wallet, set a strong password, and make sure to backup your recovery phrase. This phrase is super important in case you need to restore your wallet later.<br> 



 Secure Your Wallet: After setting up, MetaMask will prompt you to confirm your recovery phrase. This is to make sure you’ve saved it properly. Always store this phrase in a secure place, like a password manager or offline document – don’t share it with anyone!

 Adding Networks to MetaMask 



<p>MetaMask is not limited to just Ethereum. It supports a variety of other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, and Avalanche, which means you can interact with a range of decentralized apps (dApps) and manage multiple assets on different networks. Here’s how to add a new network to your wallet:</p>



 
 Open MetaMask: Click on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser to open your wallet.<br> 



 Select the Network Dropdown: At the top of your MetaMask window, you’ll see the network dropdown (it’ll say “Ethereum Mainnet” by default). Click on it.<br> 



 Add Network: Scroll down and select “Add Network.” Here, you’ll need to input the network details for the blockchain you want to add. For example, if you’re adding Binance Smart Chain, you’ll need to fill in details like the Network Name, RPC URL, Chain ID, and Currency Symbol.<br> 



 Save and Switch Networks: After entering the network details, click “Save.” You can now easily switch between networks by selecting the dropdown menu again. 
 


 
 


 How to Fund Your MetaMask Wallet 



<p>Once you’ve got MetaMask set up, it’s time to fund it. Here’s how you can add some crypto:</p>



 
 Get Your Wallet Address: Open your wallet and click on the account name to copy your wallet address. This is the address you’ll use to receive cryptocurrency.<br> 



 Transfer Crypto to MetaMask: If you already own cryptocurrency on another wallet or exchange, go to that wallet and initiate a transfer to your address. Just make sure to choose the correct network (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) to ensure your funds are transferred properly.<br> 



 Buy Crypto via MetaMask: You can also purchase crypto directly through MetaMask. Click on the “Buy” button, which will connect you to third-party services like Wyre or MoonPay, allowing you to purchase crypto using a credit card or bank transfer.<br> 



 Confirm Your Transaction: After initiating the transfer or purchase, wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. Once confirmed, your funds will appear in your wallet. 
 



 Buying BNB on MetaMask 



<p>Buying BNB on MetaMask is straightforward, especially if you’re using Binance Smart Chain. Here’s how to buy and add BNB to your wallet:</p>



 
 Add Binance Smart Chain (BSC): Make sure you’ve added Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to your wallet (see the “Adding Networks” section).<br> 



 Buy BNB: You can buy BNB directly in MetaMask by clicking the “Buy” button, or you can purchase BNB from a centralized exchange like Binance and withdraw it to your address.<br>

 Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;&nbsp;HPP <p>This time, we sat down with Won Kim, CEO of Blocko, to discuss Blocko's critical role as a key partner in the Aergo ecosystem and explore how Aergo’s future, powered by the House Party Protocol (HPP) and Layer 2 innovation, will create new opportunities for enterprises. In this conversation, Won outlines how enterprise clients will transition through Aergo’s evolution, how the dual-layer approach strengthens the ecosystem, and how Blocko continues to drive real-world adoption of blockchain technology.</p> Q1: How would you describe the relationship between Blocko and&nbsp;Aergo? <p>Won Kim: The combination of Blocko and Aergo is quite rare in the blockchain industry. Blocko provides the full spectrum of services enterprise clients need — from architecture design to system customization and long-term maintenance.</p><p>In a way, you could compare it to the relationship between Ethereum and ConsenSys, but there’s a key difference: Blocko is much more hands-on in the actual building and deployment process.</p><p>This deep collaboration benefits both parties. Aergo can continuously enhance and advance Aergo Enterprise based on direct client feedback gathered through Blocko’s projects. At the same time, Blocko can focus purely as a Managed Service Provider (MSP), delivering end-to-end blockchain solutions. It creates a virtuous cycle of innovation and execution between the platform and the service&nbsp;layer.</p> Q2: How does Blocko’s role fit Aergo’s evolution with HPP and&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has always been focused on driving real-world adoption of blockchain technology. As Aergo evolves with the launch of HPP ETH Layer 2, our role remains critical: to penetrate the enterprise blockchain market by transitioning past Aergo Enterprise use cases into the AI-driven HPP ecosystem, while continuing to deliver enterprise-grade solutions built on Aergo Mainnet. While HPP ETH L2 will lead broader Web3 innovation, Aergo Mainnet will continue to serve as the trusted foundation for enterprises requiring security, compliance, and private deployments. Our clients rely on us to provide stability and continuity as the ecosystem continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Q3: How will enterprise clients be affected by the introduction of HPP ETH Layer&nbsp;2? <p>Won Kim: There will be no disruption for our enterprise clients. Aergo Mainnet will continue to operate as it has always, providing a stable and high-performance private blockchain infrastructure. Clients using Aergo Enterprise will not need to make any technical changes. However, for enterprises seeking AI-driven capabilities, the broader ecosystem of HPP will be available as an option through Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>The launch of HPP ETH L2 is an expansion, not a replacement. It introduces a two-track strategy for the Aergo ecosystem: one track focused on public innovation (L2) and another anchored in private, enterprise-grade reliability (L1).</p> Q4: What are the benefits of maintaining both Aergo L1 and introducing HPP&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: We offer flexibility that few ecosystems can match by maintaining both layers. Aergo Mainnet provides long-term support for enterprise solutions, including compliance, data protection, and custom deployments. At the same time, HPP ETH L2 opens the door for innovation with AI-native smart contracts, decentralized identity, and broader Web3 use cases. Together, they create a full-stack ecosystem that can scale with both corporate and Web3 ecosystem needs.</p> Q5: From an enterprise perspective, what excites you most about Aergo’s&nbsp;future? <p>Won Kim: What excites me most is the convergence between AI and blockchain. HPP ETH L2 introduces concepts like AI oracles, enabling smart contracts to dynamically process and respond to real-world data. This unlocks opportunities in areas such as automated compliance, supply chain verification, and real-time risk management, where enterprises seek blockchain to add real value, not just theoretical potential.</p> Q6: How is Blocko supporting this transition alongside Aergo? <p>Won Kim: Blocko is actively working with Aergo to ensure a smooth transition through close technical collaboration, client communication, and long-term roadmap alignment. We are expanding our solution stack to bridge traditional enterprise systems with the new opportunities presented by HPP ETH L2, particularly for clients seeking to integrate AI-driven data flows and smarter automation into their blockchain operations.</p><p>We view Aergo’s evolution not as a pivot, but as a natural expansion of what we started: making blockchain real, usable, and transformative for enterprises.</p> Q7: How is Blocko approaching overseas markets with less restrictive regulatory environments? <p>Won Kim: In the past, we saw significant growth internationally, securing projects with Bank of Singapore, Credit Suisse, and the Seed Group in Dubai. We even established a local branch in the UK to support global expansion. Our projects included building a Sharia-compliant distribution platform in Dubai and conducting successful STO-related PoC projects with Credit&nbsp;Suisse.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted us, prompting us to wind down our overseas operations. This experience prompted a strategic shift, moving from a solution-based delivery model to a fully cloud-based SaaS approach. Instead of deploying teams on-site, we now host our services on the cloud, enabling enterprises and consumers to access them remotely.</p><p>As a result, approximately 40% of the current inbound demand now comes from international customers. With Korea’s blockchain-related regulations becoming more defined, we believe the time is right to expand aggressively. Blocko is well-positioned to lead the way with our technology and operational experience.</p> Q8: Is there anything you would like to&nbsp;add? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has been committed to the potential of general-purpose blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum. For over a decade, we have focused on integrating blockchain into complex enterprise environments, consistently addressing real-world challenges and operational demands.</p><p>Now, as the rapid advancement of AI technology reshapes industries, it has become increasingly clear that enterprises need a foundational layer to fully harness the power of AI innovations. Recognizing this shift, Blocko fully aligns with the vision that the evolution of Aergo’s technology into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is not just necessary, but critical for leading the next era of enterprise blockchain and Web3 innovation.</p><p>We are proud to stand alongside Aergo as we move into this next chapter, building a blockchain infrastructure ready for an AI-driven future.</p><blockquote>“Blocko has been committed to advancing blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum, integrating it into complex enterprise environments for over a decade. As AI reshapes industries, we believe a robust blockchain foundation is essential — and the evolution of Aergo into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is critical for leading the next era of enterprise and Web3 innovation.”<br> — Won Kim, CEO of&nbsp;Blocko</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-a-conversation-with-blockos-ceo-on-the-future-of-enterprise-blockchain-with-aergo-aaf9f46e29f7">Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the increasingly modular world of Web3, crypto bridges have emerged as vital infrastructure, allowing not just digital assets but also data to flow across otherwise siloed blockchains. As decentralized applications and user bases grow across chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, and others, bridges enable cross-chain functionality, improve liquidity distribution, and facilitate multi-chain user experiences.</p><p>But how do these bridges work, what risks do they carry, and how are projects like HPP (House Party Protocol) approaching them in a more secure and purpose-driven way?</p> What Is a Crypto&nbsp;Bridge? <p>A crypto bridge is a set of smart contracts and messaging infrastructure that allows users to move tokens or data from one blockchain to another. Users commonly “lock” assets on a source chain and receive a “wrapped” version on the destination chain. When they want to move back, the wrapped asset is burned, and the original is released.</p><p>Importantly, modern bridges are evolving to support not just tokens, but cross-chain data validation, state updates, and messaging, enabling a broader spectrum of interoperable applications.</p> Why Bridges&nbsp;Matter <p>Without bridges, liquidity and utility are locked within individual chains. That leads to fragmentation, inefficiency, and user friction. Crypto bridges solve this&nbsp;by:</p>  Enabling users to move assets freely across ecosystems  Allowing developers to tap into liquidity from other&nbsp;chains  Supporting cross-chain DeFi, gaming, NFT, and data-sharing applications  Reducing reliance on centralized exchanges  Facilitating cross-chain communication and AI agent orchestration  <p>Bridges are especially crucial in the Layer 2 and modular blockchain landscape, where chains are built for specialized functions (e.g., speed, privacy, compliance) but still need to interoperate.</p> HPP’s Approach to&nbsp;Bridging <p>As Aergo transitions to HPP, a Layer 2 network built on either Arbitrum Orbit or OP Stack depending on strategic and technical considerations, bridging becomes a central component of the roadmap. Aergo tokens exist on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum (ERC-20). In the future, HPP tokens will be launched on the selected Layer 2 platform, and official bridges will be established to support a secure transition and enable seamless cross-chain interactions.</p><p>In the initial stage, the bridge will serve primarily as a secure and convenient method for converting assets between chains. However, as development progresses, this infrastructure will evolve into the core of HPP’s cross-chain architecture, enabling interaction between the Aergo mainnet (L1) and HPP ETH (L2). It will also serve as the foundation for AI-related features, facilitating the orchestration of agents, datasets, and verified compute across multiple environments.</p><p>While the initial focus is on the Aergo-ETH-HPP triad, the team will continue developing additional bridge features based on demand and the evolution of the ecosystem.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Crypto bridges are essential as they represent the frontier of blockchain scalability, data coordination, and user access. Bridges are not just a ‘token swapper’ — they will be the conductor of an AI-purpose network, orchestrating AI agents, datasets, and more. Let’s see how bridges will evolve in the coming age of&nbsp;AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-4-understanding-crypto-bridges-6c78937fe5f1">BC 101 #4: Understanding Crypto Bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On May 8th, 2025, we held our sixth weekly AMA. And for the first time, we hosted it on <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1OyJALokBMNGb">X/Twitter Spaces.</a> The session with hosts Ben and Raph covered everything from HPP’s roadmap and token migration to AI, ecosystem partnerships, and more. Here’s a numbered recap of the key questions and insights&nbsp;shared:</p>  Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for HPP?<br>HPP (House Party Protocol) is the next evolution of the Aergo public blockchain. Backed by a team with over a decade in Web3, HPP represents a pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. It builds on Aergo’s strong enterprise foundation to support more adaptive, intelligent, and data-driven applications.  When will HPP launch?<br>HPP is targeting a launch in Q3 2025, which is when the current Aergo chain will transition into the HPP network. Until then, users can follow the project through its living roadmap and community channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Medium. Development updates, branding efforts, and offline appearances are ongoing in preparation for the official&nbsp;launch.  How will the token swap from AERGO to HPP work?<br>The AERGO to HPP token swap will happen at a 1:1 ratio. The process will depend on where the tokens are held. Most exchanges are expected to handle the swap automatically. A bridge may be required for self-custodied tokens. Official instructions will be provided ahead of the swap. Users are advised to stay vigilant and only trust verified channels.  Are there any Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains like BNB or Solana?<br>No. AERGO currently exists only on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. If anyone is offering Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains (e.g., BNB or Solana), it is a scam. The only safe way to move tokens is through the official bridge provided by the&nbsp;project.  Is staking available for AERGO tokens?<br>Yes. AERGO staking is available on the Aergo mainnet. Community members regularly share updated staking options in the Telegram chat, which is the best place to learn more and get involved.  What is the relationship between Aergo and Blocko?<br>Aergo and Blocko are separate entities, although they share early founders. Blocko serves as a long-term technology partner and contributes development and infrastructure support to the Aergo ecosystem. Blocko also works with major enterprise clients and remains a trusted blockchain solution provider.  Why is HPP focused on AI?<br>AI is no longer just a trend; it is becoming a foundational layer of modern digital applications. HPP is designed to address AI accountability, data validation, and agent verification. The goal is to support both innovative AI use cases and safeguards against misuse by providing a secure blockchain environment for data and agent integrity.  What is VaaSBlock’s role in the HPP ecosystem?<br>VaasBlock is an independent company that focuses on Web3 accountability tools. It is closely aligned with Aergo and contributes to the HPP ecosystem through W3DB — a decentralized registry for datasets and AI agents. While separate, the collaboration is strong, and team members often work side-by-side.  Any updates on Binance spot listing?<br>Currently, Aergo is listed on Binance Futures. The team would like to see a Binance Spot listing but has no control over Binance’s listing decisions. The focus remains on building real products and delivering value through the HPP ecosystem in hopes of earning broader listings over&nbsp;time.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-ama-6-recap-from-aergo-to-hpp-ai-and-whats-coming-next-3f9f865549a2">HPP AMA #6 Recap: From Aergo to HPP, AI, and What’s Coming Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>Universities lose over $600 M each year to fake diplomas and spend up to two weeks verifying each transcript. Extrimian’s suite—Digital Credential Wallet, ID Connect API, and Extrimian Academy—cuts verification time by 98%, prevents all credential fraud, and trains your team on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).</p>



<p></p>



 



 How Decentralized Digital Identity Is Revolutionizing Data Security in Universities 



<p>Higher-ed institutions handle millions of sensitive records—transcripts, diplomas, research files, financial aid documents—but still rely on emails, paper forms, and siloed databases. The result?</p>



 Credential Fraud 



 
 64% of candidates admit to lying on their résumé, and nearly 30% specifically lie about their academic degree → <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/candidates-for-school-jobs-may-be-lying-on-resumes-what-to-do-about-it/2024/06" title="">Education Week (2023)</a> + 



 1 in 4 Americans (25%) admit to lying on their résumé — with academic qualifications among the most common areas of deception → <a href="https://www.benefitnews.com/news/job-applicants-are-lying-on-resumes">Employee Benefit News (2023)</a> citing <a href="https://www.resumebuilder.com/resume-examples/1-4-americans-have-lied-on-their-resume/">ResumeBuilder Study (2023)</a> 



 UK universities uncovered over £7 million in fraudulent student loans between 2022 and 2025 → <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/universities-hit-student-loan-fraud-r8xj2qph2" title="">The Times UK (2024)</a> 
 



 Slow and costly processes of manual verification in the education industry 



 
 Manual verification of an academic credential can take up to 72 hours → <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/" title="">Clarifacts (2024)</a> 



 The cost of a manual credential verification ranges from $75 to $365 USD → <a href="https://americantranslationservice.com/cheap-credential-evaluation-services.html" title="">American Translation Service (2024)</a> 
 



<p>This article shows how decentralized digital identity (SSI) and Extrimian’s solutions solve these problems with real metrics, clear steps, and a roadmap for modernizing your campus.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>



 
 SSI cuts verification from days to minutes. 



 Cryptographic credentials eliminate all fraud. 



 Extrimian’s <a>Digital Credential Wallet</a>, <a>ID Connect API</a> and <a href="https://extrimian.io/academy/">Academy</a> deliver end-to-end support. 



 ROI: 98% time saved, 100% MFA adoption, near-zero fraud. 
 



<p></p>
</blockquote>



 



 1. Challenges and Barriers in Higher Education 



 1.1 Credential Fraud 



 
 $600 M+ lost every year to forged diplomas and transcripts 



 30% of job applicants lie about academic qualifications 
 



 1.2 Slow, Manual Processes 



 
 5–14 days per document for traditional verification 



 $20–$30 cost per manual check 
 



 1.3 Security Gaps 



 
 Only 45% of institutions enforce MFA consistently (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>) 



 Ransomware groups like HIVE and Vice Society have shut down campuses (e.g., Munster Technological University, 2023) 
 




Comparison of manual verification (days) vs. SSI verification (minutes)




<p></p>



 



 2. What Is Decentralized Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) puts control in students’ hands. Credentials live in a secure digital wallet instead of on a central server. Benefits include:</p>



 
 No more fraud: Signatures stop forgeries 



 Instant checks: Verify in seconds, anywhere 



 Selective privacy: Share only what’s needed (e.g., “Enrolled 2025” without GPA) 



 Built-in compliance: GDPR, FERPA, LGPD covered by design

 3. Extrimian’s Education Suite 



 3.1 Digital Credential Wallet 



 
 Student-centric: Mobile/web access, offline-ready 



 Selective sharing: Issue QR codes or secure links 



 Instant revocation: Revoke compromised credentials in real time 
 



 3.2 ID Connect API &amp; Dashboard 



 
 No-code integration: Prebuilt connectors for SIS, LMS—go live in under a day 



 Live analytics: Track issuance, verifications, and system health 



 Enterprise security: End-to-end encryption, role-based access, audit trails 
 



 3.3 Extrimian Academy 



 
 On-demand training: From SSI basics to advanced API use 



 Hands-on labs: Sandbox for issuing DIDs, VCs, and testing wallet workflows 



 Certifications: Prove your team’s SSI expertise

<p>On today’s episode we spoke to Rebekah Johnson, Founder &amp; CEO of Numeracle. This was a fascinating conversation about Rebekah’s journey starting Numeracle in 2016 to bring trust back to business communications by tackling robocalling and spam in the telecom ecosystem.</p><p>We talk about how Numeracle became an early identity issuer in telecom through the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN protocols which have now rolled out to subscribers of carriers like T-Mobile and how she overcame the classic chicken-and-egg problem of launching before carriers were ready. We also discuss how the business identity ecosystem compares to consumer digital identity, and what companies should do when they know a new standard is coming (like eIDAS 2.0), but it’s not here yet.</p><p>We finish by exploring modern AI's impact on communications, including how to preserve trust when automated agents or AI-powered voice calls are part of the conversation.</p><p>You can learn more about Numeracle at <a href="https://www.numeracle.com/">numeracle.com</a> and connect with Rebekah on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bekajohnson/">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p></p>



<p>That question has been rattling around in my brain lately, and I keep coming back to it. Not because I have a clever answer—goodness knows I’m not an identity architect, nor can I play one on TV—but because it changes the shape of the conversation I’m used to hearing. It stops being about camps or philosophies—centralized vs decentralized—and starts being about resilience. Adaptability. Survivability. Malleability. The real stuff that makes or breaks systems under pressure.</p>



<p>Whether you realize it or not, most of us are already living in the murky middle. Even the most rigorously centralized enterprise setup has had to grapple with siloed systems from acquisitions, third-party integrations that can’t be wrangled into compliance, or regional requirements that throw a wrench into the “single source of truth” fantasy.</p>



<p>On the consumer side, it’s no simpler. Many apps build their entire onboarding flow around third-party login, such as Sign in with Google, Facebook, Apple, only to realize later they can’t get out. Apple tweaks its policies, Google changes branding or scopes, and suddenly your user flow is broken. Or worse, your legal team is panicking about data access that was never fully under your control.</p>



<p>So maybe the goal shouldn’t be to “pick a side.” Maybe the goal is to build something that can move.</p>



 We’ve Been Here Before 



<p>I remember when the phrase “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” first started making the rounds. It was a wake-up call for how data was being monetized, especially in consumer tech. But in enterprise settings, it’s always been more complicated. Control over employee and operational data is often treated as sacred… until an M&amp;A event hits, or an offboarding workflow depends on access to a different tenant’s system, or someone discovers the only copy of a critical record lives on a spreadsheet maintained by a single team in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Even the executives who believe they have centralized control are often just looking at a well-behaved abstraction. Under the surface, the architecture is often more federated (or fragmented) than anyone wants to admit.</p>



<p>So: centralized in theory, decentralized in reality. And that’s (probably) fine, if you plan for it.</p>



 Centralized vs Decentralized is the Wrong Question 



<p>The wrong question is, “Should we centralize everything or decentralize everything?” Because you’re never going to have a clean answer to that. Business needs shift. Systems fail. Teams grow faster than governance can keep up. Which means sometimes, decentralization isn’t just a compromise, it’s a strategic advantage.</p>



<p>Take employee authentication. It’s easy to default to a centralized IdP for control and visibility. But control doesn’t always mean centralization. In some cases, like high-assurance access to sensitive systems, decentralized approaches like verifiable digital credentials might offer more resilient and efficient ways to meet your risk and compliance goals. (I’ve written about this in more detail <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/25/digital-credentials-in-the-enterprise/">over here</a>.)</p>



<p>So instead of asking “which architecture is best?” the real question is:</p>



<p>How do we build for mobility between them?</p>



 Shift Zones: A Mental Model 



<p>Here’s how I think about it. Your architecture probably has at least three layers:</p>



 
 Core systems that demand high assurance, strong governance, and low tolerance for error. These might initially seem like candidates for centralization, but in practice, decentralized approaches (like verifiable credentials) can reduce exposure, improve auditability, and allow more precise access controls. Think about systems managing employee benefits, third-party entitlements, or financial approvals that span org boundaries. 



 Edge systems where decentralization improves speed, autonomy, or user experience. Think mobile app login, partner ecosystems, or field service platforms. 



 Bridge systems that help you manage both ends: identity brokers, API gateways, credential verifiers. These are your control points. They don’t need to be perfect, but they do need to be swappable. 
 



 This Isn’t About Complexity. It’s About Control. 



<p>There’s a reflexive fear that anything outside your central architecture introduces risk. But lock-in is its own kind of risk. What happens when:</p>



 
 The cloud provider you bet everything on has a region-wide outage? 



 Your go-to identity vendor starts charging for what used to be free? 



 A new privacy law forces you to isolate user records by country? 
 



<p>If your systems can’t move, your strategy can’t either.</p>



<p>Which brings us to an uncomfortable truth: flexibility isn’t a feature you tack on later. It’s an investment in survivability. And yes, that includes your DR/BC planning. If your recovery plan assumes the architecture will look the same when you need to recover—same vendors, same identity flows, same regional rules—you’re about to have a Really Bad Day.</p>



<p>Systems don’t fail in isolation. They fail in ways that expose your hidden dependencies. The real risk is that the thing you need next won’t work the way it used to or, more to the point, the way you’ve planned for come recovery time. If your plan can’t flex, it can’t recover. To put it another way: rigid design is brittle, so avoid it if you can.</p>



 Trends That Make This Urgent (Not Just Interesting) 



<p>Still on the fence about needing this kind of mobility? Here’s what’s already pushing organizations in that direction:</p>



 
 Regulations that require data residency or mandate new consent flows 



 Cloud concentration risk, made worse by geopolitical volatility 



 AI deployment that needs decentralized access to proprietary or regional datasets 



 Identity policy changes (looking at you, browsers) that upend previously stable auth flows 
 



<p>None of these trends are waiting for you to clean up your architecture.</p>



 Pop Quiz! 



<p>If you’re a CIO, architect, or planner, ask yourself:</p>



<p>Can your systems…</p>



<blockquote>
 
 …switch to a new identity provider or trust a new authority within 48 hours if they have to 



 …segment authorization policy by region or user group without rewriting everything? 



 …keep functioning when a key vendor changes terms or disappears? 



 …pivot to a new compliance boundary without a year of re-architecture? 
 
</blockquote>



<p>If not, it might be time to rethink what “flexibility” really means in your environment.</p>



 Final Thought: Don’t Confuse Control with Stability 



<p>Centralization often feels like control. Decentralization often feels like chaos. But both are illusions if you haven’t built for change. The real strength comes not from sticking to one approach, but from designing your systems to flex across time zones, use cases, org charts, and crises.</p>



<p>So next time someone in the boardroom or the architecture review committee asks, “Should we [de-]centralize this?” maybe try responding with:</p>



<p>“There are pros and cons, but first, let’s make sure we build in an ability to change our minds later.”</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00] Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity, from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place. Let’s get into it welcome to Episode one of the Audio Blog. This is engineering meets economics, and today we’re going to talk about something that gets framed as kind of a binary option a little too often, and that’s centralization versus decentralization.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] Now this episode isn’t about picking a side and arguing for an either or. It’s about recognizing that the best systems, especially identity systems, don’t live at either extreme. They move around.</p>



<p>[00:00:55] So this episode is based on the blog post Engineering Meets Shifting, Not Choosing between Centralized and Decentralized, which you can find on sphericalcowconsulting.com now we’re going to be focusing on digital identity, but the ideas here apply to infrastructure more broadly because whether you’re designing a login flow, a wallet ecosystem, a cloud strategy kind of doesn’t matter. The resilience comes in from the ability to shift around and not just scale and get bigger. So let’s dive in. First, let’s start with a bit of a clarification, because centralized and decentralized can mean so many different things depending on what layer you’re talking about.</p>



<p>[00:01:33] In an identity system, centralization usually refers to who controls the source of truth and the rules of engagement.</p>



<p>[00:01:41] A centralized identity system might use a single corporate directory as the source of truth, where identities are managed, access policies are enforced, and decisions flow from one authority. Even if you’re using a third party provider like Okta or Microsoft Entra, the control is still centralized if it all stems from that single directory and policy framework. Now that’s different from decentralized identity systems, where the control is distributed, the user or device might hold their own credentials, and verification happens independently of any single governing authority. Trust is negotiated. It’s not inherited from a single source.</p>



<p>[00:02:20] Now to be clear, decentralized doesn’t mean there’s no structure. It just means that the structure allows multiple parties to operate with some level of autonomy. Now, in practice, most organizations sit somewhere in between. You might authenticate users through a central identity provider or idp, while also issuing credentials that work across external partners, vendors, or federations. And that hybrid space is where things get interesting and where smart architecture can give you room to maneuver as your environment changes. Okay, did that make sense? No. Let me try an analogy. When I was a kid, my father decided it would be hilarious to toss me a stack of plates. These were those old Corningware white and blue plates. And if you’re of a certain age and in the US I know you probably remember these. Now, me being me, I’m not about a to attempt to catch a pile of plates. And so I jumped back and the plates crashed to the ground. And I promise this is going somewhere relevant.</p>



<p>[00:03:16] Those plates didn’t just break. They shattered and continued to shatter for a good five minutes. You could hear the little crackles as things turned into small slivers of Corningware. A purely centralized technology is like a whole plate. A purely decentralized technology is a lot like slivers of plate. The best model is to have a plate that can survive being broken and yet still remain useful in one configuration, and that it won’t become an unmanageable pile of slivers so can be broken. Those broken pieces are still useful, but it doesn’t break down into just unrecognizable shattered bits. Okay, I digress. I suppose. So why does this matter? Because in an enterprise system, especially Identity, you’re always making decisions about control, or whether you call it that or not.</p>



<p>[00:04:04] Now, let’s say your organization uses a central IDP like Okta or Entra. You manage the directory or directory like object. You define the policies. But now you want to federate across to a partner organization or issue credentials that could be verified independently or meet new data residency rules in different jurisdictions. You’re not decentralizing for the fun of it. You’re decentralizing because your environment changed.</p>



<p>[00:04:29] And that’s where the friction begins. If your architecture assumes that everything will always route through one system, one policy engine, one source of truth, you’re going to have a problem.</p>



<p>[00:04:40] Now you might be thinking, why do I need to build systems that can shift between models? Isn’t that just overengineering for edge cases? You know, it’s a fair question. But here’s the thing. No one ever thinks they need that optionality until their primary model fails. The thing is, they don’t have to be fast. You know, the shift doesn’t have to be complete, but it does have to be possible. Because if the only direction your system can actually move is like in this one, one pattern, it’s not resilient, it’s actually brittle. Which gets me to that heart of the problem. You’re not choosing decentralization or centralization for its own sake. You’re design, you know, what you need to be doing is designing for the ability to shift control when the situation demands it, whether that’s technical, legal or organizational. Now, I’m not trying to tell a fear story here. I’m giving you a design challenge. Fear, uncertainty and doubt may, you know, maybe what you’re hearing, but for me it’s this challenging moment that’s a new take on the reality that I think we can do better with.</p>



<p>[00:05:39] So let’s talk about why most systems don’t feel flexible and why decentralization may sound good in theory but so often gets pushed aside in practice, especially in the enterprise. Well, I think the short answer is because centralization is easier to explain. It’s easier to build and it’s easier to control, at least at first. When you’re under pressure to ship a service, secure a system, or meet compliance requirements, centralization feels like such an obvious choice because it’s simplifying your procurement, it’s probably shortening your decision making and it’s giving you that one throat to choke when something goes wrong. And it’s not a failure, it’s just what happens when you don’t have time to design for flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:06:21] Now it’s kind of funny that you know when you’re thinking about it that way because most organizations already decentralized, at least to some some extent, they just don’t necessarily call it that.</p>



<p>[00:06:31] So if you’re, you know, in a big company, you might let different business units manage their own IAM policies.</p>



<p>[00:06:40] You might federate identity across subsidiaries or required companies.</p>



<p>[00:06:44] You might let contractors use their own credentials, tying them into your systems through some kind of federation like SAML or OpenID Connect. And that’s decentralization usually works reasonably well, though if it’s not done mindfully, it can be a little bit fragile, a little bit informal. And when that informal stuff breaks, then you’re kind of scrambling and you want to rebuild that central source of control because control feels good. Or, or worse, you might start doubling down on centralization in ways that creates serious lock in.</p>



<p>[00:07:17] Because once you’ve optimized for a single identity provider or a single trust model, or a single cloud region, you’ve made a bet as to what’s going to persevere in the long term. If your business changes or the legal environment shifts or the vendor gets acquired, you’re kind of stuck. And that’s not a failure of centralization, it’s a failure of being flexible.</p>



<p>[00:07:39] So what I want to talk about isn’t abandoning control. It’s designing a system that can be reconfigured without having to start all over again. And I don’t think that’s a fantasy. I think it’s a different set of design goals.</p>



<p>[00:07:51] So what does flexibility actually look like in real world identity systems? Okay, it’s not about throwing out everything centralized, and it’s definitely not about decentralizing just for the sake of doing it. It’s about designing with options. Right? You want to build a system that supports more than one model of control, more than one model of trust, and more than one path forward. For example, your internal directory can still be the system of record, but you can design APIs or token flows that let external verifiers validate credentials independently.</p>



<p>[00:08:26] You can use federated logins across business partners, but layer on policy controls that live with the relying party, not the issuer.</p>



<p>[00:08:34] You can store data in the cloud, but architect for multi region failover or multi cloud redundancy. So your compliance strategy isn’t tied to one jurisdiction.</p>



<p>[00:08:44] Again, the goal isn’t to decentralize everything. It’s to avoid systems where the only way to function is through one tightly coupled dependency.</p>



<p>[00:08:52] That kind of flexibility isn’t free. It does cost more to architect, and it takes more time for teams to align. And you’ll probably have to explain it repeatedly to leadership who wants to know why you’re not using the default centralized option?</p>



<p>[00:09:08] What you’re building in and the argument you can make is that you’re building room to maneuver. So when things shift, like when a vendor changes their roadmap or regulation forces your hand, you’re not stuck rewriting your entire stack. You’re shifting your control intentionally.</p>



<p>[00:09:23] So here’s the takeaway from all of this. Decentralization isn’t inherently better. Centralization isn’t inherently bad. What matters is whether your system is designed to adapt not just to today’s need, but to tomorrow’s constraints.</p>



<p>[00:09:37] Now, that might mean building systems that can federate when needed but still operate independently. Could mean designing identity flows that let you change providers without rewriting your policy framework.</p>



<p>[00:09:48] It could mean making architecture decisions that give you breathing room, not just efficiency, because you know your real resilience isn’t going to be about eliminating all risk. You can’t. But it is about having the room to shift across vendors, across trust models, across jurisdictions, without throwing everything out.</p>



<p>[00:10:05] Think of optionality as a feature, and flexibility is what is keeping your designs relevant when the world changes around it.</p>



<p>[00:10:14] So what now? The written post Engineering Meets Economics does dive a bit deeper into all of this if you want an idea of more about what I’m talking about. And also, since this is the first of a series of four posts where the series is heading, if you’re building identity systems, managing user access, or just trying to future proof your architecture, remember this isn’t about choosing a side. You know, for the people who are passionate about decentralization or centralization. It’s about building the flexibility to respond to change.</p>

<p>As a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, maintaining robust Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Business (KYB), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows is essential to comply with regulatory requirements and safeguard your firm against financial crimes.</p>



<p>Below is a checklist to help ensure your compliance programs align with FINRA rules:</p>



 1. Know Your Customer (KYC) 



 
 Customer Identification Program (CIP):
 
 Collect and verify essential customer information:
 
 Full name 



 Date of birth 



 Address 



 Identification number 
 
 



 Maintain records of the identification information and verification methods used. 
 
 



 Customer Due Diligence (CDD):
 
 Understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop a risk profile. 



 Conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious activities. 
 
 



 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):
 
 Apply additional scrutiny to high-risk customers, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) or those from high-risk jurisdictions. 



 Gather information on the source of funds and wealth. 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Rule:</p>



 
 FINRA Rule 2090 – Know Your Customer: Requires firms to use reasonable diligence to know and retain essential facts concerning every customer. <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2090?utm_source=chatgpt.com">FINRA</a> 
 



 2. Know Your Business (KYB) 



 
 Business Entity Verification:
 
 Verify the legal status and ownership structure of corporate clients. 



 Identify and verify beneficial owners with a 25% or more ownership stake. 
 
 



 Risk Assessment:
 
 Assess the nature of the business, its products, services, and customer base to determine risk levels. 
 
 



 Ongoing Monitoring:
 
 Continuously monitor business accounts for unusual or suspicious activities. 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Guidance:</p>



 
 While FINRA does not have a specific rule titled “KYB,” the principles of customer due diligence and AML compliance extend to business entities. 
 



 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance 



 
 Written AML Program:
 
 Develop and implement a written AML program approved by senior management. 



 Ensure the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations. 
 
 



 Independent Testing:
 
 Conduct independent testing of the AML program at least annually to assess its effectiveness. 
 
 



 Designated AML Compliance Officer:
 
 Appoint a qualified individual responsible for overseeing AML compliance. 
 
 



 Ongoing Training:
 
 Provide ongoing training for appropriate personnel to ensure awareness of AML responsibilities. 
 
 



 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR):
 
 Establish procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Rule:</p>



 
 FINRA Rule 3310 – Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program: Sets forth minimum standards for AML compliance programs, including the requirements mentioned above. <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3310?utm_source=chatgpt.com">FINRA</a> 
 



 Additional Considerations 



 
 Recordkeeping:
 
 Maintain comprehensive records of all customer information, transaction reports, and compliance efforts as required by FINRA and the BSA. 
 
 



 Risk-Based Approach:
 
 Implement a risk-based approach to AML compliance, allocating resources commensurate with the level of risk identified. 
 
 



 Regulatory Updates:

<p>The European Union just dropped a regulatory bombshell: by 2027, anonymous crypto accounts and privacy coins like Monero, Zcash, and Dash will be banned under sweeping new anti-money laundering rules.</p><p>The debate around crypto regulation has officially shifted. The question is no longer if crypto will comply with traditional financial regulations — it’s whether there will be any space left for privacy at all. And if not, what exactly are we building?</p> The Regulatory Reality <p>Starting July 2027, EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Regulation will:</p>  Ban any cryptocurrency designed to provide transaction anonymity  Require full KYC for all users of crypto platforms  Mandate identity verification for transactions over&nbsp;€1,000  Create a new authority (AMLA) to enforce these standards  <p>This represents the most aggressive regulatory stance against privacy in crypto to date, effectively erasing the anonymity that was once fundamental to the crypto&nbsp;ethos.</p> The Philosophical Dilemma <p>If blockchain technology becomes merely a more efficient version of our existing financial system — with the same surveillance, the same identity requirements, and the same centralized oversight — have we lost the&nbsp;plot?</p><p>Crypto was born as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, offering an alternative to centralized banking. Now, as it’s forced to mirror those same systems, we must ask: what value does it still&nbsp;offer?</p> The Privacy&nbsp;Paradox <p>The tension between regulation and privacy reveals a fundamental paradox: financial systems require trust, yet the original promise of crypto was to eliminate the need for trust through code. When we reintroduce centralized trust requirements via regulation, we fundamentally alter the value proposition.</p><p>Consider what’s lost when privacy disappears:</p>  Financial sovereignty — The ability to control your assets without surveillance  Protection from discrimination — Prevention of selective financial exclusion based on patterns of&nbsp;spending  Business confidentiality — Companies’ ability to keep competitive financial strategies private  Personal security — Protection from targeting based on visible&nbsp;wealth  <p>The irony is striking: in the name of security and consumer protection, we may be creating systems more vulnerable to both governmental overreach and targeted&nbsp;attacks.</p> Beyond Compliance: Technical Responses <p>The crypto industry now faces a crossroads. Several approaches are emerging:</p> 1. Compliance-Forward Architectures <p>Some platforms are embracing full regulatory compliance, building KYC/AML directly into protocol layers. This “surveillance-by-design” approach prioritizes regulatory acceptance over&nbsp;privacy.</p> 2. Boundary-Layer Solutions <p>Others are developing systems where privacy exists conditionally — allowing private transactions within regulatory boundaries while enabling compliance at critical junctures. Zero-knowledge proofs offer possibilities for selective disclosure without complete transparency.</p> 3. Jurisdictional Arbitrage <p>We’re likely to see geography-based fragmentation, with privacy coins and anonymous protocols flourishing outside the EU while compliant systems dominate within regulated territories.</p> 4. Decentralized Identity <p>Perhaps most promising are approaches that separate identification from surveillance, allowing for regulatory compliance without wholesale privacy sacrifice through selective disclosure mechanisms.</p> The New North&nbsp;Star <p>As the industry adapts to this regulatory reality, perhaps we need a new guiding principle — one that recognizes both the necessity of some regulation and the fundamental human right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The most innovative projects won’t be those that simply evade regulation nor those that surrender completely to surveillance capitalism. They’ll be the ones that thread the needle, finding technical and governance approaches that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving the core value of individual financial autonomy.</p><p>Because if crypto becomes indistinguishable from the banking system it sought to reform — just with better technology — then we’ve built nothing revolutionary at all. We’ve merely digitized the status&nbsp;quo.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty. SHFT is its native token and fuel of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Shyft Network facilitates the transfer of verifiable data between centralized and decentralized ecosystems. It sets the highest crypto compliance standard and provides the only frictionless Crypto Travel Rule compliance solution while protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Visit<a href="https://www.shyft.network/"> our website</a> to read more, and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">X (Formerly Twitter)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bb.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork">LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork"> </a><a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork"> Medium</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shyftnetwork7362/videos"> YouTube</a>.<a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe"> Sign up for our newsletter</a> to keep up-to-date on all things privacy and compliance.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-death-of-privacy-in-crypto-eus-2027-ban-raises-existential-questions-9e85b5f1123f">The Death of Privacy in Crypto: EU’s 2027 Ban Raises Existential Questions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs is searching for partners to help us promote safe use of the internet and support at-risk people who have a specific need for privacy and security in their life.</p>



<p>We’re inviting interested organizations to sign up as advocates of our Sudo Safe initiative and help us spread the word about a reliable way at-risk people can interact with others without giving away their phone number, email address, and other personal details.</p>



<p>Sudo Safe Advocates would help us share the important message about safe communication and offer their employees or members a 60-day free trial* of <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a> which gives users real, alternative phone numbers and email addresses (and more) to use instead of their own.</p>



<p>In today’s highly connected world, we are all asked to share our phone and email everywhere we go online and in real life. But a person’s phone number and email are easy access points for a potential stalker or attacker.</p>



<p>A stalker or attacker can use those personal details to contact their victim directly, send them threatening texts, hack their email and socials, and use <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">other tech</a> to track their movements, for example.</p>



<p>Using a separate phone and email is a useful safety strategy. MySudo allows users to manage up to 9 separate phone numbers and email addresses to use for their personal privacy and safety.</p>



<p>The phone and email are built into <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, secure digital identities that can be set up for specific purposes and <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020176373-How-do-I-delete-a-Sudo-profile">deleted</a> or <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055670913-How-do-I-Mute-Notifications-for-a-Sudo-Profile">muted</a> at any time to cut off tech access to any person who has the Sudo details.</p>



<p>What’s more, each Sudo has the option for a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">virtual card</a> to use instead of a personal credit or debit card. Card charges appear only as ‘MySudo Transaction’ on the user’s bank statement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, each Sudo’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a> allows the user to search the internet ad and tracker free, help to break the user’s data trail and make it more difficult to correlate their movements online.<br><br>A Sudo Safe Advocate could be any organization that works with survivors or those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, or any organization that strives to help protect the personal safety of its employees or members, such as universities and colleges, hospitals and health care agencies, and government agencies.<br><br>To join the Sudo Safe Advocates program or find out more, head to this <a href="https://anonyome.com/sudo-safe-initiative/#advocate">link</a>. Once there, simply complete the short online form and we will send you our digital safe communication toolkit plus the promo code for the 60-day free trial* of MySudo to share with your employees or members.</p>



<p>If your organization is interested in discussing other ways to partner with Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Safe initiative, please email us at <a href="mailto:sudosafe@anonyome.com">sudosafe@anonyome.com</a>&nbsp;and we’ll reach out to you.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs empowers people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse with real and effective tools for protecting their name, email, phone number and more. Talk to us today about how we can work together.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is also a proud partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>,&nbsp;a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.</p>

<p>The UK is aiming to join the growing number of nations introducing forms of digital identity that, if done right, could empower citizens to protect their privacy like never before.</p>
<p>In 2023, the British government released a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DITF)</a> that provided a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in any future digital identity-based initiatives in an effort to boost the country’s <a href="https://ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CCIA_State-of-the-UK-Digital-Economy.pdf">$150 billion</a> digital economy. The idea: enable smoother, more secure online transactions and align more closely to the secure route taken by much of Europe when it comes to digital identity.</p>
 What Exactly Is Digital Identity? 
<p>Identity verification and proofing are essential to functioning societies. It enables individuals to prove their identity to take out loans, make purchases, receive entitlements, access services, manage finances, and more. Verifying that identity in digital channels has been tougher, accomplished mainly through usernames, passwords, and rudimentary forms of multifactor authentication. Thanks to never-ending phishing scams and data breaches, the result has been a <a href="https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/cybercrime-costs-skyrocket-to-10-5-trillion-ai-in-cybersecurity-fights-back#:~:text=The%20annual%20cost%20of%20cybercrime,exceed%20$10.5%20trillion%20by%202025.">$10.5 trillion-a-year</a> global cybercrime economy.</p>
<p>New forms of digital identity are generally validated digital attributes and credentials designed primarily, but not exclusively, for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced government-issued physical world credentials. Birth credentials, driver’s license, passports—those kinds of things. They also increasingly include biometric information, like a fingerprint or face scan.</p>
<p>For national identification purposes, digital identity can be connected to, and even contained in, biometric-enabled ID cards, though a growing number of countries, including Singapore, India, Estonia, Sweden and Spain, are also launching mobile apps and digital wallets for keeping this and other credentials for accessing medical care, educational services, and other information that may be used for interactions and information exchange between government, universities, banks and lenders, employers, and businesses.</p>
<p>Benefits include convenience—citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. Instead, they grant permission to banks, health care providers, government agencies, and businesses to retrieve personal information to simplify account enrollment and verification. In the UK’s case, it’s estimated that digital identity can generate an additional $800 million to the UK economy every year. But there are more than a few challenges ahead.</p>
 Identity Proof Is in the Pudding 
<p>According to the 2025 Cyber Security Breaches Survey from the UK’s Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, 43% of UK businesses experienced a <a href="https://cybermagazine.com/cyber-security/inside-the-uk-governments-cyber-security-breaches-survey">cyberattack or breach</a> in the past year. That’s actually down from recent years, thanks to heightened cybersecurity—but still quite troubling. Phishing played a role in 85% of the successful breaches or attacks. The financial impact of successful breaches is significant—an average of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$4.5 million</a> per incident, before any lawsuits or regulatory fines. When personal information is breached, it can take years to rebuild public trust.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/uk-govt-introduces-new-digital-identity-verification-services-bill">Provisions</a> in the Digital Information and Smart Data Bill introduced in 2024 are designed to address data privacy concerns. This includes specially-certified third-party digital identity services that follow strict government guidelines for helping people set up digital identities while “reducing costs, time, and data leakage.” It also includes attribute providers that share attributes—specific elements of an individual’s full identity—with organizations or individuals needing to verify identity, but only with the individual’s consent. The official list of such services was launched on <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/uk-register-of-digital-identity-and-attribute-services-launches-in-beta">April 16</a>. For the record, it’s also worth pointing out that the government ruled out a mandatory digital identity.</p>
<p>The government has also announced the introduction of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348641/uk-government-digital-id-app-ios-android-launch">Gov.uk digital wallet</a>. This mobile app gives users the ability to store and manage their identity information, and is expected to drive significant growth in adoption of digital identity among UK residents. <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-portugal/">Portugal</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-singapore/">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-thailand/">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-india/">India</a>, and other nations are seeing tremendous uptake of digital identity through such apps. And Juniper Research estimates that <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/gov-uk-to-grow-while-private-sector-digital-id-app-adoption-flattens-juniper">6.9 million people</a> will adopt the app this year, climbing to 25.5 million by 2029.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to believe this is overly optimistic. Surveys have shown that more than <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/uk-digital-identity-scheme-needs-to-consider-commercial-viability-panel-says">40% of people</a> have “little to no trust” in the government managing their personal information through such systems. They trust businesses <a href="https://www.careful.industries/digital-identity-in-the-uk">even less.</a></p>
 What Kind of Digital Identity Makes All the Difference 
<p>For digital identity systems to work, individuals must control who has access to their data. These systems must also lower barriers to participation. In the UK, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2021/05/more-three-million-uk-voters-have-no-form-photo-id">8% of the population</a> doesn’t have even traditional forms of identification. Voting, driving, working, borrowing, and even commerce can be difficult without an ID.</p>
<p>Digital identity can change that. It can also reduce bias by enabling only pertinent information to be used, so that personal data vulnerable to discrimination doesn’t come into play. These systems can also reduce fraud by cryptographically protecting and locking with specific multifactor authentication methods.</p>
<p>The UK’s digital identity initiative is a significant step in the right direction. But it might also be a sign of the post-Brexit world we live in that, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceyfollows/2024/07/17/will-the-new-uk-government-introduce-a-new-digital-identity-system/">Forbes points out</a>, the UK is pursuing a different strategy for digital identity than the European Union. And that may matter in a couple of significant ways.</p>
<p>Under EU law, users remain in control of the digital credentials in their wallets to ensure that they can decide what information they share and with whom, and they can use verifiable credentials to prove certain attributes without revealing their personal data at all. A standardized digital identity solution is used via wallets across all member states under the EU’s Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust (EIDAS) regulations. Governance oversight is maintained by public sector institutions in each member state.</p>
<p>Under the UK strategy, attribute service providers give users the ability to share just the information they want with specific organizations or individuals needing to verify identity. This includes combining, say, identity information with birthdate information to verify an individual is old enough to enter a bar or example. But approved private sector providers centrally store and govern digital identity information under the DITF guidelines. As a practical matter, the utility of digital identities is also limited because of its lack of interoperability with EU systems.</p>
<p>In other words, citizens must use digital identity managed by a private sector it trusts less than the government and won’t be able to even use it with the organizations with which millions transact and interact each day. But there are steps the UK can take to mitigate these issues.</p>
 Building an Infrastructure of Trust: What Should Come Next 
<p>Yes, moving toward EIDAS standards could significantly improve the UK’s ability to conduct business with its neighbors in the EU. But either way, following some of the steps the EU is taking in distributed ledger-based identity systems can benefit the utility and adoption of digital identity no matter the framework the UK employs.</p>
<p>Both frameworks make use of digital wallets. And both frameworks grant users a measure of control over with whom their personal information is shared. But several EU countries are ahead of the curve in moving toward far more decentralized forms of identity that give users even more control over personal data—while dramatically reducing the chances of it getting hacked.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-based systems, users are authenticated without requiring personal data to be stored centrally on servers belonging to public or private organizations such as the UK’s attribute service providers, where it can be hacked, ransomed, or otherwise exploited to commit fraud. Instead, individual users maintain full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party at all. They control what information they share, for what purpose, and for how long.</p>
<p>Germany, Italy, Estonia, and Poland have <a href="https://identityweek.net/what-are-the-repercussions-of-eu-member-states-not-proactively-embracing-eidas2/">pilots in place</a> for this kind of system as part of<a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/"> EIDAS 2</a>, an ambitious update to the original EIDAS framework. There’s no reason the UK couldn’t embrace its own flavor of this kind of “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2024/08/07/self-sovereign-decentralized-identity-is-key-to-retail-cbdc-adoption/">self-sovereign identity.</a>”</p>
<p>Even within its current framework, digital identity wallets should also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79520.html">ISO/IEC</a> biometrics-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating virtually any attempt at identity spoofing or unauthorized access to accounts in a process that’s nearly effortless for users. The architecture for this kind of functional, practical digital identity is available today. In fact, it’s baked into the solution we offer at 1Kosmos. In light of distrust in government and business stemming from non-stop threats to personal data and privacy, it’s the kind of digital identity anyone would welcome.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to a new digital frontier: AI agents are no longer science fiction but a rapidly emerging force in commerce and enterprise infrastructure. Recent moves from Visa and Mastercard have opened the floodgates for intelligent agents to participate in real-world economic activities. These agents will browse the web and buy, book, negotiate, and interact on behalf of users or organizations.</p><p>Visa’s launch of “<a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Visa Intelligent Commerce</a>” and Mastercard’s rollout of “<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2025/april/mastercard-unveils-agent-pay-pioneering-agentic-payments-technology-to-power-commerce-in-the-age-of-ai/">Agent Pay</a>” mark a pivotal moment. AI agents are being handed the keys to payment networks — tokenized credentials, real-time transaction controls, and even spend-data-based personalization are now being integrated at the heart of legacy finance systems. These centralized moves, while powerful, only scratch the surface of what’s possible.</p><p>Through Visa and Mastercard’s AI commerce initiatives, we can clearly see not only the growing importance of AI agents in real-world systems but also the critical need for robust verification measures at every step of the process. From tokenized identities to real-time transaction monitoring, today’s standards will define how trust is built in autonomous systems.</p> The Centralized Push: Making AI Agents&nbsp;Real <p>Visa is working with OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM, Microsoft, and Stripe to scale AI commerce securely. Mastercard is embedding payments into AI-powered conversational flows. Both companies are enabling AI agents&nbsp;to:</p>  Transact via tokenized, AI-ready digital&nbsp;cards  Act within customizable user permissions  Leverage spend data (with consent) for personalization  Dispute and resolve transactions in real-time  <p>This represents a significant step forward. The financial system has historically been too rigid to allow fully autonomous software agents. Now, we’re beginning to see what happens when that friction is&nbsp;reduced.</p> A Glimpse of What’s&nbsp;Possible <p>While these systems operate within a permissioned framework today, their experimentation sets a powerful precedent. If Visa and Mastercard’s approach successfully brings AI agents to the mainstream securely and intuitively, imagine what becomes possible when these same capabilities are extended into open, composable ecosystems.</p><p>Rather than framing these developments as a competition, it’s more productive to see them as complementary. Legacy finance systems are proving their feasibility; permissionless crypto can extend their potential.</p> Enter HPP: The House Party&nbsp;Protocol <p>The House Party Protocol (HPP), Aergo’s new AI-first Layer 2 blockchain, is being designed precisely for this future. Built on Aergo’s proven enterprise blockchain legacy — powering large enterprises, Korean government agencies, and beyond — HPP will introduce a smarter, more adaptable stack tailored to AI-driven applications.</p><p>While Visa and Mastercard’s implementation of AI agents represents a significant breakthrough, it is currently limited to commerce and B2C environments. HPP, on the other hand, will be purpose-built to unlock broader use cases across both B2C and B2B sectors — from logistics and finance to procurement, compliance, and supply chain coordination.</p><p>Here’s how HPP contributes to the evolution:</p><p>1. AI-Ready Infrastructure<br>HPP provides a foundational layer where trust and intelligence are embedded directly into the infrastructure. Data within the HPP ecosystem is machine-readable, independently verified, and continuously assessed for reliability, ensuring high-quality inputs for any on-chain decision-making. AI-driven logic is designed to be transparent and explainable, with built-in mechanisms for on-chain accountability.</p><p>2. AI-Oracles for Real-Time Adaptation<br>HPP will integrate native AI-oracle functionality, allowing agents to make real-time decisions based on verified off-chain data streams. This will enhance adaptive automation and enable predictive, context-aware interactions across applications.</p><p>3. Verified Computation and Data Trust<br>HPP leverages external verification frameworks like VaaSBlock, a decentralized validation network that crowdsources verification tasks and scores credibility through reputation-based staking. Combined with Booost, which provides human-authenticated signals and real-world identity attestations to combat synthetic manipulation, HPP ensures that agent decisions and data sources are transparently validated, verifiable, and resistant to tampering.</p><p>4. Enterprise-Grade Implementation and Maintenance<br>Through mature integration pathways and support for hybrid on/off-chain data models, HPP makes it easier for enterprises to build, deploy, and maintain blockchain-based AI systems. This bridges the gap between traditional enterprise infrastructure and emerging AI-native services.</p> Looking Ahead: AI Agents + Crypto Infrastructure <p>The enterprise world is just beginning to explore what AI agents can do. The potential is enormous, from procurement bots to dynamic pricing, from customer service automation to decentralized governance participation.</p><p>Legacy finance systems like Visa are making the concept real. But decentralized, AI-native environments like HPP will give these agents freedom to&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>In short, if Visa is the on-ramp for AI agents, HPP will be the autobahn.</p><p>Enterprise adoption of autonomous agents is coming. And with HPP, we’re building the rails for them to run&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-rise-of-ai-agents-in-enterprise-why-hpp-is-key-to-what-comes-next-588a09ff7e42">The Rise of AI Agents in Enterprise: Why HPP is Key to What Comes Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this week’s AMA, Aergo Advisors Raph and Ben led a conversation covering recent progress within the Aergo ecosystem, the ongoing transition to the House Party Protocol (HPP), and emerging efforts in Layer 2 development and AI integration. Below is a summary of the key points discussed.</p> 1. What’s the point of these weekly AMA sessions? <p>These sessions are about staying transparent and accountable. Each week, we gather real questions from the community, often via Telegram or social channels, and do our best to answer them directly. Not every answer will be popular, but that’s part of building an honest dialogue. The intent is to help the community understand what’s happening behind the scenes and to get people excited about what’s&nbsp;coming.</p> 2. Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for&nbsp;HPP? <p>The House Party Protocol (HPP) is the next chapter of the Aergo public blockchain. It’s more than a token swap — it represents a strategic pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. Aergo has a strong enterprise track record, and HPP builds on that by creating a smarter, more adaptive environment for AI-driven use cases. The internal team has been working on HPP for over 14 months, and it was approved through three governance votes earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>HPP will replace AERGO trading pairs on exchanges, and its ecosystem is designed from the ground up to support intelligent automation and Web3 applications. It’s a calculated shift that puts Aergo in a position to lead in a world increasingly shaped by&nbsp;AI.</p> 3. What is the Living Roadmap, and how does it&nbsp;work? <p>The Living Roadmap is a live document that is regularly updated by various team members, providing a transparent view into technical development, partnerships, and strategic efforts. It’s not updated on a fixed schedule, but always reflects real-time progress, making it one of the best places to track what’s happening behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> 4. When will AIP-21 voting rewards be distributed? <p>Rewards for those who participated in the AIP-21 vote will be distributed once the HPP token is live and trading pairs are switched on exchanges. The rewards are set to be vested on a monthly basis. Since the token hasn’t been launched yet, there’s nothing to distribute at the moment. The current target for this is the third&nbsp;quarter.</p> 5. What’s the current status of Aergo’s AI&nbsp;work? <p>AI is central to HPP’s purpose. From AI-powered oracles to data validation tools like W3DB, the focus is on leveraging machine intelligence to expand the possibilities of smart contracts. There are ongoing experiments and integrations across the ecosystem, including incentive models to reward users for helping train models and verify&nbsp;data.</p><p>While not every workflow is publicly documented, the overall direction is clear: HPP is being designed to natively support AI applications in areas like compliance, identity, and automated decision-making.</p> 6. Is Aergo a real&nbsp;project? <p>Yes. Aergo has been operating since 2019, with a live mainnet and real enterprise use cases. It has worked with both public and private sector partners, maintaining a stable, long-term team. The claim that Aergo is a “scam” is factually incorrect and dismissive of years of product development and delivery.</p> 7. So what’s happening with Aergo Mainnet, HPP Layer 2, and the existing&nbsp;tokens? <p>Upon the launch of HPP, all AERGO trading pairs will be replaced by HPP trading pairs. For the average user, this will appear as a rebranding on their favorite exchanges.</p><p>Aergo Layer 1 (the current mainnet) will remain operational and continue to serve enterprise clients. These deployments are typically permissioned and don’t rely on public token liquidity. The public brand, however, is being streamlined — Aergo will now refer solely to the enterprise blockchain, while HPP becomes the identity for the public AI-native chain.</p><p>This separation enhances clarity and enables each arm of the ecosystem, the enterprise and public sectors, to grow independently.</p> 8. What about the price speculation in the&nbsp;chat? <p>Price speculation is common, but building long-term value requires more than watching charts. The project focuses on delivery and creating meaningful use cases, rather than hype. While market activity is important, it is not the foundation of strategy. Moderators are also managing speculative chatter to keep community spaces constructive.</p> 9. What about Binance? Will HPP or Aergo be listed on&nbsp;spot? <p>There is currently no spot listing on Binance, and no guarantees are available. The team does not work at Binance and is not in control of listing decisions. While Binance is a desirable exchange, listing is not what it once was, as many projects have experienced volatility even after being&nbsp;listed.</p><p>Aergo is already available on multiple reputable exchanges, and the team’s focus remains on building product value and strengthening the ecosystem. If Binance or other major listings occur, it will be a bonus, not the end&nbsp;goal.</p> 10. Final thoughts on community feedback and speculation <p>The team encourages thoughtful opinions and tough questions. However, unproductive speculation about price or unfounded accusations do not contribute to progress. The moderators are working to maintain high chat quality, and the community is encouraged to focus on the fundamentals being established.</p><p>Aergo is a real project with a long track record, enterprise deployments, and a full-time team. It’s not driven by hype, but by infrastructure and&nbsp;vision.</p> 11. What’s&nbsp;next? <p>The HPP token is still on track for a Q3 release. The team is actively coordinating technical deployment, partnerships, and infrastructure in preparation for the launch. HPP is more than a rebrand — it’s the cornerstone of a smarter, more adaptive ecosystem built to support AI-native applications.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-5-recap-hpp-progress-ai-vision-and-community-transparency-bd8f56075a6b">AMA #5 Recap: HPP Progress, AI Vision, and Community Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Working at Tokeny for the past three years has been an incredible journey. The company has supported my evolution by offering diverse learning opportunities and, more importantly, by entrusting me with a variety of responsibilities. This has sharpened both my technical and strategic skills.</p>
<p>The combination of support from a super smart team and the autonomy I’ve been given has been instrumental in my professional growth.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>When I first joined, we had that typical early-stage startup energy – everyone wore multiple hats and decisions happened quickly. As we’ve grown, we’ve maintained our core values but added more structure where needed. The culture has matured rather than fundamentally changed.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “While we’ve become more process-oriented out of necessity, we’ve worked hard to keep bureaucracy minimal and preserve that innovative spirit that attracted me initially.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “While we’ve become more process-oriented out of necessity, we’ve worked hard to keep bureaucracy minimal and preserve that innovative spirit that attracted me initially.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>I’ve grown in ways I hadn’t anticipated. From a technical standpoint, I’ve significantly expanded my expertise across various areas, including tokenization and blockchain implementation. I’ve also improved my ability to manage client relationships and explain complex topics clearly to different audiences. I’ve learned to balance perfectionism with practicality and to prioritize tasks effectively in a fast-paced environment.</p>

		 
	 
                           
	 
		 
			 “I’ve gained confidence in tackling complex challenges, which are prevalent in our high-tech, high-stakes, and rapidly changing industry.” 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 “I’ve gained confidence in tackling complex challenges, which are prevalent in our high-tech, high-stakes, and rapidly changing industry.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you appreciated the creativity and boldness the company encourages. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team took a bold approach, and how it was received? 
<p>Last year, we helped launch an STO for a sustainability-focused investment closely aligned with my personal values. The initiative enabled investors to finance sustainable agriculture and earn returns from crop sales and carbon credits. Throughout the project, I was fortunate to work alongside my exceptional team whose genuine enthusiasm, proactive approach, and ability to navigate complex requirements made a strong impression on the client. The successful offering launch and seeing investors benefit financially while making a tangible environmental impact was particularly rewarding.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>I’d tell myself to worry less about knowing everything right away. The blockchain and tech space evolves so rapidly that continuous learning is part of the job – and nobody expects you to have all the answers. In fact, today, I proactively search for and ask “naive questions,” as they might challenge assumptions, open the door to better solutions, help clarify my own understanding or at the very least, reveal how others perceive a topic.</p>
 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>I believe we’re nearing a tipping point where tokenization shifts from being an innovative approach to becoming the default logical choice in financial markets. Over the next five years, I see Tokeny consolidating its position as a global market leader, partnering with major financial institutions and establishing our technologies and standards as industry benchmarks. Increasing regulatory clarity will accelerate adoption, and we’re ideally placed to leverage this momentum.</p>
<p>As for my role, I hope to grow with the company by taking on more strategic responsibilities while maintaining hands-on involvement in implementation. I’m particularly interested in developing our approach to solving for advanced use cases.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “The challenges will evolve as we keep scaling, and I’ll be here to help navigate those changes.” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “The challenges will evolve as we keep scaling, and I’ll be here to help navigate those changes.” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for traveling and riding your motorbikes. Do any learnings or skills from these hobbies translate into your work at Tokeny? 
<p>Definitely. Skills and experiences from all my interests enhance my work at Tokeny. Likewise, professional insights often enrich my personal pursuits. I believe in living a holistic life, where all aspects are interconnected and should not be overly compartmentalized.</p>
<p>Motorcycle riding and racing has taught me risk assessment and staying calm under pressure – skills I use daily when dealing with critical implementations. You need to make quick decisions while remaining level-headed.</p>
<p>Travel broadens your perspective, enabling you to collaborate more effectively with diverse teams and clients from around the globe. It fosters openness to different viewpoints. Plus, let’s not forget the bonus of trying great food!</p>
<p>Both motorcycling and traveling require a balance between planning and adaptability – essential qualities in blockchain, where innovative ideas must align with practical execution to consistently deliver the excellence we strive to provide our growing customer base.</p>

<p>Microcredentials are rapidly gaining momentum as a new value to students in higher education. These short, focused learning opportunities teach students targeted skills and offer a way to stand out in the evolving workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/microcredentials/">Oregon State University (OSU),</a> microcredentials are “a series of courses that culminate in a digital badge from an accredited university.” Here are some of the microcredentials offered by OSU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Semiconductor Production Process Planning&nbsp; 



 Business of Viral Content Creation&nbsp; 



 Medical Spanish 



 Retail Management Fundamentals&nbsp; 



 Supply Chain Logistics Management and Procurement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 What are Microcredentials in Education? 



<p>Microcredentials are skills-based learning programs that target specific areas of expertise. They take much less time than a full degree but maintain academic rigor and credibility. Designed for flexibility, they’re often available online or in hybrid formats, making them ideal for traditional students and working professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The momentum around microcredentials began building in the early 2010s. Deakin University in Australia led the charge in 2014 by issuing digital badges to recognize specific skill achievements. Shortly after, MIT launched its MITx MicroMasters program in 2015, providing learners with industry-relevant credentials through online education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over a decade later, we see microcredentials being offered at universities worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



 The Value of Microcredentials for Universities 



<p>Higher education leaders can bring a new way of learning to their institution that benefits students, schools, and future employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering modular, skills-based learning, universities can:</p>



 
 Expand student access by serving non-traditional learners, including working adults and part-time students.&nbsp; 



 Boost enrollment by attracting new learners with flexible, low-commitment programs.&nbsp; 



 Show a commitment to students by aligning programs with real-world job skills demanded by today’s employers.&nbsp; 



 Create new revenue opportunities by monetizing short-term learning experiences and establishing employer partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>It’s a win-win for students, schools, and employers who need talent with real-world expertise.</p>



 Digital Badges and Verifiability 



<p>Unlike paper certificates, digital credentials provide a secure and verifiable way to prove skills and education. Partners, like <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/education-industry/">Anonyome Labs</a>, provide secure credentialing systems to institutions for full degrees and microcredentialing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifiable credential technology ensures that each credential is:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Authenticated and tamper-proof&nbsp; 



 Easily verified by employers and other institutions 



 Showcase students accomplishment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 Implementing Microcredentials at your Institution 



<p>As microcredentials gain momentum, higher education institutions have a unique opportunity to expand access, increase relevance, and better align with workforce expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some best practices for implementing microcredentials:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Explore multiple formats&nbsp; 



<p>Microcredentials don’t have to follow a single model. Institutions can offer standalone badges, modular courses, or even stackable options that build toward a certificate or degree.</p>



 Use the right technology&nbsp; 



<p>Digital credentialing platforms play a significant role in issuing, verifying, and managing credentials. Look for tools that are secure, scalable, and easy for students and employers to use.</p>



 Align content with the job market&nbsp; 



<p>Work with local employers and tap into labor market insights to design programs that teach relevant, in-demand skills.&nbsp;</p>



 Make learning accessible&nbsp; 



<p>Flexible formats, like online delivery or self-paced learning, can help reach more learners, especially working professionals or those juggling other responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



 Offer student support&nbsp; 



<p>Just because a program is short or online doesn’t mean students don’t need help. Access to advising, tutoring, and tech support is still essential.&nbsp;</p>



 Measure impact&nbsp; 



<p>Track student progress, career outcomes, and employer feedback to assess what’s working—and continuously improve your offerings.&nbsp;</p>



 The Time is Now for Microcredentials&nbsp; 



<p>Microcredentials are reshaping the future of higher education. These short, skill-based programs create new learning opportunities that benefit students and universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? Here we are, marking World Password Day 2025—an occasion originally invented to encourage better password practices—yet what we really need now is to move beyond passwords entirely. With escalating digital attacks and adversarial AI, traditional passwords have transformed from protectors of access to the weakest link in the security chain. Instead of celebrating passwords, it’s time we recognize their obsolescence and chart a course toward a passwordless future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/passwordless.html">passwordless alternatives</a> already exist and offer stronger security, greater user convenience, and operational benefits that 16 characters of mixed-case letters, numbers and symbols could ever match.</p>

			<p>1st May –&nbsp;Selected members of the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 association</a>, together with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, <a href="https://layerzero.network/">LayerZero</a>, <a href="https://www.fasanara.com/">Fasanara Capital</a>, and <a href="https://www.abnamro.com/">ABN AMRO</a>, have launched a cross-chain Delivery-vs-Payment (DvP) solution for regulated tokenized assets. The solution enables atomic settlement between ERC-3643-based security tokens and cash-equivalent tokens across the <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://www.base.org/">Base</a> networks.</p>
<p>Initiated within the non-profit ERC3643 Association, the solution demonstrates how on-chain securities and cash-equivalent tokens can be securely settled across two blockchains, without requiring counterparties to bridge assets across chains. This removes a major friction point and addresses the institutional need to operate the cash and security legs on separate networks.</p>
<p>The system showcases a concrete and real-time proof of concept use case: Fasanara issued ERC-3643-based security tokens on Polygon using Tokeny’s onchain finance platform, while ABN AMRO issued cash tokens on Base. A decentralized application (dApp), developed by Labrys, orchestrates the cross-chain DvP process using LayerZero’s messaging infrastructure.</p>
<p>This use case demonstrated that the ERC-3643-based security tokens and payment tokens can be exchanged across chains with real-time settlement.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 How Cross-Chain DvP Works 
 
 Create DvP Agreement: The seller creates a DvP position specifying the tokens to lock, the tokens to receive, and the buyer’s address. 
 Lock Assets: The seller locks their specified tokens in the escrow contract on the source chain. 
 Cross-Chain Notification: LayerZero relays the DvP details to the destination chain, notifying the buyer. 
 Payment: The buyer pays the agreed amount on the destination chain to fulfill their part of the agreement. 
 Release Assets: Upon payment confirmation, the locked assets are automatically released to the buyer, completing the swap. 
 
 Solving a Critical Industry Bottleneck 
<p>As asset tokenization gains traction, institutions face a major challenge: having the cash leg onchain. Most current processes rely on traditional payment rails, resulting in long settlement cycles, high operational costs, and increased counterparty risk.</p>
<p>To meet privacy requirements, some institutions prefer using payment tokens on private blockchains. This initiative demonstrates how DvP settlements can take place across two separate chains, enabling the asset and cash legs to operate independently while settling atomically, without any counterparty risk.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>This lock-and-release mechanism ensures settlement is secure, synchronized, and risk-free.</p>

		 
	 
    Institutions want to go onchain but need flexibility, control, and compliance. This project proves they can issue securities and trade them compliantly, with instant settlement, regardless of the underlying blockchain infrastructure. We’re proud to work with LayerZero, Fasanara, and ABN AMRO to deliver this real-world application.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       This is exactly the kind of use case LayerZero was built for. Bringing financial infrastructure onto crypto rails, connecting it across chains, and enabling secure applications. This project shows how cross-chain messaging can support regulated finance by combining identity, compliance, and atomic settlement, while improving capital efficiency and settlement performance across the system.  Bryan PellegrinoCo-founder of LayerZero       As an asset manager focused on innovation, we see tokenization as the future of finance. With Tokeny’s compliance infrastructure and this cross-chain setup with LayerZero and ABN AMRO, we can issue fully regulated digital securities and enable a near‑real‑time settlement experience, even when the security leg and cash leg are on different blockchains.  David VatchevHead of Tokenization of Fasanara Capital       This project demonstrates the real-world potential of blockchain in regulated markets. Issuing cash tokens onchain and settling instantly with digital securities is a big step forward, and we’re excited to help shape this future.  Martijn SiebrandDigital Assets Program Manager at ABN AMRO    
	 
		 
			<p>This achievement marks a significant leap for institutions looking to adopt digital asset infrastructure while maintaining control, compliance, and operational efficiency. The ERC-3643 standard, combined with cross-chain technology, brings the vision of interoperable and institutional-grade onchain finance to life.</p>

 You've been at HYPR for six years. Why is now the right time for this expanded role and for HYPR's next chapter?  
<p>Doug: Timing is everything. It's the one thing you can't manufacture in this industry. You’re either too early, too late, or you catch the market exactly when it's ready. Right now, the timing for HYPR Affirm couldn't be better.</p>  
<p>We’re seeing a massive shift across the security landscape. Identity-based attacks are skyrocketing, and emerging threats like AI-generated forgeries and deepfake-driven fraud are exposing how vulnerable traditional authentication systems have become. Nearly 40% of organizations faced a GenAI-related security incident in the past year, and 95% encountered some form of deepfake attack.</p> 
<p>At the same time, old models of probabilistic security, where you're "pretty sure" the right person is signing in, are breaking down. Organizations need definitive, real-time identity verification that's built for today's threats, not yesterday's.</p> 
<p>That’s where HYPR Affirm comes in, and why I’m so excited about where we’re headed. We're solving the right problem at the right time, and helping organizations secure their workforce with confidence.</p>  
 You've been closely involved in some of HYPR’s largest wins. What stands out to you most from those experiences?  
<p>Doug: Every major win had one thing in common: complexity.</p> 
<p>These are highly regulated industries with legacy systems, shifting compliance requirements, and a lot of risk on the line.</p> 
<p>The real standout for me is when you’re able to cut through all the noise, work alongside the customer’s teams, and actually move the needle, modernizing their identity security without disrupting their business.</p> 
<p>It’s never just about the technology. It’s about how you deliver it.</p> 
<p>At HYPR, our project management, solution architecture, and customer success teams treat every deployment like a partnership, not a handoff. Customers get white-glove support from day one through full rollout, and it shows - it's a big reason we were awarded Best Support by G2.</p> 
<p>Those are the wins that stick with you, because they’re built on trust and execution.</p>  
 How has HYPR changed the most since you first joined?  
<p>Doug: When I first joined, "passwordless" was still a foreign concept to most organizations. It was an uphill battle just explaining why eliminating passwords mattered.</p> 
<p>Now, thanks to years of education, market shifts, and the momentum behind FIDO passkeys, we’re at a historic inflection point. According to our latest report, passkeys and hardware keys are on track to become the dominant authentication method by 2027. That’s a massive change.</p> 
<p>HYPR has evolved right alongside that shift. We're not just helping organizations remove passwords anymore. We’re helping them achieve full identity assurance, even against the most advanced AI-driven threats.</p>  
 Most memorable moment in your career (so far)?  
<p>Doug: It’s the moments you realize, after months or years of work, that you helped a customer make a change they didn’t think was possible.</p> 
<p>This is a tough industry. Wins are rarely clean. But when you earn trust through persistence and honesty, those are the ones you remember.</p>  
 Biggest challenge you've faced with a customer, and how you overcame it?  
<p>Doug: The biggest challenge is driving real change across an entire organization.</p> 
<p>When you're talking about identity security, you're not just swapping out technology, you're asking people to rethink how they trust, access, and interact with critical systems every day.</p> 
<p>That’s a big shift, and it doesn’t happen overnight.</p> 
<p>The key is meeting customers where they are, keeping it practical, and helping them build momentum until the change sticks. It’s why having the right team behind you makes such a difference. You’re not just delivering a product. You’re helping guide a transformation.</p>  
 What are you most excited for moving forward?  
<p>Doug: Affirm is a game-changer for the industry. It’s built for this exact moment, when organizations are recognizing that identity assurance is their frontline defense.</p> 
<p>I'm excited to help more customers realize they don't have to settle for legacy technology and practices anymore. It’s time for something better, and we’re ready to deliver it.</p>  
 Bonus question! If you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?  
<p>Doug: I think it’d have to be someone like Tom Hanks.</p> 
<p>Down to earth, a million stories, and you know it wouldn’t be a boring lunch.</p>  
<p>Congratulations, Doug! We’re excited to have your leadership guiding HYPR into this next chapter.</p> 
<p>Ready to experience a new standard in identity assurance?</p>

<p>In this world, where fraud has become a common game played by criminals, biometric authentication has become the cornerstone of our lives. Whether you go to a bank, an educational institute, or any other financial institution, it is used to secure an individual’s information and assets.</p>
<p>However, many users still think that fingerprint or other traditional methods are enough for securing the systems. It is too funny……..</p>
<p>If we look at this security system comprehensively, we will witness innovations that will astonish us. If you don’t trust us, we can provide you with an example of Liveness Face Detection.</p>
<p>Here, you will wonder, what is this? We never heard about it. Right? Don’t worry, we have brought this comprehensive blog post for you, in which we have discussed it from A to Z.</p>
<p>In this guide, you will get an opportunity to learn how liveness face detection prevents fraud in biometrics.</p>
<p>Are you interested in reviewing this? If yes, buckle up and stay connected with us till the end.</p>
 What Is Liveness Face Detection: A Brief Overview 
<p>When we introduce this term in front of users, they gain a hint about it after hearing the name. Human Intelligence after Artificial Intelligence…..</p>
<p>Basically, this liveness detection for face recognition is all about an innovative technology that is concerned with the prevention of fraud. It prevents the spoofing of fake images and documents used by criminals. By and large, this technology is gaining huge popularity all over the world day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Liveness Face Detection Enhances Biometric Security? 
<p>This is an interesting question often asked by many users: How does the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> prevent fraud? Are you also here with the same question? If yes, we are here with you with a detailed answer.</p>
 1. Active And Passive Liveness Detection 
<p>Facial liveness detection has been categorized into two branches: active and passive liveness <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a>. These two types work together to enhance the biometric system. We can explain them one after one in detail.</p>
 
 
 Active Facial Liveness Detection 
 
 
<p>In this type of face recognition SDK, users who come to financial or other institutions are said to perform some specific functions. Try to understand, criminals mainly come with fake images and videos, and behave as real account holders. They are ordered to smile, blink their eyes, and move their heads. Now, you will say, such movements can never be achieved by such images, and criminals will be caught. We are also trying to make you understand the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Passive Facial Liveness Detection 
 
 
<p>In this type of face recognition detection, users are checked by their skin color, texture analysis, and blood flow. Even this detection can also be done by recording the criminal’s heartbeat. It’s a little bit funny. Here, can you ever expect such facial texture from the images or even from live videos? We don’t think so……</p>
<p>Here, we will say one special line to tribute this system: “Not only can a fake human not pass, but even a fake sparrow can’t take the exam.”</p>
<p></p>
 2. Real-Time Detection 
<p>On one side, with such strict checking, the other side has real-time checking. Amazing……..</p>
<p>Sometimes, cyber criminals can try to manipulate the systems with pre-recorded and newly captured images. Such videos and images can easily destroy the whole system. However,&nbsp; once again, liveness detection for face recognition shows its unbelievable role.</p>
<p>The real-time detection can easily distinguish between real and fake persons. This is because criminals attempt to commit fraud at any time of the day. However, this facial liveness detection ensures that the person is physically present and has no fake documents. Such crimes are monitored 24/7 in each institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 3. AI-Supported Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention 
<p>AI-supported multi-layered fraud prevention enhances the security of the biometric system by combining multiple other technologies. AI’s and ML’s sophisticated algorithms are trained to monitor the actions taken by criminals in both online and remote environments.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the real-time detection is as important as oxygen and water for human beings. AI makes the facial liveness detection stronger and stronger to detect what’s happening in multiple institutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ML with its algorithms is also integrated with a detection system to perform the passive liveness detection. In short, we can say, there is no chance of committing fraud even by an expert criminal.</p>
<p></p>
 Where to Find Facial Liveness Detection Services? 
<p>After reviewing such a post guide, this innovation will surely brainstorm your mind, where to find its services. There are multiple websites and online platforms that provide users with the same services. However, we have brought an innovative solution for you that is superior to others. Our solution will be here with all those characteristics that have been discussed in the previous section. The solution is called Recognito.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/">RECOGNITO</a> is a top provider in identity checking, focusing on advanced face recognition technology, liveness detection to verify real-time identity, and ID document checking to confirm authenticity. The company’s solutions are well-known for their accuracy and dependability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their technology is acknowledged by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT </a>as one of the best in face recognition. By using the latest methods, they help guarantee that identities are verified safely and effectively, providing a high level of trust and safety for users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Wrapping Up 
<p>Security, security, and only security across financial and educational institutions. It is considered the top priority. However, it is a digital period, where criminals have multiple manipulative techniques to destroy the systems. However, as we all know, each virus has an antivirus.</p>
<p>Such an antivirus we have discussed in this blog guide is facial liveness detection. It is a technology innovation that prevents the fraud often committed by criminals using fake images and videos.</p>
<p>After hearing about it, many users ask for a possible solution to achieve such services. To solve their issue, we have gifted them Recognito. This platform is the top in providing face liveness detection recognition. If you also want prevention against such spoofing fraud, never forget to gain help with this innovative source.</p>

<p>Meet Jamie—a compliance officer at a U.S. financial services firm regulated by FinCEN, FINRA, and the SEC. Jamie knows the stakes: missing adverse media about a potential client could lead to fines, reputational damage, or worse. But performing these checks manually often feels like searching for a needle in a haystack. Here’s how Jamie’s experience shifts when using iComply’s AML solution.</p>



<p></p>



 Manual Adverse Media Screening: A Complex Process 



<p>To comply with regulatory expectations, Jamie manually searches online articles, government reports, and social media for red flags like fraud, money laundering, or corruption. Each platform requires tweaking keywords and combing through endless irrelevant hits.</p>



 
 Overwhelming Data: Vast amounts of news, blogs, and public records make it easy to miss critical insights. 



 Time-Consuming Tasks: Cross-referencing names with sanctions lists, PEP databases, and legal filings means hours—sometimes days—of effort. 



 Risk of Outdated Info: By the time Jamie compiles findings, new updates might surface, requiring a re-check. 
 



<p>Even after all that, Jamie still has to organize the findings into an audit-ready report for internal review and potential regulatory inspections.</p>



<p></p>



 Adverse Media Screening with iComply: A Seamless Workflow 



<p>With iComply’s AML platform, Jamie’s adverse media screening becomes faster and more reliable:</p>



 
 Real-Time Data Collection: iComply automatically pulls global news, blogs, and regulatory announcements in seconds—including U.S. and international media sources. 



 AI-Driven Precision: Advanced machine learning filters out irrelevant results, significantly reducing false positives while prioritizing high-risk alerts. 



 Automated Cross-Checks: The system compares findings against global watchlists, sanctions databases, and adverse media archives automatically—no manual entry needed. 



 Instant Reports: With one click, Jamie generates a comprehensive, audit-ready report with risk scores, dates, and classifications. 
 



<p>This streamlined process helps Jamie stay compliant with FinCEN’s AML rules, FINRA’s due diligence standards, and the SEC’s anti-fraud requirements—all without the manual guesswork.</p>



<p></p>



 The iComply Advantage 



<p>For Jamie, manually compiling adverse media reports used to take hours and left room for human error. With iComply, it takes minutes. The result? Faster compliance checks, reduced risks, and more time for strategic oversight.</p>



<p>Is your compliance team ready to simplify adverse media screening? iComply’s AML solution empowers financial institutions to meet FinCEN, FINRA, and SEC standards while making compliance faster, smarter, and more secure. Let’s make it happen.</p>

<p>For a long time, logging into a website was (perhaps still is) a bit of a mess. There’s definitely been many efforts to fix it, and though OAuth buttons and SSO integrations tried to clean things up, under the hood, “Sign in with…” is mostly a best-effort dance. You can authenticate a user, maybe even grab some claims about them, and with luck, stitch together a tolerable user experience.</p>



<p>How depressing that our best efforts result in “tolerable.”</p>



<p>Now contrast that with what happens when you click “Buy now.” That’s not best-effort. That’s a minefield of regulatory compliance, industry standards, liability frameworks, and expectations that money, actual money, will safely and instantly change hands. There’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-DSS</a>. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure">3-D Secure</a> requirements. There’s the awkward but necessary dance of tokenization, fraud detection, and chargeback management.</p>



<p>When it comes to payments, the web grew up and started paying a mortgage a long time ago. When it comes to identity, we’re still pondering what it means to adult.</p>



<p>Times, however, they are a-changin’. The walls between the identity folks and the payments folks are getting thinner. In some cases, those walls are coming down entirely. And it’s not just because of technological convergence, though that’s part of it. It’s because users are demanding better experiences, regulators are demanding more assurance, and vendors are realizing there’s more money to be made (and saved) when you stop pretending these are two separate problems.</p>



 The silos are collapsing 



<p>Historically, the digital identity people worked over here and the payments people worked over there, each with their own browser APIs, working groups, and acronyms. It was a live-and-let-live scenario, with the occasional “You should talk to Bob in the Payments WG about that…” tossed across the W3C aisle.</p>



<p>That’s changing. Why?</p>



<p>I’m going to blame digital wallets.</p>



<p>Today’s digital wallets don’t just store payment cards; they also store verifiable credentials. Credentials like your driver’s license, your airplane tickets, and whatever will serve as an “I swear I’m over 18” age claim. All of these are coming together in a single UX surface, often right in the browser.</p>



<p>That means the web needs a new kind of interface. One where your browser can show you the secure thing you’re allowed to use at the right time, whether that’s a credit card, a credential, or some clever combination of the two.</p>



 Where the work is happening 



<p>At the W3C, two groups are particularly active in this convergence: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid">Federated Identity Working Group (FedID WG)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/payments">Web Payments Working Group (WPWG)</a>. They’ve mostly stayed in their own lanes, but I think that’s going to change. Lines of communication are definitely about to get stronger.</p>



<p>Interested in learning more about how standards development works and how your organization might take advantage of early knowledge? I have a service for that: <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">Inform the Standards in Digital Identity</a>.</p>



 Federated Identity Working Group 



<p>On the FedID side, two APIs are reshaping browser-based identity:</p>



 
 FedCM (Federated Credential Management): Designed to reimagine the “Sign in with…” experience for a world without third-party cookies. It gives users a native browser dialog for account selection, keeping identity flows first-party and privacy-friendly. It’s going to (hopefully) make life a lot better for anyone who uses the web for social connection or as a consumer. 



 Digital Credentials API (DC API): This is the plumbing that lets browsers relay secure information between a site, the OS, and whatever wallet is installed. Think of it as the missing piece that both enables and protects the exchange of your personal information with whatever site is asking for it. 
 



 Web Payments Working Group 



<p>Over in WPWG territory, you’ll find APIs like:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-payment-confirmation/">Secure Payment Confirmation</a>: A way to prompt users for strong authentication using platform authenticators (read: WebAuthn) as part of a payment flow. 



 <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/secure-remote-commerce/">Secure Remote Commerce</a> (SRC): The “Click to Pay” system championed by major card networks. It’s not quite a wallet, but it is a federation-like model: the user chooses a card stored elsewhere and completes the transaction with fewer redirects and less friction. 
 



<p>Now here’s the fun bit, at least from my perspective: these lines between all these APIs are starting to blur. Could FedCM be used to show a list of saved payment cards, each tied to a user identity, during checkout? Could DC API help determine whether a credentialed identity has an associated payment method?</p>



<p>Some of the payment players were skeptical at first (standardization! browsers in the mix! scary!). But they’re warming up, especially as they realize a smoother, privacy-preserving, first-party login experience could give them something they’ve been missing: recognition of returning users without third-party cookies.</p>



 Shared problems, shared future 



<p>What’s driving this convergence? Three shared goals:</p>



 
 Returning user recognition: If you’ve ever run a checkout funnel, you know: drop-off is death. Being able to recognize a returning user, without tracking cookies or forcing a login, is gold. 



 Fraud mitigation: Whether you’re managing identity theft or card-not-present attacks, you need risk signals, device binding, and good authentication. That’s why FIDO device-bound credentials and biometric authenticators are popping up on both sides of the aisle. 



 Strong authentication: Regulators (looking at you, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/memo_17_4961">PSD2</a>) and developers alike are embracing strong, phishing-resistant authentication. FIDO2 and WebAuthn aren’t just for logins anymore; they’re showing up in payment confirmations and credential exchanges. 
 



<p>But payments are also dragging identity into some new territory. Think of age-gated purchases or proof-of-residency for tax calculations. These aren’t traditional payment concerns, but they’re becoming essential parts of modern transactions. And that means they’re becoming browser problems.</p>



 So who’s in charge? 



<p>Well, no one. Or maybe it’s lots of someones. It’s hard to tell, and that’s both good news and bad news.</p>



<p>The newly launched <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance Payments Working Group</a> isn’t trying to create a new standard. Instead, it’s focused on identifying what’s missing, what payments need from the rest of the stack, and finding the right home for those requirements. That could mean new work in the W3C’s Web Payments WG, or tighter coordination with the FedID WG. Or maybe something new entirely.</p>



<p>It’s definitely the definition of “interesting times.” It’s a time when the people who design your login experience and the people who design your checkout flow have to start talking. Not just because it’s polite, but because they’re building for the same end user, solving the same problems, and being constrained by the same browser platforms.</p>



 What to watch 



<p>If you’re building anything that touches identity or payments on the web, now’s a good time to pay attention to:</p>



 
 The FedCM API, which is rolling out in Chrome and being discussed across browser vendors. 



 The DC API, which is gaining traction in wallet-based workflows. 



 The future of Secure Payment Confirmation, which might just become the go-to method for confirming both logins and purchases. 



 And the user experience expectations that come with digital wallets. Because the bar is no longer “functional.” It’s “frictionless.” 
 



 Final thought 



<p>We’re moving from a world where identity and payments were treated as separate UX problems to one where they’re deeply entwined. That’s going to be messy, yes, but also incredibly powerful.</p>



<p>Because when your browser can recognize you, verify you, and let you pay, all without handing your life story to a dozen trackers or to the browser maintainer, that’s not just good UX. That’s what the web experience should have been all along.</p>



<p>I’m so glad to be a part of getting that much closer to something better than just tolerable.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity has long been seen as one of the most promising, and most complex, developments in the world of digital identity. It offers the potential for individuals to control and manage their own identities, moving beyond today's siloed systems. But as adoption begins to grow, fueled in part by new regulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/eidas-2?ref=blog.dock.io">eIDAS 2.0</a>, the question remains:&nbsp;Can decentralized identity truly deliver on its promise?</p><p>To explore this, Dock Labs CEO Nick Lambert recently hosted a discussion with two leading experts: Charles Walton, Principal at The Agosti Group and former SVP of Identity at Avast and Mastercard, and Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst and Founder of KuppingerCole. Both guests brought decades of experience in digital identity and security, along with sharp insights into where decentralized identity is headed.</p><p>In this article, we break down the key takeaways from their conversation, from the opportunities and barriers ahead to the business models that could make&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;sustainable.</p>

<p>With enterprise browsers serving as the new gateways to critical business applications and data, organizations must incorporate high levels of identity assurance to mitigate the rising risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.<br><br>HYPR, the leader in passwordless and identity verification solutions, has joined forces with Microsoft Edge for Business, the secure enterprise browser renowned for its security and productivity features. This integration provides unparalleled visibility, detects modern threats, and enforces real-time security policies at the moment of access.</p> 
By correlating signals across browsers, workstations, and mobile devices, HYPR Adapt helps organizations spot anomalies, block unauthorized access, and reduce risk – before threats escalate. The result? A stronger security posture, better compliance, and a safer workplace. 
 The Urgent Demand for Enhanced Enterprise Browser Security  
<p>The modern workforce operates across various devices and locations, making the enterprise browser a critical control point for security. In today’s world, traditional security measures often fall short. AI-driven attacks, phishing campaigns, and social engineering tactics pose significant risks to sensitive data and systems. Organizations need a security strategy that not only protects against known threats but also adapts to new and emerging risks. This is where the HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business integration makes a significant difference.</p> 
 Key Benefits of HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business Integration  
<p>This integration offers a range of powerful benefits designed to boost enterprise security and streamline user experience:</p> 
  
  Unmatched Visibility: Gain comprehensive insights into user behavior and potential threats from signals from browsers and devices. HYPR’s integration delivers in-depth visibility into user activities, suspicious patterns, and potential security breaches. This visibility is vital for proactive security management and incident response.  
  Proactive Threat Detection: Recognize and mitigate potential threats more effectively with advanced analysis of signals from all endpoints. HYPR's intelligent risk policy engine detects anomalies and security risks in real-time, enabling you to take swift action and stop breaches before they happen.  
  Real-Time Security Enforcement: Enforce security policies instantly based on your customizable rules. HYPR Adapt enables immediate and automated response actions when potential threats are detected, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability and preventing security incidents. Such actions include requiring step-up authentication, identity re-verification, or denial of access.  
  Unified Security Posture: Establish a consistent security posture across all devices, minimizing vulnerabilities and strengthening your overall defense. HYPR Adapt ensures that security policies are applied uniformly, regardless of the device or platform, providing full environment protection.  
  
 How the Integration Works: Deep Dive into HYPR Adapt and Microsoft Edge for Business  
<p>HYPR Adapt, the policy risk engine at the core of HYPR's platform, integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Edge for Business to provide enhanced security and data protection. This integration leverages a sophisticated process to analyze user behavior and enforce security policies.</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
 Integration Workflow: Step-by-Step  
  
   <p>IdP Workflow: The user initiates the login process with their Identity Provider (IdP) and is redirected to HYPR for authentication.</p>   
   <p>Edge for Business Interaction: The user's enterprise browser detects a policy-configured URL and communicates its Device Trust capabilities.</p>   
   <p>HYPR Adapt Analysis: HYPR recognizes the browser's Device Trust intent and initiates a challenge-response exchange with the Microsoft Device Trust API and the user's browser.</p>   
   <p>Microsoft Device Trust API: The service responds by providing device trust signals from the user's browser and device.</p>   
   <p>Policy Decision and Enforcement: HYPR Adapt analyzes the Device Trust signals and makes an informed policy decision. This decision can result in several actions:</p> 
    
     <p>Allowing seamless desktop single sign-on (SSO) for a frictionless user experience.</p>   
     <p>Enforcing phishing-resistant authentication to prevent credential theft.</p>   
     <p>Requiring re-verification of user identity through HYPR Affirm for enhanced security in high-risk scenarios.</p>   
     <p>Denying access to prevent unauthorized entry.</p>   
      
   <p>Access Granted: If the policy allows and the user successfully completes the required authentication steps, they are granted secure access to their enterprise applications.</p>   
  
<p>The HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business integration represents a significant advancement in enterprise browser security. By combining HYPR Adapt's advanced signal collection and analysis with Microsoft Edge for Business's robust platform, organizations can achieve deep insights into user behavior, proactively detect threats, and enforce real-time security policies.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>28th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading onchain operating system for compliant asset tokenization, has announced a strategic partnership with the <a href="https://www.hbarfoundation.org/">HBAR Foundation</a> to bring compliant Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization to the <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera</a> network. This collaboration marks a major milestone in advancing institutional adoption of blockchain technology for regulated financial products. They’re already collaborating through the non-profit <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC-3643 Association</a> working group to drive progress in RWA tokenization.</p>

			<p>The HBAR Foundation, which supports innovation and growth on the Hedera network, plays a key role in scaling tokenized finance use cases. By working together, Tokeny and the HBAR Foundation aim to accelerate the adoption of tokenized financial products and bring new levels of efficiency, transparency, and compliance to capital markets.</p>

		 
	 
    We are thrilled to partner with Tokeny, whose solutions have already powered billions of dollars in tokenized assets. This collaboration reinforces Hedera’s position as a leader for compliant digital finance and opens the door for institutions to confidently launch tokenization strategies onchain.  Sabrina TachdjianDirector of Fintech &amp; Payments at The HBAR Foundation    
	 
		 
			<p>With this partnership, institutions can now bring assets onto Hedera in just a few weeks using Tokeny’s white-label tokenization platform, or seamlessly integrate onchain finance APIs into their existing systems without the need for costly and time-consuming development. This partnership is driving the acceleration of institutional adoption of tokenization.</p>

 Open House — Conversation with Aergo’s CTO Shaping the&nbsp;Future <blockquote>In this article, we would like to share what we’ve been working on, where we’re headed, and how each step ties into our broader vision. From new developments in Layer 2 technology to ecosystem expansions and strategic partnerships, our focus remains clear: building real value, step by step. Whether you’re new to our journey or have been with us from the start, this update is for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><p>This time, we sat down with <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/introducing-our-cto-head-of-ai-labs-168a51546448">Matt Seo, CTO of Aergo</a>, to discuss the future direction of Aergo and the upcoming launch of the House Party Protocol (HPP). In this conversation, Matt outlines the vision for Layer 2 and explains how Aergo Mainnet (L1) and the new HPP ETH Layer 2 (L2) will operate in parallel, ensuring a seamless transition for enterprise partners while creating new opportunities across the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p> Q1: What broader possibilities does the L2 expansion unlock for&nbsp;Aergo? <p>Matt Seo: One of the most exciting possibilities unlocked through this L2 expansion is the integration of intelligent data flow via AI oracles. As it stands, traditional oracles function purely as passive data relays. They deliver external information onto the blockchain without interpreting its meaning or assessing its relevance. As a result, smart contracts today are often limited to simple, static, trigger-based logic.</p> Q2: How do AI oracles change the future of smart contracts? <p>Matt Seo: AI oracles fundamentally shift the way smart contracts interact with external information. By preprocessing, parsing, and contextualizing external data before it is written on-chain, we enable smart contracts to respond dynamically to real-world conditions. This unlocks a new class of context-aware and purpose-specific smart contracts that don’t just execute predefined rules but adapt intelligently based on nuanced, real-time inputs.</p><p>It’s a necessary step if we want blockchain systems to engage meaningfully with complex external environments. Layer 2 is not just about scalability — it’s about expanding the intelligence and applicability of blockchain technology itself.</p> Q3: Will Aergo Mainnet continue to operate after the launch of HPP&nbsp;L2? <p>Matt Seo: Yes, absolutely. Aergo Mainnet will remain fully operational even after the introduction of the HPP token and the Layer 2 expansion. It will continue to support existing Aergo Enterprise (private/on-premise) clients without any disruption. The AERGO token will still function as a payment token on Aergo Mainnet. However, moving forward, most new public use cases and general user activity will transition away from Aergo Mainnet. Once HPP is listed on exchanges, the AERGO token may no longer be tradable for general users on those platforms.</p> Q4: What role will HPP ETH L2 play in the ecosystem? <p>Matt Seo: HPP ETH L2 will serve as the primary network for both new and current users, including enterprises seeking AI-native blockchain features and broader Web3 participants. The HPP token will serve as the primary currency for transactions, data operations, and governance within this ecosystem. It will also become the primary tradable asset listed on supporting exchanges going&nbsp;forward.</p> Q5: How will users move between Aergo Mainnet and HPP ETH&nbsp;L2? <p>Matt Seo: To ensure flexibility and user continuity, we are introducing a bridge between Aergo Mainnet and HPP ETH L2. This bridge will enable seamless migration of both data and tokens between the two networks. Our goal is to provide maximum flexibility, especially for enterprises that require a robust and adaptable infrastructure.</p> Q6: What is the process for AERGO token holders to migrate to&nbsp;HPP? <p>Matt Seo: First, holders of AERGO tokens, whether native tokens or ERC-20 versions, will be able to convert them to HPP tokens through the official bridge. Second, for tokens held on exchanges, the conversion will happen automatically once the exchange finalizes its integration and supports the&nbsp;swap.</p><p>Importantly, the conversion process will only begin after the successful launch of key technical milestones, ensuring that all stakeholders, including exchanges, enterprise partners, and the broader community, are fully aligned and&nbsp;ready.</p> Q7: How is this transition being managed to maintain user confidence? <p>Matt Seo: We are taking a very careful and methodical approach. Every step — from bridge deployment to token swap coordination — is being developed with security, usability, and operational continuity as top priorities. To ensure transparency, we have released a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w71t9vvrE-M65THn4ZM0W2fmtsBEsnibi3bESgrr0CQ/edit?gid=1840204549#gid=1840204549">Living Calendar</a> that outlines key milestones, and we have published the <a href="https://www.hpp.io/static/media/HousePartyProtocol_Whitepaper.1a5894913eea21bb0a72.pdf">HPP whitepaper</a> to provide a comprehensive view of the transition. We will continue to share further technical details, clear timelines, and instructions as we progress.</p><blockquote>“From static contracts to adaptive intelligence, L2 and AI oracles are shaping the future of blockchain.”<br> — Matt Seo, CTO of&nbsp;Aergo</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-conversation-with-aergos-cto-shaping-the-future-cdecf5e3d7be">Open House — Conversation with Aergo’s CTO Shaping the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 4 Most Effective Methods to Mine Bitcoin in 2025 



<p>While there are several ways to mine Bitcoin, not all of them are equally efficient or profitable. Below, we highlight the four most effective methods for 2025:</p>



 Mining Bitcoin with ASIC Hardware 



<p>ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners are specifically designed to mine Bitcoin. They offer the highest processing power and energy efficiency, making them the best option for maximizing profits. However, the initial investment is quite high, which may be a barrier for some. Popular ASIC miners like the Antminer S19 Pro can deliver outstanding performance.</p>


 
 


 Mining Bitcoin with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 



<p>Using GPU mining is a more affordable alternative to ASIC mining. While it offers lower processing power, GPUs are versatile and can also be used for mining other cryptocurrencies. This option is ideal for beginners or those with limited budgets, though it is becoming less profitable as Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increases.</p>



 Mining Bitcoin via Cloud Mining 



<p>Cloud mining allows users to mine Bitcoin without investing in physical hardware. Instead, you lease mining power from a third-party provider. This method eliminates the need for managing hardware or worrying about energy costs. However, the tradeoff is that the profits tend to be lower, and you must share them with the service provider.</p>


 
 


 Pool Mining 



<p>Pool mining is the process of collaborating with other miners to pool resources and increase your chances of solving mining algorithms. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of computational power each participant contributes. This is a great way to earn Bitcoin consistently without requiring significant investment in hardware.</p>



 Choosing the Right Bitcoin Mining Hardware and Software 



<p>To get the best results, you’ll need to carefully select both your mining hardware and software.</p>



 
 Hardware: If you have the financial resources, ASIC hardware is the best option for maximizing mining efficiency. For those on a tighter budget, GPU mining can still be effective for getting started.<br> 



 Software: The software you use is just as important as the hardware. Popular mining software such as CGMiner, BFGMiner, and NiceHash help optimize your mining efforts by connecting you to mining pools and ensuring your hardware is running at peak efficiency. 
 



 How to Maximize Profits When Mining Bitcoin 



<p>Maximizing your profits from Bitcoin mining involves more than just having the right hardware. Here are some key strategies to consider:</p>



 Reducing Electricity Costs 



<p>Electricity costs are one of the largest expenses when mining Bitcoin. To reduce costs, consider mining in areas with lower electricity rates, using energy-efficient ASIC miners, or even exploring renewable energy options like solar power.</p>



 Increasing Computational Power 



<p>The more computational power you have, the more likely you are to solve mining puzzles and earn rewards. Upgrading your hardware to more powerful ASIC miners can significantly improve your mining capacity and profitability.</p>



 Monitoring Market Trends and Profitability 



<p>Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty fluctuate constantly, so staying informed is essential. Use mining profitability calculators to assess whether your current setup is still effective or if adjustments are necessary to maximize your returns.</p>

 Challenges in Bitcoin Mining 



<p>While mining Bitcoin can be lucrative, there are several challenges that miners must overcome:</p>



 
 High Initial Investment: The cost of ASIC miners and other specialized hardware can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for beginners. 



 Electricity Costs: The energy required to mine Bitcoin is substantial, and electricity costs can eat into your profits if not carefully managed. 



 Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be volatile, meaning that fluctuations in the market can affect your mining profitability. 



 Increasing Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases. This means that more powerful hardware is required to remain competitive. 



 Competition with Large-Scale Miners: Large mining farms with access to cheap electricity and state-of-the-art equipment can often outperform smaller individual miners. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Mining Bitcoin in 2025 can still be profitable, but it requires careful planning and the right approach. Whether you choose ASIC mining, GPU mining, or cloud mining, each method has its benefits and challenges. By selecting the right hardware and software, optimizing electricity costs, and staying informed about market trends, you can maximize your chances of success in the competitive world of Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://datarella.com/securing-data-integrity-in-industry-4-0/">part two</a> of the <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> blogpost series, we explained how we use the Secret Network blockchain and a custom Wallet Service to ensure the integrity and privacy of machine-generated data in Industry 4.0 environments. In this final part, we’ll show how we integrated the Wallet Service with live machines from <a href="https://sw-machines.com/">SW</a> and an AI service from <a href="https://www.inovex.de/">inovex</a>. Together, they power a proof-of-concept demonstrator for secure and accurate anomaly detection in machine components.</p>
<p></p>
 Visualizing Sensor Data 
<p>The demonstrator has three core features. First, the data exploration tool lets you visualize sensor data from three different machines. For granularity, you can filter by machine, component, sensor, and the timeframe you want to monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_1.png"></a></p>
 Verification &amp; Anomaly Detection 
<p>Next, the anomaly detection feature, coupled with data integrity verification. Like before, you can filter by machine, component, sensor, and timeframe. Additionally, you choose from three anomaly detection algorithms—Local Outlier Factor (LOF), DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest—and adjust their hyperparameters. After that, once you lock in your configuration and submit the query, the system fetches data from a central time series database. It then converts the data into the standardized format described in our <a href="https://datarella.com/securing-data-integrity-in-industry-4-0/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_2.png"></a></p>
<p>To ensure trust, the Wallet Service verifies the dataset by comparing a freshly generated fingerprint to the one anchored on the blockchain. It uses the standardized batchID for this lookup. If the fingerprints match, the AI service proceeds with the anomaly detection. Whenever the number of anomalies exceeds a defined threshold, the system flags the component as worn out. Consequently, it submits an automatic spare part order to the ERP systems of the manufacturer and the customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_3.png"></a></p>
 Data Integrity Log 
<p>In this demonstrator, users manually trigger the configuration and execution of the anomaly detection. In contrast, a production system would automate and continuously run these steps. The third feature is a data integrity log to give users better visibility of what is happening. This audit trail has three levels: At the top level, it shows the health status of each machine and the last verified batch used for anomaly detection.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_4.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, it breaks down each machine into components, displaying health statistics for each</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_5.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, it presents detailed logs of every anomaly detection run and whether the data integrity check succeeded.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_6.png"></a></p>
<p>As we wrap up this blog post series, what began as a technical experiment has evolved into something much broader. It points toward a future of industrial intelligence that values transparency and built-in trust. By embedding trust directly into machine data and equipping AI with verified information, we do more than detect anomalies. We enable machines to communicate, collaborate, and maintain themselves. Ultimately, this proof of concept is a first step toward an Industry 4.0 landscape that is autonomous, secure, and transparent, where trust is not an afterthought but a foundation.</p>

<p>Meet Emily—a compliance officer managing KYC processes for an international financial firm. Like many businesses, her firm relies on multiple third-party tools, each with its own subprocessors scattered across various countries. Every time a new customer submits their documents, the data embarks on a long and risky journey—hopping across networks, servers, and regions before returning as a completed KYC profile.</p>



<p>But what if that journey could be shorter, safer, and entirely within the organization’s control? Enter edge computing—a game-changer that keeps sensitive data local, secure, and compliant. Here’s a closer look at the difference it makes.</p>



<p></p>



 The Legacy KYC Data Journey 



<p>Emily’s current KYC process starts with a customer uploading identification documents through a third-party portal. These documents travel to cloud-based services for validation and verification, often crossing borders and passing through international subprocessors.</p>



<p>Each stop introduces new risks:</p>



 
 Data Exposure: Sensitive information is transmitted over multiple networks. 



 Jurisdictional Complexity: Different data privacy regulations apply at each stage. 



 Increased Latency: Every transfer adds time, creating frustrating delays for customers and compliance teams alike. 
 



<p>When regulations like GDPR or U.S. Data Privacy Framework require local data storage, this scattered process becomes a compliance headache—and a potential security vulnerability.</p>



<p></p>



 The Edge Computing KYC Data Journey 



<p>Now imagine the same process using edge computing. When Emily’s customer uploads their documents, something different happens:</p>



 
 Local Processing: The data is encrypted, authenticated, and validated on the customer’s device or a nearby edge node before it leaves the network. 



 Direct Transfer: Once verified, only the necessary data is securely sent to Emily’s local server, staying within jurisdictional boundaries. 



 Faster Decision-Making: No detours through third-party subprocessors or distant cloud servers—just fast, secure compliance processing. 
 



<p>With edge computing, Emily’s KYC process is not only faster but also privacy-focused, meeting data localization laws without added complexity​​.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Benefits of Edge Computing for KYC Compliance 



 
 Data Sovereignty by Design<br>Edge computing keeps customer data within required jurisdictions, making compliance with data localization laws seamless. No international subprocessors, no regulatory gray areas—just clear control over where and how data is handled​. 



 Stronger Security<br>By encrypting and validating documents at the source, edge computing minimizes data exposure during transmission. Sensitive information never travels unsecured through multiple systems, drastically reducing the attack surface​​. 



 Reduced Latency and Costs<br>Processing data locally means faster verification times—often within seconds. This eliminates the lag caused by data bouncing between external servers and cuts cloud storage and transmission costs. 
 



<p></p>



 The Future of Compliance Is Edge-Based 



<p>For Emily’s firm, the switch to edge computing transformed KYC from a risky journey to a secure, streamlined experience. Customers appreciated faster onboarding, while Emily’s team gained confidence in their compliance processes, knowing sensitive data stayed secure and audit-ready.</p>



<p>Are you ready to take control of your compliance data journey? With iComply’s edge computing solutions, you can enhance privacy, reduce risks, and future-proof your compliance strategy. Let’s redefine compliance together.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Not that long ago, non-human identities (NHIs) were governed by neglect; provisioned manually, tied to a cron job or batch script, maybe mentioned in a change ticket, and rarely touched again. No formal lifecycle, no regular reviews, and certainly no clear ownership. If you remembered to rotate the password once a year, you were ahead of the game.</p>



<p>That kind of ad hoc governance may have been tolerable in the on-prem world, but it doesn’t hold up in today’s environments. NHIs now sit at the heart of everything from cloud orchestration to API transactions. They scale faster than humans, act autonomously, and often outnumber user accounts by orders of magnitude.</p>



<p>Modern systems rely on NHIs—workloads, APIs, containers, data pipelines—to function. They’re created and destroyed in seconds. They make privileged requests across systems. And they rarely show up in traditional access review processes.</p>



<p>So who’s responsible for these identities?</p>



 Governance Models for NHIs 



<p>One of my colleagues takes a hardline view of NHI governance: every NHI should have a named human owner, just like every user account. It’s a familiar model, and it works, up to a point. But as infrastructure gets more complex, ownership becomes less about people and more about systems. Since I’m not convinced human ownership always works for NHIs, I wanted to dig a bit deeper. This blog post is the result.</p>



<p>Here are five governance models I think exist in the world, sometimes combined, sometimes purely their own thing. These are more my notes on the subject rather than a narrative post; I’d love your feedback as to any models I might have missed.</p>

 Human Stewardship: One Bot, One Human 



<p>Core idea: Every NHI is assigned a human owner who is responsible for managing its lifecycle and reviewing its access.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An integration with a payroll vendor uses a service account in your HR system. That account is assigned to the Payroll Manager, who gets pinged during quarterly access reviews to confirm it’s still needed and appropriately scoped.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Fits with existing IAM workflows 



 Clear accountability 



 Easier to audit 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Doesn’t scale for environments with thousands of NHIs 



 Owners often approve access by default, without understanding the technical context 



 Orphaned NHIs become a problem when owners leave 
 



 Functional Ownership: Tied to Role, Not Person 



<p>Core idea: Instead of a specific individual, ownership is assigned to a team or function based on operational responsibility.</p>



<p>Example:<br>Your DevOps team owns a CI/CD pipeline that deploys applications. The workload identity used by that pipeline is assigned to “Platform Engineering” in your IAM system or tagging scheme, not to a specific engineer.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Reflects how teams work today 



 Works well for shared tools or infrastructure 



 Reduces the need to reassign identities when staff change 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Diffuses accountability if the team structure is unclear 



 Requires coordination when multiple teams interact with the same identity 



 Less effective when “function” and “ownership” don’t align 
 



 Autonomous Lifecycle: Let the System Handle It 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are provisioned and deprovisioned automatically based on policies and runtime conditions—no human or team is directly assigned.</p>



<p>Example:<br>A containerized function spins up during an event-driven workflow in your payment processing system. It generates a short-lived identity for that execution context, with permissions scoped to the task. When the function completes, the identity is destroyed.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Extremely scalable 



 Limits exposure by minimizing identity lifespan 



 Reduces human error 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Requires robust automation and observability 



 Tougher to audit, especially for compliance 



 Policy misconfigurations can be hard to detect 
 



 GitOps Ownership: The Code Is the Owner 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are defined in code repositories, and the team that owns the repo is responsible for the identity.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An engineering team defines workload identities in Kubernetes YAML files managed through Git. Any changes to identity permissions must go through a pull request. The team that maintains the repository is responsible for keeping identities secure and aligned with policy.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Aligns with DevSecOps and infrastructure-as-code practices 



 Makes governance auditable and version-controlled 



 Scales with engineering workflows 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Repo ownership doesn’t always reflect operational ownership 



 Policies may drift if teams copy or fork configurations 



 Developers may overlook security settings unless guardrails are in place 
 



 Tag-Driven Governance: Metadata Rules Everything 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are governed through tags or labels that define ownership, sensitivity, environment, and other attributes used to drive policy.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An S3 bucket access role is tagged with <code>env=prod</code>, <code>team=data</code>, and <code>owner=email@example.com</code>. IAM automation tools use those tags to apply access restrictions, retention policies, and monitoring rules. When the <code>owner</code> tag changes, alerts are sent for review.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Enables scalable policy enforcement 



 Supports dynamic environments and multi-cloud deployments 



 Works well with automation frameworks like Terraform or Pulumi 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Inconsistent tagging undermines policy enforcement 



 Requires disciplined tagging practices across teams 



 Can be bypassed if not integrated with enforcement mechanisms 
 



 Why NHI Governance Matters 



<p>These models aren’t mutually exclusive. Most organizations end up with a mix:</p>



 
 Human ownership for persistent, high-risk identities 



 Functional or Git-based ownership for shared infrastructure 



 Automated governance for ephemeral workloads 



 Tag-driven policies to tie everything together 
 



<p>That said, there’s a reason I’m researching this: non-human identity governance needs to be more strict than human identity governance. That’s not because machines are less trustworthy: it’s because they’re faster, quieter, and far more prolific. A misconfigured workload identity can do a lot of damage before anyone notices.</p>



<p>Think back to the <a href="https://nhimg.org/beyondtrust-breach-causes-major-incident-at-us-treasury">BeyondTrust breach</a>. A single, static API key—tied to an NHI with no clear governance—led to a major incident. The problem wasn’t just the key. It was the absence of lifecycle controls, automation, and ownership.</p>



 Rethinking IAM from the Ground Up 



<p>Managing NHIs well doesn’t just reduce risk. It also gives us a roadmap for what modern IAM could look like—automated, policy-driven, and flexible enough to work across platforms.</p>



<p>Standards like <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/03/securing-the-software-supply-chain/">SPICE, WIMSE, and SCITT</a> are laying the foundation for better tools and better governance models. But even without those in place, there’s work we can do now:</p>



 
 Review your NHI inventory 



 Assign ownership or implement tag-based policies and be consistent about it 



 Identify where automation can reduce standing privilege 



 Align NHI access with actual workflows, not ideals

 Early detection of document fraud is key to prevent serious and irreparable business damage. Thankfully, we run regular training sessions to ensure our customers are kept up to date with the latest fraud terms and techniques. 



 



<p>At IDnow, we take the risks posed by document fraud very seriously. The use of forged and fraudulent documents can massively disrupt operations, leading to reputational harm, loss of customer trust and ultimately cost a <a href="https://datadome.co/learning-center/online-fraud-is-costing-your-business-rsa-2023/">business millions in damages</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why our Security Document Examination and Fraud Detection training program, developed in cooperation with multiple law enforcement agencies, from INTERPOL to the Macedonian police, equips our customers with the tools, knowledge, skills and confidence to detect and respond to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/#:~:text=Avoid%20fraud%20risks%20with%20IDnow,99%25%20of%20identity%20documents%20worldwide!">document fraud</a> effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, if there’s one thing that our diverse customer base shares it’s a common interest in enhancing their capabilities to examine and detect fraudulent documents.</p>



 How we help detect the most common forms of document fraud. &nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-documents/">Document verification</a> and authentication are crucial to ensure that submitted documents are a) genuine and b) presented by the rightful holder. However, with thousands of different identity and travel documents in existence, it can be a significant challenge to differentiate between false and genuine documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are four commonly accepted forms of fraudulent documents: counterfeit, forgery, fraudulently used or obtained travel documents and fantasy or camouflage documents. Here, we share how we train our customers to detect each one.&nbsp;</p>



  Counterfeit documents.  



<p>A counterfeit document is an illegally produced document, such as a passport, that is created to deceive or mislead. This type of document is neither legitimately manufactured nor legitimately issued by the recognized authority. Synthetic documents are also considered counterfeit documents. Counterfeiting is illegal and often associated with criminal activities, such as identity theft, fraud and illegal immigration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We train our customers to detect counterfeit documents by examining security features (watermarks, holograms and microprinting) under different light sources like UV lights and using specialized tools, such as magnifiers to check paper quality and texture for printing inconsistencies.</p>



<p>2. Forged documents.</p>



<p>Forgery is a fraudulent alteration of any part of a genuine document. Alterations are only made to certain elements, such as substituting photographs on the bio-page or altering variable data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number). Tampering may include the removal or addition of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forgeries can be detected by looking out for signs of tampering, including disturbed paper fibres or irregular lamination. Other tell-tale signs include inconsistent printing, such as mismatched fonts or disrupted patterns. Of course, the most obvious thing that we train our customers to be on the lookout for are data discrepancies, and photo signature irregularities. The use of UV lights and microscopes are essential, as these can reveal chemical treatments and differences in printing and personalization techniques that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye.</p>



<p>3. Fraudulently used or obtained genuine documents.</p>



<p>Of course, genuine documents can also be obtained fraudulently by using someone else’s personal information to apply for documents or providing false information on applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of a genuine identity document by another person is identity theft. Here, an impostor uses the stolen, found or given identity document of another person without authorization pretending to be that person (also referred to similarity fraud) with the intent to commit crimes in that other person’s name. A person who uses a mask (synthetic mask attack) also falls under the category of identity theft.</p>



<p>Facial morphing refers to the synthesis of two facial images from different individuals. Morphing can fully transform one face into another but when the process is stopped midway, a morph image with a non-existent person, who resembles both people at the same time, will be created. As a result, multiple individuals can use the same document. There is a substantial risk of receiving a morph image when an individual’s photo is submitted to the issuance authority while applying for an ID document, instead of the photo being taken on-site. In this case, the obtained document itself is authentic and genuine, and it is extremely difficult to detect this kind of identity fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We train attendees to express caution when examining documents because even if secure identification documents are genuine, they might have been obtained illegally. For example, criminals often change their name through a legal process and then apply for a new secure identity document to evade detection by law enforcement to cross borders and open bank accounts.</p>



<p>4. Fantasy and camouflage documents.</p>



<p>A fantasy document refers to any security document, such as a passport, issued by a non-recognized state, whereas camouflage document can be a document issued in the name of a country that no longer exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fantasy documents mask the real identity or nationality of the holder and often bear the names of non-existent or historical nations, or fictitious issuing authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detecting these documents involves searching for inconsistent components from different document sources. We train how to verify security features against genuine reference specimens and validate document numbers with issuing authorities.</p>



 



Daniela delivers a training session on the use of fraudulent travel documents.



 A collaborative approach. 



<p>Since 2023, IDnow has been delivering Security Document Examination and Fraud Detection training. Our sessions are interactive, practical and adaptable to different industries. They feature multiple modules and practical exercises to hone document examination and fraud detection skills. In doing so, we help strengthen the document verification capabilities of our customers, enabling them to examine and identify fraudulent documents and other types of fraud, including money laundering, deepfakes and money mules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Key components include:&nbsp;</p>



  Hands-on analysis of genuine documents  



  Tools and technologies used in document production  



  Security features verification  



  Classification of fraudulent documents  



  Scenario-based learning to reinforce decision-making skills and detect fraud  



  Up-to-date forgery detection techniques  



<p>Whether delivered in-person or virtually, the training is led by experts with backgrounds in fraud investigation, forensic analysis and law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As counterfeit travel and ID documents are widely regarded as a major threat to public order, we recommend all our customers to have at least a minimum knowledge and skills for security document examination and fraud detection.</p>



 Beyond training: Building a culture of trust and vigilance. 



<p>While tools and technology help, it’s people who are always the first line of defence. Our goal is to help organizations build a culture of awareness and responsibility, where every employee understands their role in protecting against fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud isn’t going away anytime soon — but with the right training and support, organizations can stay a step ahead. We’re proud to work alongside law enforcement and international organizations to empower our clients with the knowledge and strategies they need to safeguard their operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As fraudulent documents affect every industry, we deliver training sessions to a wide range of customers from financial services, telcos, gambling platforms and many other industries.</p>

 Untangling Complexity: How Can We Better Support Collaboration on Complex and Interconnected Problems? <p>Solving the world’s most pressing challenges — from climate crisis to social inequality — requires unprecedented levels of collaboration. Often, this involves many diverse organisations from different sectors, bringing varied perspectives and forms of value to the table. This is the realm of “complex collaboration.” Our project, Many-to-Many, delves into this space. It’s not about inventing collaboration itself but about exploring and improving the ways we structure it, particularly the governance, legal and operational frameworks that underpin these vital partnerships.</p>Many-to-Many is designed for groups who want to collaborate to solve complex challenges but require new ideas about value, ownership, and&nbsp;power.<p>Many-to-Many has been running for about two years, building on insights from an earlier initiative called <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/initiatives/beyond-the-rules">Beyond the Rules</a>, and has worked closely with various partners in real-world contexts. Through this process, we’ve gathered a wealth of detailed, complex information about what works, what doesn’t, and the frustrations people face when traditional structures clash with collaborative intentions. Recently, three core team members — Michelle, Arianna, and Gurden — spent a week together in Berlin. Our goal? To figure out how to transform this dense knowledge into an accessible, usable digital platform, sharing it with anyone who might find it useful and interesting.</p><p>Here’s a glimpse into our conversation about the project, the challenges, and our approach to sharing what we’re learning.</p><p>Michelle: So, we’re working on this project called Many-to-Many. At its heart, the idea is simple: tackling huge problems like climate emergency, housing crisis emergency, or urban waste management needs many different organisations, sectors, and types of value coming together. We want to be super clear — we didn’t invent the idea of people working together! That’s probably existed since humans have existed. What we have been focusing on is how the ways we currently enable this collaboration aren’t always helpful. Our project is about finding and supporting different approaches to what we call ‘complex collaboration’.</p><p>Gurden: And how long has this exploration been going on, and what led up to this intensive week in&nbsp;Berlin?</p><p>Michelle: This specific initiative, Many-to-Many, has been active for about two years, but it stems from work that’s been going on much longer under the banner of Beyond the Rules. We started Many-to-Many by prototyping with a small group of six organisations, asking, “What happens if we get together? Can we devise governance, organising principles, and legal structures that genuinely fit how we want to collaborate?” Since then, we’ve applied and tested these ideas in more complex, often place-based situations, learning and adapting as we&nbsp;go.</p><p>Gurden: It sounds like it’s really born from the ground up, working closely with networks and learning directly from people’s actual frustrations with existing&nbsp;systems?</p><p>Michelle: Exactly. There are loads of people trying to do this, and tons of collaboration methodologies out there. But a common frustration we observed is that even when collaborators agree on what they want to do and how, the formal structures that follow — like governance models or legal entity types — often don’t match their intentions. They end up defaulting to the status quo because available structures force them into old patterns. If you code collaboration into a traditional legal or governance structure, give it time, and it often starts behaving just like the systems people were trying to&nbsp;escape.</p><p>Gurden: Right, it forces you back into the old structures, even if you started with different intentions.</p><p>Arianna: And over the last two years, this work generated vast amounts of information, captured in various places like <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Notion knowledge base</a>, presentations, reports, workshops and Miro boards. But these didn’t solve the need to share this knowledge effectively, right?</p><p>Michelle: That’s the perfect segue! Yes, working with all these different people and examples has generated so much dense information. It’s been a real struggle figuring out how to share it in a way that people can engage with it without being overwhelmed, yet ensure it’s deep and technical enough to be useful at the pointy end — like when you need to decide ‘who decides what?’ Finding a way to present that information across its full breadth and depth is exactly what brought us together in Berlin this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Arianna: I think it’s also crucial to understand the nature of the challenge. It’s not just about creating another linear presentation or a hundred-page report — those have been tried. The information itself is networked; things connect in complex ways, full of important details. That’s the real difficulty.</p><p>Gurden: It feels like the information wants to be dynamic, too. Like something you interact with, that unfolds differently depending on your needs, rather than just a static PDF. The goal is to spark conversations, right? To see how people actually use it. Arianna, you joined the project a bit later, what was your perspective coming&nbsp;in?</p><p>Arianna: Coming in after Michelle and others who had wrestled with this complexity for years, I saw that difficulty firsthand — moving from deep knowledge held in people’s heads and scattered materials to a format that’s shareable and understandable for specific users. The strategic visual design work involved helping the team diagram and synthesise information, but also exploring how to gather it all, perhaps in a digital tool or portal. We looked closely at specific things like contracting and how the underlying principles, the ‘deep codes,’ could be visualised and made prominent, not just talked about but actively present, even visually within a contract.</p><p>Gurden: How vital has visualisation been in this process? It sounds like it wasn’t just about designing the outputs, but part of the thinking process&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Arianna: Absolutely. In this project, visualisation is an investigative tool, part of a back-and-forth conversation. When we visualise a topic, it’s not the end point; it reopens the discussion. We can look at a diagram and ask, “Does this accurately reflect the concept? Is this the right way to explain it?” We even tested models that didn’t work, forcing us to rethink and re-explain the underlying topic. It’s a continuous dialogue using different tools — writing, talking, visualising. Prototyping the platform itself is the same; we’re thinking through the prototyping process, not just building something at the&nbsp;end.</p><p>Michelle: Arianna, could you also touch on the information architecture aspect? You did a lot of thinking around navigating this complexity, deciding what’s important, and building hierarchies of understanding.</p><p>Arianna: Yes. A key challenge was: what’s most important in a project where everything is important? Even small details can have significant impacts. So, instead of forcing a hierarchy immediately — which was a problem in earlier attempts to write things down — we initially tried giving everything equal weight. We looked at unusual examples, like open-world video games, where you have multiple entry points and freedom to explore. This forced us to define clear ‘entries’ into topics, allowing people to then dive deeper. That process helped us distinguish between entry-level information and more detailed, secondary content. We realised a pure ‘open world’ might overwhelm our target users who don’t have weeks to explore, so now we’re focusing on creating a clearer hierarchy and prioritising pathways based on user&nbsp;needs.</p>Simultaneously managing information flow, hierarchy, and the significance of small details in multiple contexts.<p>Gurden: I love that! Taking inspiration from unexpected places like video games to tackle something often seen as dry, like governance. It challenges the assumption that these topics are only for lawyers or experts and shouldn’t be questioned. For me, coming in freshest to the team, a key takeaway from our time in Berlin was reframing our goal. We aren’t just building a website; we’re taking it from the approach of designing a living service. We spent time defining who this service is for, their needs, their goals, mapping their potential journeys — from first-time discovery to repeat engagement. We also grounded ourselves in the project’s identity: non-authoritative, born from shared frustration, aiming simply to make life easier for people trying to collaborate in complex&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Michelle: That point about it being more than a website is crucial. It’s easy to say you want a “knowledge-sharing, living space,” but incredibly hard to do well. We want to share what we’ve learned, but critically, we need to ensure it’s useful and actually wanted. That’s why the emphasis on testing this week felt so solid — testing the pre-prototype, the prototype, the beta… The last thing we want to create is another ‘dead, dusty archive,’ as Arianna put&nbsp;it.</p><p>Arianna: Exactly. Two key words for me are honesty and carefulness. We’re trying to be honest with ourselves and others, avoiding overpromising. We have long-term goals, but we’re taking the time to think, test, use handmade drawings and multiple prototypes before jumping into&nbsp;code.</p>Screenshots and photographs of digital and paper prototypes.<p>Gurden: I agree. We are aiming to be realistic, especially when discussing community engagement. As Michelle said, it’s easy to say community engagement and just add a contact form somewhere but so much harder to actually foster a thriving group of humans. But what’s special about our work is that we have an existing, passionate community, and we have planned realistically how to engage them, acknowledging our assumptions and building in checkpoints to test them at each stage. The process itself is being designed with&nbsp;care.</p><p>Michelle: Okay, perhaps that’s a good place to pause for this first post. We’ve covered the background of Many-to-Many, why we gathered in Berlin, our different perspectives, and the careful, iterative approach we’re taking to share this complex but important work.</p><p>Thanks for reading and joining our journey, stay tuned for more updates as we further develop Many-to-Many. You can also join the Beyond the Rules newsletter by signing up&nbsp;<a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1">here</a>.</p><p>And a big thanks to the other members of our team — Annette and Angela, who weren’t with us in Berlin, but are key stewards of this&nbsp;work.</p><p>Visual concept by Arianna &amp;&nbsp;Anahat.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/untangling-complexity-how-can-we-better-support-collaboration-on-complex-and-interconnected-cd83272e68c3">Untangling Complexity: How Can We Better Support Collaboration on Complex and Interconnected…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>I’m Akanksha Bhasin, and I’m all about building community for developers. I come from a developer background, and for over six years, I’ve been building and growing communities for developers. On top of that, I’ve spent the last four years diving into Developer Relations. I’ve had the chance to work with some fast-growing companies, helping them build their communities worldwide. That means getting the word out about emerging tech to developers, organizing significant events and hackathons, speaking at conferences, fostering partnerships, and supporting open-source projects.</p>

<p>My lifelong curiosity, from early science experiments and a fascination with astronomy,  has propelled me into an exciting new orbit: officially becoming an Oktanaut at Okta! 🚀🌠🧑‍🚀</p>

 My journey into the tech world 

<p>My tech journey has been quite a ride! I began by experimenting with various things, including Arduino, different aspects of programming, and building AI applications.</p>

<p>What piqued my interest wasn’t just web development and the scope of AI applications. Back in 2018, when Google Assistant came out, I was fascinated by how voice could fit into our everyday lives, from controlling appliances to using apps, all with your voice! So, I started building Voice AI applications for Google Assistant and Alexa and eventually began teaching what I learned at professional meetups and colleges all over India, which then led to being featured at Google I/O for my work in Voice AI.</p>

<p></p>

 Building developer communities: my passion and journey 

<p>Driven by a passion for community building that began with Voice AI technology, I later founded Women in Voice, India, to empower more women to build careers in tech. Alongside this endeavor, I’ve delivered sessions worldwide, hosted hackathons and events, led Google Developer Groups on my campus, and volunteered to organize the largest DevFests in my region, which gathered 3,000+ developers.</p>

<p>My fondest memory has been in Mumbai, where I got to teach how to build AI applications in areas without much tech awareness and opportunities. Seeing someone’s face light up when they finally understood new technology was priceless and kept me going. Life is about giving back. Even if you have impacted just one person’s life, you have done something priceless.</p>

<p></p>

 Embracing developer advocacy at Okta 

<p>I’m so excited to join the Okta team; it’s a pinch-me moment! I love our principle of “Building a world where identity belongs to you!” Innovation is thriving, and change is here, making this the opportune and crucial moment for security.</p>

<p>Identity security and access management are the shields and the first line of defense for any software. They wrap every API, CLI, and SaaS workload in a magnetic field of strong authentication and privileged access. Without it, a compromised credential can topple an entire software system, just like a small puncture in a spacesuit; the whole mission can fail. With that, security can’t remain a checklist item; instead, security is the foundational layer of every enterprise application. I want to be part of this mission to help independent software vendors (ISVs) and developers secure user identities in their applications!</p>

 Let’s connect! 

<p>When I’m not geeking out about tech, you’ll probably find me dancing or exploring new places and cultures. If you catch me outside with my phone, I’m probably trying to capture a beautiful sky. These simple moments make me feel calm and happy. Connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/akankshabhasin">LinkedIn</a>; I’d love to chat with you!</p>

<p>Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">set their domain as their username</a>. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.</p>
<p>Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>To apply for verification or to be a Trusted Verifier, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIjeImcJEG6m8WSTVXiWrD4CVEidg0VH6548xNl47ICjiNnA/viewform?usp=header">this form</a>.</p>

  
  A verified Bluesky account with a blue check.

 Trusted Verifiers 
<p>Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.</p>
<p>So, we’re also enabling trusted verifiers: organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.</p>

  
  The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check.

<p>For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>When you tap on a verified account's blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.</p>

  
  Tap on the blue check to see which organization verified the user.

<p>You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings &gt; Moderation &gt; Verification Settings to toggle it off.</p>
 How to Get Verified on Bluesky 
<p>Notable and authentic accounts interested in receiving a verification badge or becoming a Trusted Verifier can apply <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIjeImcJEG6m8WSTVXiWrD4CVEidg0VH6548xNl47ICjiNnA/viewform?usp=header">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can self-verify by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">setting your domain as your username</a>. We highly encourage official organizations and individuals to do this.</p>

<p>“Welcome to our comprehensive blog, in which we will explore the role of face liveness verification in online security in detail.”</p>
<p>Those days have come when there is a long bunch of cyber criminals everywhere. Due to this, securing online sensitive information and valuable assets has become more important than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you think strong passwords are sufficient for online and offline security, it is a wrong assumption. Especially when it comes to sensitive information of institutions like banks, medical stores, and government institutions.</p>
<p>So, what to do now……</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the astonishing rise of technology has paved the way for us to interact with security and defeat the criminals bravely. Such a gift provided by technology is called face liveness verification.</p>
<p>If you are hearing this term for the first time, this comprehensive blog is for you. In this guide post, we will briefly provide its overview and explain its role in online security in detail.</p>
<p>Don’t miss any single part of this guide…..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Face Liveness Verification? 
<p>Face liveness verification, also known as face liveness detection, is a method of online verification that is implemented by ensuring the actual presence of users. This cutting-edge technology prevents fraud that is often made by using fake images, videos, and documents.</p>
<p>There are two major types of this liveness detection for face recognition:</p>
 
 Active face liveness detection: In this type, users are said to perform specific functions such as blinking, smiling, and rotating their heads for authentication. 
 Passive face liveness detection: This type of liveness detection is done by light reflection and texture analysis. 
 
<p>Once you understand this technology, it’s time to uncover its role in enhancing online security. Let’s proceed to the next section.</p>
<p></p>
 Why Face Liveness Verification Is Crucial For Online Security? 
<p>Read this section carefully, which includes the detailed role of face liveness verification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Prevents Spoofing Attacks 
<p>One of the easiest ways that cybercriminals adopt to manipulate the systems is spoofing. As hinted earlier, for this, they use fake images, videos, and other documents in place of actual persons. This spoofing is done to deceive the system into thinking that real or legitimate users are trying to access the accounts.</p>
<p>However, where there is a <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a>, there is no value in such thefts. We have discussed in the types that this recognition system asks users to perform specific functions that are not exclusive to these fake documents. By using this strategy, they easily distinguish between actual and fake users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Improve User Authentication 
<p>The liveness detection for face recognition enhances users’ authentication, especially in sensitive environments. Basically, these sensitive environments, such as banks, colleges, and universities, can never provide an opportunity for cyber criminals to steal their sensitive data.</p>
<p>Here, once again, face liveness verification plays its pivotal role. Here you will surely ask, how? Well! We can understand this by describing an example:</p>
<p>Let’s suppose a criminal with a fake identity came to your university and asked for the sensitive information of students. They will behave like as if they are a relative of that student. Here, you can easily use liveness detection technology to identify whether they are real or fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Protects Against Account Takeovers 
<p>Identity theft is an ever-growing issue spreading all over the world. Sometimes, cybercriminals attempt to destroy the systems by using stolen passwords, usernames, and security numbers. Here, the face recognition SDK plays an unbelievable role and prevents fraud in two different ways.</p>
 
 The system can easily distinguish between a fake and a real person with the help of passive face liveness detection. This is done by users’ texture analysis and skin care when they are suspected. 
 The system combines this detection method with traditional authentication methods, such as fingerprint with blood flow, and password with eye retina dilution. 
 
<p></p>
 4. Protection in High-Risk Digital Transactions 
<p>Digital transactions of money have become a normal part of our lives. On the contrary, with this transaction, there are a lot of chances of cyber theft. They can visit banks and other financial institutions with fake IDs and images, and behave as real users.</p>
<p>However, if the bank has implemented the face recognition SDK, the criminals will be reduced to nothing. After all, they can be easily suspected and punished as they deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Prevent Fraud in Remote Environments 
<p>Many businesses shift from online to the remote environment. Due to this, online identity verification becomes a key challenge for them. Once again, face liveness verification will come back to back of cyber criminals……</p>
<p>With the rise of video conferencing, telemedicine, and remote transactions, ensuring that the person you are interacting with is authorized. Liveness verification system integrates with these remote platforms, minimizing the risks of online theft and crimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Find Face Liveness Verification Services? 
<p>After reading the importance of face recognition SDK, you will surely want to find such a service. Right? Don’t worry, not only service, but we will provide you with the complete solution that will implement all those things to prevent fraud, discussed in the upper sections. The solution is called <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>.</p>
<p>Recognito is a well-known developer of face recognition programs with unmatched success in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT).&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>As a top supplier of identity checking solutions, it focuses on state-of-the-art technologies like face recognition, liveness detection, and ID document checking. This innovation provides the latest solutions to improve safety and guarantee trustworthy authentication in different fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>In this age, securing online assets and sensitive information is more important than ever. On one side, the number of cyber criminals is increasing. On the contrary, technology has also come on the ground in the form of face liveness verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users ask us, What is this <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a>? What is its role in improving online security? To answer them, we have created this comprehensive blog guide for them.</p>
<p>After reviewing this post, you will also learn everything about this technology. We have discussed its role in detail in enhancing security. If you are also one of those who ask for such services, we have given a possible solution in the form of Recognito.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, identity is everything. From logging into enterprise systems to onboarding new customers in finance or healthcare, seamless identity access is critical.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet many organizations still struggle with identity silos: isolated pockets of identity data that don’t talk to each other. These silos cause redundant identity checks, security blind spots, compliance headaches, and user frustration.</p><p>Whether you're running an identity verification platform, managing IAM infrastructure, or building digital onboarding flows, identity silos slow you down. They form when different departments, business units, or legacy systems maintain separate identity records, making it hard to know who’s who across your ecosystem.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll break down what identity silos are, how they form, and why they’re costing you more than you think. We’ll explore their impact across industries like finance and healthcare, and show how verifiable credentials offer a powerful solution to eliminate identity silos—improving security, reducing friction, and restoring trust in digital interactions.</p>

<p>India’s Modi government has launched a mobile app that brings facial biometrics and enhanced privacy controls to its Aadhaar system, the national identity verification service used for everything from accessing public services to booking travel to opening bank accounts. It may also provide important lessons for a growing number of other digital identity initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Introduced in limited beta on April 8, the Aadhaar app is just the latest advancement for India’s ambitious Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)—the so-called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/11/07/india-has-a-digital-infrastructure-america-needs-one/">India Stack</a>” that has successfully helped boost financial inclusion across this country of 1.4 billion people, spur innovation, and supercharge a digital economy that’s second only to China in its pace of growth, and could soon be valued at <a href="https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/indias-digital-economy-grows-10-times-races-towards-1-trillion-mark/118777732">$1 trillion.</a></p>
<p>Based on four API-enabled “layers”—identity, documents, payments, and empowerment—building the India Stack began in 2009, and has rapidly become the centerpiece of a digital transformation effort expected to propel India’s overall GDP to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/the-rise-of-digital-public-infrastructure-boosts-india-towards-an-8t-gdp-by-2030">$8 trillion</a> by 2030. But as its latest advancement in digital identity gains the attention of governments racing to catch up, it’s worth noting that India’s technological head-start goes way back—thousands of years, in fact.</p>
 From the Vedas to Aadhaar: A Legacy of Innovation 
<p>Bounded by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast, this South Asian country’s traditions have always strongly embraced advanced technology, and the sanctity of an unalterable identity tied to the social good.</p>
<p>Its ancient Vedic texts and their stories of vimanas (flying chariots), Brahmastra (energy weapons), Ayruvedic medicine, and mathematics have long inspired, when not directly forming the basis for, innovations ranging from nuclear energy to aeronautics to software architecture, network design and more. And its Sanskrit Puranas include tales of King Harishchandra, who staked his identity on an unwavering commitment to truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>Not bad as far as digital age backstories go. Yet even so, India’s digital transformation over the past 16 years has been remarkable. As France’s Institut Montaigne points out, the DPI has pushed India to the top digitalization index of tax collection among emerging market economies. From mega-cities like New Delhi to Mumbai and from rural villages of Himachal Pradesh to Bihar, the DPI is designed to serve the public good and has enabled society-wide transformation in the way India provisions social services. It has also expanded access to education and, increasingly, digital health and agricultural services. At the heart—or rather, the start—of it all: digital identity.</p>
 Digital Identity Forms the ‘Stack’s’ Foundation 
<p>Today, more than 94% of the Indian population has a digital ID. Combined with smartphone penetration topping nearing 50% ,interestingly rural smart phone penetration is over 76%, Institut Montaigne estimates that more than three-quarters of the Indian population over the age of 15 has access to an account at a financial institution or via mobile wallet. In 2006, just 50% of Indian households had such access.</p>
<p>A significant contributor to the DPI’s success can be found in its building-block, or layered, approach, which include three overarching layers:</p>
 Digital Identity (or ‘Presence-less’) Layer 
<p>Aadhaar, which literally means “foundation” in Hindi, formed the Stack’s all-important first layer. In 2009, Aadhaar began as a digital identity card that has been able to provide definitive proof of identity to nearly 1.3 billion citizens—including those in its most remote areas. Each Aadhaar card includes the individual’s name, address, gender, and 12-digital unique identity number, and a photograph, and is backed by a fingerprint and iris biometric. What originally started with the vision of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to ensure the mass subsidies reached the right hands, today, it is used for everything from accessing government services to travel bookings to banking, and more.</p>
 Digital Documents (or ‘Paperless’) Layer 
<p>Indeed, possession of a verified biometric identity, and the ability to build a financial history, proved to be a game-changer—paving the way for the Digital Public Infrastructure’s second layer: Aadhaar-enabled document storage and sharing. This includes a digital locker (or “DigiLocker” for storing identity documents such as driver’s licenses, academic certificates, and more. Meanwhile, e-Sign and new e-KYC processes simplified access to financial services and ensured access to a basic savings and deposit account, credit, insurance, and a pension. Later, utilities and telecom companies were able to start piggybacking their services through this channel as well.</p>
 Digital Payments (or ‘Cashless’) 
<p>In 2016, the next layer—an instant, real-time mobile payments system called the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was added, enabling users to transfer funds between two bank accounts, whether for government services, or business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. By 2023, the UPI had become the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-surpasses-worlds-leading-digital-payments-platforms-with-this-record/articleshow/112949499.cms">world’s largest</a> real-time payments system in transaction volume, eclipsing PayPal, Brazil’s PIX, and even China’s Alipay. Today, 80% of all retail payments in India are made through this payment system. And overall, half the world’s daily <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/india-s-plan-world-without-cash">digital transactions</a> take place on the UPI. The statistics are staggering for 2024, a 172 billion UPI transactions (~46% growth y-o-y) transferred a total sum of INR 247 lakh crore (~US$ 2.9 Trillion showing a 35% growth y-o-y). Indeed, this Aadhaar-enabled system has been so successful, it’s being <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/aadhaar-draws-interest-as-indonesia-india-sign-mou-on-digital-transformation">offered commercially</a> to other nations as well.</p>
 Empowerment (or ‘Consent’) Layer 
<p>The final layer in the India Stack is a framework designed to give individuals control over their data, ensuring that personal data is only shared when they provide explicit consent. Users can approve, manage, and revoke consent agreements for data sharing with financial, health, and educational services. This “Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture,” or DEP, enables individuals to securely share their financial data with chosen institutions <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/blog/economy-policy/how-india-stacks-aggregator-economics-can-become-a-game-changer-for-market-dynamics-330129.html">through intermediaries</a> called consent managers or Account Aggregators. In addition to reducing fraud due to its integration with Aadhaar, this can potentially enable Account Aggregators to confirm creditworthiness without sharing specific personal information—thus reducing bias.</p>
 Now, There’s an App for That–But Is It Enough? 
<p>The mobile app released in April brings all these layers into the physical world in new ways, making it easier for users to share their <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/india-launches-aadhaar-app-with-face-biometric-authentication">Aadhaar ID details</a> digitally, without the need to present physical copies at airports, shops, or hospitals, or hotels where ID details could be stolen or misused. ID verification is completed by scanning a QR code and allowing a <a href="https://organiser.org/2025/04/10/286720/bharat/aadhaar-verification-now-as-simple-as-upi-payment-bharat-govt-unveils-face-id-based-digital-identity-app/">real-time facial scan</a> via their smartphone camera. Just as with online data sharing via the UPI, users can share only the necessary data, giving them more control over their personal information. The app arrives amid the rise of so-called <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/digital-identity-strengthens-super-wallets-transforming-indias-dpi">super wallets</a>—integrating Aadhaar-based identification, facilitating real-time bank transactions by UPI, and securely storing digital credentials. There’s no reason to think biometric identity verification for physical data sharing won’t soon be integrated as well.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say there aren’t challenges. Fraudulent QR codes for parking and other services have been used to scam citizens since the earliest days of the DPI. And just in recent weeks, authorities uncovered a nationwide scam involving fraudulent Aadhaar modifications, counterfeit documents, tampered biometric devices, and a fake Aadhaar portal used to make unauthorized changes to a victim’s Aadhaar information, such changing birthdate, or linking the Aadhaar account to a <a href="https://organiser.org/2025/04/09/286594/bharat/uttar-pradesh-sambhal-police-bust-nationwide-aadhaar-scam-using-fake-biometric-devices-cloned-uidai-portals/">fraudster’s smartphone.</a></p>
<p>India-specific statistics are hard to come by, but globally, this kind of synthetic identity fraud led to as much as <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/16/2964004/0/en/TransUnion-Analysis-Finds-Fraud-Costing-Businesses-Equivalent-of-Nearly-7-of-Revenues.html">$3.2 billion</a> in losses worldwide during just the first half of 2024. Incidences of new account fraud using synthetic identity info jumped 18% YOY during the same period—an all-time high. That said, its latest layer has the India Stack headed in the right direction—though it could be even stronger.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>It’s hard to argue with the success of India’s full-throttle embrace of digital identity across its DPI. But there are some easy ways to make it even more powerful and secure.</p>
<p>For example: While the government has launched an unrelated stack called “Vishvasya” as part of an initiative to promote <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/india-launches-vishvasya-blockchain-tech-stack/">blockchain use</a>, the India Stack does not yet use distributed ledger technology. In my view, digital identity’s fullest success can only be achieved through distributed technologies and the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">architectural advantages</a> they offer. This is especially crucial given the country’s layered approach to leveraging digital identity. I believe the consent managers/Account Aggregators within the stack’s Empowerment layer are a step in the right direction—and their blind pass-through of personal information is key.</p>
<p>But distributed technologies hold the promise of a day when someone applying for a loan can choose which personal information to share, instead of opening their entire financial lives to a lender or dealer financing department, on their own—unlocking the Stack’s potential to curb bias and truly enhance financial inclusiveness.</p>
<p>It also means they could one day share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing any personal information at all—bringing the microbusiness opportunities <a href="https://time.com/4828808/india-biometric-id-system-aadhaar-benefits-women/">afforded to women</a> through Aadhaar-based mobile services to a whole new level, for example. Remote and in-person <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">identity verification</a> and authentication becomes far more secure as well—easily enabling differentiation between legitimate users and imposters hiding behind stolen or synthetic identities.</p>
<p>India’s adoption of liveness tests during authentication through its new app is an excellent first step. Let’s hope its beta is a massive success and it goes into wide release sooner rather than later. But that’s only if they do it right.</p>
<p>To maximize effectiveness, the Indian government should consider adopting global best practices and standards—such as <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/iso-30107-3-presentation-attack-detection-confirmation-letters/">ISO/IEC 30107-3</a>—for its digital identity infrastructure and related liveness testing. These can serve as a strong foundation while the country works toward developing its own standards in the future. Only then will they be able to defeat virtually any attempt at identity spoofing. I may be biased, but it seems fitting for a nation with a legacy of technological advances dating back to the Vedas—and I have to believe King Harishchandra would approve.</p>

<p>Meet Alex—a compliance analyst onboarding a new corporate client. The company looks legitimate, but beneficial ownership is often more complex than it appears. With layers of holding companies and indirect stakeholders, missing key details could mean regulatory trouble—or worse. Fortunately, with the right system, Alex’s beneficial ownership reviews can be streamlined, secure, and insightful.</p>



<p></p>



 Alex’s Approach to Beneficial Ownership Reviews 



<p>Instead of hunting through emails and databases, Alex pulls director filings, shareholder lists, and organizational charts automatically from trusted global sources. This gives him an instant overview of the company’s structure and connections—even across multiple jurisdictions. Once the data is collected, Alex focuses on identifying individuals with 25% or more ownership or control. He cross-checks these key players against watchlists, sanctions, and adverse media to flag potential risks early.</p>



<p>To close the loop, Alex compiles findings into an audit-ready report—no manual spreadsheets or patchwork PDFs. With one click, he generates a detailed summary that tracks every step of his review, making audits painless and ensuring regulatory requirements are met. Real-time alerts and built-in compliance checks mean Alex stays proactive, not reactive.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Considerations for Complex Beneficial Ownership 



 
 Trusts, Shells, and Hidden Layers: Ownership isn’t always direct. Many firms use trusts or shell companies to obscure control. A robust compliance platform helps uncover indirect ownership and manage ownership percentages with transparency. 



 Global Variations in Ownership Laws: Each jurisdiction may have different thresholds and definitions for beneficial ownership. Your system should adapt to local regulations while maintaining a unified global view. 



 Dynamic Ownership Changes: Ownership structures evolve due to mergers, investments, and leadership shifts. Continuous monitoring ensures you catch changes that could impact compliance long after onboarding. 
 



<p></p>



 Make Compliance Your Strength 



<p>With iComply, beneficial ownership reviews become an integral part of a smarter, more secure due diligence process. Automating data collection and verification saves time, reduces errors, and keeps your compliance team a step ahead. Ready to transform your approach? Let’s get started.</p>

<p>You may have heard the buzzwords lately—Microcredentials, <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/standards/open-badges">open badges 3.0</a>, verifiable credentials. It can be overwhelming to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the world of credentialing is moving into higher education and you don’t want your institution left behind, so here is your full guide on verifiable credentials (VC) in education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What Are Verifiable Credentials for Higher Education?&nbsp; 



<p>In higher education, <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> are secure, digital representations of academic achievements and identity-based records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities can issue VCs for:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Diplomas&nbsp; 



 Transcripts 



 Course completions 



 Student and Staff IDs 



 Professional certifications 



 And more 
 



<p></p>



<p>These credentials allow students to securely share their achievements with employers, boards, and other institutions without requiring manual verification from the university. By using cryptographic technology, VCs ensure authenticity, prevent fraud, and streamline the verification process, benefiting both students and the institutions that issue them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Digital Credentials vs Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>While the terms digital credentials and verifiable credentials are often used interchangeably, they have some major different in terms of security, verification, and ownership.&nbsp;</p>



 Digital Credentials: Basic Digital Records&nbsp; 



<p>Digital credentials refer to any electronic version of a traditional credential, such as a PDF diploma, an email confirmation of course completion, or a student ID stored in a university portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While convenient, these credentials:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Lack built-in verification (Employers or institutions must manually verify their authenticity)&nbsp; 



 Are easy to forge (PDFs and digital images can be edited or manipulated) 



 Rely on central databases (Universities must store and confirm credentials, requiring ongoing administrative work)&nbsp; 
 



 Verifiable Credentials: Secure &amp; Tamper-Proof&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials (VCs) are a more advanced, fraud-resistant version of digital credentials. They are issued using cryptographic security, making them tamper-proof, instantly verifiable, and privacy-focused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike basic digital credentials, VCs:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are instantly verifiable (Employers and institutions can check authenticity without contacting the issuing university) 



 Can’t be altered or forged (Cryptographic signatures ensure credentials remain unchanged)&nbsp; 



 Are decentralized (Students own and control their credentials, eliminating reliance on a central database) 
 



<p>VCs provide increased trust and efficiency for all parties involved.</p>



<p>For universities, this means fewer manual transcript requests, fewer third-party verification costs, and reduced administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For students and alumni, it means the ability to prove academic achievement anytime, anywhere—with no delays, paperwork, or middlemen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because verifiable credentials are built on privacy-by-design principles, they also limit data exposure. Students share only what’s necessary—such as verifying enrollment status or degree completion—without revealing full personal records. This selective disclosure is ideal for both data protection compliance (like GDPR) and enhancing student privacy.</p>



<p>Additionally, VCs are designed to be interoperable and future-ready. A credential issued by a university today can be used across platforms and systems tomorrow, supporting career transitions, further education, and international mobility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities that issue verifiable credentials are positioning themselves as innovators, enhancing student success and streamlining operations with scalable, secure technology.&nbsp;</p>



 Why Universities Are Moving to Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Traditional credentials create inefficiencies and security risks, while verifiable credentials provide a future-proof, automated, and fraud-resistant way to issue academic records. By adopting VCs, universities can streamline verification, reduce costs, and enhance trust for students and employers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why are universities making this shift now?&nbsp;</p>



 1. Strengthening the University’s Reputation &amp; Trust&nbsp; 



<p>Diploma fraud and fake credentials damage the credibility of academic institutions. By issuing verifiable, fraud-resistant credentials, universities reinforce their reputation as trusted, forward-thinking institutions. Employers and graduate programs can instantly verify a student’s qualifications, eliminating doubts about authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Creating a Better Student &amp; Alumni Experience&nbsp; 



<p>Students and alumni frequently request transcripts, diplomas, and certificates for job applications, further education, or licensing. Verifiable credentials allow universities to provide these documents instantly—saving students time and reducing administrative burdens.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Reducing Administrative Costs &amp; Workload&nbsp; 



<p>Traditional credential issuance and verification are time-consuming and expensive. Universities spend significant resources processing requests, verifying documents, and managing outdated systems. Verifiable credentials automate and streamline these processes, freeing up staff to focus on more strategic initiatives while cutting operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Enhancing Security &amp; Regulatory Compliance&nbsp; 



<p>Data breaches and identity fraud pose serious risks to educational institutions. Verifiable credentials are privacy-first, encrypted, and compliant with global regulations like GDPR. Unlike centralized databases that are vulnerable to breaches, VCs allow students to control their own data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>



 5. Creating New Revenue Opportunities&nbsp; 



<p>Offering verifiable credentials as a premium service for alumni, employers, and continuing education programs opens new revenue streams for universities. Institutions can monetize digital credentialing services by charging for expedited verification, lifetime credential access, or industry-specific certifications.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Future-Proofing University Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>As industries shift toward digital identity ecosystems, universities that adopt verifiable credentials gain a competitive edge. By providing secure, portable, and instantly verifiable credentials, institutions establish themselves as leaders in innovation while meeting the evolving demands of employers, students, and regulatory bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Academic Verification&nbsp; 



<p>Issuing verifiable credentials isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about enhancing security, improving the student experience, and strengthening institutional credibility. Universities that embrace this technology reduce costs, improve compliance, and create long-term value for students, alumni, and the broader education ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs makes it easy. We empower institutions to issue secure, tamper-proof verifiable credentials that enhance trust, streamline operations, and deliver a seamless student experience. Whether you’re modernizing your student ID system or enabling alumni to prove their degrees, we’ll help you build the future of digital trust—today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As CEO of HYPR, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future of identity security. And right now, one of the most significant shifts we're witnessing is driven by the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence. While AI offers incredible potential, it also presents formidable challenges, particularly in the realm of identity verification. The uncomfortable truth is that the era of relying solely on scanning a driver's license or passport to prove someone is who they claim to be is rapidly coming to an end. AI has made forging these documents disturbingly easy, rendering traditional methods dangerously inadequate.</p>  
 How Advanced AI Undermines Traditional Document Checks  
<a></a> 
<p>We've all seen the headlines about generative AI tools like GPT-4o, Midjourney, and others. Their ability to create text, images, and even video from simple prompts is astounding. Unfortunately, this power extends to creating highly convincing counterfeit identity documents. What once required specialized skills, equipment, and significant time can now be achieved by malicious actors in mere minutes.</p> 
<p>This isn't a theoretical future threat; it's happening now. The implications for businesses relying on Know Your Customer (KYC) and employee identity verification processes are immense. From financial institutions onboarding new clients to travel companies verifying passengers, the foundational assumption that a presented document is genuine is crumbling under the weight of AI-driven forgery. This ease of access to sophisticated forgery tools democratizes identity fraud on an unprecedented scale, posing a severe risk to businesses and consumers alike.<br></p> 
 How AI Like GPT-4o Can Effortlessly Create Convincing Fake Passports and IDs  
<p>The alarming reality of AI's forgery capabilities was starkly demonstrated recently in a widely shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/musielak_you-can-now-generate-fake-passports-with-activity-7312844061973917698-v_sF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABBsJa8Bi7jTW5bovTQMMK-CEDMr2G0peKk">post on LinkedIn by Borys Musielak</a>. He highlighted just how simple and accessible this threat has become.</p> 
<p>As Borys shared, using generative AI capabilities available in models like GPT-4o, it took him a mere five minutes to create a convincing digital replica of his own passport. This wasn't a theoretical exercise; it was a practical demonstration yielding a fake document that, in his assessment, would likely sail through many automated KYC systems currently in use without raising any red flags.</p>  
<p>Borys's conclusion was blunt and accurate: "Photo-based KYC is done. Game over." And he's absolutely right. He further noted, "any verification flow relying on images as 'proof' is now officially obsolete. The same applies to selfies. Static or video, it doesn’t matter. GenAI can fake them too."</p> 
<p>This isn't about spotting blurry, amateurish fakes anymore. We're talking about high-resolution images possessing all the visual hallmarks of genuine documents, generated with frightening speed and ease. To the untrained human eye, and critically, to many legacy automated verification systems, these fakes are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. These systems, often designed to spot layout inconsistencies or basic digital manipulations, are simply not equipped to detect pixel-perfect forgeries created by AI trained on vast datasets of real documents.</p> 
<p>The types of foundational documents now easily counterfeited digitally include:</p> 
  
  Passports: Essential for international travel and high-value transactions.  
  Driver's Licenses: Widely used for domestic identification, age verification, and accessing services.  
  National ID Cards: Key for government services, voting, and proof of citizenship in many countries.  
  Birth Certificates: Often the root document used to obtain other forms of identification.  
  The sheer speed and quality achievable mean fraudsters can generate fake credentials on demand, tailored for specific targets or designed to bypass particular security checks. The core vulnerability lies in the fact that these traditional documents were designed for a pre-digital, pre-AI world. Their security features often rely on physical inspection (holograms, watermarks, special inks) which are completely irrelevant in a purely digital verification process based on submitted images. Visual layout consistency, once a reliable indicator, is now something AI can replicate flawlessly.
<br> 
 The Imminent Obsolescence of Just Using Document-Based Identity Verification  
     
<p>The consequence of this AI-powered forgery capability is stark: traditional, document-centric identity verification is becoming obsolete as a standalone method. Relying solely on a submitted image of an ID, or even pairing it with a selfie (which can also be faked using deepfake technology), is no longer a sufficient security measure.</p> 
<p>Why is this the case?<br></p> 
  
  Perfect Replication: AI can analyze thousands of genuine documents and learn to replicate their structure, fonts, layouts, and subtle visual elements with near-perfect accuracy.  
  Beyond Static Images: The threat isn't limited to document images. AI can generate fake selfies ("deepfakes") and even manipulate video feeds in real-time, fooling liveness checks that require a user to blink or turn their head.  
  Ease of Bypass: Fraudsters armed with these AI-generated fakes can easily circumvent onboarding processes, open fraudulent accounts, launder money, and commit other serious crimes, leaving businesses liable and customers vulnerable.  
  
<p>Continuing down the path of document-only verification is like putting a padlock on a screen door. It looks like security, but it provides no real protection against a determined adversary armed with modern tools. Businesses clinging to these outdated methods are not just failing to stop fraud; they are actively exposing themselves and their legitimate customers to significant financial and reputational risk.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=9b50cee6-bc8a-4f21-93f5-b04103b27804&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Multi-Factor Identity Verification: The Necessary Path Forward  
<p>So, if documents alone are no longer reliable, what's the answer? The solution lies in a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">multi-layered, multi-factor approach to identity verification</a>. Instead of relying on a single, forgeable piece of evidence, we must validate multiple, independent factors simultaneously during a single user interaction.</p> 
<p>Think of it like securing a high-value facility. You wouldn't rely solely on a single keycard; you'd incorporate security guards, cameras, biometric scans, and access logs. Similarly, robust identity verification requires multiple signals triangulated together to build confidence in the user's identity. This dramatically increases the complexity and cost for fraudsters, making it exponentially harder to bypass checks using only a fake document.</p> 
 Essential Components of Secure Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>A truly secure multi-factor identity verification process doesn't just ask for more things; it intelligently combines different types of signals. At HYPR, we believe the essential components include:</p> 
  
  User's Device Trust: Is the user interacting from a device (phone, computer) that is known and trusted? Analyzing device integrity, reputation, and security posture provides a critical anchor. Leveraging technologies like passkeys, which bind the user to the device cryptographically, adds a powerful layer.  
  Location &amp; Network Context: Does the user's location (derived from IP address, GPS, network signals) align with expected patterns? Is the network connection suspicious (e.g., coming from a known VPN or proxy associated with fraud)? Contextual data provides vital clues.  
  Advanced ID Document Validation (As One Factor, Not the Only Factor): We remotely analyze submitted document photos using sophisticated digital forensics to detect forgery and cross-reference key information against trusted national databases.&nbsp;  
  Simultaneous Validation &amp; Orchestration: Crucially, these factors must be checked together in a single, orchestrated session. A fraudster might be able to spoof one factor (like location via a VPN) or possess a fake document, but faking a trusted device, a plausible location, and passing advanced document checks all at the same time is significantly more challenging.  
  

This orchestrated, multi-signal approach creates a security posture far stronger than the sum of its parts.
<br> 
 Benefits of Multi-Factor Approach Over Document-Only Verification  
<p>Adopting a modern, multi-factor verification strategy delivers tangible advantages:</p> 
  
  Dramatically Reduced Fraud: Makes it exponentially harder for fraudsters to succeed with only fake documents.  
  Layered Security: Creates multiple barriers; if one factor is compromised, others still stand guard.  
  Enhanced Compliance: Helps meet evolving regulatory requirements that increasingly recognize the limitations of document-only checks.  
  Improved User Experience: Modern solutions can orchestrate these checks seamlessly in the background, often requiring less active user participation than more cumbersome processes.  
  Increased Trust: Demonstrates a commitment to highest security, reassuring users that their identities are being properly protected.  
  
 The Inevitable Path to Verified Digital Identities  
<p>Multi-factor verification is the crucial defense against current threats. But the long-term solution involves moving beyond verifying static documents altogether and embracing verified digital identities.</p> 
<p>Think of a physical wallet containing your driver's license, credit cards, and health insurance card. A digital identity wallet securely stores verified, cryptographically signed digital credentials on your smartphone or device. When you need to prove your identity online, you present the relevant digital credential from your wallet, which can be verified instantly and securely without transmitting unnecessary personal data.<br></p> 
 Flaws in Traditional KYC Processes Across Industries&nbsp;  
<p>The reliance on outdated, document-centric KYC is a systemic vulnerability affecting numerous sectors:</p> 
  
  Banking &amp; Finance: Exposure to account opening fraud, money laundering, and regulatory fines.  
  Insurance: Fraudulent claims, policy inception fraud based on fake identities.  
  Travel &amp; Hospitality: Circumvention of watchlists, booking fraud, non-compliance with passenger verification mandates.  
  Cryptocurrency Exchanges: High susceptibility to money laundering and sanctioned individuals using fake IDs.  
  Gig Economy &amp; Marketplaces: Platform abuse, background check evasion, trust and safety issues.  
  Government Services: Benefits fraud, unauthorized access to citizen services.  
  
<p>In all these areas, the risks of clinging to document-only verification are clear: rampant fraud, regulatory penalties, operational inefficiencies dealing with fraud fallout, and perhaps most damagingly, the erosion of customer trust.</p> 
 Digitally-Verified Identity: The Necessary Evolution of KYC  
<p>The future of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">secure and user-friendly KYC</a> lies in verified digital identity. Forward-thinking governments and regulatory bodies, like the EU with its eIDAS 2.0 framework and digital identity wallets, are already paving the way. This approach offers a paradigm shift:</p> 
  
  Cryptographically Secure: Identity data is bound to the user and verified using strong cryptography, making forgery virtually impossible.  
  Verifiable Credentials: Users present specific, verified attributes (like "is over 18" or "is a resident of X state") without revealing underlying sensitive data.  
  Interoperable Standards: Built on common standards ensuring compatibility across different services and jurisdictions (e.g., eIDAS, GDPR principles of data minimization).  
  User Control &amp; Privacy: Users control their own identity data within their digital wallets.  
  Seamless Experience: Enables secure, passwordless authentication and instant identity verification, creating a frictionless user journey.  
  Verified digital identity isn't just about better security; it's about creating a more efficient, private, and user-centric digital world. It represents the true evolution of KYC for the digital age.
<br> 
 Choosing the Right Digital Identity Verification Partner  
<p>Transitioning to a modern identity verification strategy requires the right technology partner. As you evaluate solutions, consider these key aspects:</p> 
  
  Multi-Factor Verification: Does the platform incorporate device trust, location context, behavioral signals, and advanced document checks with sophisticated orchestration? Does it have proven fraud detection capabilities against modern threats?  
  Seamless User Experience: How easy is the verification process for legitimate users? Does it work across web and mobile, and for various use cases (onboarding, login, transaction verification)?  
  Compliance &amp; Standards: Does the solution support relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and emerging digital identity standards?

<p>When we talk about introspection in digital identity, we’re not just talking about what happens in OAuth 2.0. Yes, there’s a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7662">token introspection spec</a>, but this post is about something broader: the idea that platforms—especially browsers—can inspect and influence the identity data being exchanged.</p>



<p>Is that a good thing? Apple and Google disagree on just how much introspection is required. And, unfortunately for my piece of mind, I can definitely see both sides of the argument.</p>



 What Is Introspection in Web Identity? 



<p>In OAuth, introspection allows a system (typically a resource server) to ask a trusted party whether a token is valid and get details like the user, scope, and expiration time.</p>



<p>But the concept of introspection has grown. On the web, it now also means the ability of browsers or platforms to inspect credential requests and responses in order to enforce policy, mediate UX, or protect users.</p>



<p>When a platform introspects, that could mean:</p>



 
 Checking the structure of the credential request 



 Verifying the origin of the Verifier 



 Filtering or transforming claims before they reach the user 



 Blocking requests that don’t meet policy requirements 



 Mediating consent UX on behalf of the user 
 



<p>The question is: how much of that should the browser do by default?</p>



<p>Some say introspection is essential to prevent misuse and protect people. Others argue it creates surveillance risks and makes systems harder to build and scale. Both arguments make valid points, and Apple and Google are not entirely aligned. If you’re expecting a consistent user experience across browsers and mobile platforms, this split is a problem.</p>



 A Quick Aside: Inspection vs. Introspection 



<p>(Because language matters and I needed to look this up myself.)</p>



<p>Inspection is about checking whether something is safe to process, typically by looking at its structure or syntax.<br>Introspection is about understanding what something means and making decisions based on its content.</p>



<p>In digital identity:</p>



 
 Inspection might involve validating that a request is well-formed and doesn’t contain code injection attempts. 



 Introspection would involve analyzing the claims being requested and deciding whether they’re appropriate to show to the user, or even whether the request should be blocked. 
 



<p>To put it another way:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Inspection asks, “Is this safe to handle?”<br>Introspection asks, “What is this trying to do?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That distinction matters, especially when deciding how much power the browser (or any other entity in the system) should have.</p>



 Two Tech Giants, Two Opposing Philosophies 



<p>I don’t think you’ll find these positions formally documented anywhere, but based on conversations I’ve had and observed, it boils down to this: </p>



 
 Apple enforces stricter policies that require any credential request passed from the browser to the OS to be syntactically valid and free from malicious content (which means they need to see that content). 



 Google takes a different approach: validating format but delegating deeper inspection to the wallet itself. That’s similar to how they handle passkeys with external providers. 
 



<p>Both companies agree that the browser, as the user agent, has the right to intervene if it believes a request is actively malicious, but they differ in how proactive the browser should be by default.</p>



<p>These positions ultimately shape APIs, UX flows, and developer expectations across major identity protocols. They even impact regulatory discussions as lawmakers argue about what they most want to protect the user from: Big Tech or everyone else.</p>



<p>(For a closer look at how these differences are shaping actual standards work, including the emerging <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">Digital Credentials API</a> at the W3C, I covered some of the details <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/14/what-is-the-w3c-wicg-digital-identities-project/">in this earlier post</a>.)</p>

 Enter Alice: A Real-World Example of Identity in Action 



<p>We all love Alice; she is the subject of many a tech story! Let’s say Alice goes to vote in a local election. She’s asked to scan a QR code, which opens her phone’s browser. The verifier (e.g., the state election site) sends a request to her digital identity wallet asking for name, age, home address, and proof of citizenship.</p>



<p>The problem? That’s not a single request. It’s really four separate ones. And Alice has more than one credential that could answer each, e.g., a mobile driver’s license and a mobile passport. Who decides which credentials are shown to Alice? Who ensures that the request is legitimate and not asking for too much?</p>



<p>That’s where introspection—by the browser, wallet, or platform—becomes a question of control.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that neither Apple nor Google has said they want the browser to inspect everything or nothing. What they’ve done is adopt different implementation strategies:</p>



 
 Apple enforces stricter content validation between browser and OS. 



 Google favors letting wallets handle most decision-making, as long as requests are well-structured. 
 



<p>Both reserve the right to step in if a request seems actively harmful. But their default assumptions about the browser’s role do differ, and that shapes how developers must design for each environment.</p>



 Should the Browser Mediate or Stand Back? 



<p>If the browser only performs inspection, Alice’s experience might depend entirely on the wallet. That could mean an inconsistent user experience, especially if she has multiple wallets or credentials from different issuers.</p>



<p>If the browser goes further—into introspection—it could help Alice choose appropriate credentials, warn her if a verifier is overreaching, or even block suspect requests.</p>



<p>But that also means the browser has access to more metadata about what’s being requested and how Alice is interacting with verifiers. That’s a privacy concern in itself and ultimately a trade-off each platform has to make.</p>



 What This Means for Digital Identity Developers 



<p>The lack of consensus means that digital identity wallets, verifiers, and browsers are often behaving differently depending on what platform you’re using or developing for. That leads to:</p>



 
 Inconsistent user experiences 



 Confusing or overly technical prompts 



 Incompatibility between ecosystems 
 



<p>These differences are baked into major specs: <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC)</a> for digital credentials in general and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> for mobile driver’s licenses all take a stance on who gets to inspect what.</p>



<p>These aren’t just product design differences—they affect how global standards get written. If the browser is deeply involved, specs like OpenID4VC or ISO 18013 need to account for that. If not, then the wallet has to take full responsibility for consent and UI, which introduces fragmentation risks across platforms.</p>



<p>Developers are caught in the middle, trying to build usable systems that work across platforms with  different requirements.</p>



 TL;DR: What’s at Stake with Introspection? 



 
 For users: Do you want the browser to protect you—or stay out of the way? The answer to that guides what platform provider you choose. 



 For developers: Do you build for Apple-style control or Google-style neutrality? Unfortunately, the answer is probably “both.” You job is complicated. 



 For standards folks: Do your APIs assume the browser mediates—or just observes? You’ll probably have to be more careful to build in feature detection (among other things). 
 



<p>The answers affect more than architecture; they shape the identity experience itself.</p>



 So, Is Introspection the Bug or the Feature? 



<p>In digital identity, introspection can be either.</p>



 
 When done right, it helps prevent overreach, clarify consent, and improve trust. 



 When done poorly, it increases complexity, leaks sensitive data, or just gets in the way. 
 



<p>What’s needed is nuance, which is insanely challenging. Right now, we’re stuck in a binary: inspect everything or inspect nothing.</p>



 What Comes Next? 



<p>Should browsers protect users from overly ambitious verifiers? Or is it time to let wallets and holders take full responsibility?</p>



<p>The question isn’t just technical. It’s political, ethical, and practical. And like so much in identity, it comes down to one thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who do we trust to protect Alice?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’d love to hear how others are thinking about this. Is there a better path forward? Should introspection evolve or be reined in?</p>

<p>We founded Liminal in 2022 with a radical idea: that the future of intelligence wouldn’t be delivered through static reports or one-size-fits-all dashboards but through real-time, contextual insight embedded directly into the decisions that matter most. That idea led to <a href="https://liminal.co/product/link-core/">Link</a>, our core platform, and a broader vision to transform how leaders in complex and regulated industries navigate change, assess risk, and act confidently.</p>



 Today, I’m thrilled to share that Liminal has raised $8.5 million in Series A funding, led by <a href="https://noromoseley.com/">Noro-Moseley Partners</a>, with participation from early strategic investors and customers who have supported our vision. 



 



&nbsp;$8.5M Series A Funding Fuels Liminal’s Intelligence Platform



 



<p>This milestone is about much more than capital. It validates the market need, the strength of the team, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving. Most importantly, it fuels us to build the next generation of intelligence products that enterprise leaders can’t live without.</p>



 Why Now, Why Liminal? 



<p>Enterprise decision-makers are under more pressure than ever. Go-to-market teams face shrinking budgets and rising complexity. Risk and compliance leaders are overwhelmed by shifting regulations and increasingly creative threat actors. Product and strategy teams are expected to see around corners.</p>



<p>And yet, the tools they rely on are fragmented, slow, and outdated. Static research reports. Siloed dashboards. Intelligence that’s often too late, too shallow, or too generic to be useful.</p>



<p>We believe the answer isn’t “more data.” It’s better intelligence—delivered in real-time, tailored to the task, and embedded directly in workflows.</p>



<p>That’s the future we’re building at Liminal. And this round accelerates that mission.</p>



 Where We’re Going 



<p>With this Series A funding, we’re focused on three core priorities:</p>



 
 Product Innovation: Expanding Link and launching new tools that meet our users where they are. This includes products like <a href="https://liminal.co/product/sales-hub/">Sales Hub</a>, which was launched in March and brings real-time, contextual market and competitive intelligence into the hands of go-to-market teams. 



 Scalable Infrastructure: Building a data pipeline and delivery engine that supports the speed, scale, and specificity our customers demand. 



 Customer Success &amp; Growth: Deepening our partnerships with enterprise clients and growing our advisory, research, and support capabilities to help every customer extract maximum value from our platform. 
 



 What Makes Us Different 



<p>We believe that great intelligence is:</p>



 
 Dynamic: It adapts as the market evolves 



 Granular: It breaks down complexity into its most actionable parts 



 Embedded: It shows up where and when decisions are made 
 



<p>This is why we started by focusing on highly regulated, rapidly shifting domains like cybersecurity, financial crime, fraud prevention, and trust and safety. These are the areas where the cost of bad information is highest and where our platform can deliver immediate value.</p>



<p>Our approach combines human expertise, proprietary data models, and a flexible delivery system that brings intelligence into Slack, Salesforce, product roadmaps, sales playbooks, and executive dashboards—wherever needed.</p>



 A Thank You to the People Who Made This Possible 



<p>We wouldn’t be here without the support of our customers, early investors, partners, and team. To our early adopters, thank you for believing in our mission and pushing us to build something that truly works for you.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>Raising a Series A isn’t the end of the story—it’s the beginning of our next chapter. We’re more energized than ever to push the boundaries of what’s possible in enterprise intelligence.</p>



<p>We’re building Liminal for leaders who can’t afford to wait for answers, teams that need to see what’s changing in real-time, and companies that want to turn complexity into a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>We’re just getting started.</p>



 



<p>Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to learn more <a href="https://link.liminal.co/">about our platform</a> or what we’re building next. We’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>In today’s world, when security is our top priority, face recognition liveness detection has gained much popularity across multiple fields of life. This technology is widely used due to its non-intrusive nature and ease of use.</p>
<p>This technology is used to determine whether the face during authentication is real or fake. It also examined whether the person is physically present or using fake images or videos to manipulate the systems.</p>
<p>Such a technology is considered the top solution to prevent fraud……..</p>
<p>However, it is an interesting question that is often raised by many users: how does this face recognition liveness detection work? What is the actual technology behind this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you also have the same question? If yes, raise your hand and add to the list with those who are going to stay connected with.</p>
<p>So, let’s start…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Face Recognition Liveness Detection is Important? 
<p>We can understand its importance with a lifetime example:</p>
<p>Let’s suppose you are working for a bank institute as an employee, and a person comes to you with someone’s fake images. Here, they can claim to be an account holder. After this claim, they will come to their main point and ask for some sensitive information or perform the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it’s not time to underestimate the importance of face recognition liveness detection. Without this technology, the fake person will easily manipulate you and cause you to have a big loss. You have to use this technology to determine whether the person who came to you is fake or real.</p>
<p>This system of security is gaining huge popularity across banks, educational institutions, and other financial systems day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Face Liveness Detection Works? 
<p>Let’s uncover the main topic of our blog. In this section, we have to explore how liveness detection for face recognition works. Basically, multiple components and technologies contribute to the working of this technology. Below are their descriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Artificial Intelligence 
<p>We don’t think so, there is no field of life where Artificial Intelligence has not left its impact. Are we saying right? When it comes to liveness detection, AI plays a ground-breaking role. It analyzes facial expressions and behaviours of the person to determine whether the face is fake or real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This liveness detection system uses sophisticated AI algorithms to differentiate between real human users and deepfakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Machine Learning 
<p>Unlike Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning also plays its pivotal role in face recognition liveness detection. Machine Learning algorithms are trained to recognize the subtle patterns and anomalies in facial textures. This feature lets the system identify whether the face is fake or real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, ML can easily identify the major signs of spoofing attempts that are made to manipulate the systems and cause their downfall by criminals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Action-Based Detection 
<p>After reading this sub-heading, you would have understood the 90% theme of this section. Well! It is good, but there are some concepts about this that need to be explained. As the name suggests, here, users are said to perform some specific actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes they have to smile, blink their eyes, and even nod their heads. Now, let’s have a very simple question for you: are these motions or actions exclusive to images or videos? It is not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Blood Flow Detection 
<p>After reading this heading, you may be surprised or laugh that the blood that was used for the DNA test will be used for liveness detection. Actually, liveness detection systems analyze biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here, their main purpose is to monitor the color change that is associated with human blood flow. Sometimes, the same monitoring can also be achieved through their heartbeats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn’t it funny……</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. 3D Imaging Technology 
<p>Accessing the depth perception is one of the most important aspects of the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> system. As hinted previously, fake persons use spoof images and videos to destroy the systems. Here, you may ask, why only 3D image technology?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically, 2D images lack the depth information of any person. Due to this, detection systems utilize 3D image recognition technology to identify whether the person is using fake images or is present physically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 6. Color And Texture Analysis 
<p>Liveness detection system enhances biometric identification and improves the system through color and texture analysis. They analyze facial color patterns that are associated with human faces. This approach ensures that the data reflects the actual and real human characteristics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we talk further about this component of facial liveness detection, it is considered the backbone of active liveness detection. If any institute adopts such a strategy, it is impossible to manipulate them by utilizing fake images and other documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 7. Pupil Dilation Technique 
<p>Do you know how the mobile becomes unlocked when you bring your face in front of it? This is all just because of the retina image of an eye’s pupil. Similarly, when it comes to facial liveness detection systems, the pupil dilation technique is of great importance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using this technique, some aspects, like changes in pupil size and natural eye movements, are monitored. Such monitoring is useful to differentiate between a fake person with stolen fake videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 “Introducing Our Face Recognition Liveness Detection Solution” 
<p>If you are looking for an innovative solution for face liveness detection, we are here with a possible solution named <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI and machine learning algorithms, and biometric analysis, we ensure the best method to distinguish between real faces and potentially harmful spoofing attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This solution features action-based detection, blood flow monitoring, and 3D imaging technology. With these key features, our system delivers an unbelievable approach to security, making it a vital tool for preventing fraud and safeguarding sensitive transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This technology ensures seamless security across multiple fields and financial and educational institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when it comes to its working process, many readers get confused. To eliminate this confusion, we have created this blog post for them. In this guide, we have explored the components and technologies behind this detection system in detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Join Michael Cichon, CMO at 1Kosmos, and Mike Engle, CSO, as they explore the growing impact of biometric privacy regulations across the U.S. and beyond. Learn how 1Kosmos protects user data through privacy-by-design, decentralized architecture, and secure biometric hashing. Whether you’re a security leader or privacy-conscious consumer, this conversation breaks down what to watch out for when scanning your face or ID online—and how to stay in control.</p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
<p>Well, hello, everybody. Welcome to the 1Kosmos Vlog. This is Michael Cichon. I’m the chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here with Mike Engle, our chief strategy officer. Always good to have you, Mike. Let’s jump right in. I want to talk to you about privacy. 1Kosmos is a identity verification, passwordless authentication company. So obviously, we capture biometrics. We use biometrics of various sorts, fingerprint, face ID, live ID, even getting into some things like iris if the company has that set up.</p>
<p>So a lot of privacy regulations making the news lately. The list’s probably too long to mention here, but Illinois, Texas, New York, probably several others by now, are all passing privacy legislation. Consumers generally seem to be at least, if not concerned, aware that their biometrics are being captured, and they want some degree of control here. So before jumping into 1Kosmos and how we manage privacy, can you talk a little bit about the privacy movement that we’re seeing in the United States and probably, in all likelihood, international, as well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So when Google and Facebook did their thing, they monetized all of us. Right? Get Facebook for free. Get Google for free. Guess what? They’re going to sell your data. There’s been quite a backlash, not only from people who don’t want that to happen, but the states are starting to force data privacy. A big part of data privacy is the biometrics, and it’s one of the most important things. You can sell the fact that I live at 123 Main Street, my social security number, and that’s bad.</p>
<p>You can protect against that. Right? You can move. Your address, by itself, really not too scary, and typically, there’s other controls. But you can’t change your biometrics. Then, the other challenge is once your biometrics are in a system, you don’t know how they’re using them and how they might use them in the future. So these are some of the things that are top of mind for legislators and, really, everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, that is a concern, I mean, just a personal concern. I’ve been online. I’ve had to scan my driver’s license in a couple times, online prescriptions, even advertising, digital advertising now. When you go through the airport, if you want the fast path, you kind of have to scan your credentials. So should I, as a consumer, be concerned about scanning my driver’s license and my likeness into a website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>You should. Yeah. You should be careful where you do it. Trust the entity, and understand the privacy policies. Sometimes, you’re in a rush. You don’t check. Are they storing that driver’s license or your face in a place long term, or is it kind of transient, where they’re going to process it and throw it away, which is what they really should do unless there’s some reason, maybe legal. Right? Banking, they might have to keep it. So that privacy policy and how they’re going to use it in the moment and in the future is really important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So privacy policy, of course, is important, but we’ve had thousands and thousands of data breaches. So data’s captured and secured until it isn’t. Right? So what are the questions to ask when we start scanning our biometrics into any system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, it’s, what are they using it for? Right? That’s the consent part. For example, let’s say you walk into a grocery store, and they have some new face authentication thing, which, it’s getting out there. Right? The Amazon Fresh has palm scanners. Panera Bread does, as well. Chase has this thing called PopID, which is a facial and other types of biometrics that they’re putting into retail. So what if that face could now be used to tell anytime you walk into the store? Would that bother you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>It might.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Right? So that’s the issue, is these entities must say, “We’re just going to use it to make your life easier at the register, and we’re going to take really good care of that face.” In fact, the way we do the technology, this is how 1Kosmos does it, is a way that we don’t even have to store your face in the system, but we can use you walking up to a camera over and over again. Right?</p>
<p>So we have, obviously, our fingerprint, 1Key device, and our face LiveID technology, which doesn’t actually store your face in a way that we can use it a second time without your consent. So that’s the big difference in the two. And so if I told you that, you’d probably have a little more comfort with the solution. Right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>I might. I might. So let’s talk a little bit more about that. What are some of the, if you were, the design considerations or security countermeasures that 1Kosmos puts in place to protect and secure personal identifiable information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So there’s a couple. There’s the concept of biometric hashing. So imagine you walk up to a terminal, a kiosk, a website, your phone, and at the edge, that face can be turned into a mathematical formula, call it a thousand random numbers that look random and that cannot be reverse engineered into your face. That is where the determination is made as to whether it is you or somebody else. Hashing is a concept that’s been used since the password was almost invented, going way back. It’s really important when you apply it to biometrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. The 1Kosmos platform is privacy by design. What does that mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It means that the user is always in control of their PII. So if we work with you and verify your identity, or we need to authenticate you into your workstation or a website, we will never have access to your personal data, for example, your driver’s license information, your passport, that face biometric, your fingerprint biometric. We don’t have access to it.</p>
<p>So my head of engineering could not, with all his knowledge, reach into some type of database and get your stuff, period, full stop. That’s the way we’ve designed it. By design, it is private. Now, the only way to access it is if I give you my consent and, really, the private key, which enables that to be leveraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So in a traditional system, somebody hacks the admin’s credentials. They have the same access the admin has. They can then see what’s in the central files and, I guess, encrypt them, view it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>In our system, if, God forbid, you hacked a developer or a central admin, congratulations, but you’re not going to be able to get any personal data from anybody. Because that admin, that person, by definition, doesn’t have access to it. It’s the whole nature of a distributed ledger. All right. So let’s talk about the practical application of this, then. Now, you have chief information security officers trying to make decisions about passwordless authentication, whether or not to use biometrics. What are some of the considerations that these folks should have when they evaluate the approach they’re going to take to eliminating passwords or strengthening authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So there’s the design. Right? So we talked about privacy by design. If a face from the authenticating or verifying system ends up anywhere that it can be accessed, it’s a big red flag. There’s been many biometric breaches of recent years, and that, it just opens up a whole host of issues. Then, so let’s say you are, you mentioned a chief information security officer. If they want to allow their employees to log into a Windows workstation with just their face glancing at a camera, much like Windows Hello, but it would work anywhere, they have to make sure that not only the provider, 1Kosmos, doesn’t have access, but they don’t either. Right? That CISO does not want access to faces. They don’t want to be able to click on some button in a system and be able to see them. So the privacy by design is important.</p>
<p>Just as important is consent. So all that means is you have to ask the user for their permission to do the thing that you’re going to do, and that’s what the states have been enacted laws for very aggressively. The most famous state for this type of topic is Illinois with their biometric regulation that they call BIPA, B-I-P-A. They’ve had over 1,400 lawsuits since 2019 suing the biggest companies in the world and companies paying out millions of dollars, because they just didn’t disclose properly. They didn’t say, “Here’s how we’re going to do it. Do I have your permission?” And they used it for a purpose that wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>So it’s really, if you do those two things, make sure you don’t have access. Then, when you do get access, make sure you don’t use it for unintended or undisclosed reasons. You keep yourself out of trouble in general. So we put together some guidance on this. It’s kind of a state-by-state breakdown of how the laws are today, how they’re evolving, some details on the lawsuits that have happened, because by seeing what people have been sued for, it can help you keep out of trouble. Right? I think everybody has to become educated on the topic as they embrace the technology, but there’s a lot of help we can provide along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So interesting. So to use biometrics in authentication, you can access the data, but you don’t need to control it. If you’re going to access the data, you want to make sure you get user consent, and then, at the end of the day, sounds like the user has ensured that user has sole control of their information. Sounds like a three-step process that maybe makes sense out of the approach to some of these security regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. That’s right. That’s right, and some states are even saying written consent. So that one term, what does that mean, written? You got to go look at the devil in the details of what they mean and maybe what the lawsuits are claiming. Written consent could be as simple as I check, “Yes. It’s okay.” Other times, it may be written. So maybe you avoid biometrics in that one state, which, of course, you can do. You can solve for the 90% and handle the 10% with some edge case solutions, like maybe, then, use an alternate form of authentication. But that’s right. That’s the two ways to get yourself out of trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. All right. Mike, thank you very much for your time today. This is evolving topic. We might have to come back and revisit it, but appreciate you spending a few minutes with me today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>My pleasure. Hope to see you soon.</p>

<p>MUNICH and LONDON – April 10, 2025 – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is evolving its role in the digital identity landscape, ushering in a new phase of growth centered around trust, security, and future-proofing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where Trust Powers Identity – this phrase encapsulates IDnow’s evolution from a European leader in automated and expert-led identity verification to a forward-thinking, future-proof digital identity ecosystem. This ecosystem not only verifies identities but continuously enriches them, setting a new benchmark for trust and security in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s transformation of its identity approach comes as a strategic response to the fragmented digital identity landscape and the rapidly evolving needs of companies. This evolution strengthens IDnow’s position as a trusted name in fraud prevention and digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rising complexity of global fraud and compliance challenges, industries’ demands go beyond traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) services. Today, true trust requires real-time fraud prevention at multiple touchpoints and as a result, identity verification becomes a proactive defense mechanism rather than a one-time regulatory obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trust is more than just an element of customer onboarding. Digital identities must remain secure and compliant in a constantly evolving market environment. Only then can they meet the demands of today’s digital landscape,” explains Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our new vision and strategic repositioning go far beyond traditional identity verification. We are creating an ecosystem where trust is embedded into every interaction, enabling businesses to gain a sustainable, competitive advantage in the global digital economy.”&nbsp;</p>



 Trust as the Foundation of Digital Identity&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow: Where Trust Powers Identity lays a strong foundation for the growth of the company. The key initiatives of this new mission include cementing business operations, streamlining processes, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for automation, and optimizing cost structures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in 2014, IDnow has evolved from a startup offering a revolutionary alternative to the PostIdent procedure into a global company. Its continuous adaptability and commitment to raising trust standards provide IDnow’s customers with a clear competitive advantage in the global digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



 A Central Platform for the Next Generation of Identity Verification&nbsp; 



<p>With AMLR and eIDAS 2.0 on the horizon, the digital identity landscape is becoming increasingly complex. In this context, IDnow is a one-stop shop, providing seamless access to electronic identities (eID), digital wallets, trust services, and all existing verification solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow plays a central role in the pan-European digital identity landscape. Its solutions simplify risk management, reduce regulatory complexity, and deliver customer-centric solutions. At the heart of this new vision, IDnow emerges as a key player in the next-generation identity verification ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Positioned for the future&nbsp; 



<p>With this new strategic direction, IDnow specifically addresses the evolving risks that business operating in the global digital economy face today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As cyberattacks grow in both frequency and sophistication, traditional security measures are often reactive and fail to provide the proactive defense needed. By prioritizing real-time fraud prevention and scalable security, IDnow is taking a forward-thinking approach to safeguarding businesses, ensuring that trust is embedded at every stage of the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s strategic shift allows companies to move from reactive to proactive security and implement a strong digital identity ecosystem. This approach, especially in highly regulated industries, creates crucial advantages while simultaneously optimizing the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A paradigm shift is taking place in the digital identity landscape: moving away from one-time verification towards a continuous security process,” summarizes Bodczek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IDnow is a leading expert in fraud prevention. With our new vision and strategic repositioning, we are redefining what it means to be a leader in digital identity. We are creating a scalable, intelligent trust framework that future-proofs businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He concludes: “We help businesses stay one step ahead of tomorrow’s threats. The comprehensive suite of products in our ecosystem means our customers will benefit from seamless identity verification, real-time fraud protection, and continuous compliance, all while enhancing user experiences and conversion rates.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital-first economy, the financial services industry sits at the intersection of convenience, trust, and risk. The rapid acceleration of digital transformation has unlocked new opportunities for personalized services, frictionless experiences, and global connectivity. However, this shift has also broadened the attack surface for cybercriminals, placing digital identities at the center of a growing crisis. Fraud, identity theft, unauthorized access, and advanced AI-driven deepfake attacks have created significant vulnerabilities that financial service providers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For financial institutions, protecting digital identities is no longer just a cyber-security problem – it’s a strategic imperative. Secure and converged identity and access management (IAM) is critical to safeguarding customer trust, meeting evolving regulatory requirements, and preventing financial and reputational losses. A single breach can cost millions and irreparably damage trust. In fact, 80%1 of financial service organizations have experienced data breaches due to weak authentication, with each incident costing an average of $2 million.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore the threats to digital identities in financial services and outline the key strategies financial service providers can adopt to protect customer, workforce, and B2B identities.</p>

<p>The role of Chief Information Officer involves managing everything from networking and IT to data systems and cybersecurity, all while technology continues evolving.</p><p>State CIOs are responsible for securing government networks, reams of public data, and public benefits systems, at a moment when advanced state actors have become increasingly aggressive and subtle. Hacking and phishing now regularly impact even <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FY23-FISMA-Report.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Federal government systems</a>, and state CIOs are expected to fend them off on a public-sector budget. This comes after the COVID-19 pandemic released a broad surge of attacks against benefits systems, such as unemployment assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>These conditions have led to accelerating turnover: nearly half of all state CIOs have been new to the role since 2022, and the median length of a state CIO’s term has declined from 30 months to 23 months over the same period, <a href="https://www.nascio.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Deloitte-NASCIO_Cybersecurity-Study_20024.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">according to a recent study</a> by Deloitte and the National Association for State CIOs.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is there’s a powerful new tool on the CIO’s side that can reliably confirm identities online: <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">verifiable digital credentials</a>.</p><p>Read More: SpruceID’s in-depth <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> Digital Identity: A Foundational Layer for Security and Privacy <p>The challenges facing state CIOs can be divided into three categories: ensuring accurate identity on state systems, protecting citizen privacy, and securing government networks.</p><p>Trustworthy digital identity has many benefits, but above all, it has become arguably the most important factor in cybersecurity. According to Crowdstrike, more cyberattacks now rely on <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">the theft of valid identity credentials</a> to compromise systems than malware.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable digital credentials are designed to mitigate these threats at their root. The cryptographic signature that validates a VDC is embedded in the phone’s secure element—a hardware-based vault specifically built to resist tampering. Extracting it is not just extremely difficult and costly; it’s practically infeasible with today’s technology. And even in the unlikely event of compromise, the credential is cryptographically bound to the device, rendering it useless anywhere else.</p><p>Identity fraud of a different sort can undermine state unemployment insurance programs or other benefits. Improper state UI payments, including fraudulent payments, ranged <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/unemployment-insurance-payment-accuracy?ref=blog.spruceid.com#NC">from 7% to as high as 25%</a> from July 2021 to June 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. </p><p>Much of this is enabled because of the transition to online services, where stolen or “synthetic” identities can pass through some systems undetected. Identity credentials built for digital trust, such as the Mobile Driver’s License (mDL), can reliably prove a holder’s identity and residency over the internet, presenting one path to mitigating fraudulent claims.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, digital identity can increase the privacy of state residents by reducing the amount of data being transmitted, thanks to a mechanism known as <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selective disclosure</a>. That means mDL adoption can prevent state agencies from becoming unwitting <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/data-hoarding/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">data hoarders</a>. This creates an even more virtuous cycle because less identity data is available to steal, which means hackers have less raw material for impersonating real people.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Privacy-protecting identity verification</a></p> Digital Credentials for Next-Generation Access Control <p>The goal of most network compromises and phishing attacks is to steal data that can be used in other malicious ways. Usually, that’s personal data that can be used for identity theft – and a state’s records are something like a hacker’s Holy Grail. That’s why CIOs <a href="https://www.nascio.org/resource-center/resources/2024-deloitte-nascio-cybersecurity-study/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">polled by NASCIO in 2024</a> said their second-highest priority was preventing bad actors from accessing data-rich systems.</p><p>A big part of the problem is that state intranets managing this data still often rely on password-centric identity and access control. This makes them vulnerable to phishing – manipulative “social engineering” that tricks humans into entering a password or other data into a fake portal, handing them over to an attacker. Those attacks have been massively accelerated by the availability of generative AI, which enables <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/ai-generated-phishing-emails-are-getting-very-good-at-targeting-executives/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">massive scale and “hyper-personalization”</a> that make phishing more effective.</p><p>As with public-facing applications, VDCs have the potential to massively undercut phishing attacks on state workers and systems by replacing passwords and other “knowledge-based” access controls with <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">cryptographic signatures</a>. The use of digital credentials for log-on and access control is still nascent but could either leverage public VDCs like mobile driver’s licenses or use different employee credentials issued by agencies or departments.</p> Large Scale, Low Cost <p>Device-tied access control systems are nothing new, of course – random-number keyfobs and similar solutions have been widespread in defense and other sensitive settings for decades. The deeper advantage of VDCs is that they can provide similar assurances at a much, much lower per-user issuance cost.</p><p>First, that’s because VDCs don’t require additional specialized hardware, instead leveraging the smartphones that state workers already have. Second, a mobile driver’s license issued by your state’s DMV will be sufficient added security for many roles, and those will come at little or no added cost to state offices.</p><p>Before long, new state employees will simply arrive on their first day with digital credentials in hand. Nearly 6 million Americans already have mobile driver’s licenses, early adoption driven by the simple convenience of leaving behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/personaltech/mobile-wallet-app.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">an old-school paper-stuffed wallet</a>. Those first 6 million adopters are from about a dozen U.S. states that already have mDL programs up and running, and the number stands to skyrocket as more states come online.&nbsp;</p> Interoperability Without Lock-In <p>The open, interoperable, and standards-based nature of VDCs has other advantages compared to older purpose-built identity systems. Much like the World Wide Web can be read through many different browsers, a growing ecosystem of vendors can provision VDCs to the same standard. That competition will help keep costs down, whether for issuing more specialized credentials or building the front-end systems to accept and validate VDCs.</p><p>Maybe even more important, though, is that an open-source system prevents vendor lock-in. Whether credential issuance or systems-level work, the basic plumbing of VDCs is universal and interoperable. If anything goes wrong with one vendor, another team can easily pick up the ball and run with it. Signing up for the added security of digital credentials doesn’t mean being dependent long-term on any specific team.</p><p>Now is the time to start thinking about the potential for digital credentials in your state’s cybersecurity stance.

 IDnow is evolving from a pioneering video identification provider into a leader in digital identity trust. Here, we explain why. 



<p>In today’s hyper-connected, digital-first world, trust is no longer a luxury – it’s a necessity. Identity is the cornerstone of all online interactions, transactions and relationships. But in an era where digital identities are fragmented, evolving and increasingly under threat, how can businesses create a trust ecosystem that is both secure and scalable?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our transformation into a leader in digital identity trust reflects our deep commitment to meeting the ever-growing demand for robust, adaptive and intelligent trust solutions in a rapidly changing landscape.</p>



 Why trust needs to power identity. 



<p>In the past, identity verification was often seen as a one-time check – a necessary but static process. Today, it’s no longer enough to simply verify someone’s identity at the point of entry. With evolving threats, increased regulatory pressures and the constant need for frictionless customer experiences, trust must be continuous, dynamic and scalable. This shift in perspective is not just a response to market demand; it’s a recognition that businesses that embrace trust as a cornerstone of their identity systems will not only survive — they will thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the amount lost to fraud scams and brank fraud scams totalled <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/financial-crime-is-crippling-the-global-economy-breakthrough-identity-tech-is-leading-the-fightback">$485 billion</a>, highlighting the urgent need for real-time fraud prevention and continuous trust management. Fraud risks are not just threats to business revenue — they undermine consumer confidence, erode brand integrity and disrupt long-term relationships. This is why we believe that trust must power identity throughout the customer journey, from onboarding to every subsequent interaction.</p>



 A new approach: Continuous, scalable and intelligent trust. 



<p>As the market evolves, businesses today require more than just verification — they demand continuous, scalable and intelligent trust solutions that are agile enough to meet regulatory changes, combat emerging fraud risks and elevate customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our mission at IDnow is clear: we are not just a service provider; we are a trusted orchestrator of identity solutions. Our AI-driven, SaaS-based platform enables businesses to confidently navigate the complexities of the digital world. Whether it’s seamless identity verification, real-time fraud prevention, or adaptive compliance, we ensure that trust is integrated into every transaction, every interaction, every moment.</p>

 Trust in action: A competitive advantage. 



<p>The demand for frictionless identity verification has never been higher. Customers expect fast, effortless experiences without compromising security. Yet, in today’s digital economy, businesses cannot afford to overlook security for the sake of convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where trust becomes a competitive advantage. Without it, customers will look elsewhere. In fact, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/improving-account-opening-process-in-retail-banking.html?icid=dcom_promo_standard%7Cus;en">Deloitte, 38% of new customers</a> are prepared to abandon the account opening stage if the process takes too long. &nbsp;</p>



<p>By embedding trust into every interaction, businesses not only improve conversions and enhance customer loyalty — they protect their operations from evolving threats, stay ahead of regulatory pressures and foster long-term relationships built on confidence. Trust is no longer a “nice-to-have”; it is a key differentiator in a crowded marketplace.</p>



 IDnow: The gateway to a secure digital trust ecosystem. 



<p>As EU’s new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/eidas-2-0-simple-update-fundamental-change/">eIDAS 2.0</a> continue to reshape the digital identity landscape, businesses face increasing complexity. The digital identity ecosystem is fragmented, with a myriad of platforms, devices and services that make it challenging for organizations to keep up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow is the key to unlocking a secure digital trust ecosystem. Our platform provides seamless access to eIDs, digital wallets, Trust Services, and verification solutions — all backed by cutting-edge, real-time risk intelligence. With IDnow, businesses can simplify complex risk management, combat fraud with precision and stay ahead of regulatory complexity, all while delivering trusted, customer-centric experiences that are designed to scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This holistic approach ensures that businesses are equipped not only to meet current demands but to adapt to the future of digital commerce — where security, compliance and customer trust are paramount.</p>



 The next level of KYC: Beyond verification. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> used to be the standard for verifying identities. But in today’s fast-paced, digital-first environment, it is no longer enough. It’s not just about confirming a customer’s identity once — it’s about continuously validating trust throughout the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With IDnow, businesses gain real-time fraud prevention capabilities that go beyond traditional KYC processes. From detecting synthetic identities and deepfakes to monitoring behavior and transaction patterns in real time, our platform provides continuous trust monitoring that adapts to emerging fraud risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our AI-powered risk intelligence doesn’t just stop at onboarding — it continuously analyzes behavioral and transactional signals to identify potential fraud threats, such as APP scams and money mule activity. This ongoing vigilance ensures that trust is never static but rather needs to evolve to meet the changing landscape of digital threats.</p>



 Building a resilient future with trust. 



<p>In an increasingly fragmented digital identity landscape, businesses that prioritize trust will always have an edge. Trust is no longer just about preventing fraud; it’s about building resilient, long-term relationships that allow businesses to adapt and grow in the face of new challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow equips businesses with the tools to not only mitigate risks but to thrive in a world where trust is the ultimate differentiator. As we look ahead to the future of digital identity, one thing is clear: trust will power every successful business strategy, every seamless transaction and every lasting customer relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we are proud to lead the way in shaping the future of digital identity. Together, we can build a world where trust isn’t just a goal — it’s the foundation of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>

 Protecting Digital Identity in the Web3 Era 



<p>Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack strikes. Ransomware drains billions, while stolen identities fuel a $3 trillion shadow economy. Yet, our defenses—passwords, centralized databases—remain stuck in the past. Web3 changes the game with&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials (VCs)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), tools that put control back in users’ hands. No more single points of failure. No more endless data leaks. This isn’t just security—it’s digital sovereignty. In this article, discover how <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">VCs </a>and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="DIDs ">DIDs </a>are slashing fraud, simplifying compliance, and safeguarding industries from healthcare to finance. </p>



<p>Plus, see how Extrimian’s plug-and-play solutions help organizations ditch outdated systems and embrace self-sovereign identity—today. Ready to turn vulnerability into strength? Let’s begin.</p>



Essential Cybersecurity Tips&nbsp;for digital data



 



 1: The Current Crisis in Digital Identity and Cybersecurity Risks 



 Data Breaches and Their Economic Impact 



<p>In 2023, the average cost of a data breach soared to a staggering $4.45 million, a 15% increase over three years, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report. These breaches aren’t just about stolen credit cards—they erode customer trust, trigger regulatory fines, and cripple business operations. For instance, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted fuel supply across the U.S. East Coast, costing millions in recovery and reputational damage.</p>



 The Limitations of Traditional Centralized Systems 



<p>Centralized identity systems—like passwords and government-issued IDs—are inherently fragile. They create single points of failure. When a major credit bureau was hacked in 2017, it exposed the Social Security numbers of 147 million people. Why? Because centralized databases are goldmines for hackers. Worse, users have no control over how their data is stored or shared.</p>



<p>The digital identity crisis isn’t slowing down. Hackers exploit outdated systems, while users juggle dozens of easily guessable passwords. But what if there were a way to eliminate centralized databases entirely? Enter decentralized identity solutions, which shift control back to users and organizations. By 2026, Gartner predicts that 30% of enterprises will adopt decentralized identity tools to mitigate these risks. The question isn’t if your organization should transition—it’s when.</p>



 



 2: What Are Verifiable Credentials and Why Are They Essential for Web3? 



 Technical Definition and Components 



<p><br>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital proofs—like diplomas, licenses, or certifications—that are cryptographically secured. They consist of three roles:</p>



 
 Issuer (e.g., a university granting a degree). 



 Holder (e.g., a job seeker storing the credential in a digital wallet). 



 Verifier (e.g., an employer validating the degree’s authenticity). 
 



 How Issuing and Verification Processes Work 



<p>Imagine a hospital issuing a nurse’s license as a VC. The credential is signed with the hospital’s private key and stored in the nurse’s wallet. When applying for a job, the nurse shares only the credential—not their Social Security number or address. The employer verifies it instantly via blockchain, ensuring it’s unaltered and legit.</p>



<p>VCs are game-changers for Web3. They’re interoperable (usable across platforms), portable (controlled by the user), and tamper-proof. For example, Extrimian’s VC platform helped a European healthcare network cut credential fraud by 90% by replacing paper-based records with blockchain-anchored digital licenses. In a world drowning in fake diplomas and deepfakes, VCs are the antidote.</p>



 



 3: DIDs: The Foundation of Decentralized Identity (SSI) 



 What Are Decentralized Identifiers? 



<p> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are user-owned, blockchain-based IDs that act as the backbone of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Unlike email addresses or usernames, DIDs aren’t tied to corporations or governments. Think of them as self-owned digital passports—no third party can revoke or censor them.</p>



<p>DIDs vs. Traditional Identifiers</p>



Traditional IDsDIDsControlled by issuers (e.g., Google)Owned by the userProne to data leaksEncrypted and decentralizedRequire constant reauthenticationPersistent and reusable



<p>Extrimian leverages W3C-standard DIDs, enabling seamless integration with platforms like Algorand for lightning-fast verification. A DID might look like did:algorand:123xyz, resolvable via blockchain to confirm its authenticity. This eliminates reliance on vulnerable central authorities—a leap toward true digital sovereignty.</p>



 



 4: Combining Verifiable Credentials and DIDs: A Shield Against Cyberattacks 



 Combatting Phishing and Identity Spoofing 



<p>Phishing attacks account for 36% of data breaches. But with VCs and DIDs, users prove their identity without revealing sensitive data. For example, logging into a bank app with a DID-linked VC means no passwords to steal. Even if a hacker intercepts the credential, it’s cryptographically useless without the user’s private key.</p>



 Reducing Attack Surfaces with Encryption 



<p>VCs use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), allowing users to share only necessary information. Need to confirm you’re over 21? A VC can prove your age without disclosing your birthdate. Extrimian’s solutions employ quantum-resistant encryption, ensuring credentials remain secure even against future threats.</p>



<p>Picture a supply chain where every supplier’s license is a VC tied to a DID. Tampering becomes impossible, and audits take minutes instead of weeks. After adopting Extrimian’s framework, a logistics firm reduced compliance costs by 40% and breach-related downtime by 75%.</p>



 



 5: Business Benefits Beyond Cybersecurity 



 Cost Savings in Identity Management 



<p>Manual identity checks drain resources. A Fortune 500 company reported spending $3 million annually on password resets alone. With Extrimian’s automated VC issuance, businesses slash IT costs by up to 60% and accelerate onboarding.</p>



 Compliance and Brand Reputation 



<p>GDPR fines hit €1.6 billion in 2023. VCs simplify compliance by design—data is minimalized and user-consent-driven. A fintech client using Extrimian achieved eIDAS compliance in 3 months, boosting customer trust and EU market access.</p>



<p>Beyond savings, VCs future-proof your business. A Forrester study found SSI adopters see 200% ROI within two years through fraud reduction and operational efficiency.</p>



 



 6: Success Stories: Universities, Banking, and Governments 



 Tamper-Proof Academic Credentials 



<p>MIT now issues digital diplomas as VCs. Graduates share them instantly with employers, eliminating verification delays. Fraudulent claims dropped to zero.</p>



 Secure Financial Transactions 



<p>Spain’s Basque Government uses Extrimian for citizen IDs, enabling secure access to 200+ services via a single VC wallet. Voter fraud? Practically eradicated.</p>



<p>A Nordic bank deployed Extrimian’s DID-based KYC system. Result? A 70% drop in account takeover fraud and 50% faster customer onboarding.</p>

<p>The open standards development process, whether at the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/process/">IETF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/">W3C</a>, or <a href="https://openid.net/policies/">OpenID Foundation</a>, has always been a balancing act. While politics inevitably plays a role (where there are people, there are politics), technology has historically held at least an equal seat at the table.</p>



<p>At least, it did.</p>



<p>With shifting geopolitical priorities and radical changes in the U.S. federal government, open standards organizations are increasingly viewed through the lens of tech sovereignty. Governments are asking:</p>



 
 Who is participating in standards development organizations (SDOs)? 



 Do certain entities have disproportionate influence? 



 Where are these organizations based, and whose culture shapes their work? 
 



<p>If the answers boil down to “Big Tech companies, largely U.S.-based, with an outsized impact,” then the technical standard itself becomes secondary. It’s not just about what’s in the spec. It’s about who wrote it. In some cases, that’s enough to render a standard unacceptable, regardless of its technical merit.</p>



 When Open Participation Isn’t Enough 



<p>Open standards bodies pride themselves on transparency and broad participation. In theory, anyone can contribute; maybe not vote (if voting even happens), but certainly comment, influence, and propose text. Yet that openness isn’t always seen as sufficient. The sentiment seems to be:</p>



<p>“Better to use a suboptimal standard that aligns with national interests than adopt something Those People created.”</p>



<p>If that sounds frustrating, it is. It’s also a stark example of why we can’t have nice things.</p>



 The Shifting Landscape of Standards Development 



<p>This growing concern over control and influence raises serious questions:</p>



 
 What happens to global interoperability if standards development fragments along geopolitical lines? 



 Will the most impactful standards shift to treaty-based SDOs, where geopolitical compromise often takes precedence over technical rigor? 



 Will national standards bodies step in, forcing vendors to adapt to country-specific requirements? 
 



<p>One example stands out: the Digital Credentials API (DC-API).</p>



 The Digital Credentials API: A Case Study in Standards Politics 



<p>On April 23, 2025, I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hlflanagan_digitalcredentials-activity-7299501972565471232-yMqs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAezwAB2XSOIfPk0uSIUxiyRZ9UraWiMrg">posted on LinkedIn </a>about a major development: the formal objection blocking the DC-API from progressing in the W3C had been <a href="https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html">overturned</a>. The responses to that post were fascinating and mildly terrifying.</p>



<p>Some saw the DC-API as a valuable tool for the EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI ARF</a>). Others argued that it was a mistake to allow the spec into anything the EU depends on. Further discussion resulted in the following (paraphrased):</p>



<p>“There’s nothing technically wrong with the spec itself—it’s about who wrote it.”</p>



<p>That’s a tough pill to swallow. If standards adoption hinges more on perceived authorship than technical quality, what does that mean for the future of open standards?</p>



 What Comes Next? 



<p>We’re witnessing a restructuring of how SDOs engage with the world. Will we see:</p>



 
 A shift toward EU-led standardization? They are doing some pretty cool stuff. 



 Treaty-based SDOs taking the lead? They already have the mechanisms in place for international government support. 



 A patchwork of national standards forcing enterprises to navigate an even more complex compliance landscape? It’s a lovely, short-sighted ‘win’ for national tech sovereignty.  
 



<p>I could make a strong case for the open standards model. Transparent processes, broad participation, and high technical quality should count for something. But I also understand why governments want to protect their interests—especially when U.S. politics seem increasingly volatile.</p>



<p>A middle ground would be nice. But before we get there, things are likely to get a lot messier.</p>



 Don’t Wait for Regulation to Decide for You 



<p>It’s tempting to sit back and wait for regulation to dictate which standards to follow. But that approach comes with real risks. Standards shaped solely by geopolitical negotiation—rather than technical expertise—are unlikely to serve enterprises, developers, or end users well.</p>



<p>If your company relies on interoperability, global reach, or future-proofing your technology investments, now is not the time to disengage from standards work. Instead:</p>



 
 Stay involved in open standards organizations—even if the process feels frustrating or slow. 



 Engage with policymakers to help them understand the real-world impact of their decisions. 



 Support industry collaboration to bridge gaps between regulatory needs and technical feasibility. 
 



<p>The future of global standards is still being written. The question is: who will be holding the pen?</p>



<p>Need Help Navigating This Shift? I spend a lot of time helping companies track standards developments, understand emerging regulatory trends, and figure out where they can (and should) engage.
