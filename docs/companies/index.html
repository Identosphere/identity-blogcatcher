<p><a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a> has released a new continuous authentication solution designed to stop malicious actors that try to take advantage of a company computer. The ActiveLock authenticates users with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/typingdna-explains-what-goes-into-biometric-typing-pattern-050405/">typing biometrics</a>, and can automatically lock down a machine if an unauthorized user sits down at the keyboard.</p>



  



<p>According to TypingDNA, ActiveLock will help cut down on insider threats to enterprise organizations. Such threats are up more than 50 percent in the past year, with each incident carrying an average price tag of $13.3 million. Some of those incidents are the result of deliberate malfeasance, while others are the result of negligence when an authorized user leaves their device unlocked and unattended.</p>



<p>ActiveLock can guard against both kinds of threats. Like <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/typingdna-replaces-sms-codes-with-typing-biometrics-032304/">other TypingDNA products</a>, ActiveLock analyzes keystroke patterns to build a typing profile of a user. It then runs in the background to passively confirm that person’s identity throughout the entire session. If an unauthorized user tries to access the device, ActiveLock can immediately step in to lock the computer, or it can send out a silent alarm to system administrators to trigger a follow-up investigation.</p>



<p>TypingDNA believes that ActiveLock is ideal for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/entrust-survey-shows-growing-support-hybrid-work-model-wake-covid-19-090107/">remote and hybrid work environments</a>, especially since many people leave their devices unattended while working in coffee shops or other public settings. In that regard, ActiveLock delivers a high level of security without forcing people to re-enter login information several times over the course of the day.</p>



<p>ActiveLock is compatible with both Windows and macOS devices, and can be integrated with existing software or deployed as a standalone security solution. The solution does not gather any personal identifying information, and instead looks only at typing patterns, and not at the actual words being punched into the computer. As a result, ActiveLock is able to verify people’s identities while still respecting user privacy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.daon.com/">Daon</a> is trying to make it easier for organizations to take advantage of its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-daon-upgrades-identityx-digital-onboarding-platform-072305/">IdentityX onboarding and authentication platform</a>. To that end, Daon has released an improved version of the platform that can be deployed as a web app with minimal coding requirements.</p>



  



<p>The new solution is geared toward organizations that do not want to dedicate the time and resources they would need to integrate IdentityX into their own native apps using Daon’s SDKs. The low/no code version of the platform is built to be an out-of-the-box solution that can be set up in a matter of hours, while still giving clients the ability to configure the platform with brand logos and custom workflows at a later time.</p>



<p>“We’re always searching for new ways to bring the unrivaled power and data transparency of our IdentityX platform to new customers with the least amount of integration overhead and the shortest time-to-market,” said&nbsp;Daon Americas President Conor White. “We’re driven to empower our customers on their own terms, which means making our most powerful capabilities fully available in any deployment configuration that suits customers’ needs.”</p>



<p>According to Daon, the enhanced platform will reduce an organization’s administrative costs, both because it requires less development time and because all of the data is hosted in Daon’s cloud (rather than internally). Daon already processes hundreds of millions of transactions on a daily basis, which ensures that the platform can scale to meet the needs of any enterprise.</p>



<p>Organizations that do adopt the new offering will have access to more data, and the ability to set their own identity priorities. The solution can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and can provide coverage for desktop and mobile devices, and for both app and browser channels. In that regard, Daon’s solution uses face and document recognition to match a selfie to the image on a photo ID. End users only need to register once, and their information can be used to enable biometric authentication in any corporate channel.</p>



<p>Daon has spent much of the past year <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/daon-passes-200000-users-verifly-immunity-credential-app-022603/">promoting its VeriFLY app</a>, which gives people the ability to upload and share <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/verifly-lets-users-upload-vaccine-credentials/">vaccine and COVID-19 test credentials</a> when they travel. The company also optimized <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/daon-adapts-identityx-biometric-tech-to-forgerock-identity-platform-905141/">IdentityX for the ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> back in 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel</a> to show consumers what the retail experience might look like in the future. The collaboration specifically focuses on supermarkets and convenience stores, though it has implications for any segment that wants to take advantage of the latest innovations in big data.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, VSBLTY is specifically releasing its new <a href="https://storeasamedium.com/">Store as a Medium</a> program through a Store as a Medium app run by Intel and The Store-WPP. The app is a free download available for iOS and Android devices, and exists as a metaverse project that highlights some of the ways that retailers can use modern technology to build more meaningful relationships with their customers. They can also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-provides-customer-analytics-bianchi-vending-machines-102101/">gather data from their customers</a> to learn more about their target market, and then use that information to make strategy changes that will increase sales and make their operations more efficient.</p>



<p>The launch of the Store as a Medium app will coincide with the release of a white paper of the same name at the National Retail Federation Conference. The white paper argues that retailers should be moving to capitalize on emerging retail network opportunities, a topic that will be discussed in greater detail during a roundtable discussion on February 10. The panel will feature contributors to the white paper, with representatives from The Store-WPP, VSBLTY and Intel joining colleagues from WestRock, Lenovo, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, amongst several others.</p>



<p>“We have been working worldwide with joint venture partners uniquely qualified to play a role in helping transform and monetize the Store as a Medium with retailers and brands,” said VSBLTY CEO Jay Hutton. “The SaaM is where the internet of things meets media advertising, machine learning and big data analytics. Even ‘Mom &amp; Pop’ stores can profit from SaaM.”</p>



<p>VSBLTY has previously provided smart retail and analytic technology for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-modelo-move-forward-with-smart-retail-network-latin-america-031501/">convenience stores in Mexico</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-vsblty-provides-smart-retail-tech-for-south-african-convenience-stores-908101/">South Africa</a>. The company also formed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-targets-global-retailers-through-new-partnership-ust-global-042408/">strategic partnership with UST Global</a> in 2020 to extend its reach with international retailers.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/survey-governments-biometrics-501199/"></a> 



<p>Toronto-based password management firm <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> has reached a $6.8 billion valuation after one of the biggest funding rounds in the history of the digital security industry.</p>



<p>The $620 million Series C funding round was led by Iconiq Growth and featured contributions from Accel, Lightspeed Ventures, and Tiger Global. It also saw the participation of A-list Hollywood celebrities including Ryan Reynolds, Robert Downey Jr., and Scarlett Johansson.</p>



<p>It’s a flashy group of supporters for tech company focused on an old and archaic security tool. But 1Password seeks to revamp password-based security through a platform that lets end users store complex passwords behind a single master key, helping to combat the endemic issues of the use of simple passwords vulnerable to brute force attacks, and the reuse of the same password across multiple sites and apps.</p>



<p>1Password also distinguishes itself with a focus on enterprise security, enabling corporate IT managers to see which apps employees download without permission, and to lock them out of digital assets after they depart the company.</p>



<p>And 1Password isn’t exclusively about password-based security. Like <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/password-manager-nordpass-extends-support-biometric-authentication-121007/">other password manager platforms</a>, 1Password has increasingly integrated support for biometric authentication. It has supported fingerprint-based authentication on iOS and Android devices for years, and enabled Face Unlock support on the Google Pixel in 2019. More recently, 1Password enabled <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/1password-brings-biometric-authentication-desktop-computers-052807/">biometric authentication for desktop users</a>.</p>



<p>The support for biometric authentication would seem to be an acknowledgement of its heightened security and convenience for end users, but the technology also appears to be the source of an uneasy tension in 1Password’s value proposition. Speaking to CNBC about the company’s latest funding round, CEO Jeff Shiner suggested that biometrics are not always as secure as passwords, asserting, “If anybody ever got a copy of your fingerprint or your face, you can’t change that.”</p>



<p>The objection of biometrics’ irrefutability has been addressed by many identity specialists through the development and deployment of sophisticated liveness detection technology, which can tell the difference between a genuine fingerprint or face and a spoof artefact created from stolen biometric data. The topic was recently discussed in the audience Q&amp;A section of the recent webinar “<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-frictionless-access-control-712169/">10 Reasons to Switch to Frictionless Access Control</a>,” which is available to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-frictionless-access-control-712169/">watch on-demand</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a message that undercuts 1Password’s growing support for biometric authentication. But 1Password is growing itself, with Shiner saying the company plans to double its workforce this year; and the password manager’s stature in digital security is likely to rise alongside growing enthusiasm for biometric authentication, which means 1Password’s management will be compelled to find a way to resolve the tension between passwords and biometric security going forward.</p>

To that end, the company has formed a new partnership with Emphor Trading LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based security specialist that has agreed to market Princeton’s face and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/princeton-identity-iris-recognition-patents-908224/">iris recognition technology</a> to potential clients in 25 countries throughout the region.</p>



  



<p>Emphor operates as a division of ScreenCheck, which is itself a subsidiary of the UAE’s broader Centena Group. The company acts as both a distributor and installer of security technology, and can work with a client to deliver a custom security system that is fully integrated with that organization’s existing infrastructure. The full Emphor portfolio includes ID cards, surveillance, attendance, and access control solutions, all of which have been provided to clients in sectors ranging from government and education to retail, oil, and manufacturing.</p>



<p>Princeton’s solutions, meanwhile, are designed to support contactless access control. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/princeton-identity-iris-face-terminal-503123/">company’s terminals</a> verify someone’s identity with face and iris biometrics, both of which negate the need for traditional authenticators like PIN codes or cards. Princeton’s entire line of biometric identity solutions will be available through the Emphor partnership.</p>



<p>“Partnership with Princeton Identity is part of our commitment to our customers for the continuous delivery of enhanced security solutions from our portfolio,” said ScreenCheck COO Shaji Abdul. “We are confident that PI’s global track record in implementing high-end biometric security solutions will benefit government and large corporate customers in the UAE.”</p>



<p>“Emphor Trading’s elite clientele require their security installations to meet the most stringent standards for reliability, accuracy, and convenience, and we’re pleased to create technology that exceeds this high threshold,” added Princeton President Bobby Varma.</p>



<p>Princeton’s technology can be used for both physical and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/princeton-integrates-biometric-tech-into-epams-corporate-cybersecurity-platform-080906/">digital access control</a>. The company’s iris recognition technology has also been integrated into <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/future-trend-integrates-princetons-iris-tech-into-biometric-hr-platform-030410/">Future Trend’s time and attendance management solution</a>.</p>

 Spherity is Partnering with Legisym Offering Joint Compliance Product for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.  Legisym, LLC is a trusted expert in the U.S. Life Sciences Market, providing services to pharmaceutical companies around the world since&nbsp;2009 <p>Legisym and Spherity have worked closely together to bring to maturity a joint offering that meets the security requirements of the U.S. Life Sciences Market. As part of the joint development, both companies have collaborated with SAP and Novartis, which have already subjected the product to extensive quality testing and functional validation. Spherity and Legisym are pleased to officially announce their partnership as of&nbsp;today.</p>Spherity is partnering with Legisym offering a joint compliance product, Credentialing Service, for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.<p>In November 2013, the U.S. congress enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in order to protect patients’ health. To ensure that only legitimate actors are part of the supply chain, the regulation requires U.S. pharmaceutical trading partners to ensure that they only interact with other trading partners that are authorized. Authorized is every trading partner holding a valid state-issued license or a current registration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Today in 2022, U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors have no interoperable, electronic mechanism to validate each other´s authorized status. With more than 60,000 interacting trading partners involved in the U.S. Life Sciences Industry and a FDA recommendation to respond to data requests in under one minute, a solution that provides compliance with the regulations by 2023 is in high demand. Legisym and Spherity have decided to cooperate and offer an interoperable highly secure service to enable pharmaceutical supply chain actors to become an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) according to U.S.&nbsp;DSCSA.</p><p>Legisym, as a trusted identity and license verification service provider, perfectly complements Spherity’s digital wallet technology for managing verifiable credentials. The verifiable credential technology is used to represent the authorized status of interacting trading partners in an highly efficient, secure and DSCSA-compliant way. To use credentialing for Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) requirements under DSCSA, trading partners need to go through a one-time due diligence onboarding process with Legisym. Once the verifiable credentials are issued, they are stored in a secure digital wallet which comes embedded with the Credentialing Service provided by Spherity. Using this technology enables U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors to interact with digital trust, as they now can digitally verify their ATP status in every interaction.</p><p>Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity says, “together with our partner Legisym we focused on making the adoption of credentialing for trading partners as simple as possible. Manufacturers, wholesalers and dispensers can all acquire a digital wallet and ATP credentials within minutes without integration effort and use this innovative solution for DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>“Legisym is thrilled to be working alongside Spherity to bring the first production-level ATP Credentialing solution to the industry,” said Legisym President &amp; Co-Owner David Kessler. “With the successful completion of the ATP Credentialing Pilot in 2020 and the joint founding of the Open Credentialing Initiative in early 2021, the Spherity-Legisym partnership is already proving successful in collaboration and forward thinking.”</p><p>Legisym and Spherity founded along with other adopters, the <a href="http://oc-i.org">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI). This newly formed organization incubates and standardizes the architecture using Digital Wallets and Verifiable Credentials for DSCSA compliance for Authorized Trading Partner requirements. Besides U.S pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and dispensers, the OCI is open for solution providers integrating the ATP solution.</p><p>For press relations, contact <a href="mailto:communication@spherity.com">communication@spherity.com</a>.

In early 2020, driven by the 2023 authorized trading partner (ATP) requirements, Legisym began leveraging their existing Controlled Substance Ordering System (CSOS) and license verification technologies and experience, to engage as a credential issuer. By performing thorough credential issuer due diligence processes, first to establish a root of trust, Legisym promotes confidence in the trading partner’s digital identity prior to the issuance of all ATP credentials.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is a German software provider bringing secure and decentralized identity management solutions to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms.

<p>The government of Ethiopia is launching a new National ID Program (NIDP) in collaboration with <a href="https://imageware.io/">TECH5</a>. The Fayida Identity Management System (IDMS) is now entering a limited pilot phase, during which TECH5 and NIDP Ethiopia will gather biometric information and issue digital IDs to participating citizens.</p>



  



<p>The program is based on the open-source MOSIP platform, and takes advantage of a number of different TECH5 solutions. During the pilot, Ethiopian authorities will collect face, fingerprint, and iris biometrics, and then use <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-lauches-biometric-fingerprint-sdk-following-strong-performance-nist-testing-121708/">TECH5’s biometric SDKs</a> to assess the quality of each image. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-brings-biometric-tech-mosips-open-source-id-platform-082205/">government will also use the T5-ABIS</a> to make sure that there are no duplicates in Ethiopia’s National ID database.</p>



<p>Finally, the T5-IDencode solution has been integrated with MOSIP to allow the government to generate and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-invites-partners-trial-digital-id-solution-092105/">issue Digital IDs</a> to citizens once the registration process is complete. Those digital IDs can be printed or stored electronically on a standard smartphone, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/tech5-unveils-covid-19-immunity-credential-020407/">verified with a smartphone app</a> in both online and offline situations. As a result, the IDs can be used as proof of identity (or proof of age) in settings that have traditionally required a physical ID card.</p>



<p>Participants will need to provide basic demographic information (such as name and birth date) when their biometric information is collected. That data will be stored in Ethiopia’s National ID database, though officials stressed that they only collect the information they need to confirm someone’s identity, and that citizens retain full ownership of their personal information. In that regard, the NIDP Program is based on principles of data privacy, minimization, and consent.</p>



<p>“This entire program is aimed at creating and implementing a Foundational Digital ID system for Ethiopia at the national level, the culmination of which results in the enrollment of millions of consenting individuals as part of national priority use-cases in the banking, insurance, education, residential and other sectors,” said NID Executive Director Yodahe Zemichael.</p>



<p>TECH5 fully <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-increases-support-mosip-identity-program-090905/">integrated T5-IDencode with MOSIP</a> in September to better support countries looking to move forward with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/guinea-uses-mosip-tech5-technology-new-national-id-program-062207/">Nati</a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/guinea-uses-mosip-tech5-technology-new-national-id-program-062207/">o</a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/guinea-uses-mosip-tech5-technology-new-national-id-program-062207/">nal ID programs</a>. The Ethiopian program has been trying to develop its own custom MOSIP solution for more than a year.</p>

<p>A credential comprises one or more claims made by the issuer of a credential about the subject. For example; a driving license containing the licensee's name, SSN, date of birth, etc is a credential where such data and details are claims made by the license issuer about the licensee which is the subject. A credential is called a verifiable credential when its authenticity can be cryptographically checked by anyone because the credential contains a cryptographic signature by the issuer, and the issuer's public key is well known. To convince a service provider, the verifier, of the authenticity of a verifiable credential, the credential along with the signature is shared with the service provider who can then verify the signature.</p><p>However, the above approach may be harmful to the user’s privacy. The entity in possession of the credential being the holder, has to share the credential in its entirety with the verifier, which may reveal a lot more information than what was needed. As an example, the holder may have wanted to share his name and date of birth from his license, not the rest of the credential data like his SSN, all while still being able to convince the verifier that he does own a verifiable credential containing his name and date of birth. This desired property is called selective disclosure where the holder can choose to disclose only parts of the credential, rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Another problem to solve is linkability. Say the holder is able to achieve selective disclosure where it only reveals part of the credential data to the verifier (the part that is sufficient for the verifier to provide service to the holder), the holder would not want the verifier to link his previous interactions with him. This desired property is called unlinkability. There are cases however when the holder is willing to be linked across several of his interactions but that should be voluntary and we do support that.</p><p>In some cases, even the above two properties might not be sufficient, for example when the holder wants to reveal part of the data -</p>  If a holder wants to prove he is over 18 or above 65 for availing a service, he doesn't need to show his date of birth; just being able to prove those conditions, called predicates is sufficient for the verifier.  For proving that he/she is not a resident of a city/state, the holder should not need to share his exact address.  For availing of social welfare, when the holder's salary is below a certain amount, the holder should not need to reveal his salary from his bank statement, but show an anonymous credential to convince the verifier of the same.  Similarly, an investor should be able to convince a verifier that the total value of his assets is greater than some amount without revealing the actual values of his assets.  <p>One of the solutions to solve the above problem is called anonymous credentials, sometimes called Attribute-Based Credentials (ABC). The main idea in anonymous credentials is that rather than considering the credential data as arbitrary bytes which are then signed by the issuer, anonymous credentials adds "structure" to the credential. Each claim in the credential is treated as an attribute and then these attributes are signed in a specific way by the issuer to create a signature. These attributes and the signature now form anonymous credentials. For example, if a credential has 3 claims made by the issuer about the holder including, name, city, and SSN, these 3 claims correspond to 3 attributes, one for each claim. Because of the "structure" in this credential, the holder can prove to a verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that he has this credential from the issuer without revealing any of the attributes. To be precise, the holder can disclose these attributes exist and have been signed by an official issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>“The holder can also reveal one or more attributes as part of the zero-knowledge proof from this anonymous credential, thus achieving selective disclosure.</p><p>“One or more zero-knowledge proofs created from the same anonymous credential cannot be linked together thus giving us unlinkability. </p><p>To achieve both of these properties, we use a signature scheme called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a>. A useful property of BBS+ (and similar) signatures is that when using several BBS+ signatures, attributes common to the signatures can be proven equal without revealing them. For example, if you have a driving license credential and passport, both with a BBS+ signature, you can prove that your SSN attribute is the same in both your driving license and passport without revealing your SSN. This property allows linking many credentials together and is helpful in cases when you need to prove that all credentials are about the same subject (or subject id).</p><p>Because credentials are essentially attestations made by an authority, i.e. the issuer, meaning they act as evidence or proof of something, it should be possible for the authority to permanently or temporarily renounce the attestations. These revoked credentials signal that the credential should not be accepted by any verifier. This kind of signaling requires the verifier to check the unique ID against a public list of all revoked credentials. However, revealing such a unique ID goes against our unlinkability requirement, as the unique ID of the credential ties all zero-knowledge proofs created from that credential. Therefore, we need a system in which the holder can prove that the membership of their credential ID is in a list in-zero knowledge:</p>  The verifier is assured the holder’s credential ID is not in the public list of all revoked credentials  The verifier will not have access to the credential ID  This system will ensure the holder is unlinkable.  <p>For this zero-knowledge membership, we use an accumulator which is a set-like database but with a very small size and allows such zero-knowledge membership checks. Accumulators also enable other use cases where such a membership or non-membership check is required. </p><p>Say that you have a bank details credential that contains your account number as one of the attributes. To convince a regulator that your account is not in a "suspicious-accounts" list, you can prove to the regulator that your account is not in the accumulator which contains all suspicious accounts. We use a pairing-based accumulator called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/777">VB accumulator</a>.</p><p>Some other common requirements with anonymous credentials is being able to prove conditions or predicates about the attributes like proving total income from a bank statement credential is less than the limit. Here the total income might not be a single attribute but composed of several attributes with one attribute per income source. Therefore, the attributes need to be added together before comparing to the limit amount, some cases may need more complex operations on one or more attributes. </p><p>These capabilities are not possible with BBS+ alone, and we therefore use zk-SNARK which can be used to prove arbitrary conditions on the attributes. The zk-SNARK we use is the same as used in Zcash but <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">adapted</a> to be linked with the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but too much privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Consider an exchange as a verifier that allows customers to make transactions after they prove possession of a government ID, but does not ask for any other information. At any point, a regulator or law enforcement may want to know details of who made certain transactions, but the only information the verifier has and is able to provide, is that someone made the transactions with a government ID. </p><p>This isn’t sufficient for the regulator or law enforcement, traceability is needed here. However, not everyone in this chain needs traceability, certain authorities are the ones in need of it. We solve this problem by a technique called verifiable encryption.</p><p>Using the example above, a customer who possesses a government ID should be required to encrypt their SSN for the regulator without revealing the SSN itself. Authorities can decrypt the SSN and track who the government ID belongs to, while the customer is assured the exchange is not able to track them, only the authorities who need to trace them. Note that verifiable encryption is not mandatory with Dock credentials, it’s opt-in.</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto">core cryptographic library</a> that implements the signature schemes and proof protocols is implemented in Rust.  The library contains different primitives in separate crates. The notable ones are <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus">BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/vb_accumulator">accumulators</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>.  The composite proof system allows us to combine these primitives like proving knowledge of 2 BBS+ signatures with proof of accumulator membership.  <p>Since a large part of this code needs to run in a Javascript environment like a browser or a react native app, we built a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm">WASM wrapper</a> over the Rust code. The wrapper is quite thin and mostly does deserialization/serialization logic. It intentionally lacks abstractions like classes and is just some modules with free-floating functions. Finally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts">Typescript library</a> that uses the WASM wrapper and provides various abstractions like creating signatures, proofs, accumulators. &nbsp;</p><p>As verification of proofs and accumulator membership/non-membership requires publicly available authenticated storage, we deployed the ability to post BBS+ and accumulator public keys on our chain and also to create, update and remove accumulators. The changes have been live on the mainnet for some time and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/bbs-plus.js">corresponding</a> <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/accumulator.js">modules</a> and tests are added in SDK for <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/bbs-plus.test.js">BBS+</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/accumulator.test.js">accumulators</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/demo.test.js">composite proof</a> by fetching objects from the chain.</p><p>For a more detailed explanation of the primitives, see <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#overview">the explainer</a> in the GitHub repo. The usage with examples is described <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#usage">here</a>. It is broken down into the following sections:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signatures-1">BBS+ signature</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#accumulators">Accumulator</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#composite-proofs-1">Composite proof system</a>  <p>The composite proof subsection shows several examples like <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>, creating proofs over <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#multiple-bbs-signatures">multiple BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signature-together-with-accumulator-membership">BBS+ signature with accumulator membership</a>, getting <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#getting-a-blind-signature">blind BBS+ signature</a>, meaning even the issuer is not aware of certain attributes, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#verifier-local-or-opt-in-linkability">opt-in linkability</a> where the holder chooses to be linkable across several proofs of his credential, but only at a certain verifier.</p><p>We are exploring options for predicates like range proofs, verifiable encryption, and support for arbitrary computation on credential data in general, but we have PoCs for showing that they work with BBS+ signatures.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/cp-snark-bbs">PoC</a> shows the usage of BBS+ and <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, which is an adaptation of Groth16, the zk-SNARK used in Zcash. The PoC shows how to:</p>  Prove that some attribute of a BBS+ signature satisfies some bound that can be used to prove that age is less than or greater than some number  Prove that the sum of certain attributes satisfy a certain bound which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than some number.  Prove that sum of certain attributes of 1 credential is less than the sum of certain attributes of another credential, which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than the sum of assets.  <p>This <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/saver-poc/saver">PoC</a> shows verifiable encryption based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1270">SAVER</a>. We show in <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/saver-poc/saver/src/tests.rs">this test</a>, that a user can verifiably encrypt any of his attributes for a third party, and convince the third party that the encryption has been correctly done. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, compares the lack of data privacy protection laws in certain parts of the world to the&nbsp;others.</p><p>We have often spoken about the relevance of Web3 and decentralization in our podcast. Still, it is essential to talk about pioneers in the Web2 space fighting for free internet and data privacy. They are the advocates working with governments for data regulations that protect internet users. One of such organizations is Mozilla. In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at Mozilla. During this discussion, he explains the role of Mozilla in the free internet ecosystem, data regulations discrepancies in the Asia Pacific and particularly India, and more. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem: 20 years of Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</p><p>Mozilla explicitly works towards treating the internet as a global public resource that should be accessible to everyone. It does this with the help of different <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">products such as Firefox, Pocket, and Mozilla&nbsp;VPN.</a></p><blockquote>“My role in the global public policy team at Mozilla is to also look out for laws and regulations that may impact these products. I oversee if the laws can be improved to ensure that they lead to that open Internet — I then advocate for those laws. Or if there are particularly worrying things in certain laws and regulations that would be bad, not just for Mozilla’s products, but also for the internet — I also tend to work on those issues. And so far my remit has largely been in the Asia Pacific region but I also work on some other issues globally.”</blockquote><p>The main aspects of Udbhav’s role&nbsp;are</p>  data protection and&nbsp;privacy  content regulation and intermediary liability  connectivity, encryption, and&nbsp;security  <p>The Mozilla Foundation is actually a digital rights NGO. It has fellows that work on internet health and internet security around the world. At Voices of the Data Economy, we have interviewed two fellows in the past: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/julia-reinhardt-what-do-gdpr-and-ai-regulations-mean/id1506212617?i=1000531062544">Julia Reinhardt </a>and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-and-collective-consent/id1506212617?i=1000475444072">Anouk Ruhaak</a>. The foundation has initiatives like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keb0oAMV-I4">YouTube Regrets </a>and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/">privacy not included</a>.</p><p>Data Regulations across Asia and&nbsp;India</p><p>Udbhav mentions that Europe has had a data protection law for much longer than other parts of the world (of course, now we have&nbsp;GDPR).</p><blockquote>“Here in the Asia Pacific region, it’s quite far from being the norm even to have a data protection law in the first place. If one were to turn the clock back, I would say even ten years ago; one could easily count on two hands the number of countries in the Asia Pacific region that had a dedicated data protection law on the books. But thanks to the proliferation of technology and public demands from civil society that want better protections for users and consumers– things are changing.”</blockquote><p>Australia has had a privacy law for a fair amount of time. Still, they are actually amid re-looking at their privacy law; it’s being updated to suit modern technologies better. If one were to move a little higher up, countries like the Philippines have now had a privacy law for some time. And in fact, business imperatives around the business processing and outsourcing industry in the Philippines played a considerable role in the Philippines, even having a privacy law in the first place. Sri Lanka is also looking at a data protection law. Even countries like Indonesia have been debating data protection laws for some time, and Indonesia also now has a data protection law. However, some provisions within the law still need to be notified, or specific, like regulatory entities under the law need to be set&nbsp;up.</p><blockquote>“Even in India, the protection, the conversation around data protection has been going on for well over, I think, 12 years now, approximately, there have been different versions of different bills that different committees have proposed.”</blockquote><p>Indian data regulation law and its relation with non-personal data</p><p>The drafted data protection law in India has the following issues:</p>  The first fundamental provision is around data protection and how it applies to governments. So the law in India currently has a section, the draft law, section 35, which will allow the government to exempt any part of itself from any part of the law. Everybody understands the need for exceptions: national security for law enforcement access, and all laws worldwide contain it like the GDPR contains some exceptions. But in India, many people think it has significantly exceeded that narrow scope. Hypothetically, it can say things&nbsp;like    These 15 sections will not apply to the Reserve Bank of&nbsp;India  These five sections won’t apply to view IDI, India’s digital identity authority or  The whole law will not apply to the Intelligence Bureau OR the whole law will not apply to the CBI, India’s centralized investigation agency.    The second provision is in general, around the independence of the Data Protection Authority that this law is proposing. The Data Protection Authority is the regulator that enforces data protection laws — they are the ones you can complain to if something goes wrong with you and a Data Collector. But some individuals do proactive audits who enforce the provisions of the law. And suppose you don’t have a robust Data Protection Authority. In that case, the law becomes a toothless tiger when it comes to data protection because you can’t do anything unless there is, you know, a capable infrastructure of people who can enforce that&nbsp;law.  <p>India’s data protection law contains both the drafts and the new one as well contains some pretty strong language that splits data into three categories.</p>  Personal data  Sensitive Personal&nbsp;data  Critical Personal&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Critical personal data isn’t defined; it’s something that the government will be able to notify, for example, they can say health data is critical, they can say that. And in these three classifications, critical data will have to stay in the country and simply cannot leave the country. Sensitive data can leave the country for a short amount of time, but a copy of that data must always be kept in the country, and personal data can currently go around when it wants to. So as you can imagine this, fundamentally like rejigs the way the internet and its infrastructure works in a very big&nbsp;way.”</blockquote><p>When it comes to non-personal data, in general, numbers, data is actually like, it has a negative definition, which is anything that isn’t personal data is nonpersonal data. So all privacy laws and data protection laws around the world fundamentally apply to personal data, right, like data that identifies an individual or has identifying characteristics. So for example, if I write a poem, right, like on a piece of paper or on Google Docs, and I don’t write any my name on it, I don’t associate it with an account, then that is actually isn’t data. Yes. Is it personal data? No. Right? Like, because, for example, imagine Amazon has the list of the top 100 products that are sold in India every day, right without who bought them without any other information, just a pure List of 100 products, top 100 products that are sold in India every day. That is an example of nonpersonal data. It is data it has its uses as inferences associated with it. But it doesn’t meet the definition of personal data, which means it doesn’t have identifying characteristics that can’t be used to identify individuals, so on and so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>India’s status in Data Regulation</p><p>India, in many ways, is trying, and some people are now openly saying it is very much trying to carve what it calls is the fourth part of internet regulation; they think that the three main dominant models&nbsp;are</p>  The United States: with the free market, very little regulation  Europe: pretty strong prescriptive regulation,  regulation in countries like China, which differs much more from the state’s&nbsp;power.  <blockquote>“I think India, in all of the issues that we have discussed, is trying to pick and choose different models from these different countries in order to be able to implement them in practice. I think it is very deliberately doing so to set an example for other similarly placed countries. So it’s not just what we do here, but it’s also how we do things in a manner that other countries can&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.20 -7.25: Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem</p><p>7.25–13.20: Data regulations in the Asia Pacific with a focus on&nbsp;India</p><p>13.20–28:35: What is non-personal data, and how are the regulations?</p><p>28.35–32:05: How should a data protection law in India look&nbsp;like?</p><p>32.05–43.06: How does big tech behave in&nbsp;India</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-governance-across-continents-what-does-it-mean-for-internet-users-39c771ab1f08">Data Governance Across Continents: What does it mean for internet users?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 È online il nuovo sito web di InfoCert-Tinexta Group per parlare alla platea sempre più vasta ed eterogenea di utenti dei Digital Trust Services. 



 Il progetto rientra nella più ampia strategia aziendale che punta ad arricchire e rafforzare il rapporto con i clienti con esperienze d’uso personalizzate e coinvolgenti in ogni ambito. 



<p>Roma, 20 Gennaio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia il rilascio della nuova versione di infocert.it, il sito web dedicato all’offerta di soluzioni tra cui PEC, Firma Digitale, Marche temporali, Conservazione Digitale, Fatturazione Elettronica e SPID.</p>



<p>Il radicale rinnovo di infocert.it ha grande valore strategico per l’azienda, anche per il suo ruolo di porta d’accesso della clientela, in particolare PMI e Professionisti e privati, al mondo dei trust services: sono oltre 1 milione i clienti dell’ecommerce InfoCert ed il sito ogni anno registra oltre 100 Milioni di pagine visitate.</p>



<p>Inoltre, questa prima release del sito è la chiave di comunicazione digitale di InfoCert in Europa. Infatti, le aziende del gruppo InfoCert verranno allineate a questo nuovo format, con l‘obiettivo ambizioso di rendere sempre più riconoscibile l’immagine e l’offerta del gruppo InfoCert. Questo elemento è stato fondamentale per determinare la scelta attuale di User Experience e Look&amp;Feel, in quanto ha l’importante ruolo di comunicare non solo un marchio all’estero, ma soprattutto di intercettare le esigenze di geografie e culture diverse.</p>



<p>Il progetto è in continua evoluzione: già entro il primo trimestre del 2022, è prevista la trasformazione della sezione di e-commerce nonché la creazione di aree dedicate a specifici target di clientela.</p>

  <p>UI designers and front-end developers are tasked with creating clean and consistent user interfaces. At the same time, testing is a cornerstone of software development. Each part of a software project is tested individually and isolated from the other elements in unit tests. This practice has been challenging to achieve in the context of user interfaces.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> provides an open-source framework that lets you test UI components in isolation from the rest of the website. Storybook presents you with a browser of all the components in your web application. You can test each component independently and in different configurations. The tool runs as a separate application outside your main application, which means that you can test your components without worrying about application-specific dependencies or requirements.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to use Storybook to create a simple <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application. The application will be a unit conversion app, and I will use Storybook to showcase the individual components and the application page itself. I will not assume any prior knowledge of React or Storybook. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node, and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> packet manager installed on your computer.</p>

 Creating React components with Storybook 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a React application and implement components displayed in Storybook. These components will serve as the basis for the unit conversion application. To start, open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command to create a new React application.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 react-storybook --use-npm
</code>   

<p>The <code>create-react-app</code> command creates a new folder, <code>react-storybook</code>, and initialises a basic application skeleton. Next, turn this basic React app into a Storybook application. Navigate into the newly created folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx sb@6 init
</code>   

<p>When prompted, answer yes to install the <code>sb</code> package. Initializing Storybook will create a new folder, <code>stories</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder, and populate it with some pre-made demo components and stories to be used by Storybook. Open the project folder in your favourite IDE.</p>

<p>You can test out storybook straight away. Open a terminal session in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). For now, you will only see the components that Storybook installs by default. You can keep Storybook running while you develop your app.</p>

<p>Using your IDE, create a new file named <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code>. This will be the module that will contain some basic UI components. For the sake of this tutorial, I will place all these components into a single module. In practice, you might want to spread them out over several files. Open <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code> and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './Components.css';

export function Input({ size, type, label, name, placeholder, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`input-component input-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;input
        type={type==='text' ? 'text' : 'number'}
        step={type==='floating-point' ? 'any' : undefined}
        name={name}
        placeholder={placeholder}
        onChange={onChange}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Input.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  type: PropTypes.oneOf(['text', 'number', 'floating-point']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  placeholder: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  type: 'text',
  label: 'Enter a value',
  name: 'input',
  placeholder: 'Please enter a value',
  onChange: undefined
};

export function Select({ size, label, options, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`select-component select-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;select className="select-component" onChange={onChange}&gt;
        {options.map((option) =&gt; &lt;option value={option.value}&gt;{option.description}&lt;/option&gt;)}
      &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Select.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  options: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
    value: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    description: PropTypes.string.isRequired
  })).isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Select.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Options',
  options: []
};

export function Tabs({ children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(0);

  const onTabClick = (newActive) =&gt; () =&gt; {
    setActive(() =&gt; newActive);
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="tabs-component"&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-row"&gt;
        {children.map((child, index) =&gt; &lt;div className={`tab ${index === active ? "active" : ""}`} onClick={onTabClick(index)}&gt;{child.props.label}&lt;/div&gt;)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-content"&gt;
        {children[active]}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

Tabs.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.instanceOf(Array).isRequired,
};

Tabs.defaultProps = {
  children: []
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports three components. <code>Input</code> is a configurable <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with a label for entering text or numbers, <code>Select</code> is a dropdown <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element wrapped in a label, and <code>Tabs</code> is a component that shows its children in a separate tab. I am using the React feature <code>propTypes</code> to specify the properties that each React component expects as arguments, allowing Storybook to extract this meta-information and display it to the user. To provide a bit of styling for the components, create a file <code>src/stories/Components.css</code>, and fill it with the following contents.</p>

   <code>.input-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.input-component span {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.input-component.input-component--large input {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.select-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.select-component span {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.select-component.select-component--large select {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row {
  font-family: 'Nunito Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  display: flex;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row .tab {
  border: 1px solid #EEEEEE;
  border-bottom: none;
  border-top-right-radius: 4px;
  border-top-left-radius: 4px;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row .tab.active {
  background-color: #EEEEEE;
  cursor: auto;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-content {
  border: 1px solid #EEEEEE;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}
</code>   

<p>With this, the components are usable as React components in your application. But you also want them to be browsable through Storybook. For this, you will need to create one file for each component. Start by creating a file <code>src/stories/Input.stories.jsx</code> and enter the following code in it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Input } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Input',
  component: Input,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Input {...args} /&gt;;

export const Normal = Template.bind({});

Normal.args = {
  label: 'Normal Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'normal'
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  label: 'Large Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large'
};

export const Number = Template.bind({});

Number.args = {
  label: 'Integer Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'number'
};

export const FloatingPoint = Template.bind({});

FloatingPoint.args = {
  label: 'Floating Point Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'floating-point'
};
</code>   

<p>The <code>export default</code> at the top of the file tells Storybook what the component’s name is and which React component the stories in this file refer to. The subsequent exports <code>Normal</code>, <code>Large</code>, <code>Number</code>, and <code>FloatingPoint</code> represent individual stories or use cases for that component. Each story defines a member <code>args</code> that specifies the properties to pass to the component. Creating stories in this way is quick, so now create the next one for the <code>Select</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Select.stories.jsx</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Select } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Select',
  component: Select,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Select {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  size: 'large',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>This file defines two stories for the <code>Select</code> component. One story shows it in normal size, and the other shows it in a large size. Finally, do the same for the <code>Tabs</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Tabs.stories.jsx</code> and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Tabs } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Tabs',
  component: Tabs,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Tabs {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  children: [
    &lt;div label="One"&gt;Content One&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Two"&gt;Content Two&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Three"&gt;Content Three&lt;/div&gt;,
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to test out your new components in Storybook. If you haven’t done so already, open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). You can browse the components in the left sidebar. The stories you just created can be found under the Components header, and when you select, for example, the Input -&gt; Number story, you should see something like shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The component shows up in the main view, and the icons above let you change the background, the screen size, and even allow you to check the dimensions of the component’s layout. Below the main view, you can manually adjust the options passed to the component. I invite you to play around with all the features Storybook provides.</p>

 Creating the unit converter application using Storybook component stories 

<p>I will use the <code>convert-units</code> library to implement the unit conversion app. Open a second terminal in your project folder and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E convert-units@2.3.4
</code>   

<p>Now, in your IDE, create a new file, <code>src/stories/Converter.jsx</code>, and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import * as convert from 'convert-units';
import { Input, Select } from './Components';

export const Converter = ({measure}) =&gt; {
  const possibilities = convert().possibilities(measure).map((unit) =&gt; {
      const descr = convert().describe(unit);
      return {
          value: descr.abbr,
          description: `${descr.singular} (${descr.abbr})`
      };
  });

  const [fromUnit, setFromUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [toUnit, setToUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [fromValue, setFromValue] = useState(1);
  const [toValue, setToValue] = useState(convert(1).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));

  const updateFromUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(event.target.value).to(toUnit));
  };

  const updateToUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setToUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(fromUnit).to(event.target.value));
  };

  const updateValue = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromValue(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(event.target.value).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));
  };
  
  return &lt;div className="converter"&gt;
      &lt;Select label="From:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateFromUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Select label="To:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateToUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Input label="Value:" type="floating-point" onChange={updateValue}&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{fromValue} {fromUnit} = {toValue} {toUnit}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
};

Converter.propTypes = {
  measure: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  measure: 'length'
};
</code>   

<p>The component takes a single property called <code>measure</code>, which specifies the type of units to be converted and can be something like <code>mass</code> or <code>length</code>. The code for this component then consists of four parts. The first action is to query the <code>convert-units</code> library for all the possible unit conversion options. Units are mapped into an array of objects, ready to use with the <code>Select</code> component. In the next part, you’ll define four state properties, followed by three event handlers. These will react to a change in the user input and update the state accordingly. These event handlers contain the actual calls to the <code>convert-units</code> library where the unit conversion happens. Finally, the component is put together from all the parts and returned. You can also create a story for this more complex component with the individual components. Create a file <code>src/stories/Converter.stories.jsx</code> and paste in the following contents.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Converter',
  component: Converter,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Converter {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  measure: 'length'
};

export const Mass = Template.bind({});

Mass.args = {
  measure: 'mass'
};
</code>   

<p>When you installed Storybook with the <code>npx sb</code> command, the initialization script added a few components as examples to demonstrate Storybook’s capabilities. You will be reusing two of these components for the unit-conversion app. 
Open <code>src/stories/Header.jsx</code> and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Button } from './Button';
import './header.css';

export const Header = ({ user, onLogin, onLogout }) =&gt; (
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div className="wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {user ? &lt;div&gt; Hello {user.given_name} &lt;/div&gt; : ""}
      &lt;div&gt;
        {user ? (
          &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogout} label="Log out" /&gt;
        ) : (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogin} label="Log in" /&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
);

Header.propTypes = {
  user: PropTypes.shape({}),
  onLogin: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onLogout: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onCreateAccount: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  user: null,
};
</code>   

<p>I have modified the header component to show the correct application name and allow some structured user data to be passed in. In the story for the header, in file <code>src/stories/Header.stories.jsx</code>, modify the arguments passed to the <code>LoggedIn</code> story to reflect this change.</p>

   <code>LoggedIn.args = {
  user: {
    given_name: "Username"
  },
};
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/stories/Page.jsx</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Header } from './Header';
import './page.css';
import { Tabs } from './Components';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export const Page = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();
  return &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;Tabs&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="length" label="Length" key="length"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="mass" label="Mass" key="mass"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="volume" label="Volume" key="volume"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
      &lt;/Tabs&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;;
}

Page.propTypes = {
  useAuth: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};

Page.defaultProps = {
};
</code>   

<p>This component displays the application page, including the header and a tabbed container that allows switching between <code>Converter</code> components configured to convert different measures. The page needs a <code>useAuth</code> hook passed in that returns the user information and callbacks to log the user in or out. In the stories for the page, in <code>src/stories/Page.stories.jsx</code>, you need to create a mock function that supplies fake user data. Edit the contents of this file to look like the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Page } from './Page';

export default {
  title: 'Pages/Page',
  component: Page,
};

const mockUseAuth = (loggedIn) =&gt; () =&gt; [
  loggedIn ? {given_name: "Username"} : undefined, 
  () =&gt; {}, 
  () =&gt; {}
];

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Page useAuth={mockUseAuth(true)} {...args}/&gt;;

export const LoggedIn = Template.bind({});
LoggedIn.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(true),
};

LoggedIn.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};

export const LoggedOut = Template.bind({});
LoggedOut.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(false),
};

LoggedOut.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};
</code>   

<p>Note how <code>mockUseAuth</code> uses <a href="https://javascript.info/currying-partials">currying</a> to return a function that can be used as the <code>useAuth</code> hook in the <code>Page</code> component. You can now use Storybook again to test the <code>Converter</code> component and the full application page. If it’s not still running, run <code>npm run storybook</code> again. You can navigate to Pages -&gt; Page in the left sidebar, and you should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding authentication with Okta to the application 

<p>You have created a page that uses an <code>useAuth</code> hook to manage user authentication. For the Storybook stories, you made a mock implementation of this hook. This section will show you how to implement the hook using Okta’s authentication service. First, register the application with Okta.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Next, install the necessary libraries. Open the terminal and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.1 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.10.0 react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.3.0
</code>   

<p>Open the file <code>src/index.js</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import { App } from './App';
import { Page } from './stories/Page';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useAuth } from './auth';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientID}',
  redirectUri: `/callback`,
});

function SecuredRoutes(props) {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };
  
  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;App {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path="/converter" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;Page {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;SecuredRoutes /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

reportWebVitals();
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain. This change does several things. The <code>oktaAuth</code> instance provides a global authentication singleton. The main <code>render</code> function now contains a <code>Router</code> element that allows the application to navigate different routes. Finally, <code>SecuredRoutes</code> is a component that wraps the routes in a <code>Security</code> component. This component makes a <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook available for all components contained within it. Inside this component, you define the routes. Note how you pass a <code>useAuth</code> hook into the <code>App</code> and the <code>Page</code> components. Create a new file <code>src/auth.js</code> and add the following code to implement this hook.</p>

   <code>import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export const useAuth = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      if (!user) {
        oktaAuth.getUser().then(setUser);
      }
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  }, [authState, user, oktaAuth]);

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect('/');
  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

  return [user, login, logout];
};
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to modify the existing <code>App</code> component to use the authentication hook. Open <code>src/App.js</code> and adjust the content to look like this.</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Header } from './stories/Header';

export const App = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;Link to="/converter"&gt;Go to the app!&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you have completed your React application with Storybook. You can now open the console in the project folder and run the following command to start the app.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>You should see the application’s front page in your browser. When you click the  Go to the app! link, you’ll log in on the Okta page. After successfully signing in, you will redirect to the unit converter page, which looks like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about React, Storybook, and Single-Page Apps 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a React application and use Storybook to browse the application’s components. Storybook is a great tool that can enhance your development workflow.</p>
 
   It lets you view and test your components in isolation. 
   You can specify the location of each component in a hierarchical menu and then browse through the components in your browser. 
   You can have multiple stories showcasing different use cases for each component. 
   You can also modify the component parameters and see the impact on the visual appearance in real time. 
   Storybook can keep running during the development process, and it will reflect any changes you make to your code. 
 

<p>The application you wrote was a simple unit-conversion app. I guided you on using the <code>convert-units</code> library to convert length, mass, and volume. You assembled the individual components to create a larger component containing multiple input elements. I have shown you how Storybook lets you create stories, test these complex components, and complete application pages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> has finalized its acquisition of <a href="https://www.4stop.com/">4Stop</a>. The two companies first <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-acquires-kyc-data-hub-4stop-712071/">announced the proposed acquisition</a> in December, though they indicated that the deal would not close until early 2022.</p>



  



<p>That timeline has proven to be quite accurate. Jumio and 4Stop managed to complete their deal in mid-January, which will in turn allow Jumio to move forward with its plans to integrate 4Stop’s data management hub into its own identity verification portfolio.</p>



<p>In that regard, 4Stop’s platform draws information from more than 650 data sources in nearly 200 countries all over the world. Clients gain access to that information through a single consolidated API, and can use it to guard against fraud and comply with various Know Your Customer and Know Your Business regulations.</p>



<p>Jumio, meanwhile, is best known for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-enhances-risk-screening-capabilities-kyx-platform-102604/">remote onboarding solutions</a> that use face and document recognition to compare a selfie to the image on a photo ID. The company believes that 4Stop’s simple API will make its identity verification products easier to manage, since clients will be able to deploy and configure a Jumio offering through that one API layer. 4Stop’s tech will also allow administrators to monitor account activity and evaluate their level of risk.</p>



<p>“Jumio is once again disrupting the entire identity industry and redefining what modern organizations need in order to provide complete customer lifecycle management,” said Jumio CEO Robert Prigge. “We are thrilled to complete this acquisition and welcome 4Stop to the Jumio family.”</p>



<p>The news formalizes the existing relationship between Jumio and 4Stop, which <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-4stop-integrates-jumios-identity-verification-technology-112007/">integrated Jumio’s identity verification tech</a> into its own platform back in 2019. Jumio would later name 4Stop as its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-hands-out-regional-partner-awards-2020-030506/">Strategic Partner of the Year</a> for the EMEA region in its Partner of the Year awards presentation in early 2021. 4Stop is based in Germany, while Jumio recently revealed that its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-momentum-continues-in-q4-update-501181/">2021 revenues doubled</a> what the company generated in 2020.</p>

 Protecting customer data will continue to be an urgent issue for businesses worldwide in 2022. The risks and requirements are not going away. 



<p></p>



<p>In 2021 we saw users demanding and gaining more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Big tech/ad tech took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">more hits</a> to their data-driven business models, even while introducing variously effective “privacy” measures (such as Google phasing out&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and scrapping app developers access to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">ad IDs</a>&nbsp;and Apple introducing the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;feature and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">privacy labels</a>&nbsp;in the App Store). When&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;caused global outrage by demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal data with Facebook, and Elon Musk switched millions of those users to private messaging app Signal with a two-word tweet, the world was never surer that consumers are tired of trading their personal information for access to services. This sentiment is only intensifying.</p>



<p>Throughout 2021, the regulatory landscape expanded, placing even greater compliance burdens on business and making cross-border data transfers more difficult.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;and the mass move to remote working environments continued to demand businesses find ways to protect employee devices and secure corporate data and resources as cybersecurity threats ramped up. Contact tracing also amplified the risks of sharing and storing personal information.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/cisco-the-age-of-privacy-has-arrived-helped-by-covid-19/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;confirmed the pandemic had seriously elevated the importance of data privacy as a business priority and, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, this imperative hasn’t changed. Privacy budgets and resourcing skyrocketed among businesses in response, and governments and health authorities are still struggling to balance public health with protecting personal privacy.</p>



 Obviously, data privacy will remain firmly on the agenda in 2022, so the big trends to watch for are: 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Privacy regulations and compliance obligations will continue to expand and tighten in the US and globally.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) quotes Goodwin Partner and IAPP Senior Fellow, Omer Tene as saying,&nbsp;“In 2022, expect an avalanche of new laws and regulations, attempting to govern and impose order on a dizzying array of tech developments. New regulatory efforts will range from data protection laws in India and China to AI regulation in the EU to automated decision making rules in US states. Add to that a flurry of enforcement activities, and you get a perfect storm of tech regulation.”<br><br>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;says it’s unlikely the US will gets its long awaited national privacy law in 2022, but at least six states will move to pass their own (Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska), and it will be interesting to see whether any of those states includes a&nbsp;<a href="https://lawrina.com/blog/private-right-of-action/#:~:text=According%20to%20Federal%20law%2C%20a,legal%20violations%20under%20a%20statute.">private right of action</a>&nbsp;(PRA) —because, if they don’t, the game could change. “A couple of years ago, conventional wisdom was that the more states pass privacy laws, the greater the pressure will build on the business community, and consequently Congress, to pass preemptive federal legislation. Absent a PRA, however, an interesting dynamic may develop, where the more state privacy laws, the less appetite businesses – who are growing accustomed to complying with the emerging (PRA-less) state framework – have for federal pre-emption,” Tene says.</p>



<p>More tech legislation will flow out of Europe too. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;calls it&nbsp;“a veritable alphabet soup of tech regulation affecting digital platforms, digital services, online marketing, data intermediaries and more …”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>, affecting algorithmic decision making across the economy, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-data-act">Data Act</a>, which broadens legal obligations, including cross-border transfer restrictions, to non-personal data will also be things to watch.</p>



 We’ll see more regulatory enforcement.  



<p></p>



<p>Governments in the US and Europe are expected to ramp up regulatory enforcement around breach reporting and risk reporting. GDPR enforcement increased in 2021 and this is set to continue. Tene says, “Importantly, regulators are expanding the lens from an early focus on data breaches to challenging companies’ legal bases for processing data and, notably, cross-border data flows. In 2022, expect an additional step up the enforcement ladder. We expect regulators to focus on issues such as protecting children’s data, restricting the use of sensitive health and financial information, and curbing the excess of digital marketing.” Of course, if greater enforcement is to happen, the regulators will need to be adequately resourced. Enforcement times are not getting any shorter on the complex cases. It will also be long overdue. For example, the Schrems II decision was in the middle of 2020 and there has been very minimal (if any?) enforcement action resulting from that change.&nbsp;</p>



 More limits on big tech/ad tech.  



<p></p>



<p>Regulators, the media and the general public have big tech/ad tech firmly in their sights and will continue to demand more privacy-first data tracking and sharing practices and business models. As we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">reported</a>&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tene notes: “Under the leadership of new Chair Lina Khan, the FTC has issued strong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/StaticContent/202110/Statement_3084_FTC.pdf">statements and strategic plans</a>&nbsp;for broad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69">rulemaking</a>&nbsp;efforts, including rules to curb “abuses stemming from surveillance-based business models” and “lax security practices” and to “ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” But he notes this in part depends on Bedoya’s appointment proceeding in the Senate, which may not be quick.&nbsp;</p>



 Consumers will continue to favor brands that are genuinely good, honest stewards of their personal data.

<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;released research findings in October 2021 which it says, ”demonstrates the growing importance of privacy to the individual and its implications on the businesses and governments that serve them.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Eighty-six per cent</a>&nbsp;of respondents said they care about data privacy and want more control, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">79 percent</a>&nbsp;said they’d be willing to vote with their wallet and not support businesses that don’t protect their data and would indeed pay for better data protection. This sounds like the new growing market of “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a>” we discussed last year and which no brand can afford to ignore.

<p>Clearly the opportunity for businesses to build customer trust and loyalty by responding authentically to what their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customers want and need</a>&nbsp;are enormous. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">PwC</a>&nbsp;says, brands that get customer privacy and safety right will disrupt the market.

 “Facial biometrics technology can empower businesses and government agencies with a safe and holistic solution while continuing to safeguard civil liberties and human privacy rights; one is not exclusive of the other.”  –  Avi Golan, CEO, Oosto 



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-frictionless-access-control-712169/"></a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-frictionless-access-control-712169/">Watch the on-demand webinar now!</a> 



<p>The White House recently posted a request for public comment concerning the use of biometrics for identification, and <a href="https://oosto.com/">Oosto</a> is now responding enthusiastically in the form of an open letter.</p>



<p>The White House request was issued in the form of <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/08/2021-21975/notice-of-request-for-information-rfi-on-public-and-private-sector-uses-of-biometric-technologies#print">an RFI posted on the Federal Register</a>, in which the Office of Science and Technology Policy asked for input on the “use of biometric technologies for the purposes of identity verification, identification of individuals, and inference of attributes including individual mental and emotional states.” The OSTP explained that it was seeking to understand how these technologies are being deployed and what kinds of principles and policies are guiding their use (among other things), both on the part of private and public deployments.</p>



<p>Oosto has responded in the form of an open letter, signed by CEO Avi Golan, that emphasized Oosto’s efforts to serve societal interests through deployments tailored to different social contexts.</p>



<p>“It is critical that government leaders recognize the power of visual AI to save and sustain lives,” Golan wrote. “Visual AI today is often misunderstood or misrepresented… Facial biometrics technology can empower businesses and government agencies with a safe and holistic solution while continuing to safeguard civil liberties and human privacy rights; one is not exclusive of the other.”</p>



<p>The letter represents Oosto’s latest effort to emphasize the importance of ethical frameworks in the deployment of biometric technology and facial recognition in particular. In <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-ethical-recommendations-uk-surveillance-commissioner-709081/">an open letter</a> to UK’s Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner last year, Golan stressed the importance of ensuring that any law enforcement agency’s use of biometrics is not based on a pre-populated database provided by a vendor; and that was followed with an open letter celebrating the Australian Information Commissioner’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-applauds-australian-information-commissioners-clearview-ruling-711118/">ruling against Clearview AI</a>, which has become notorious for its facial recognition platform’s privacy violations.</p>



<p>Oosto has also previously emphasized the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-calls-on-nist-to-draft-ethical-guidelines-for-facial-recognition-706032/">need for regulatory guidelines</a> concerning such technologies, a theme that came up again in the company”s latest open letter.</p>



<p>“As a world-leading firm in this space, we encourage regulators to conduct thoughtful due diligence in order to provide meaningful guidance and an appropriate legal framework regulating the use of biometrics in context-specific scenarios,” Golan wrote. “Moreover, we need a cohesive national policy for the ethical use of facial recognition vs. a patchwork quilt of differing state-level regulations which make commercial compliance challenging.”</p>



<p>Oosto’s latest public comments come after a senior advisor with Softbank reaffirmed the tech-focused VC investor’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/softbank-advisor-wants-to-expand-and-accelerate-oosto-collaboration/">commitment to Oosto</a> at a recent conference, reflecting enthusiasm for the company’s principled development and deployment of biometric technology.</p>

<p>A Brazilian naked payments start-up is entering Mastercard’s Start Path accelerator. <a href="https://payface.com.br/">Payface</a> was founded in Santa Catarina, and is the developer of a face-based payment application that has already been deployed in six Brazilian states.</p>



  



<p>The company is hoping that its participation in the next Start Path cohort will open up more development and marketing opportunities internationally. The Payface system relies on facial recognition, and functions much like <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shinhan-card-launches-face-based-naked-payments-scheme-041308/">other naked payments systems</a>. Users are asked to register their biometrics and their payment information through the Payface application. They can then submit to a facial recognition scan to complete a transaction at the point of sale. In doing so, Payface negates the need for a physical card or a cellphone during in-person payments.</p>



<p>Start Path, meanwhile, is essentially a six-month mentorship program that provides tech start-ups with the resources and expertise they need to take their businesses to the next level. Payface is the only Latin American company in its cohort of nine, and believes that its selection attests to the strength of its business and its payment platform.</p>



<p>“We have partnered with fintech companies from the start and evolved the Mastercard Developers portfolio with programs like Start Path to support companies like Payface on their journey to grow and scale,” said Mastercard Fintech and Enablers SVP Amy Neale.</p>



<p>“We want to leverage Mastercard’s global network to directly engage with consumers, gather feedback on geographic expansion and relevant market dynamics, and receive guidance on product viability,” added Payface Co-founder and CEO Eládio Isoppo.</p>



<p><a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-mastercard-start-path-011302/">HYPR</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/veridium-mastercard-starup-accelerator-program-504022/">Viridium</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/mastercard-strategically-invests-in-truststamp-902056/">Trust Stamp</a>&nbsp;are some of the more high-profile alums of the Start Path program. Facial recognition has previously been used to facilitate payments at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/china-kfc-worlds-biggest-naked-payments-deployment-511142/">KFC stores in China</a>, while PopID has brought similar technology to a network of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/popid-builds-biometric-poppay-network-pasadena-081707/">restaurants and retail outlets</a> in the United States.</p>

Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-194-the-party-is-over-589625d2283c">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Can you trust your million dollar&nbsp;NFT?  What people are&nbsp;saying  The question of atoms v.&nbsp;bits  Tweet of the week — guy who created Ethereum&nbsp;edition  The investment everyone is talking&nbsp;about  Stuff happens   1. Can you trust your million dollar&nbsp;NFT? Bored Ape Yacht&nbsp;Club<p>One of the fundamental novelties of NFTs is that the framework has brought a sense of scarcity and permanence to a place — the internet — that has historically been of abundance and transience.</p><p>That NFTs exist on decentralized blockchains further gives users a sense of ownership over their items — perfect for digital collectibles and other use cases such as&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>But how permanent are NFTs really? And how decentralized are they actually?</p><p>That’s one of Moxie Marlinspike’s points from a blog post last week on his “<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">first impressions of web3</a> (via /rcb) that’s making the rounds in the cryptosphere.</p><p>Here’s Moxie on the problem with&nbsp;NFTs:</p><blockquote>Most people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote><blockquote>So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1">one way</a> on OpenSea, <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=details">another way</a> on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large [poop] emoji. What you bid on isn’t what you get. There’s nothing unusual about this NFT, it’s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into [poop] emoji at any time; I just made it explicit.</blockquote><p>That’s the current NFT reality. But technology has never been just about code. It’s also an inherently social endeavor — as Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">points out in his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>The NFT does not by itself convey ownership of the underlying thing in either a legal or practical sense. It conveys ownership in some more metaphysical sense: If you buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, then the people who are part of the BAYC NFT community will treat you as the owner of your ape. This is essentially a social fact and can be true even if the immutable code of the blockchain says that you don’t own the ape, because you were <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3v3ny/all-my-apes-gone-nft-theft-victims-beg-for-centralized-saviors">hacked or whatever</a>. The technology is a scaffolding on which to hang a social system, but the social system is what does or does not convey “ownership” in a meaningful sense.</blockquote><p>It’s also likely that as the space develops — web3 and NFTs really only entered the mainstream conversation last year — that new solutions will emerge to address some of those technological gaps. (For instance, your NFT might be stored on Filecoin’s Interplanetary File&nbsp;System.)</p><p>But there will also be cases where some gaps can’t be addressed or more practically, it doesn’t make sense to address them with decentralized solutions.</p><p>As Moxie points out, that’s something the industry and community as a whole will continue to grapple over going forward. There are philosophical merits to decentralization, but in order to deliver a compelling and convenient product to end users, some sort of balance will be struck between the vision of a decentralized world and the efficiency of centralized solutions. (To Moxie’s point, that’s already the case with NFTs and platforms like OpenSea.)</p><p>For Moxie, it’s about expectations:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a complaint about OpenSea or an indictment of what they’ve built. Just the opposite, they’re trying to build something that works. I think we should expect this kind of platform consolidation to happen, and given the inevitability, design systems that give us what we want when that’s how things are organized. My sense and concern, though, is that the web3 community expects some other outcome than what we’re already&nbsp;seeing.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>However, even if this is just the beginning (and it very well might be!), I’m not sure we should consider that any consolation. I think the opposite might be true; it seems like we should take notice that from the very beginning, these technologies immediately tended towards centralization through platforms in order for them to be realized, that this has ~zero negatively felt effect on the velocity of the ecosystem, and that most participants don’t even know or care it’s happening. This might suggest that decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people downstream, that the only amount of decentralization people want is the minimum amount required for something to exist, and that if not very consciously accounted for, these forces will push us further from rather than closer to the ideal outcome as the days become less&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>All of which is hardly a radical take. Decentralization in and of itself is no panacea — even if it is a cornerstone for where we’re evolving&nbsp;toward.</p><p>And as web3 continues to grow in prominence and end product, these conversations will only continue and new gaps will be identified.</p><p>One gap that will command increasing focus in 2022 is the question of identity. If technology is a fundamentally social endeavor, we need to know who we’re dealing with, whether from a personal, community, or regulatory perspective.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Matt Levin e— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876891/signal-ceo-steps-down-moxie-marlinspike-encryption-cryptocurrency">Moxie Marlinspike has stepped down as CEO of&nbsp;Signal</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/">Moxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a> — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/10/newton-signal-crypto-payments?s=09">Casey Newton on the Danger of Signal Adding Anonymous Payments</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s FTX’s <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1481381452696723459">Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweetstorm on the subject</a>, referencing <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">this blog post response from Dan&nbsp;Finlay</a>:</p><blockquote>I think Dan’s ‘right to exit’ is a key piece. Sure, there are centralized apps in crypto — FTX is one! But you have the right to exit: if you don’t like FTX, you can withdraw assets to another exchange, or to your private&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>And, in fact, everything in the crypto universe — or at least almost everything — is plugged into decentralized rails which connect all of the (sometimes centralized) pieces. It’s not perfect, from a decentralization angle. But it still helps a&nbsp;ton.</blockquote><blockquote>And those rails are not just decentralized, they’re also open to competition. Don’t like using blockchain X to transfer assets? Try blockchain Y! Banks have had the same ~2 ways of sending funds for decades, and can’t change that. Crypto exchanges generally have&nbsp;~20.</blockquote><blockquote>And, similarly, if some infrastructure provider sucks — RPC nodes, for instance — people can create a new one. That doesn’t, of course, mean that they *will* — and I think Moxie makes some really compelling points that we probably don’t do enough of that as an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>There is concentration of usage in various places, and some of those places are not really making progress.</blockquote><blockquote>In general, I really encourage people to find pieces of crypto infrastructure that seem shitty, and build competitors to them. That’s how we move&nbsp;forward.</blockquote><blockquote>And Moxie’s other point — that crypto is too profit-motivated right now — seems totally correct to me. Hopefully we can take a longer-term view of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Sam’s first point reminds me of something that an old friend told me (who properly introduced me to Bitcoin told me back in 2013): You can build centralized services on a decentralized framework, but that doesn’t hold true the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>And having that decentralization layer, having that option — whether or not people decide to take it — is powerful in and of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>To Sam’s second point, it’s probably no surprise that a lot of the real work gets done during crypto winters. (After all, that’s when Solana was developed.)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Dan Finlay: <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">What Moxie Missed on Web3&nbsp;Wallets</a>   3.

They are transforming old industries and building real world&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It reminds me of something Peter Thiel likes to say, paraphrasing: We’ve done a lot of work in the world of bits, but we need to do more work in the world of&nbsp;atoms.</p><p>(By the way, it’s not necessarily clear that those two things are mutually exclusive.

Citadel Securities is interested in getting into crypto market making, but is waiting for greater regulatory clarity surrounding digital currencies, especially in the U.S., a company spokesperson told The Information.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Paradigm and Sequoia can also connect Citadel Securities to exchanges and companies that would enable the market maker to build a crypto business. Both VC firms have invested in crypto exchange FTX, for example, as well as in Fireblocks, a startup that offers a platform for market makers to manage crypto&nbsp;trading.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to potentially securing a powerful new partner for their portfolio companies, Paradigm and Sequoia could also benefit from investing in a company that’s well-positioned to be a major player in crypto trading, in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes digital currencies as securities. That move seems likely given SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Even though many crypto advocates don’t consider digital currencies to be securities, Paradigm and Sequoia seem to be betting on that to change with their investment. Citadel Securities already has two decades of experience in trading securities and established relationships with regulators, although it has recently tangled with the SEC. Its deep connections could help it quickly become a crypto market maker in compliance with emerging regulations. Citadel Securities could also let Paradigm, which helped create a digital currency lobbying group, gain better access to regulators.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/paradigm-sequoia-to-invest-115b-in-citadel-securities-bringing-trading-firm-closer-to-crypto/">Paradigm, Sequoia to Invest $1.15B in Citadel Securities</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/business/dealbook/citadel-sequoia-paradigm.html">Ken Griffin’s Trading Powerhouse Gains New&nbsp;Partners</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402">WSJ News Exclusive | Crypto Exchange FTX Sets Up $2 Billion Venture&nbsp;Fund</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/visa-partners-with-consensys-to-develop-cbdc-on-ramp-tool/">Visa Partners With ConsenSys to Develop CBDC On-ramp Tool — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/us-banks-form-group-to-offer-usdf-stablecoin/">US Banks Form Group to Offer USDF Stablecoin</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/paypal-is-exploring-launch-of-own-stablecoin-in-crypto-push">PayPal Explores Launch of Own Stablecoin in Crypto&nbsp;Push</a>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/venmo-paypal-zelle-must-report-600-transactions-irs-rcna11260">Venmo, PayPal and Zelle must report $600+ in transactions to&nbsp;IRS</a>   6.

<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a>, a service for regaining control over your digital identity using KILT Protocol. SocialKYC is a building block for making online services in Web3 better and safer, providing a way to return your credentials to where they belong — with&nbsp;you!</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, where customers must prove they possess government-issued credentials like a passport. SocialKYC gives the user power to extend trust in a similar way, by building a digital identity using their social accounts.</p><p>SocialKYC and <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, the KILT wallet, were built by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (B.T.E.) a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT. Used together, SocialKYC and Sporran allow users to manage and store their personal credentials, and decide which elements of their private information they share with online services.</p><p>SocialKYC issues credentials to users confirming the ownership of their email address or social media accounts after the user proves that they control the account. Unlike sign-in processes on the internet to date, SocialKYC then forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. The credential, the personal information, and the control remain with the&nbsp;user.</p><p>How it&nbsp;works:</p>  SocialKYC first sends the user a simple task to verify their control of a specific account (confirm your email address; Tweet this message to prove this is your account).  After a successful check, SocialKYC issues a credential to the user. The user can save the credential in their Sporran wallet, which is installed locally on their computer. The credential states the ownership of the specific&nbsp;account.  This personal data is not stored or shared by SocialKYC. It remains in the user’s Sporran wallet under their full&nbsp;control.  Using Sporran on their local computer, users can later send their credential to any online service that accepts the credential.  Users can also choose to publish one or more of their credentials, making them accessible to anyone. Published credentials can be unpublished by the user at any&nbsp;time.  <p>Create your identity and get your first KILT credentials now! Here’s how to get&nbsp;started:</p> Get Your&nbsp;Sporran <p>The first step is setting up your Sporran, a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that serves as a wallet for your KILT credentials and KILT Coins. Download this at<a href="https://www.sporran.org/"> sporran.org,</a> then <a href="https://support.kilt.io/support/solutions/articles/80000959735-how-do-i-create-a-kilt-sporran-identity-">follow our step-by-step guide</a> to set it&nbsp;up.</p> Create Your KILT&nbsp;Identity <p>In KILT, identity starts with a unique decentralized identifier (<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/core-feature/did">DID</a>), represented by a string of numbers and&nbsp;letters:</p><p>did:kilt:light:014sxSYXakw1ZXBymzT9t3Yw91mUaqKST5bFUEjGEpvkTuckar</p><p>You will get your first DID as part of the Sporran setup. Your digital identity is built by adding different credentials like email, Twitter account, passport, certificates, etc. to this identifier. You may even want to create several digital identities; one personal, one for work, one for&nbsp;gaming.</p> Get Your KILT Credentials <p>Once your Sporran is set up, follow our guide to creating your email credential or Twitter credential via SocialKYC <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_Identity_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By default, these free credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain and are linked to a “light” DID that lives on the computer it was created&nbsp;on.</p><p>Credentials for platforms such as Discord, GitHub, and others are coming soon, which will support use cases like gaming, e-sports leagues, health care, academia, media, and decentralized social networks. We’ll announce SocialKYC partner integrations as they happen, so keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> account and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>.</p> Upgrading to a Full&nbsp;DID <p>The Sporran also provides the option to upgrade to a “full” on-chain DID. This allows you to create a service endpoint such as a url, providing a way to make your credentials public and making it easier for online services to access&nbsp;them.</p><p>Upgrading to a full DID requires a transaction fee payable in KILT (currently less than 0.01 KILT) and a deposit of 2 KILT. The deposit is designed to incentivize users to clear the data from the blockchain once it is not needed any longer, reducing wasted storage space. If you choose to delete a DID at a later date, this deposit is returned.</p><p>This could also be of use, for example, for companies who want to share their product credentials, etc. The full DID also allows the owner to set additional keys for different purposes beyond authentication, including attestation and delegation. This would allow the owner to issue their own credentials and create delegation hierarchies — useful in a company where several employees would be involved in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>On-chain DIDs will also be useful for individuals who want to publish their credentials, use key rotation for extra security, and anchor their DID anchored on the blockchain.</p><p>See how to upgrade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p> Start Building! <p>We’ve created the infrastructure. The rest is up to you, the Web3 community! Got an idea? Build it! We can’t wait to see you create services that use SocialKYC to make Web3 a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Go to our <a href="https://dev.kilt.io/">dev site</a>, read our documentation, and check out the open-source SDK. If you’re not already in the community, join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a> channel. We’re excited to see the apps and concepts you come up with. Don’t forget, KILT Treasury funds are available for creating infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We’ve started the ball rolling with a fun use case — a SocialKYC launch raffle on <a href="https://clankilt.io/raffle">ClanKILT</a>. Set up your credentials with SociaKYC, then enter to win limited edition KILT and Sporran&nbsp;swag.</p><p>Keep an eye out for more exciting uses for the full DID coming soon, like&nbsp;DIDsign!</p> About B.T.E.

Community Growth   This week, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published《<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>》, which introduced the Ontology staking strategy for the community members in detail. The article answered questions relating to ”How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node?”, and more. Community members all said that they have benefited a&nbsp;lot.  This week, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join the AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also interpreted Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481710138624929795?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1483363542262640645?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a>, with the theme “Staking”. For those who are new to Staking, they rely more on APY when choosing a node, while Ontology Harbinger Polaris and SG Node believe that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each node. It is necessary to check the comparison before the start of each Consensus Round, which can reduce problems such as staking reward&nbsp;losses.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about DID, including its function, meaning, and the changes it brings to Web3. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was invited to participate in an exclusive interview hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCoinShow/status/1482817191619829762?s=20">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and shared the latest progress of Ontology EVM. He said that Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.  Moonstake published a series of articles to introduce their strategic partners. In the article 《<a href="https://moonstake.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-in-2022/">What You Need to Know about Ontology in 2022</a>》, Moonstake elaborated on Ontology’s plans and goals for 2022, stating that they are proud to be strategic partners of Ontology. They will continue to maintain strong support for the ever-growing and developing Ontology ecosystem in 2022, building Web3 infrastructure with Ontology together.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Finextra — 《<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/21543/five-digital-identity-trends-to-watch-in-2022">Five Digital Identity Trends to Watch in&nbsp;2022</a>》</p><p>“In 2020, the world went online and fraudsters were quick to pounce on the opportunities as businesses rapidly digitised their operations. The wave of opportunistic fraudsters drove the rate of identity document (ID) fraud up by 41% in 2020. Given the rise in sophisticated identity fraud over the past 12 months and the staggering<a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/us-identity-theft-stark-reality"> losses of $712 billion</a> as a result, it is critical that organisations understand the most common trends and take the necessary steps to protect themselves. ”</p><p>With the continuous development of decentralized technology, decentralized identity is getting more and more attention. Whether it is traditional Internet giants or blockchain start-ups, they are building their own decentralized identity solutions based on blockchain technology, and are committed to building a new generation of Internet with more security and privacy. Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions.

<p>Many industries are seeing a significant increase in the use of digital services. Of course, this has been ongoing for some time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited it.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>With more digital services comes an increased risk of fraudulent activity. As customer onboarding and verification become automated, there are new challenges with which we must deal. Regulation has been devised to address such matters through the control and use of technical solutions and the checks and processes which currently exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow has developed solutions that offer state-of-the-art video-based and biometric onboarding. These have been designed to meet regulations in Europe and the Middle East. They continue to do so as regulations expand and tighten, particularly as our industry evolves and becomes more engrained as a standard part of the AML / KYC process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE is one of the furthest ahead countries in the Middle East. It has technology, AML, and electronic signature regulation in place. The country has also adopted full use of national identities. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> product is ready to meet UAE regulations and help financial institutions realize the security and user experience benefits of automated verification.  (See also our article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-accelerates-use-for-automated-identity-verification/">UAE accelerates use for automated identity verification</a>)</p>



 Growth of identity verification and regulation &nbsp; 



<p>Video and automated onboarding has increased in recent years, along with controlling regulations. Of course, there is a need to ensure secure processes, both in identity matching and in the wider area of safeguarding against fraud and money-laundering activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe and the UK have been leading developers of identity regulation. The first AML laws (the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives</a>) were released in 1991, following Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) guidance. Germany – traditionally a highly regulated market – later moved to allow video-based identity verification. Many other countries have since done the same. Being more deregulated in this area, the UK is one of the most supportive.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>This use and approval of video-based verification have quickly expanded to further automated and biometric verification. Many EU countries now permit some form of electronic identification / verification, and the trend is well set for expansion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification solutions have been developed alongside this growth. They aim to fully support new and evolving technology while also meeting the latest regulations. Many of such regulations throughout the Eurozone, have been promulgated with the input of IDnow and our relationships with national and international contacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VideoIdent was launched in 2014, largely to meet German regulators’ requirements for video-based identity verification. As regulations and technology evolved, AutoIdent was launched as a single solution offering greater user experience, faster conversion rates, and added security against fraud. </p>



<p>AutoIdent takes VideoIdent further and offers fully-automated biometric identity verification with video or agent fallback. As a fully automated or hybrid solution, Autoident encompasses current and the most recent developments in digital identity verification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">ID Verification with AutoIdent – meeting European Regulations</a></p>



<p>The regulatory trend to allow biometric solutions that rely on automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard customers is evolving across Europe, Asia, and now the Middle East. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For technical regulation, the UAE follows joint guidelines issued by The UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). They have jointly issued “<a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/sites/default/files/2021-11/Guidelines%20for%20Financial%20Institutions%20adopting%20Enabling%20Technologies%2020211107.pdf">Guidelines for Financial Institutions Adopting Enabling Technologies.</a>“   &nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulations apply to all financial institutions that are licensed and supervised under UAE law. In terms of identity verification, these are advanced and far-reaching regulations – going further than many European countries as of early 2022. They permit video onboarding as well as fully automated biometric solutions. The use of NFC technology for reading national identity cards is also permitted. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to these technical regulations, anti-money laundering laws cover monitoring and screening requirements. The primary law in the UAE is ”Federal Decree-Law No. (20) of 2018 On Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations.” These AML regulations have been designed to follow international FATF guidance, much like the European AMLD regulations.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of electronic signatures is regulated under two separate laws. Federal Law No. 1 of 2006 (eCommerce Law) applies countrywide in the UAE, while Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has introduced separate legislation under the DIFC Electronic Transactions Law of 2017. These are more open than EU laws, however, and they do not define specific <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as AutoIdent meets European regulations and is used with several financial institutions, it also complies with UAE regulations. The following are some of the main areas to consider. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of AutoIdent to meet UAE regulations for automated identity verification &nbsp; 



<p>UAE regulations permit the use of automated and biometric identity verification. Under the UAE joint regulations, an automated solution should carry out the following steps: &nbsp;</p>



  ID Proofing Check (to check the identity document is valid and genuine) &nbsp;  Similarity Check (to match the person and the identity document) &nbsp;  Liveness Check (to ensure the person is physically present) &nbsp;  



<p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution is designed to support these steps. Full automated identity verification is also supported by manual verification as a backup. If the AI is unsure of a case (or country regulations require a hybrid approach), <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">manual video-based verification</a> is available to ensure the completion of the process.  &nbsp;</p>



 







 Supporting NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>The UAE is a leader in the region with its Emirates ID national identity card. This is compulsory for citizens and uses NFC technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips, developed to meet ICAO 9303 standard. NFC is currently used to read German identity cards but can work with any chips using global standards – such as the Emirates ID.  &nbsp;</p>



 Meeting AML regulations &nbsp; 



<p>AutoIdent has been developed for compliance alongside EU AMLD regulations, and it fully meets the requirements of the latest 4AMLD, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, and 6AMLD updates.  These regulations have evolved to respond to criminal behaviour changes and increasing sophistication of methods used.  </p>



<p>UAE AML regulations, despite being first released later than EU regulations, incorporate many of the main advances seen in AMLD. This includes key areas such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Political Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and checking sanction lists.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Under AML regulations (AML-CFT Decision 4.2(b), 7.2, 15, 22, 25), enhanced due diligence must be carried out for PEPs and customers associated with high-risk countries. AutoIdent offers this functionality through add-on modules to the single platform. It handles fully compliant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML Screening &amp; Monitoring</a>. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of Qualified Electronic Signatures &nbsp; 



<p>The use of QES is relatively new in the UAE but is permitted in many areas. Crucially, the UAE’s laws allow the use of electronic signatures and state that a contract may not be deemed invalid or unenforceable solely because it is in electronic format. However, acceptance and legal basis are more open than under European regulations.   &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/electronic-signature/">Electronic Signatures</a> can only be used in some areas. Traditional paper signatures are currently still required for transactions involving immoveable property, negotiable instruments, civil documents, and other processes that require a notary public.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent fully supports eIDAS regulations for the use of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). Neither the UAE E-Commerce Law nor the DIFC law prescribes specific technical criteria for acceptable signatures, and as such, QES would not be automatically deemed acceptable. Working to the highest QES standards with a reputable provider is the best way forward, though. With limited use to date, the area is somewhat untested. &nbsp;</p>



 Webinar: The evolution of ID Verification 



 



 <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/"></a> 
<p></p>
  



 Moving to more automation in the future &nbsp; 



<p>Many countries are rapidly moving towards greater use of automated identity verification and electronic signatures. In Europe, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the UK all permit this process, and more are moving this way. The UAE is a leader in the Middle East, but other countries will likely follow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, in August 2021, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported that it had successfully implemented automated customer onboarding. This uses facial recognition techniques combined with reading NFC data from a customer’s Emirates ID card and passport.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow firmly believes that the industry is moving to document and biometric-centered identity verification – in the Middle East and elsewhere. There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in many areas (especially facial recognition). The FATF now supports this, and many more regulators are likely to follow its guidance.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">recent webinar</a>. &nbsp;</p>

 Understanding containers vs. virtual machines 

<p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> was released, beginning a shift in how we think about hosting applications and managing infrastructure. Infrastructure teams and operations had been leveraging virtual machines with great success for decades, so you may be tempted to think, “isn’t this just a virtual machine?” In spirit, yes; in application, no.</p>

<p>To talk about containers, we have to talk about virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual representation of a computer, all the way from its boot process to loading an entire operating system (OS). This provides a lot of flexibility. You gain fine-grained control over an entire virtual computer, as well as all the pitfalls of a whole computer. The operating system has to be maintained, patched, and updated; disks have to be managed, and all manner of operational overhead goes into their care and feeding. Notably, VMs are huge because an entire OS has to go on them. So when you start a VM, you have to go through the entire boot sequence of a traditional computer.</p>

<p>There are three major problem areas that containers hope to solve: ease of management, size, and speed to start. There are others, but for simplicity, I will focus on those that are the most relevant to business processes. Containers differ from traditional virtual machines in one significant way. They do not have an actual OS. This may come as a surprise to you, even if you’ve dabbled in containers before. Instead, containers rely on an abstraction of an operating system that provides hooks into the host OS using standards and conventions supplied by the container system.</p>

<p>Docker is the de facto container standard for all practical purposes, but other container technologies do exist. The notion of a standardized container comes from the shipping industry. In shipping, there was no standardization, which made transport difficult because you had to figure out how to hold each item on a boat, train, or truck. Containers provided a standard format for moving goods: “You can put whatever you want inside the container so long as it conforms to a standard set of dimensions and can be opened and bolted down in a uniform way.” This simplified the logistical process of moving real-world items. In this same way, standardizing the way a software container interacts with its host OS to delegate the responsibility for executing tasks simplifies management of the most crucial part, the application.</p>

 Hosting containers with AWS ECS Fargate 

<p>Now that we have a better idea of what makes a container different from a virtual machine, how does this solve our three problems?</p>

<p>First, containers make management easier by letting us write build scripts to create a stable, repeatable representation of the host. This is needed to do the body of work required by the application. Second, since an OS ultimately hosts the container, that OS can enforce company and security policies. In the worst case, this would be the most a given container could do. For example, if the host OS only allows traffic inbound from a specific subnet and port, the container cannot override this restriction. The container is ultimately bound by the host OS’s networking rules.</p>

<p>This kind of management reliability continues into data management, memory management, and any other policies that need to be enforced. Ultimately, the result here is business agility. Operations can open the doors to developers knowing that established guide rails are in place. As for size–our second key problem area–since you no longer need a whole OS, container images are often as small as a few MB vs. many GB. On the topic of speed–our third key problem area–since there isn’t a complete boot cycle, the container can effectively start up as fast as the hosted application.</p>

<p>The difficulty with containers moves further up the abstraction chain (as is the style of such things) than virtual machines. The challenge comes down to networking and managing container images across many resources so that you can treat a set of computing as one homogeneous unit. Fortunately, products like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mesos, Nomad, and others can help you solve these challenges. However, you are ultimately back to managing a fleet of computers along with the associated management overhead.</p>

<p>This is the sweet spot of AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate. Fargate gives you networking abstractions across a virtual network known as a VPC (virtual private cloud). This network abstraction is built right into the heart of AWS and is well vetted for any type of workload, including high-security government workloads. Fargate takes this a step further by abstracting away the machine management. You can set up traditional clusters and manage your machines if you want, but leveraging Fargate simplifies one more part of your process. Ultimately the goal with using cloud vendors is to let them handle the infrastructure management so you can focus on managing your business.</p>

<p>Time to jump in and try out .NET containers with AWS Fargate!</p>

<p>What you will need to get started</p>

<p>What you’ll need to continue are the following:</p>

 
   Basic knowledge of .NET 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/dotnet/core/install/">.NET SDK 3.1</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">An AWS account (you’ll be using a free tier product)</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI V2</a> 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker Desktop for Windows/macOS (Not required if you are on Linux)</a> 
 

<p>This tutorial assumes you already have Docker set up and running.</p>

 Build and dockerize a .NET chat application 

<p>So what do you want to build? To keep things simple and see the value in using something other than standard HTTP protocols, you’ll use SignalR to build a very basic chat application.</p>

 
   Secure: Only logged-in clients should be able to use the chat functionality 
   Chat users’ names must come from their validated identity 
   Real-time 
 

<p>To achieve this, I am going to use four technologies:</p>

 
   Okta for identity management 
   .NET to host the application 
   SignalR to provide the socket management abstraction 
   Vue.js to provide the rendering for the front-end 
 

 Authentication for Your .NET chat app 

<p>Authentication is vital in any application, but doubly so when you need to depend on who someone is. Okta makes it really easy to delegate access to those who need it and shut down access across the entire suite of applications if a bad actor gets a set of credentials.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:5000/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Note the Issuer URL and Client ID. You will need this in the next step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: To test out your chat application, don’t forget to manually add a second user to your Okta org. Log in to your Okta org and navigate to the Directory &gt; People page. Click the Add person button and fill out the form.</p>
</blockquote>

 Set up a .NET Core web application 

<p>Let us create a new ASP.NET Core web application using the <code>dotnet</code> CLI. Navigate to the location where you want to create the project and run the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet new webapp -n Okta.Blog.Chat
</code>   

<p>Let’s call the project Okta.Blog.Chat.</p>

<p>Now, set up your Okta application credentials by opening appsettings.json and add the following to the JSON object after AllowedHosts:</p>

   <code>"OktaSettings": {
  "OktaDomain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
  "ClientId": "{yourOktaClientID}",
  "ClientSecret": "{yourOktaClientSecret}"
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can find the required values from the .okta.env file created at the folder where you executed the <code>okta apps create</code> command. The value of <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> should be something like <code>https://dev-123456.okta.com</code>. Make sure you don’t include <code>-admin</code> in the value!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure to exclude appsettings.json from Git so that you don’t accidentally commit your client secret. You can generate a .gitignore file by running the command <code>dotnet new gitignore</code>.</p>

<p>Now you’ll need to add the authentication library. Run the following command inside the Okta.Blog.Chat folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Now modify Startup.cs to use the Okta authentication provider.</p>

<p>Modify the method <code>ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose. You will use it later for authorization.</p>

   <code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var oktaMvcOptions = new OktaMvcOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = Configuration["OktaSettings:OktaDomain"],
        ClientId = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientId"],
        ClientSecret = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientSecret"],
        Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    };

    services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddCookie()
    .AddOktaMvc(oktaMvcOptions);

    services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =&gt;
    {
        //options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
    });
    services.AddSignalR();
}
</code>   

<p>Make sure to add imports.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs;
</code>   

<p>This will add the authentication provider, set the page Chat as an authorized page, and add SignalR support.</p>

<p>Next, modify the method <code>Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose, you will use it later during our SignalR setup.</p>

   <code>public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        //endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The key difference here is <code>app.UseAuthentication();</code>.</p>

<p>Next, create a new folder called Hubs and a new class file in that folder called ChatHub.cs. This will provide our chat backend.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs
{
    public class ChatHub : Hub
    {
        public async Task SendMessage(string message)
        {
            if (this.Context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", this.Context.User.Identity.Name, message);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll see in this class you’ve made use of the user’s authentication status. This way, even if someone knows the backend is SignalR, you’ve mitigated their ability to use the system unless explicitly authenticated. Any additional authorization logic could go here as well.</p>

<p>Next, you need to make sure you have the pages you need. In the Pages folder, go ahead and delete the page Privacy.cshtml and Privacy.cshtml.cs and add a new page named Chat.cshtml by running the following command from the Pages folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Chat
</code>   

<p>Edit Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml and modify the second nav item from this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>To this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Chat"&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the <code>dotnet run</code> command or run the application from Visual Studio, you should be able to navigate to the chat page with the heading “Chat”. Make sure that it runs successfully before moving on to the next step.</p>

 Add Docker support to your .NET chat application 

<p>Before you add the chat functionality, add the Docker support. Add a file named Dockerfile to the root Okta.Blog.Chat folder with the following content:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:3.1-bullseye AS build
WORKDIR /src
## copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY Okta.Blog.Chat.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
## copy everything else and publish app
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:3.1-bullseye-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Okta.Blog.Chat.dll"]
</code>   

<p>We are building and publishing our application first. Next, you will copy the build files and call <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, which translates to “run dotnet with our published DLL” - nothing extraordinary, right? The <code>FROM</code> keywords use other built docker files as base images to build our image from, so the work of installing .NET is already done.</p>

<p>Now add a .dockerignore file with the below content so that they are not copied to the final image.</p>

   <code>**/.dockerignore
**/.git
**/.vscode
**/bin
**/obj
</code>   

<p>If you use Visual Studio, you’ll now have the ability to debug right into a running container in your debug toolbar. If you press F5 or click the play button, you’ll run your app in a Docker Container.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are not using Visual Studio, run the following command to build and start the container.</p>

   <code>docker build . -t okta-chat
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>.</p>

 Authorize Your chat app 

<p>Modify Setup.cs and uncomment the following line.</p>

   <code>options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: At this point, if you try to authenticate the <code>/Chat</code> path using Google Chrome, you’ll get an error. This is because you are running the app without TLS and Chrome blocks set-cookie headers with <code>SameSite=None</code> when the <code>Secure</code> attribute is not present (which will be preset only for HTTPS requests).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s make sure our docker container can run with HTTPS.</p>

<p>First, you need to create a certificate. You can use the .NET CLI for creating self-signed certificates for development. Please note that this is only for development purposes and should not be used in production.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create a self-signed certificate. Use the correct command based on your OS and use an appropriate password.</p>

   <code># clean existing certs if any
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
# create a new cert on macOS/Linux
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# create a new cert on Windows
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# trust the cert
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
</code>   

<p>Now you can run the container with HTTPS using the below command. You will use the certificate you created above and mount it as a volume.</p>

   <code># macOS/Linux
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v ${HOME}/.aspnet/https:/https/ okta-chat

# Windows
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https:/https/ okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>https://localhost:5001/</code> now.</p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings, and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs as below:</p>

   <code>Sign-in redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback
Sign-out redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/
</code>   

<p>Try running the application. You should see that to open the chat page, you’ll be redirected to the Okta Single Sign-On portal and then redirected back. You are now successfully authenticated.</p>

 Add chat functionality with Vue.js and SignalR 

<p>You’ll use Vue for state management since you can take as little or as much as you want. With Vue, you. can start with a CDN script tag and use it for a single component, a single page, or a deep dive with a robust build system on Node. For this exercise, you’ll be using a CDN-hosted script.</p>

<p>But first, you need to finish one thing on the backend.</p>

<p>Since you have created your ChatHub.cs, open Startup.cs and uncomment the following line:</p>

   <code>endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
</code>   

<p>Now modify the Chat.cshtml file to look like this:</p>

   <code>@page

&lt;div id="chatApp"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-2"&gt;Message&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" v-model="message" id="message" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="button" v-on:click.stop.prevent="sendMessage" id="sendButton" value="Send Message" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
      &lt;ul id="messagesList"&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="(item, index) in chatLog" :key="index"&gt;{{ item.User }} - {{ item.Message }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aspnet-signalr/1.0.27/signalr.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.2.24/dist/vue.global.prod.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();

  const VueChatApp = {
    data() {
      return {
        isConnected: false,
        message: "",
        chatLog: [],
      };
    },
    mounted() {
      connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
        this.receiveMessage(user, message);
      });
      connection
        .start()
        .then(() =&gt; {
          this.isConnected = true;
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          return console.error(err.toString());
        });
    },
    methods: {
      receiveMessage(user, message) {
        this.chatLog.push({
          User: user,
          Message: message,
        });
      },
      sendMessage() {
        connection
          .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
          .then(() =&gt; {
            this.message = "";
          })
          .catch((err) =&gt; {
            return console.error(err.toString());
          });
      },
    },
  };

  Vue.createApp(VueChatApp).mount("#chatApp");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>We use CDN for the SignalR client library, and the connection to the ChatHub uses the endpoint you set earlier:</p>

   <code>const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();
</code>   

<p>The state is stored in the data section of our Vue app. There are three properties in use: a flag to let us know if it is connected, the message currently being typed, and a chat log.</p>

   <code>data() {
  return {
    isConnected: false,
    message: "",
    chatLog: [],
  }
},
</code>   

<p>Your app has two methods: <code>receiveMessage</code> and <code>sendMessage</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>receiveMessage</code> is called, it appends an object to the chat log with the user and the message.</p>

<p>When <code>sendMessage</code> is called, you use the SignalR connection to invoke “SendMessage” and pass along our message properties. Once the message is sent, you blank it out to fill a new message.</p>

   <code>receiveMessage(user, message) {
  this.chatLog.push({
    User: user,
    Message: message,
  });
},
sendMessage() {
  connection
    .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
    .then(() =&gt; {
      this.message = "";
    })
    .catch((err) =&gt; {
      return console.error(err.toString());
    });
},
</code>   

<p>When the app is created, a hook is added for “ReceiveMessage” that calls the ViewModel <code>receiveMessage</code> method described previously.</p>

<p>Then the connection to the hub is started, and if successful, <code>isConnected</code> is set to true.</p>

   <code>connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
  this.receiveMessage(user, message);
});
connection
  .start()
  .then(() =&gt; {
    this.isConnected = true;
  })
  .catch((err) =&gt; {
    return console.error(err.toString());
  });
</code>   

<p>If you run your application at this point, you’ll have a secured chat application running in a container!</p>

 Deploy your .NET chat application to AWS 

<p>Now that the chat application is complete, it’s time to deploy. First, you need to build the docker image and deploy it for use in AWS. AWS has private container repositories via its Elastic Container Registry (ECR) product.</p>

 Create an ECR repository 

<p>First, you need to make one final change to the Dockerfile to get TLS working on Fargate.</p>

<p>Add the following two lines to the Dockerfile right after the <code>dotnet publish</code> command:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
...
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

ARG CERT_PASSWORD
RUN dotnet dev-certs https -ep /app/aspnetapp.pfx -p ${CERT_PASSWORD}

# final stage/image
...
</code>   

<p>This will create a self-signed development certificate right within the docker image, which you can use to run the application with TLS on Fargate for demo purposes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This type of development certificate is not recommended for production use. It is used here for simplicity in a demo. For a production setup, you should use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. Recommendation: to run a production .NET application on ECS, use an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to a reverse proxy (Nginx) via an HTTPS listener configured to use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. The reverse proxy would then route traffic to the application. The reverse proxy and the application should also be configured to use TLS using valid certificates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Log in to your AWS console and navigate to ECR.</p>

<p>Click Create Repository.</p>

<p>For visibility settings, choose Private and name your repository. Then click Create Repository at the bottom of the wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to okta-chat and click View push commands. This has all the steps you’ll need to build and push your image to ECR.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Follow the steps and push the images to ECR. Make sure to pass <code>--build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123</code> to the <code>docker build</code> command like below.</p>

   <code>docker build --build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123 -t okta-chat .
</code>   

<p>Select the copy button in the URI column next to your image and save that for later. This is the path to your image.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up the ECS Fargate cluster 

<p>Now set up your ECS cluster.</p>

<p>On the left menu, click Clusters under Amazon ECS, then click the Create Cluster button.</p>

<p>Click Networking Only &gt; Next step from the options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I named my cluster “okta-test”, name yours as you see fit, and click Create on the following screen. Then click View Cluster.</p>

<p>Now that the cluster is set up you’ll need to create a task for your image.</p>

<p>Click Task Definitions on the left menu and click Create new Task Definition.</p>

<p>For launch type, select FARGATE and click Next step.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Task Definition Name, I named mine okta-chat.</p>

<p>Set the Task memory (GB) to 0.5 GB.
Set the Task CPU to 0.25 vCPU.</p>

<p>.NET Core applications are very efficient, as are containers. For many applications, you’ll find you can serve many requests with smaller boxes than you might expect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Leave other options unchanged.</p>

<p>Now you need to define the image you want to use. Click Add Container.</p>

<p>Let us name the container the same thing – okta-chat.</p>

<p>For the Image, you’ll need the path you copied from the ECR repository earlier.</p>

<p>Set the soft limit to 512, and add ports 80 and 443.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the ENVIRONMENT section and add the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+"
ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123"
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=./aspnetapp.pfx
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Click Add at the bottom of the pop-up. Now click Create at the bottom of the page. Go back to your cluster, click on the Tasks tab, and click Run new Task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Here’s a recommendation: Create services instead of tasks for production to take full advantage of the elastic scaling capabilities of ECS. I’m using tasks directly for the simplicity of the demo. When using an ALB (application load balancer) to route traffic to the application, use of services is also required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Select FARGATE as Launch type.</p>

<p>Select your default VPC and Subnets under VPC and security groups.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Edit button next to the security groups. Click on Add rule to add a new inbound rule for HTTPS port 443. Click Save on the pop-up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, click Run Task.</p>

<p>You’ll be taken back to your cluster. Select the task you created by clicking its ID. Make a note of its public IP; you’ll need that to adjust your Okta application settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application’s name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs using the IP address from your running task as shown below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, if you navigate to <code>https://YOUR_FARGET_TASK_PUBLIC_IP</code>, you’ll see you are the proud owner of a fully functional chat application, secured with Okta, running in an ECS Fargate container.</p>

 Recap 

<p>Whew, that was a ride! Good job on making your new chat application. What can we take away from this?</p>

 
   Serverless is good for HTTP request/response, but other protocols need something different. 
   Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines but come with their own challenges. 
   A docker file consists of the instructions to build your application and launch it, and which ports to expose. 
   Fargate makes the hosting of containers easier since you don’t have to manage the host machine infrastructure. 
   SignalR makes real-time communication easier by abstracting most of the heavy lifting. 
   Vue can be used for state management without taking on additional build and development pipeline. 
   Okta makes it easier to secure any type of .NET web application. 
   There is no reason to have an insecure site! 
   Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Nginx configured to use TLS with valid certificates in production.

<p>Indicio has won the&nbsp; <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d">BC Gov “Code With Us” Challenge</a> to develop the did:indy DID Method for the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> project, the open source project housed at the Hyperledger Foundation that provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge has two goals. The first is to expand the types of content that can be written to DIDDocs, documents that instruct users on which ledger they need to find and read so that they can use verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Second, the new method will align Hyperledger Indy with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) Specification</a>. Most of Hyperledger Indy’s development occurred prior to the completion of the standard DID Specification by the W3C and, as a result, identifiers written to one network are currently not resolvable on other networks. A new did:indy DID Method will fix that and make it easier for decentralized identity products and services to interoperate across different Indy networks.</p>
<p>“Given the increasing use of Indy Networks, we are grateful to this &lt;/&gt; Code With Us challenge and to BCGov for sponsoring this important contribution,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we are committed to open-source development, and we applaud BCGov for its leadership in sponsoring critical development needs that will make interoperability easier and lead to increased adoption. We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—and it means a lot given that several of Indicio’s developers have been contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project since its inception.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Winning the challenge comes as Indico is about to kick off a series of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/11/22/hyperledger-foundation-community-training-accelerate-your-decentralized-identity-skills-with-two-free-hyperledger-indy-and-hyperledger-aries-workshops">Hyperledger Community Training Workshops</a> in using the Hyperledger Aries codebases to design and develop decentralized identity solutions. Indicio has made training on all aspects of decentralized identity a key part of its mission and product offerings. Places on the free Hyperledger workshops filled rapidly, so keep an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">eye out</a> for future events.</p>
<p>To learn more about decentralized identity training, or how to start developing decentralized identity products on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, or how to use our products, services, and hosting to create trusted data ecosystems, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>

<p>I have always given a damn about digital identity.</p>



<p>Hi. <a href="https://wider.team/team/#wolff">I’m Phil Wolff</a>. And this is a personal note to start my year. </p>



<p>I love that digital identity tries to answer deep philosophical questions. What does it mean to be human? How do we trust ourselves and each other? What is the reality we agree on? What is personal integrity? What helps civilization and a civil society endure? What is fairness and justice?</p>



<p>I love that it’s more than a technical discussion. It’s laws. Sociology. Politics and civics. Commerce. Psychology. Ethics. History. Economy. All the humanities.</p>



<p>Identity touches everything. It always will. Computation and communication continue their pervasion, and identity spreads with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity ships. I like that a few standards folks have the power to turn grand ideas into covenants into engineering protocols. To settle things for everyone for a while. To versioning something pragmatic that others can build from and evolve.</p>



<p>Shaping identity is a human endeavor. I like the geeky and artistic communities that emerge for a while around problems and opportunities. We show the best of ourselves. Comradery while tackling authenticity and the unidentified. Courage taking on concentrations of power. Conviction while building safety and security for all. Grit for persevering through long slogs to make stuff work. </p>



<p>So I’m passionate for digital identity’s formative process, its purpose, and its impact on our world.</p>



<p>That’s why I organized online for data portability as a human right (DataPortability Project). Why I literally marched on Oakland City Hall for privacy and joined police in working out a surveillance policy (Oakland Privacy). Why I promoted open data and open source in civic projects at more than 150 civic hack nights (OpenOakland). Why I fostered identity-centric startups (PDEC). Why I consult on identity as transformational strategy here with Wider Team.</p>



<p>Since 2021, I’ve worked with standards bodies on digital identity in clinical IoT, trust governance, decentralization and fiduciaries, and biometrics. I hope to continue these efforts along with the growing cadre who focus on the intersection of technology, society, and enterprise. </p>



<p>Have a healthy and impactful 2022, y’all. </p>

<p>Picture above: SSI workshop at Decentralized Web Summit 2018, San Francisco Mint, (left to right) Kim Duffy, Christopher Allen, Jonathan Holt, Daniel Buchner, Christian Lundquist, Markus Sabadello, Eugeniu Rusu, Rouven Heck.</p>



<p>At this point, we know what self-sovereign identity (SSI) is, but where does it come from? A short timeline highlights just how quickly SSI has developed. It underlines the path and development of the evolution of Internet Identity. From a centralized to a federated to a user-centric identity, the self-sovereign identity is seen as the most recent and urgently needed step in this evolution. It is independent from any individual silo, and provides three essential elements: individual control, security, and full portability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The source goes back to the 1990s&nbsp;  



<p>Christopher Allan estimates the birth of SSI in the early 90s (cf. Allan 2016). In 1991, PGP mentions a first hint towards what could become a self-sovereign identity when introducing a ‘Web of Trust’. This was an example of a decentralized trust management, but focusing only on email addresses. Therefore, PGP can be seen as one of the first to highlight a different way, in which identity can be supported by peers instead of centralized authorities. As another early thought, Allan recognizes a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created, published in 1996 (‘Establishing Identity without Certification Authority’). Ellison’s main argument highlighted that there was a need for a method of establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities (Ellison 1996).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These early approaches could mark the beginning, but it is safe to say that SSI really took off in the 21st century, along with the development and further spread of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, things have changed of course. Essentially, Sovereign is really about the individual being able to control what happens to stuff others (trusted parties) say about them. The community as a whole does not rely on web of trust infrastructure anymore for SSI, but rather connects the SSI technology with the existing trusted certification authorities (ie. the state).&nbsp;</p>



 Taking off: SSI in the 21st century&nbsp; 



<p>In 2000, the Augmented Social Network provided the groundwork for a new digital identity. Their most significant advance was ‘the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity’ (Jordan 2003).&nbsp;</p>



<p>One major contribution, paving the way for the SSI development, is the Internet Identity Workshop, which started back in 2001 and introduced on a new term: user-centric identity. It is interesting to notice that the term of self-sovereign identity itself only came into increased use in the late 2010s. At Jolocom, we used the term ‘autonomous identity’ before SSI picked up.&nbsp; One of the first references is Devon Loffreto’s blog post back in 2012, where he wrote about ‘Sovereign Source Authority’ (Loffreto 2012).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years later, Phil Windley described self-sovereign identity as an ‘Internet for identity’ (Windley 2012). He highlights three major virtues of such: no one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Ever since, SSI has grown into an ecosystem aiming to put users in control over their own personal information and data. Identity management can be expected to become increasingly significant due to the rise in digital interactions. Already, self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry.&nbsp;</p>



 The late 2010s&nbsp; 



<p>A year to remember is 2018. Back then, the emerging SSI community agreed on a high level definition of the term SSI in the Identity Position Paper by Bundesblock for the first time. INATBA’s position paper ‘What’s at stake’ in 2020 built on exactly this foundation and furthermore highlighted possible development scenarios for SSI. These efforts helped to make SSI a priority in the digitalization process within Germany and the EU. In Germany specifically, the SDI (secure digital identities) projects are a significant effort to start an SSI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a European level, developments towards an SSI friendly legal framework were proposed by the European Commission in June 2020. The initial examples of successful SSI pilots and projects across EU member states and the international momentum on the topic have found their way into the proposal for an updated eIDAS (electronic Identification, Authentiction and trust Services) regulation. This proposal It is currently being debated by the European Council and the European Parliament&nbsp; and foresees a introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets for all European citizens. The proposed regulation is taking inspiration from self-sovereing identity principles and is a great chance for Europe. It’s main potetnial lies in the provision of a legally binding Trust Framwork, as well as associated Technical Specifications for a coherent technical infrastructure. As a result, if the European Commission has its way, all public services should be available online by 2030 and 80 percent of EU citizens should use an eID solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been contributing to this process on a German, European and Global level in different capacities of the past years as Jolocom and will do our best to ensure that our vision for an open- and decentralized infrastructure will be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			 What does our new strategic partnership with Inveniam mean for issuers? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>We are off to a great start this year as&nbsp;we teamed up with Inveniam to&nbsp;unlock asset liquidity via tokenization.&nbsp;The partnership comes alongside a €5m investment from Inveniam, Apex Group, and K20 Fund.</p>
 Assets tokenized and priced&nbsp; 
<p>The most exciting part about this partnership is that <a href="https://inveniam.io/inveniamio/">Inveniam’s data solution</a> complements the T-REX ecosystem by providing tokenized assets with a valuation reference, which will fully unlock private market asset liquidity.</p>
 Covering the entire value chain of tokenization 
<p>As a result of this collaboration, securities tokenized through <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">the ERC-3643 standard and the T-REX suite</a> will be enriched with timestamped valuation data linked to their underlying assets. The result? High functioning securities that will unlock liquidity:</p>
 
 Issuance: We provide the enterprise-grade white-label tokenization platform – <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> – to help asset managers compliantly bring assets to blockchain. 
 Asset management:&nbsp;Tokenized assets and investors are managed via our T-REX platform. In addition, tokens are enriched by real-time data regarding asset valuation delivered by Inveniam. 
 Secondary trading:&nbsp;Peer-to-peer transfers are available through our compliance framework. With trusted pricing references provided by Inveniam, investors can then make fair deals with confidence. 
 
  
 Accelerating the tokenization adoption&nbsp; 
<p>By addressing the&nbsp;two biggest issues in private markets, which are pricing discovery and compliance, we are now making private market assets more accessible and liquid together with our partner Inveniam.</p>
<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.

<p>The world is moving towards digitalisation and its having both a positive and negative impact on businesses. On one hand, with the rise of cybercrime, and cybercrime damages costing the world roughly $6 trillion in 2021, regulators and authorities are looking into solutions that can ensure highest security standards. On the other hand, completely automated processes, that can be used remotely are a new requirement amongst users.</p>



<p>The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) made an important step and changed its online identification ordinance. The Austrian Anti-Money Laundering Act (Austrian AMLA) has been amended to allow for the use of a fully automated biometric process for remote identity verification. The new process allows banks and other AML-required companies to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements using a variety of remote identity verification methods. This is a positive development not only for users, but also for companies, who can now offer quicker processes and achieve better conversion rates.</p>



<p>According to the proposed amendment, biometric verification criteria must meet current state-of-the-art technology and offer the same level of security as an “in person” identity. This procedure involves technical requirements ranging from ID document security feature checks to biometric capture or Liveness Detection, which can be verified via video recording. From January 2023 onwards, a photo ID must be verified by reading the electronic security chip (NFC chip) under the current contingency under the new amendment.</p>



<p>IDnow is constantly working with the authorities, regulators and European standardisation working groups like IDO Alliance working groups from identity verification to European digital identity. IDnow is also a member of Hyperledger, W3C and, Linux Foundation, to work towards a safe, modern identity ecosystem and to ensure a superior platform for all compliance needs.</p>

<p>Over the past years, various frameworks and models for defending against cyber-attacks have been published. A popular one is the NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework), another one is MITRE D3FENDTM. Both have overlaps and differ in other areas. But, when looking at these approaches, there also are missing elements that are required for a comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>Comparing NIST CSF and MITRE D3FENDTM</p>
<p>While NIST consists of the five stages Identify – Protect – Detect – Respond – Recover, the MITRE approach has Harden – Detect – Isolate – Deceive – Evict as its five main stages. When comparing these in a matrix, it looks like this:</p>




<p>NIST CSF</p>


<p>MITRE D3FENDTM</p>




<p>Identify</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Protect</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Detect</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>Respond</p>


<p>Isolate</p>
<p>Deceive</p>
<p>Evict</p>




<p>Recover</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Table 1: Mapping NIST CSF to MITRE D3FENDTM shows that the overlaps and differences between both approaches.</p>
<p>Also, while the MITRE approach is more a list of technical steps and technologies, NIST also focuses on continuous improvements. It details the actions by mapping the functions (such as “identify”) into categories, which are split into subcategories that then reference to established standards such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or COBIT 5.</p>
<p>When analyzing the MITRE framework, one also could argue that some essential steps such as hardening the operating system. patching applications or hardening by enforcing consistent access controls at the system and application level are lacking. In addition, Access Governance for enforcing the least privilege principle, or Privileged Access Management (PAM) should be considered along with endpoint management related capabilities, which are absent. Notably, all this could be easily added to the framework.</p>
<p>The even more interesting challenge becomes apparent in table 1: The bread around the sandwich is lacking, with the phases of identify and recover not (yet) being part of the MITRE framework. NIST CSF starts with Asset Management as the first category within the first stage of “Identify”. Without understanding which systems are in place, which software is running on these systems, or how these systems are configured, the knowledge of which systems to harden in which way, or analyzing the state of security becomes difficult, as well as response becomes a challenge.</p>
 You can’t protect what you don’t know 
<p>Experience from practice tells that a lot of organizations struggle in case of incidents with the simple fact that they don’t know exactly which systems, be it clients, servers, or services, they have in place that could be affected. Identifying these systems takes valuable time and the right endpoint management systems can assist in discovery and identification actions.</p>
<p>Asset management and software inventory are essential capabilities for every defensive approach, capturing the information about the state of IT. Such repository is the foundation for automating activities for hardening/protecting as well as for response.</p>
 Response is not enough – keep your business up and running 
<p>While protecting or hardening, detection, and responsive actions such as isolation, deception, and eviction are essentials, there also is a need for recovery. These activities also must be well-prepared, for rapid reaction in case of an incident. This, e.g., might include recovering both endpoints and data in case of a ransomware attack, to return to normal work as quickly as possible. Also, in case of many other types of attacks, the ability to recover or restore to a known state is an essential capability.</p>
<p>Thus, a comprehensive approach must look beyond the technical response and forward to getting back to work based on a known, safe state. A key capability therein is the ability to recover systems, including endpoints, rapidly, which is a common capability with Endpoint Management Systems solutions available today.</p>
 Operate and automate 
<p>Last not least, it also is about automation and efficient IT operations. Neither steps such as identification and hardening, nor response or recovery, can be only based on manual activities. Efficient protection across all systems and services requires a high degree of automation, where, again, Endpoint Management comes into play. Rapid reaction equally requires automation, to be fast in, e.g., restoring systems and data.</p>
<p>IT operations is the glue that ensures that all these activities can be executed fast, efficiently, and with a high degree of automation.</p>
 Taking the best of both worlds: Bread, mustard, cheese, and more 
<p>Both frameworks, the one from NIST as well as the one from MITRE, deliver very valuable input for organizations when implementing their cyber defense, as other references such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are doing. The analysis of these frameworks also shows that there is not a single, simple answer to all challenges. The depth MITRE delivers when it comes to technical activities is impressive, while NIST CSF takes a broader perspective.</p>
<p>For being well-prepared against cyber-attacks, a broad perspective is essential, from the identification of both risks and the assets to be protected, to the ability for quickly recovering from attacks. Technologies such as UEM, Asset Management, and solutions that support in recovery from both a data perspective (Backup and Restore) as a system perspective (UEM again) thus must become part of a comprehensive approach on defense against cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Recommended Risk Framework:</p>




<p>The Sandwich</p>


<p>When To Use</p>


<p>The New Recommended Framework</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Attack</p>


<p>Identify</p>




<p>Mustard</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Cheese</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Protect</p>




<p>Ham</p>


<p>During the Attack</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Respond: Isolate, Evict, Patch</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After the Attack</p>


<p>Recover</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>Improve</p>




<p>At the end, it is like with a good sandwich. It is not only about ham or cheese, about mustard or other sauces, it also is about the bread and putting all this together the right way. MITRE D3FENDTM is a very valuable approach, providing depth at the technical level other models don’t deliver. Other approaches such as the established NIST CSF add another perspective and a broader coverage across the whole cycle of cyber-attack resilience.</p>

 SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction app <p>SmartPlaces Protocol is partnering with Ocean Protocol to enable users who contribute to social interactions through the SmartPlaces app to securely monetize their data while preserving their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The mission behind SmartPlaces Protocol is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology. SmartPlaces Protocol makes it possible for people to interact and connect in real-world situations. This is done through a geo-location based mobile application that allows them to make their thoughts and interests visible for others in a direct real-life environment.</p><p>With the “1-click-wingman”, people can easily seize everyday’s life opportunities and immediately connect with others. The hyper-localized application will be launched at a later stage in 2022 and, based on strategic partnerships, it will be made available in approx. 40 countries. In addition, SmartPlaces will provide use cases for the Metaverse, as it allows users to earn an identity and trust label based on the volume and the quality of real-life interactions with the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The SmartPlaces app data will be shared and monetized on Ocean Market. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data technology aligns perfectly with SmartPlaces Protocol’s need, as it provides a means to exchange data while preserving privacy — the data stays on-premise with the data provider, and data consumers can run compute jobs on the data — to train AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Bruce Pon, CEO of Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><p>The current data economy is not inclusive, transparent, nor does it allow for easy entry and access. The collaboration between Ocean and SmartPlaces Protocol is adding to the opportunities for people to take control over their data and monetize–this is the social media of tomorrow, fair, responsible, open, beneficial for everyone who is a part of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Hung Luu, CEO of SmartPlaces Protocol added&nbsp;that:</p><p>The digitalised world lacks real-life interactions between people. Smart Places Protocol’s vision is to create a new era of social interaction by engaging people to connect with others. I’m sure that our values and vision have the potential to align decentralized technologies with everyone on a real social level. We believe that Ocean Protocol could play a major role in enabling this ambitious but realistic plan in a distributed way. We envision that our cooperation will build a redistributed social data ecosystem, by being a solid proposition to our&nbsp;society.</p><p>We’re aware that the data produced by the user’s activities, like geolocation, consuming behaviors, and other metadata is private and must be protected. With Ocean Protocol we’re sure to have the right partner to combine privacy requirements with opportunities for monetizing these data in favor of the users, says Björn Heinze (COO &amp; Legal) expert and specialist in data protection /&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About SmartPlaces Protocol</p><p>SmartPlaces’ mission is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology and to build a decentralized ecosystem. As a result, SmartPlaces Protocol helps to (re)connect people in real life and creates unique user experiences.</p><p>SmartPlaces Protocol introduces the “connect2earn” approach and rewards all users who contribute to interact with other users. SmartPlaces Protocol will also allow users to earn NFT-based identity and trust label that covers various use cases within the Metaverse.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/smartplaces-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-unlock-data-monetization-for-web3-social-interaction-cb59d14033f5">SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>"Privacy and Consent Management" is an exciting topic in a continuously changing market. Annie Bailey has just completed her latest Leadership Compass, which researches this market segment. To mark the release of this document, she joined Matthias for an Analyst Chat episode where she talks about the innovations and current developments.</p>
<p>In A Nutshell</p>
<p>In the episode 108 “Privacy &amp; Consent Management” Matthias hosts Anne Bailey.</p>
<p>Q: “From a definition point of view, what do we need to think of when we talk about privacy and consent management?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is one of those terms where you could spin it in a lot of different ways, you know, privacy is so much in the public discourse that it doesn't really have a concrete definition anymore. So I thought it might be useful to get us all on the same page before we talk any more about it. So the way at least I have defined privacy and consent management in this most recent report. It's, of course, considering organizations and it's their administrative and governance capabilities over data privacy within their organization and of course, the tools and the solutions that are there to make that happen. So you could think of it then in a simplified manner about the capabilities that such a tool or a solution would have to the first group of capabilities, would then to be able to manage any incoming signals about privacy and consent. So these are things like being able to manage cookies and trackers that are on websites, being able to accept and then implement those consent or preference choices that an end user would make. And that would be over the range of different channels. So on a smart TV, on a mobile device, on a website, over the phone, via email in person interactions as well, should be considered. So that's all about managing the incoming signals. But what's also very important as well is the organization's ability to take care of their own internal management of privacy. So being able to govern sensitive data, which is in the organization and private data, being able to document their steps towards compliance and something which is a buzzword in this most recent report is being able to operationalize privacy.”</p>
<p>Q: “Recently, you published an updated version of your Leadership Compass report, which compares providers and services. What are the changes in the market that you can observe that you want to share with us?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is an especially dynamic market area. Things are always changing. And so we can see some pretty big market changes between the report which published 18 months ago or so and the one which just came out this week. And that's in the types of vendors that were interested in participating. So what we saw in the last report were a lot of vendors that really focused on being able to manage those incoming signals, so being very focused on cookie management, on being able to collect consents and preferences and make sure that those are all able to be implemented in the many different connected systems within an organization and all the downstream vendors that may impact. Very focused on this incoming flow of information from end users. And what we saw, which was different in this report, is that there were more vendors that are really focused on data governance and using that as a foundation for privacy. So being able to operationalize and take action within the organization to further their privacy goals. And so we could think of that as an example. So being able to identify a privacy weakness of some sort in a process and then from that same administrative screen, then be able to do something to address that weakness. I guess we could go into more concrete details on what that could be. So, you know, if there was a scan done on a database and that scan returns the notification that there is private information in this database, there would then be the chance to leverage automation to go and anonymize those sensitive fields. So you're then connecting information about the status of privacy in the organization with an action to then improve it. So that was something that we noticed among several of the vendors that they're moving more in this direction. And that also does connect back to the relationship between the end user and the organization. So there was a big focus on being able to provide support for data subject requests and being able to process those. So in the same way of operationalizing privacy, if a consumer then submits a data subject request, the administrator would then be able to scan and automatically compile a report containing their personal information rather than needing to do that manually.”</p>
<p>Q: “Vendors offer products and services globally. Do you think they can catch up with changing privacy and consent requirements?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And frankly, this is really hard to stay up to date with because given our very globalized presence on the internet and connection with consumers all around the world, many organizations do have to stay up to date with the regulations that are not just for their own jurisdiction and in the region where they reside, but they have to pay attention to where their customers are, where any of their downstream suppliers or, you know, MarTech partners may reside and where this data is moving. So they have to be aware of a much wider legal domain than they've been used to before. And as I mentioned before, this is a really dynamic space. And part of that is because there are many privacy regulations which are being released all around the world. So this is something that we've identified as a really key capability in privacy and consent management tools, is that having some basis, some support from legal experts in-house to be able to keep up with all of these changing regulations and be able to pass that knowledge down to their customers is a really valuable thing.”</p>

 To stake or not to stake? Or even better, should I choose to stake or should I create my own candidate node instead? Is it worth it? What are the benefits? This and more you can find answered in this article, brought to you by your Telegram admin, Ontology Harbinger and proud owner of candidate node “CZ/SK Ontology community node”,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.  Which one is better for&nbsp;me? <p>In order to make a correct decision, you should know what staking is, what it means to run a candidate node, and what are the main differences. To put it simply, staking means that you assign your ONTs to a candidate or consensus node. For doing this, you earn ONG rewards based on the distribution ratio set by the node owner. On the other hand, as a node owner, the main advantage is that you manage the distribution ratio. Let’s see the main pros and cons of both approaches.</p> Staking <p>(+) Low limit - you can stake as little as 1 ONT, while the upper limit depends on how much the specific node can accept from&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Higher flexibility - you can decide to cancel the full, or part of the stake at any time. Your tokens are unlocked when consensus round ends (in the case of unstaking from candidate nodes).</p><p>(+) No entry barrier - no extra fees applied, only a transaction fee of 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>(-) Trust in the node owner - your rewards depend mainly on the node’s distribution ratio, the risk is that node owner can change it or even cut it to 0, which may force you to stake to a different node. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to either stake with nodes that have stable fee sharing ratio checkmark at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, or regularly check whether the node you stake with changed the ratio to unfavorable values.</p><p>(-) Switching nodes - if you decide to change a node, cancelling the stake and staking to a different node will result in losing 1 consensus round of&nbsp;rewards.</p> Candidate node&nbsp;owner <p>(+) You manage the distribution ratio - you decide on how much % of generated rewards you keep, and how much is distributed to your&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Potentially higher rewards - explained in next parts of&nbsp;article.</p><p>(+) A way to promote yourself/your company.</p><p>(-) Higher entry limit - minimum amount to start a candidate node is 10,000&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>(-) Lower flexibility — as a node operator you can not reduce your stake below 10,000 ONT, or unstake such an amount that would result in user stake being more than 10x higher than your remaining node stake (example: your node stake is 15K ONT, user stake is 100K ONT, at max you can unstake 5K ONT). In case you would need to unstake more, you must cancel your node entirely.</p><p>(-) Entry fee - to start a node you need to pay a fixed 500 ONG fee, + 0.05 ONG transaction fee.</p> Summary <p>Staking is a great way to get passive rewards for holding your ONTs. Moreover, it is suitable for everyone as you can stake from as little as 1 ONT, and it also provides more flexibility than when you run a node. You can learn more about staking in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a>. On the other hand, if you have more than 10,000 ONTs, and you are a long term holder that wants to maximize your rewards, it is a good time to consider creating your own candidate node.</p> I want to run a candidate node! <p>So you decided to run a candidate node? In the next part, I will cover how to create a candidate node, the requirements, and possible strategies.</p> How it&nbsp;works? <p>Ontology candidate nodes are nodes which do not validate transactions. They could become active validators if they get to the top 15 by size, which would turn them to consensus nodes. A basic candidate node is something like staking pool, which creates room for stakers. Therefore, once you register a candidate node, and you are not in the top 15, you are not required to have your device online 24/7. This is all you need to start generating ONG rewards. In addition, you could run an online node, which synchronizes the blocks generated by consensus nodes. This would require your device to be online but does not bring you any extra rewards as you do not actively participate in consensus. If you still want to go in that direction, then you can find documentation at <a href="https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract">https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract</a>, but it also requires some technical skill.</p> How to launch a candidate node? <p>The main tool you need is OWallet on your PC. It is a desktop wallet application developed by Ontology. Download it only from the official GitHub source: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases</a>.</p><p>Once you have OWallet installed, you can create a new wallet, import your existing wallet, or use a Ledger hardware wallet. Last but not least, you need at least 10,000 ONT in your wallet address, + at least 500.05 ONG. Ontology published a step-by-step guide on how to proceed within OWallet, you can find the guide here: <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node</a></p><p>Once you launch the node within OWallet, and set important settings, you just need to wait until a new consensus round begins. At that point, your node generates rewards which will be available for you to claim after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> Explanation of important settings in&nbsp;OWallet <p>There are few important settings, which you definitely should not miss because they define rewards distribution as well as how stakers see&nbsp;you.</p>  Allowed stake unit — located at the “User stake Authorization” page, determines how many ONT your node can accept from stakers. By default it is set to 0, which means stakers can not stake at your node. The maximum value you can set is 10x of your initial node stake, and you can also see this value in the table below. So, if your node stake is 10K ONT, you can set a maximum of 100K&nbsp;ONT.    Fee sharing ratio — located at at “User Stake Authorization” page, determines the distribution ratio of rewards between the node operator and its stakers. You set the ratio for the node’s initial stake and user stake separately. Remember, in OWallet, you set reward values which you, as node operator, decide to keep. The remaining rewards are automatically distributed to stakers. The first value represents % of rewards generated by the node initial stake, while the second value represents % of rewards generated by the user stake. If you set it to 100/100, this would mean you keep all rewards and stakers get 0 (so nobody will stake with you). On the other hand, if you set it to 0/0 then all rewards will go to the stakers and you get 0. The trick is to find the ideal setting which fits your strategy. Some popular ratios are 90/10, or even more generous to stakers, 90/5. This would be displayed to stakers at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> as 10/95. Keep in mind that any change of ratio takes effect in the consensus round after the next one. (Example: you change the ratio in OWallet during round 150. When round 151 begins, it will be displayed to stakers at node.ont.io as the next round ratio and becomes effective when round 152&nbsp;begins).  Node info — it is a separate page where you can fill in all the information about your node. For instance, you can change the node name, set a logo, etc. If you want to obtain a “Verified” checkmark next to your node at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, you need to also fill in the “Email to contact with Ontology”. You can learn more about checkmarks at <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark</a>   When will I get&nbsp;rewards? <p>Reward distribution frequency is the same as when you are a staker. You do not get rewards for the round during which you launch a node, but you get your first rewards for the next consensus round. Rewards are added to your profit section each time when a consensus round ends. You can claim them after each round, or keep them accumulating and claim anytime you like. (Example: you launch the node during consensus round 150, you will get your first rewards when round 151 ends and the next rewards when round 152 ends,&nbsp;etc.)</p> Candidate node possible strategies   Operator only — some candidate nodes decide not to allow user staking to their node so they participate only with their node initial stake. In this case, they keep all rewards generated by node initial stake, but lose the potential of getting additional rewards from user stake. The difference from normal staking is that they do not need to worry about changing the distribution ratio, because they are node&nbsp;owners.  Self promotion — some nodes may decide to use their node for promotional purposes, such as Unifi Protocol node, which distributes 100% of all rewards to stakers. Node operator gets 0 rewards but in return is well visible in the community, which can help achieve long term goals of the operator in the&nbsp;future.  Win/win — this strategy means that you set a distribution ratio, which gives you, as node operator, higher rewards than you would get with the “operator only” strategy, and at the same time gives good rewards to stakers, which motivates them to stake with you. Success of this strategy depends on the node operator’s ability to attract stakers, because the goal of such a node is to achieve 100% filling of the staking capacity. An example may be Harbinger nodes, which are represented by outstanding members of the Ontology community. Stakers can decide to stake with those Harbingers to support them and their work, instead of some company or corporation.  Anything else — you can develop your own strategy which fits you best&nbsp;:)  <p>In the end, I hope this article helped you with your decision making process. Now it is your turn, whether you decide to stake or run a candidate node, that fully depends on your own preferences. Should you pick any of them, I welcome you&nbsp;onboard!</p><p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon.

They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.

<p>In the world of real-time ACH payments, open banking instant account verification is quickly making the old, manual methods look like the rotary phone. Why use an unreliable relic, when there’s a better, more secure, faster innovation? Throughout the years, financial institutions have relied on voided checks, manual routing and account number input by the consumer and microdeposits. These require days or weeks to complete, and are prone to errors or fraud.</p>
<p>More recently, data consortiums were used to confirm customer-submitted account details, checking them against existing databases. This assisted with clearing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Mixed-solution authenticators provided a fraud risk rating for the account being verified, but their information was sometimes based on older data. At best, these methods yielded only a sensible prediction of risk. With FinicityPay, failed payment risk is mitigated by obtaining account owner and balance insights prior to processing.</p>
<p>Previous methods of verification were rife with processing delays and lost revenue due to failed payments and fraud. Open banking APIs and platforms are the next evolution of payments. Faster, more secure and more transparent.</p>
 Open Banking Platforms Create a Real-Time Network of Connections to Financial Institutions 
 
 Trusted financial data aggregation platforms facilitate secure access to consumer-permissioned data via traditional connections (enriched with bank-level security) and APIs. 
 Tokenized access to account credentials is granted to third-party financial services innovators, utility providers and investment platforms, opening up consumer options. 
 Open banking is making third-party ACH payments faster and more secure, maximizing savings, rewards and investment opportunities. 
 A simple account balance check smooths the pre-funding path and protects consumers and merchants alike from failed payments and potential fees. 
 
<p>Using secure, consumer-permissioned access, financial institutions and vendors now get instant account balances and data from a consumer’s bank. Owner details, addresses, account and routing numbers and real-time balances are all immediately available. They can be scrutinized before authorizing payments on an open banking platform. Account access credentials are packaged into a “token” that can be passed to a third party. It yields no meaningful data if intercepted and hacked. This new level of security is spawning a much larger, more niche-oriented market of financial services providers and app developers. Open banking applications allow users to move money at the speed of the market.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Opens Up Payment Enablement and Authentication 
 
 Innovation across all data-sharing stakeholders in the ecosystem expands what you can do to verify data and customize it to fit your payment use cases. 
 New technologies like AI are now available to integrate into your user experience. Move customers through your account setup process quickly and intuitively, while gaining permission to curated data that fits your needs.&nbsp; 
 Once an account is authenticated, payments from it can be issued instantly (dependent upon market/account providers) throughout your suite of products. Financial management, investment, utilities and recurring payments are all open for immediate money movement. 
 
<p>All of this has been revolutionary for consumers. Their mobile phones are full of financial services options powered by open banking, and they’re adopting them at a rapid pace. With a few taps on the screen, a user can grant permission to third-party apps and platforms, without having to type in account or routing numbers. The app or service the user wants to access is up and running with a full package of information pre-loaded. Secure, real-time ACH payments can be made within moments of installing and setting up an app. With the richer level of insight that’s available through consumer-permissioned data, developers are giving consumers a wealth of new options for managing, spending, and borrowing money. This is industry-changing innovation. It’s giving consumers more flexibility and ownership of their financial position than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Simplifies the Payments Experience for Consumers 
 
 Customers aren’t asked to supply sensitive information, just permission to their accounts. 
 No more waiting periods for further verifications, like microdeposits or database checks. The customer’s data is pulled in milliseconds and rolled into the app they’re using, making real-time payments a breeze. 
 Financial management apps with AI integration pull together a holistic picture of the consumer’s moment-to-moment financial well-being.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While authenticating account details, ownership and current balance can streamline your payment process, it also reduces the hassle of setting up accounts and making payments for your customers. Enhancing their experience, especially when setting up payment is one of the first interactions they have with you.</p>

        <p>Major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte.</p>
  <p>On January 24, 2022, major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The upgrade to 4GB is a breakthrough that will help everyone in the BSV ecosystem. TAAL is here to support the community and to help every BSV transaction processor to mine bigger and bigger blocks. That’s why we’re encouraging all miners to immediately increase their excessive block size limit to 4GB. They’ll be able to take full advantage of the node upgrade to expand their revenues and client base,” said Lars Jorgensen, TAAL Chief Operating Officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin protocol does not have a limit on the block size (!), it is up to the decentralized transaction processors (aka “Miners”) to decide how big a block they accept based on their own capacity.</p>
<p>The market decides. When there is a market demand for more transactions and thereby larger blocks, the transaction processors will invest in hardware, network and energy contracts to be able to capture and handle more transactions efficiently and earn the transaction fees on the transactions they process and store.</p>
<p>The old term “Crypto Mining” becomes irrelevant as the initial “block reward” diminishes and becomes irrelevant compared to the massive amount of (very low) transaction fees. Transaction processors are not “mining crypto” they are processing transactions and storing data in the distributed blockchain.</p>
<p>Now when the Bitcoin blocks become larger and store many million transactions, the energy cost per transaction also becomes irrelevant, especially as the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) becomes very high due to the practical use of Bitcoin blockchain technology in for example enabling Global Supply Chains to become more efficient.</p>
<p>Global Supply Chains waste at least 80%! i.e., global supply chains end-to-end aggregated efficiency is less than 20%. If we can increase global supply chains efficiency by just some percentages by using Bitcoin Blockchain technology the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) will be enormous! Not to mention the enormous positive environmental and sustainability effects that will bring us.</p>

			<p>Tokeny, the Luxembourg-based tokenization platform, announced today a partnership with Inveniam Capital Partners, Inc. (“Inveniam”), a SaaS company delivering trust, transparency and completeness of data to private market assets. The partnership includes a €5m investment by Inveniam, Apex, and K20 Fund.</p>
<p>Inveniam works with private market asset owners and managers to deliver trusted valuation and pricing data using distributed ledger technology. This data underpins private market digital assets and gives these assets integrity upon which market participants can establish price discovery. The benefit to asset owners and managers is a more liquid asset, which can unlock value.</p>
<p>Tokeny offers a comprehensive and institutional-grade white-label solution for digital assets that allows asset owners and managers to efficiently and compliantly issue, transfer, and manage digital assets. All processes, from the client onboarding process including KYC/AML checks to the administration required to manage investor subscriptions, capital tables, distributions, capital calls, etc., are streamlined on the Tokeny platform.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to fully unlock asset liquidity via tokenization, which will be facilitated by providing all technical solutions private asset owners need, covering the entire value chain of tokenized assets underpinned with trusted data regarding asset valuation and pricing. These synergies can return significant value to each company’s clients.</p>

		 
	 
    We’ve been watching the Tokeny team’s progress and product evolution for more than two years and know they're building next-gen tokenization systems the efficient and compliant way. Totally altering the global trading of private market assets will only work on the institutional level if the experience is seamless, the technology is top-notch, and the right regulatory structures and business networks are in place. This partnership addresses all those requirements for success.  Patrick O'MearaChairman and CEO of Inveniam    
	 
		 
			<p>While Tokeny’s solutions provide a compliance infrastructure enabling asset managers to easily bring nearly every kind of real-world asset to blockchain, Inveniam allows their investors to access trusted data and asset valuation. Liquidity will be realized as investors can conduct peer-to-peer transfers using Tokeny’s compliance framework with a fair and transparent price reference provided by Inveniam.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokeny’s capabilities pick up right where Inveniam’s end and vice versa, addressing two biggest obstacles in private markets — pricing data and compliance — on a hyper-efficient infrastructure. In tandem with this very synergistic partnership, the investment by Apex, K20, and Inveniam will allow us to further improve our solutions and accelerate the adoption of tokenization with the best-in-class technology.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.</p>

			 About Inveniam 
<p>Inveniam is a blockchain-based fintech company, headquartered in Miami, Florida, with offices in New York City and Novi, MI. Founded in 2017, Inveniam has built Inveniam.io, a powerful technology platform that utilizes big data, AI, and blockchain technology to provide not only surety of data, but high-functioning use of that data in a distributed data ecosystem. Through Inveniam’s platform, users can obtain real-time pricing of private, infrequently traded assets, accelerate diligence, accurately price assets, and identify buyers for those assets. Inveniam’s platform credentials data to commute trust throughout the global financial system. Inveniam holds numerous patents pertaining to the ingestion of data into smart contracts. As of January 2022, there are $5.7 billion in assets on the platform.</p>
 About Tokeny&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly and seamlessly issue, transfer, and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.&nbsp;Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance, and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

 MetaMUI and Sovereign Yidindji Government launched 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based National ID&nbsp;system 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based App “Yidindji SSID” for Yidindji’s National ID&nbsp;system<p>We are delighted to announce that our first E-Government pilot program with the Sovereign Yidindji Government has been successfully completed on Jan 7,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji government is a representative of Sovereign Yidindji which is a rainforest-based micronation with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent and it has a combined population of more than 150,000 Australian citizens and Yidindji citizens. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Yidindji territory. Currently, SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become fully digitized in its venture towards E-Governance and national ID&nbsp;system.</p><p>The purpose of this pilot program was to establish the world first fully blockchain-based E-Government. During the six-month pilot program, Sovereign Wallet Network(SWN) team has implemented the first self-sovereign identity-based national identity system to digitize all government services such as digital identity authentication, vaccination certificate, and digital administrative works.</p><p>We just finished our first step to open the gate for making governments become automated and fully compatible with each other country on top of MetaMUI Blockchain. MetaMUI Blockchain is the world’s first blockchain that every government and institution can issue their own digital currency while complying with all the financial legal conditions. MetaMUI Blockchain allows users to have their own Decentralized Identity(DID) and all the personal information of the users only stays inside the users’ device. Every ownership of the assets is bound to the identity of the user, not to the private key, therefore it can be recovered should the user lose the private key. This will make every bank adopt MetaMUI Blockchain to build a practical application for their customers and it will allow the customers borrow, lend and store their digital currency and digital assets through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Yidindji SSID and MetaMUI SSID will soon provide more functions such as storing various digital assets including NFTs, Carbon Credits, Stocks and even gold certificates. These 2 apps will also present a special feature called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a two-way cryptographic binding system that enables users to login any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Users can also avoid phishing websites through its Pairwise Trust function because the two-cryptographic binding makes possible not only the users prove themselves to the website but also the website must prove itself to the users through the&nbsp;system.</p><p>More innovations will come through the year of 2022 and our journey has just begun. We are glad that we could deliver this wonderful news to our audience at the very first month of this year and we will keep building and developing our technology to make a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Cointelegraph article:<br><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system">https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system</a></p><p>Sovereign Yidinji SSID Launch Video: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

 Ontology Opens New German Office To Expand Its Digital Identity Solutions and Web3 Infrastructure Across&nbsp;Europe  Ontology aims to contribute to the burgeoning European privacy ecosystem through new partnerships, community members, and employees <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has today announced the opening of a new European office in Berlin,&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>Ontology’s move reflects its alignment with Europe’s efforts to increase data privacy and protection through legislation such as GDPR. In addition, the European Commission’s endorsement of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663">Digital Identity</a> as a more secure and convenient means for data storage and exchange for citizens makes Germany an ideal environment for Ontology’s expansion. By opening its new office in Europe, Ontology aims to play a role in increasing privacy across the continent and highlight the benefits that its decentralized solutions can bring to users and regulators alike.</p><p>Increasing privacy, transparency, and trust, Ontology’s high speed, low cost blockchain is designed to give users and enterprises the flexibility to build blockchain-based solutions that suit their needs, while also ensuring regulatory compliance. <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application, which enables users to fully control their digital identity, surpassed 1.5 million users in September 2021. Other products include the <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a> wallet, which allows users to securely manage their identities, data, and digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Europe is one of the largest hubs for blockchain related services and Web3 innovation worldwide, with much of the action happening in Berlin, which has seen over <a href="https://links.angel.co/u/click?_t=26b4e8aeb47d4cd3acd5eba415f76f62&amp;_m=2bf0624adc7b4627af6b1684bdcb8210&amp;_e=jnAKQaFyCL4Xj1-PO3VdQpiRJtpBJducEChrJfyUW_7VgEonJHdQ_piG16mHseFTHkoy_KCla9fVN9G5Kxjv510qFjOP9hi0Sr9heMsNfrNXTpACCiVi8nRszWWQZJG01YxUCeiKjWXBtRxjaKWqEmgT2I5ngx69Am-m7pEHHcI-reY_05akQEdngBU6eTx9BhfT19nc8UlJBj0ZEdarrvYiWMDhh465x-4Bf5gm7rivF-iNmvaW5nH30ApI3LZHIvaUbHUGObxEIn6FtKCNJgSI-gVfXOk3gRnMy8IPAqmsaxeNptRUr-P45G8yd1Vl7j_Hj6q9rhn-ezY9aYvHUaNb0pjmzCTXzw7UFPgrkZLmoQdgU4-wV9ZryYKpMutH">$13 billion of investment</a> since 2016. As such, Ontology has chosen Berlin as a key strategic location where it will aim to expand its reach and capitalize on the incredible talent and resources available.</p><p>Gloria WU, Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships at Ontology, said: “Europe sits at the forefront of Web3 and technical innovation and its continued focus on increasing user privacy and security aligns clearly with our mission at Ontology. By opening our new office in Berlin, we are excited to contribute to the continent’s ongoing efforts to create a more secure web. We look forward to growing our presence in Europe and contributing to the ecosystem through a host of new partnerships, community members, and employees. We are currently hiring for a number of roles available.”</p><p>The opening of the office supplements Ontology’s long standing roots in Europe, which have been established through a host of different partnerships. Following on from its previous partnership with Mercedes parent Daimler Mobility to develop<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc"> Welcome Home</a>, an in-car system designed to transform driving experiences, Ontology recently <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-decentralized-mobility-platform-bloxmove-to-bring-interoperable-6490c6f50112">partnered</a> with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-decentralized-mobility-platform-bloxmove-to-bring-interoperable-6490c6f50112">bloXmove</a>, a European mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation. The partnership will see bloXmove integrate Ontology’s decentralized digital identity protocol into its platform, providing users with an identifier that will allow them to share their verifiable credentials, such as driving licenses and passports just once, in a way that is totally private, secure, and encrypted.</p><p>Specifically in Berlin, Ontology has partnered with the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-to-collaborate-with-berlins-htw-university-to-advance-blockchain-education-research-7ee413022d56">Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft</a> (HTW) University to explore joint research and teaching initiatives, with a view to developing a number of bespoke blockchain applications.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>However, in 2017, a new prompt appeared in the login flow, before you were taken to the website. The following screenshot came from an iOS app preparing to log you in with Facebook. The interface prompt informs you that a specific app, the Yelp app in this example, wants to use a specific website to sign you in, and it warns you about information sharing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with this prompt:</p>

 
   
    <p>Problem One (Where did this prompt come from? ) : Many people consider this a bad user experience because the prompt looks out of place, and the wording is confusing and might alarm end users.</p>
   
   
    <p>Problem Two (Ambiguous UI message): If you implement logout functionality through the same flow, the prompt still says Sign In, even though the user may have already clicked a Logout button. This too is confusing to the end user, as shown in the following screenshot. This problem is reported as <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/255">a bug on the AppAuth library</a>, although it was designed as a security and privacy feature.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>In this article, I’ll go into more detail on aspects of the iOS platform limitations. I’ll explain why this prompt is shown and how to get around it to build a more seamless user experience.</p>

<p>Specifically, this article will:</p>

 
   explain the evolution of iOS over time, and how and why this prompt was introduced. 
   describe various ways you can invoke a standalone or embedded browser on iOS, and explain the cookie-sharing behaviors. 
   discuss several ways to eliminate the confusing user experience issues we’ve identified above. 
 

 A brief history of iOS evolution 

<p>The browser options available for authentication  on an iOS device have changed significantly over the years, as Apple continues to add capabilities to enhance user privacy.  To understand the behavior of the browser options provided on iOS, some historical context is  helpful.</p>

 Authentication prior to iOS 9 

<p>Before the release of iOS 9 in 2015,  there were only two ways to authenticate through a web browser, and neither one was optimal.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>UIWebView</code>. This approach shows web content in a <code>UIView</code>. The mobile app can intercept interactions with the <code>UIView</code>,  hence it is not secure.</p>
   
   
    <p>Redirect to an external browser. The mobile app can open a webpage in a separate browser app, and the browser app can redirect back to the mobile app after authentication. However, app switching is not a good experience for mobile users. In addition, the redirect back can fail if another app has registered the same URL scheme first.</p>
   
 

 Authentication in iOS 9 (2015) 

<p>In 2015, Apple introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code></a>, which displays an embedded Safari browser in the app. As an in-app browser tab, this interface lets the user stay in the app. Once the user interaction with the website is no longer needed, the browser tab can be closed and dismissed.</p>

<p>This solution was groundbreaking, because it is secure (the native app can neither peek into the embedded browser, nor alter its state) and it provides a better user experience by avoiding app switching.</p>

<p><code>SFSafariViewController</code> shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. This gives developers a way to implementSSO (Single Sign-On) with shared cookies..</p>

 iOS 11 changes (2017) 

<p>Apple changed <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior to address privacy concerns with the release of iOS 11 in 2017. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. Thus, a website can no longer determine that the user on <code>SFSafariViewController</code> is the same user on Safari, even though the view controller and the browser are open on the same device.</p>

<p>Apple understood that  the <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior change would break SSO, since single sign-on relies on the ability to share cookies. Instead, Apple had to introduce <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> as a workaround, where <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> would share a persistent cookie with Safari.</p>

 Iterative changes in iOS 12 (2018) 

<p>In 2018, Apple deprecated <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code>, but introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession"><code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code></a> as a revised solution.</p>

<p>Both <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are designed specifically for OAuth 2.0 authentication, not for showing general web content. To avoid abuse, when <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are used, Apple always displays the prompt we saw earlier. The prompt is designed explicitly for user sign-in, and indicates that cookies are shared.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Apple does not know whether an <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> is invoked  for sign in, sign out, or general web browsing. This is why the prompt text is generic. It only states that your app is trying to Sign In, regardless of the actual use case, which results in the ambiguity described earlier in  Problem 2.</p>

 iOS 13 changes (2019) 

<p>In 2019, Apple introduced <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> as an option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If this option is set to true, <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> does not show the prompt above, and as a consequence, it does not share cookies with Safari. This gives developers a choice. Either they gain  a better user experience with no confusing prompt and no SSO, or they get  SSO, along with the annoying prompt.</p>
 <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> behavior 
<p>The various browser options offer differing levels of cookie sharing in order to limit websites’  ability to track a user.</p>

<p>The cookie-sharing behavior is not well documented in Apple’s documentation. The  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> doc</a> mentions that, “In iOS 9 and 10, it shares cookies and other website data with Safari … If you would like to share data between your app and Safari in iOS 11 and later, … use <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> instead.”</p>

<p>A few third-party websites extend Apple’s documentation to highlight that persistent cookies are shared between an embedded browser and Safari. Unfortunately, it is rarely known that session cookies can also be shared between different embedded browsers. If your application just needs SSO between your mobile apps, you do not have to use a persistent cookie; a session cookie is sufficient.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the complete sharing behavior in iOS 11 or later. I’ve omitted <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> for brevity because it is deprecated, but it behaves the same as <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. I’ve also omitted the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> because when it is set, cookies are not shared at all. 
I also use SVC as shorthand for <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and WAS as shorthand for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>.</p>

 

  
    
      
        &nbsp;
        APP1 + SVC
        App1 + WAS
        App2 + SVC
        App2 + WAS
        Safari
        Other browsers (ex.: Chrome)
      
    
    
      
        Session cookie
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ❌
      
      
        Persistent cookie
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ✅
        ✅
        ❌
      
    
  

 

<p>In the following iOS cookie behavior demo video, you can see how the session cookie and the persistent cookie are shared. The session cookie sharing behavior is not intuitive. Even when App1 is closed (which should clear all session cookies), opening App2 would make it possible to see App1’s session cookie.</p>

 
            
         

<p>It is worth noting that in iOS 14 and later you can specify another browser, such as Chrome, as the default. This does not affect the sharing behavior. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> always use Safari under the hood, so they will never share cookies with browsers other than Safari, even if they are set as the default. The term system browser, often used in online articles, is synonymous with Safari.</p>

 Solution: how to remove the extra prompt 

<p>Now that we’ve reviewed the evolution of iOS browser behavior, and explored the rationale for the changes, let’s look at solutions to improve the user experience.</p>

 Solution to problem two 

<p>Solving problem two only – eliminating the ambiguity of the prompt message – is straightforward: Use the browser for sign-in only; do not use the browser to sign out. You can sign out of your application directly by revoking the access token and the refresh token. Okta provides a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/main/">revoke API</a> that you can call directly.</p>

<p>Revoking a token works as a solution if you are okay with signing the user out of the native app only. The user may still have a login session in the browser, and if the native app wants to log in again, the browser will not ask the user for credentials before granting an access token.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach if your web session may be supporting many different native apps. For example, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/reference/current/FB.Logout/">FB logout</a> specifically recommends not to log out of the web session.</p>

<p>However, if you require a stronger privacy and security posture, for instance for a banking app, keeping the web session alive may not be an option.</p>

 Solutions to problem one 

<p>There are two potential approaches to solve problem one.  Both solutions use browser components that do not show a prompt. Both have the drawback that no cookie can be shared, so SSO will not work. If your app requires SSO, you’ll have to find a new way to share login sessions. Fortunately, Okta recently introduced <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO</a>, which allows native apps to implement single sign-on without cookies. See our <a>blog post on SSO between mobile and desktop apps</a> for a full example. The following code shows how to remove the prompt, and it assumes your app either does not require SSO or uses Native SSO.</p>

<p>First, you can use the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If you are using the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS</a> library, you can configure the <code>noSSO</code> option as follows:</p>

   <code>let configuration = OktaOidcConfig(with: {YourOidcConfiguration})
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
    configuration?.noSSO = true
}
</code>   

<p>Under the hood, the <code>noSSO</code> option sets the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> flag. Note that this flag is only available in iOS 13 and above.</p>

<p>Second, if you desire to support older iOS versions, you could use <code>SFSafariViewController</code> as the browser to present the login session. The following demonstrates how to launch <code>SFSafariViewController</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth iOS</a> library.</p>

<p>AppAuth iOS supports a concept of external user agent, where you can use any browser to present the sign-in webpage. Normally, you invoke the following method to bring up a browser:</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>This method will invoke a default user agent. Alternatively, you can use the following method, which gives you an option to plug in any external user agent, as long as it conforms to the <code>OIDExternalUserAgent</code> protocol.</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>There is already an implementation of using <a href="https://gist.github.com/ugenlik/2a543f351e9b9425800b48266760dc85"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> as an external agent</a>. You can download it and plug it into your project. The following code snippet shows how to create and pass in an external user agent <code>OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController</code>.</p>

   <code>let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
let externalAgent = OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController(presentingViewController: self)

appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =
        OIDAuthState.authState(byPresenting: request, externalUserAgent: externalAgent) { authState, error in
    if let authState = authState {
        self.authState = authState
        print("Got authorization tokens. Access token: " +
              "\(authState.lastTokenResponse?.accessToken ?? "nil")")
    } else {
        print("Authorization error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
        self.authState = nil
    }
}
</code>   

 Summary 

<p>Understanding iOS and Android platform-level constraints is a prerequisite for developing great mobile experiences. I hope this article will help you understand the browser options available on iOS and their cookie sharing behaviors.</p>

<p>At Okta, we are adamant about optimizing end-user experience. Every extra click needs to be eliminated if possible, and every extraneous prompt should be avoided. We develop solutions such as Native SSO to help you overcome mobile constraints. I hope our solution helps you improve the experiences you are building for your end users. We’d love to hear more about your needs and how we can build solutions together. Feel free to add your questions and suggestions about this solution or future topics in the comments below.</p>

<p>A few keen-eyed readers pointed out that I never wrote a follow-up article on last year’s DevCamp. They’re absolutely right; all I wrote since the start was this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/#devcamp-8">small update</a> halfway through the course. It’s time to write something!</p><p>As you may have heard, over 1800 people signed up for the DevCamp, which amazed us all. This was a huge increase from the previous DevCamp’s roughly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/speedy-improved-holochain-release-unblocks-all-the-things/#register-for-devcamp-7">200</a> registrants. More and more people are hearing about Holochain, among them developers who may go on to create some really wonderful apps.</p><p>I’m so grateful to the DevCamp organisers. I think they did a fantastic job presenting a pretty demanding subject to a huge group of people, all online and spread out across time zones. They facilitated with enthusiasm, structure, patience, and compassion. This was a big project, and they faced it courageously and skillfully. (Did you know that they were all volunteers, doing it simply because they love the project?)</p><p>The organisers did have some selection criteria to make sure it would be a rewarding experience for participants — this was, after all, meant to train people to build Holochain apps, so it probably would only be useful to people who intended to build Holochain apps. Roughly 1000 of the registrants were selected for participation, and roughly 400 enrolled once they were accepted.</p><p>Over the course of the DevCamp’s two-month schedule, we did see a drop in participation. Live session attendance dropped by 67% between the beginning and the end of the course. This might sound disappointing, but it’s actually quite good — various studies say online courses see from <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">85%</a> to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals">97%</a> dropout rate. This shows that an above-average number of people committed themselves to learning a pretty demanding subject.</p><p>Not knowing why individual participants decided to leave, I have some guesses: some may have found the course load or meeting times didn’t work for their schedules, others may have decided that Rust or Holochain development wasn’t for them, and still others may simply have joined because they wanted to learn a little bit about the project but not develop an app.</p><p>Some Holo team members helped with the DevCamp too, which gave us the opportunity to do some research. We learned a few important things:</p>  People don’t get interested in Holochain simply because it solves a technical problem for them. Instead, they get involved because they believe in the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/what-holochain/">values</a> it represents — agency, accountability, privacy, cooperation, voluntary participation. They want to join a movement, not just use a piece of tech.  Holochain’s community is unique among open-source communities — it seems stronger, more closely knit and supportive, with passionate people who are willing to give their time to help newcomers. (The DevCamp organisers are a case in point!) Reputation revolves around commitment to helping others grow, rather than crowing about one’s accomplishments.  It’s not just one ‘community’ either — there are many communities who value slightly different things or are focused on different aspects of the project. There are a lot of different perspectives about what matters. In a way, the tech and the social structures mirror each other.  DevCamps are a special way to experience the health of the community — it might be that the community is the most valuable part, because they create a supportive space for learners and help them become part of the Holochain community at large. The Discord server, in particular, was a great addition to DevCamp 8, and resulted in a lot more active conversations than the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org">forum</a> had had in previous DevCamps.  There’s a steep learning curve. Not only is Rust a new language for most, but Holochain is quite different from either cloud or blockchain. Many DevCamp participants had already participated in a DevCamp but wanted to reinforce or refresh their knowledge. The strong, supportive community also helps people gather the courage to meet this challenge.  Many participants feel like there was still so much to learn by the end of the course. In fact, we learned that some had already participated in a DevCamp and wanted a refresher. This reinforces what we learned about the learning curve, and suggests that a community, ongoing events, and self-serve resources for alumni would be useful.  Not everybody can participate in a DevCamp or online learning community. Time constraints — busy life or time zone differences — are the biggest barriers. Most people participated asynchronously, replaying the recorded session videos and chatting on Discord. We would do well to develop more self-serve resources for those people. (Fortunately, the organisers have published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuXrtFJO6zVMOMiqt0iOvwGtEba470wi">all of DevCamp 8’s session videos</a> on YouTube, which is a great start!)  Session 1 of the DevCamp Holochain 0.0.122: big gossip performance improvements <p>Most of the recent Holochain releases have been maintenance releases.</p><blockquote>But today’s release brings big New Year news. I’ve been looking forward to sharing this one!</blockquote><p>Recently one of the core developers has been troubleshooting a performance bottleneck we saw in the Elemental Chat tests. Gossiped DHT ops were being integrated at a rate of 40 per second, which seemed unusually slow because it didn’t involve a lot of processing.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the DHT, here’s how it works: when an agent commits an element to their source chain, it results in the creation of a number of DHT operations. These operations are messages, sent to peers on the DHT, that update their local DHT shard. Here’s an example of the ops produced by a ‘create app entry’ element:</p>  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreElement"><code>StoreElement</code></a> operation stores the header in the neighbourhood of the new header’s hash.  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreEntry"><code>StoreEntry</code></a> operation stores the entry, and a copy of the header, in the neighbourhood of the new entry’s hash.  Finally, a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity"><code>RegisterAgentActivity</code></a> operation stores a copy of the header in the neighbourhood of the author’s public key, allowing those authorities to detect source chain forks or serve up source chain segments to other validators.  <p>Each of these operations has to be ‘integrated’ by the authorities in the neighbourhood — that is, validated and stored in their DHT shard. This happens initially, at publish time, when the author first sends out these operations. But it also happens on an ongoing basis, as new peers join the DHT and start building their shard, or as peers disappear and cause remaining peers to increase their coverage. These peers share this information through gossip, which happens at regular intervals — more frequently for new data, less frequently for historical data.</p><p>In the Elemental Chat tests, the historical data gossip loop was slowing down HoloPorts. Part of this was because sharding wasn’t yet turned on, which meant that everybody gossiped everything with everybody else. But that ended up being a great way to catch this performance problem.</p><p>The solution was to optimise the table that stores the operations, along with the queries that manipulate it (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1167">#1167</a>). Now, operations are integrated at a rate of 1000 per second — a 25× increase!</p><p>There are other changes you should know about as a developer:</p>  The conductor API lets you manually insert elements into a source chain. This will be used to build source chain redundancy for Holo hosting, as well as source chain backup and restore for natively installed Holochain instances. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1166">#1166</a>)  Breaking: The <code>Path</code> abstraction for working with links has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">#1167</a>)  Breaking: You can now query a source chain by ranges — either between two sequence numbers, between two hashes, or the most recent element plus a certain number of preceding elements. All range queries are inclusive. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1142">#1142</a>)  The above breaking changes mean that Holochain 0.0.122 is compatible with <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.118/hdk/">HDK 0.0.118</a>.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#20220106093622">Read the full changelog</a>.</p><p>That’s the news from the start of 2022. I’m looking forward to sharing more this year as our projects move towards beta status and see wider adoption among developers!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@tegan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Tegan Mierle</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/camp?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops on GlobaliD</a>.</p><p>Every crypto project faces the same challenge: How to strategically or fairly distribute tokens to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A common practice is called an airdrop — giving away tokens to users who qualify for certain terms or accomplish certain tasks. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, created one billion governance tokens and airdropped 15% of them to anyone who had used the protocol up to that point — 400 UNI tokens in total, at the time, worth about&nbsp;$2000.</p><p>Airdrops are a great way to distribute tokens to your most active and engaged users while also helping to promote and market the&nbsp;project.</p><p>But as airdrops have gained in popularity and prominence — and with significant money at stake — these distributions are increasingly vulnerable to people gaming the system, undermining their equity and effectiveness. When bots sabotage your airdrop, it compromises the strategic intent of the token distribution.</p><p>For any project, the goal is to reach engaged users that are real people. Naturally, that extends to NFT drops, DeFi platforms, and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as&nbsp;well.</p> Trusted Airdrops <p>By introducing self-sovereign identity to airdrops, you can now guarantee that real people receive tokens rather than bots in a privacy preserving way. It’s the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity.</p><p>With GlobaliD’s Trusted Airdrops, developers can quickly and easily verify that wallets belong to real&nbsp;people.</p><p>Users that receive airdrops can conveniently verify themselves and participate in exciting new projects without compromising ownership or control over their identity or their data. GlobaliD never sees users’ private data, which is encrypted and decentralized.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Learn more about why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>The process is simple and straightforward:</p>  Developers create a signup link for their airdrop through&nbsp;GlobaliD  Recipients follow the link to verify their&nbsp;identity  Recipients add a wallet and get their&nbsp;drop  <p>You can learn more about the process&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>For projects building on XRPL, they can leverage <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">GlobaliD’s native integration with XUMM Wallet</a>, the most popular XRP wallet in the ecosystem that boasts over 200,000 active&nbsp;users.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>It’s also incredibly cool to see the many projects come up with hacky solutions for custom needs.

In just the last few weeks, we’ve seen dozens of projects choose GlobaliD through word of&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>In order to meet and address that demand, we’re actively working toward improving our documentation and developer support. That starts with the <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops</a> landing page, but it’s just the beginning.</p><p>It’s also just the tip of the iceberg for what’s possible with GlobaliD and the entire suite of tools available for developers. That includes GlobaliD Groups for building communities as well as the GlobaliD Wallet for payments.</p><p>We’ve also been working with a handful of DeFi organizations to address some of their biggest challenges — all while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their platform.</p><p>That includes:</p>  ID verification for compliance (Green DeFi or&nbsp;XeFi)  Elimination of bots, scams, and bad actors on the&nbsp;network  Protecting their master nodes and protocols  <p>So stay tuned for more exciting releases in the very near future (including a noncustodial wallet) as we look to make self-sovereign identity more useful for more&nbsp;people.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">How GlobaliD enhances trust for XRPL Labs’ XUMM&nbsp;Wallet</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with GlobaliD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The online sports betting market in Ontario, Canada is seeing rapid expansion after lawmakers passed a bill (C-218) in June 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result of this bill is hugely increased flexibility for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada comes down to local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction and Ontario is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Key iGaming Regulations in Ontario&nbsp; 



<p>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, Ontario created iGaming Ontario (iGO) – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, so long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is Consumer protection quoted on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">IGO website</a> are 3 bullet points:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity&nbsp;  Prevent underage access  Ensure compliance by private operators with applicable laws, including compliance with anti-money laundering rules and regulations and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>A full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> details what is expected of operators and what kind of rules and regulations are being enforced for iGaming in Ontario. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO, and there are some key things to note for operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC). Although, iGaming Ontario has established a strict set of regulations, which go beyond the basic FINTRAC requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photos (or selfies), and liveness (such as a video) to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Becoming Compliant With Ontario’s iGaming Regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> program requirements, which could require operators to complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One solution to overcoming this is working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Autoident</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>







<p>Autoident is very well suited to the FINTRAC standard set by Ontario, already supporting verification processes that include Document verification, selfie and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a>, while also being backed by an experienced team with years of success and experience, globally in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">iGaming</a> industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are also other ways to become compliant with Ontario’s regulations, such as adjusting things like the onboarding process, looking at AML reporting requirements, and much more that is required by iGO. Depending on an operator’s current systems, this could be an expensive and time-consuming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whichever way operators choose to tackle Ontario’s regulatory climate, it will be a complicated and tough battle to become compliant in a reasonable timeframe. </p>



<p>However, utilizing an identity verification partner to help smoothen the bumps in the road and provide a guiding hand will prove to be an incredible advantage. KYC and AML should not be a burden but an enabler for your success.&nbsp;</p>

				  Helen Garneau joins the Hyperledger Foundation as Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee and Trevor Butterworth joins the Steering Committee of the Covid Credentials Initiative.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted at the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, has welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helengarneau/">Helen Garneau</a>, Chief Marketing Officer of <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> as Vice Chair of its Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>This is the second leadership role for Indicio in recent months at a Linux Foundation Project. In December, Vice President of Governance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorwbutterworth/">Trevor Butterworth</a>, was elected to the Steering Committee for the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI), a part of <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH), the leading organization for hosting and nurturing open-source technology for the benefit of public health initiatives.</p>
<p>Garneau has an extensive track record in implementing successful marketing strategies for a range of Hyperledger Foundation projects, including <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>,<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>. She also played a key role in project launches and the growth of Hyperledger communities.</p>
<p>As Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee, Garneau is committed to broadening Hyperledger’s membership base during her one-year term.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be named vice-chair of the Hyperledger Foundation Marketing Committee alongside Chair, Duncan Johnston-Watt, CEO &amp; Co-founder at Blockchain Technology Partners (BTP),” said Garneau. “One of the things I enjoy most&nbsp; in the Hyperledger community has been seeing the technology, use cases, and contributions from other members and companies. The dollars that companies put into their Hyperledger Foundation membership are valuable and I’ve seen the return in business growth first hand. The Hyperledger marketing team does an incredible job and I look forward to helping articulate that value proposition in my role as Vice-Chair.” </p>
<p>Butterworth was already involved in Linux Foundation Public Health as Chair of the Steering Group for the Cardea Project, an open-source ecosystem built on Hyperledger Indy&nbsp; and Hyperledger Aries for digital health credentials developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to LFPH.</p>
<p>“At Indicio, we are at the front end of building and implementing digital health credentials with commercial partners—and our success in this area, in open-sourcing the results, and in creating a community of developers to extend functionality is a win for both the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health,” said Butterworth. “Joining the Covid Credentials Initiative will help us learn from its experts, build better products, and drive adoption of technology that is sustainable and solves fundamental problems in privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Indicio is both a member and active contributor to the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health and has taken a significant leadership role in the open sourcing of a number of technologies. Among others, Indicio has helped lead the development and contributions to several projects at Linux Foundation including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor">Hyperledger Indy Node Monitor</a> (August 2020): A set of tools for monitoring the status of Hyperledger Indy networks.

 Malcolm Wright Joins Shyft Network as Head of Strategy for its Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions  BitMEX’s former Chief Compliance Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/malcolmwright/">Malcolm Wright</a> will oversee the expansion of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, Shyft’s FATF Travel Rule solution &amp; Travel Rule interoperability tooling, along with strategy and growth for upcoming core public network products including institutional DeFi, NFT’s &amp; The Shyft Network’s DAO. <p>Malcolm Wright, a veteran of the blockchain industry is departing <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX </a>as the Chief Compliance Officer to join Shyft Core, the core development team of the Shyft Network ($SHFT). Malcolm, whose experience has spanned over three decades across strategy, technology, operations, and risk and compliance will join <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft</a> Network to lead Veriscope while also acting as the Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions.</p><p>He will be responsible for the expansion of Veriscope, the open source Travel Rule protocol built on the Shyft network, for leading strategy and growth for upcoming ecosystem infrastructure that includes Shyft’s Cross-chain Institutional DeFi System &amp; the Shyft DAO’s regulatory and compliance solutions, and&nbsp;more.</p> BitMEX to&nbsp;Shyft <p>Malcolm is joining the Shyft Network Core team from BitMEX, one of the world’s leading crypto derivatives exchanges. Malcolm has been instrumental in global policy work and advocacy on behalf of the digital asset ecosystem, and is the founder of InnoFi Advisory, a consulting firm supporting innovation and growth in DeFi, DAOs, and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Malcolm is currently the co-lead of the anti-money laundering (AML) working group at Global Digital Finance (GDF), a virtual asset industry body that supports policymakers to develop supportive legislation to assist the industry in its goal to understand and comply with regulation, and was instrumental in the development of open data sharing standard requirements such as&nbsp;IVMS101.</p><p>Malcolm said “I have long supported Shyft’s approach to resolving the FATF Travel Rule as one that provides the least friction for crypto firms’ customers whilst maintaining the decentralized community-driven ethos that underpins the Blockchain and crypto industries.</p><p>“With DeFI, DAOs, and NFTs reaching critical mass over the past 12 months, Shyft is trailblazing the way in addressing multiple challenges for financial services firms and governments that go far beyond Travel Rule. This is very much aligned to my own desire to provide the governance foundations upon which responsible innovators can design impactful, transformational, successful solutions.”</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">BitMEX Compliance Chief Malcolm Wright Jumps to Shyft Network (coindesk.com)</a></p> Shared beliefs <p>Joseph Weinberg, Co-founder of Shyft Network said: “Over the last 3+ years a group of incredible individuals have been working to guide policy and educate regulators across this space. Malcolm and I were among several of that group who share a belief that decentralization and maintaining the ecosystem is critical to its foundational success.</p><blockquote>“As Malcolm and the policy side of Shyft had already been working together, both in his capacity at BitMEX, and through policy development across regulators, bringing on Malcolm to drive this next phase of institutional development &amp; growth was a 1+1 = 6 equation.</blockquote><blockquote>“We began working on Shyft Network &amp; its public infrastructure out of a belief that we can apply the open innovations built from within the ecosystem to bridge the gap between the traditional world’s regulatory &amp; compliance requirements, identity &amp; decentralized economies without eroding privacy, decentralization &amp; openness.</blockquote><blockquote>“As these two worlds collide and we see rapid acceleration in both regulatory requirements, as well as adoption, we also need the best and brightest people who continue to bring balance for the ecosystem to be driving critical infrastructure like Veriscope &amp; other public utilities for the new market participants who need identity-based compliance capabilities to operate across all verticals. Malcolm’s deep expertise across the space, from policy makers, to Open Standards, as well as his vast experience prior to entering crypto, makes him an excellent person to lead all compliance related aspects of the public utility smart contracts that the Shyft Core team developed for the Shyft network.”</blockquote> Leading role <p>In this role, Malcolm will be tasked with leading the Veriscope teams both inside of Shyft Core, and across all VASPs &amp; Travel rule solutions that are globally utilizing or contributing to the public network, while also managing the open governance task force responsible for proposing policy changes across the counterparty processes that are universal to Veriscope through the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Along with this, Malcolm will lead all regulatory compliance &amp; institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope that includes universal cross chain layers for Institutional Defi, NFT’s, DAO’s and&nbsp;more.</p><p>As Shyft Network is an open source project, and it’s infrastructure is being deployed to open source, Malcolm’s work will focus across regulators, institutions currently joining Veriscope, the Shyft DAO &amp; continued open standards development across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>Malcolm will be tasked with designing and documenting the frameworks and critical policy requirements across Shyft Network’s products and maintain his already impressive status as an industry thought leader recognized by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions.</p><p>On behalf of the Core team, the Shyft Community, Veriscope’s open Network of VASPs&amp; institutions, and all developers building atop of Shyft Network, We are excited to welcome Malcolm to the Community</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner.

 Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple, non-custodial authentication infrastructure  Led by Sequoia Capital India with participants such as Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, the Series A funding round advances our mission to eliminate seed phrases and make blockchain authentication decentralized and accessible to&nbsp;all. <p>We are excited to announce that we have raised $13M led by Sequoia Capital India, Union Square Ventures, Multicoin and others, to drive mass adoption in Web3 through simple, secure, and non-custodial auth infrastructure for apps and wallets. The round follows demonstrable success, with our infrastructure securing over 1M monthly users and 8M keys, on wallets and applications such as Binance Extension Wallet, Ubisoft, Kukai, Skyweaver, and more. We are also proud to reveal Web3Auth, which kickstarts the decentralization of the Torus&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Series A was raised with additional participation from FTX, Bitcoin.com, DARMA Capital, Chainstry, Hash, KOSMOS Capital, Kyros Ventures, LD Capital, Minted Labs, P2P Capital, Phoenix VC, Staking Facilities, YBB Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, and Decentralab.</p><p>For those who don’t know us, the Torus team (now specifically more known as <a href="https://web3auth.io">Web3Auth</a>) have been working on improving onboarding and non-custodial key management in the crypto space. A critical problem that quantifiably has contributed to the loss of nearly 20% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Fear of loss and unfamiliarity of keys/seed phrases presents a significant barrier to entry that deters non-technical users from exploring Web3 and participating in the ecosystem.</p> Introducing Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth is simple, non-custodial auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. For your crypto native users Web3Auth makes them feel right at home, allowing them to connect or use their key management of choice, be it Metamask, Phantom, Ledger and so on. For new users developers can use Web3Auth to build intuitive login flows, such as single sign-on with Google and Twitter, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with vulnerable public-private key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Under the hood, Web3Auth’s mainstream UX is powered by the Torus Network (which Torus now refers exclusively to), it enables users to use multiple factors to access their wallet, leveraging on existing things a user has to secure these factors. These include their social login, existing devices, backups/passwords and in the future even family. This immediately improves on the existing key management standard of seed phrases, which is essentially a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>For those who have known Torus before Web3Auth, Web3Auth consolidates our existing products, and draws a clear distinction between the products we build and the underlying infrastructure, allowing us to take further steps towards further decentralizing this infrastructure. Moving forward, the Torus Network will refer to the underlying infrastructure that supports our products, and Web3Auth will refer to the one stop pluggable product that Web3 apps/wallets know &amp;&nbsp;love.</p><p>Developers can integrate Web3Auth into their application just with a couple lines of code and allow users to connect to any blockchain. And can start&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Apart from the initial connection, Web3Auth also provides:</p>  Customizable UI / even fully whitelabel  Plugging in your own existing auth and user&nbsp;base  Fiat-to-crypto aggregator, so users can also choose the best fiat-to-crypto provider for your application and the user’s&nbsp;region.  Incremental security and better redundancy, which drastically reduces support tickets for mainstream users.  Broad platform support, including SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native and&nbsp;Unity.   What will happen to existing users/developers and the Torus&nbsp;Network? <p>Existing users and developers on our current products (i.e. CustomAuth, OpenLogin, Torus Wallet) do not have to do anything, and they can be rest assured that these products will continue to be developed and supported as they are used as components of Web3Auth. No action is required from developers or end-users.</p><p>We will continue working on the underlying infrastructure to improve efficiency and security, but the priority for us is to further decentralize the Torus Network.

 Highlights <p>The <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-2022-roadmap-a0036cd72f1b">Ontology 2022 Roadmap</a> has been officially released. Our goal for 2022 is to make the Ontology high-speed, low-cost, public blockchain, the blockchain of choice for Web3 applications. We are working hard to develop a more diverse and prosperous Ontology ecosystem. Ontology’s efforts in creating interoperability between the different public chains, including Ethereum with the upcoming Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch, will provide the opportunity to incubate more high-quality Web3 applications in the new year, across a multitude of industries and services. Ontology will continue to vigorously develop ONT ID, ONTO, and other products, making Web3 available to everyone. Ontology is proud to be part of this rapidly changing landscape and is excited to share more updates in the future. Here’s to another year exploring the future together.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various application tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals and we are 75% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 72% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 53% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 22% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.5 was released, bringing support for Avalanche and NFTs on OEC, as well as FIO address registration and&nbsp;binding.  ONTO is hosting its very own <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479362169737302018">NFT ONTOvaganza</a>. This event rewards NFT holders from previous ONTO events with more NFTs. Each NFT comes with a different ONG airdrop quota and rights. Top winners can get up to 1,000 ONG from this event. The event is in progress, and the claiming of NFTs will end at 21:00 (Singapore time) on January 15th. Don’t forget to open ONTO and claim your&nbsp;NFT!  ONTO is hosting a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479800051132100608">Parking Infinity</a>. Participants who complete related tasks have the opportunity to earn rewards. The event is in progress, with more than 1,100 participants.  ONTO hosted an NFT Giveaway campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1478712890773450760">MetaYoka</a>. Participants who completed related tasks had the opportunity to earn NFT rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 2,000 participants.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1477263336899108868">HyperJump</a>. Participants who completed all the tasks had the opportunity to earn rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 1,000 participants.   On-Chain Activity   123 total dApps on MainNet as of January 10th,&nbsp;2022.  6,856,727 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 18,420 from last&nbsp;week.  16,928,849 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 75,643 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   5,539 new members joined our global community this week. Over the past four years, Ontology Harbingers have always been our most dedicated supporters, driving the growth of the global community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join us</a> to experience and promote a more decentralized future together with Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “EVMs”. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and WasmVM. Community members believe that this is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about ENS, including its application scenarios, how to participate in the ecology, and more. Community members discussed the differences between Ontology DID and ENS. For example, ENS currently focuses more on associated addresses, while DID focuses on a wider range of information and is more inclined to personal&nbsp;data.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Gizmodo — 《<a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-is-web-3-and-why-should-you-care-1848204799">What Is Web3 and Why Should You&nbsp;Care?</a>》</p><p>“In recent months, you may have come across a phrase growing in popularity: Web3. You might be wondering what it is, what it will mean for the future, and how exactly the third-generation internet differs from the first two. And now the dawn of Web3 is upon us. People define it in a few different ways, but at its core is the idea of decentralization, which we’ve seen with cryptocurrencies (key drivers of Web3). Key to this decentralization is blockchain technology, which creates publicly visible and verifiable ledgers of record that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. The blockchain already underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as a number of fledging technologies, and it’s tightly interwoven into the future vision of everything that Web3 promises. The idea is that everything you do, from shopping to social media, is handled through the same secure processes, with both more privacy and more transparency baked&nbsp;in.”</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not changed. 2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With millions of people boarding flights every day, customer data and experiences are the most important elements to the travel industry. As airports increasingly ramp up to meet the digital age, they are more prone to cyberattacks and data breaches. One such incident occurred when <a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/features/five-times-airports-were-involved-in-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/">Heathrow airport</a> was fined £120,000 when they lost sensitive data stored on a memory stick, which included the Queen’s travel history and passport numbers.</p>



<p>To prevent such data leaks in the future and avoid heavy fines, airports are constantly evolving and adapting biometric security in airports.</p>



 Why Are Biometrics Used in Airports? 



<p>The technology associated with air travel has advanced considerably in recent years. Biometrics for airports have provided passengers with a faster, safer end-to-end experience. It may go unnoticed at first but biometric technology is used widely in airports. Be it filling your visa application from the comfort of your home or automated barrier control at the airports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biometrics for airports can provide a contactless experience using facial recognition for the ease of passengers and to meet growing concerns around health concerns with contact methods. Biometric technology can identify individuals, measuring dozens of physical attributes, such as fingerprint, voice recognition, and facial recognition, among others.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Biometrics for airports can be used for security checks, luggage, boarding, and check-in facilities. Implementing biometrics at airports helps automate the verification process, and sharing a digital identity can expedite the immigration process.</p>



 Benefits of Using Biometric for Airports 



<p>Biometric authentication and its use cases in the travel industry and airports provide several advantages including:</p>



 High Security 



<p>Biometrics provide increased levels of security to the airlines that the person is truly who they claim to be. The identification is done by tangible and real-world traits that relate to the passenger. Nearly any username, passwords, and PINs can be compromised, and a data breach can leak sensitive information to the hackers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved User Experience 



<p>The internal implementation of biometric technology may be difficult, but it provides a smooth user experience to passengers at the airport. Placing a finger on a scanner and getting border access is much easier and fast than going through the long processes of physical verification.&nbsp;</p>



 Non-Transferable and Unique 



<p>Every individual has a unique set of biometrics which are impossible to duplicate with current technology. Also, biometrics are not transferable. The only way to access biometric data at airports is through the physical application.&nbsp;</p>



 4 Biometric Technologies Used at Airports 



<p>There are currently four biometric technologies being used at airports. These include:</p>



 Facial Recognition 



<p>Facial recognition identifies facial features such as distance between eyes, eye shape, nose shape, and more, through stored facial patterns and data to find a match. Facial recognition enhances security, is contactless, and is easy to integrate.&nbsp;</p>



 Fingerprint Recognition 



<p>Fingerprint recognition automatically identifies someone based on a comparison between a stored and live fingerprint. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometrics and is being implemented at airports all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Recognition 



<p>Iris scanning or <a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition">iris recognition</a> is the process of using infrared light to take a high contrast image of your iris. Similar to fingerprints, iris patterns are unique to each individual and provide exceptional accuracy. Iris recognition is another contactless biometric method which is considered to be one of the most accurate.</p>



 Palm Recognition 



<p>Palm recognition evaluates the unique patterns and characteristics in the palms of an individual’s hands. The systems use a scanning device that processes data from a digital photo of an individual’s hand and compares it to the stored biometric template in the database. Many airports have started deploying palm recognition as a part of their authentication processes.&nbsp;</p>

 Web3Auth has allowed Binance Smart Chain users to seamlessly create and manage their extension wallets with their Social&nbsp;Accounts  About Binance Chain Extension Wallet&nbsp;(BEW) <p>Binance Chain Extension Wallet is the official Binance cryptocurrency wallet for accessing Binance Smart Chain, Binance Chain, and Ethereum. The extension allows users to securely store crypto and connect to thousands of projects across different blockchains. It currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and&nbsp;Brave.</p> The Story Behind the Integration <p>Key management is a long-standing problem in crypto. Users have lost crypto worth over $150bn (Worth more than even GDPs of several nations) due to inefficient management of their private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem knew how important it was to make key management and onboarding easy for mainstream crypto adoption. Especially with the increase in the adoption of decentralized apps, mismanagement of private keys was rampant leading to significant financial loss.</p> The search for a perfect non-custodial key management solution <p>To fix this — the BSC community started considering multiple private key management solutions. Few solutions had made significant progress in streamlining the user onboarding experience but had long been plagued by the trilemma of sacrificing security or redundancy for convenience. Many of these systems also had points of centralization that reduced censorship resistance.</p><p>They were then introduced to Web3Auth.</p> Onboarding thousands of users through&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Binance chain Extension Wallet (BEW) introduced a new seamless and secure user onboarding process through Web3Auth in early 2021 and has since onboarded hundreds of thousands of users into the BEW&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Designed with a simple and straightforward user experience for mainstream users, the onboarding includes OAuth logins, key management that reduces account loss while retaining the non-custodial guarantees that the decentralized ecosystem requires.</p> How Web3Auth handles users’ private&nbsp;keys <p>Web3Auth is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the Shamir Secret Shares (SSS) scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider.</p><p>The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret key. Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> BEW — Web3Auth pave the way for crypto’s&nbsp;future <p>BEW’s partnership with Web3Auth ensures that no user in the future will ever lose access to their valuable Cryptos just because they forgot or misplaced their private keys. This revolutionary approach paves the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptos across the industry.

 Kukai: A go-to wallet for leading NFT projects on&nbsp;Tezos  About Kukai <p>Kukai is the longest-running web-based Tezos wallet. It allows you to manage your tokens, NFTs and digital assets in a single easy-to-use and secure platform. As a Tezos wallet, Kukai includes the ability to store, transfer and delegate your Tezos (XTZ) tokens, so you can easily receive XTZ rewards through staking. Kukai supports the fast-growing Tezos ecosystem with features like an NFT gallery, DeFi token support and more. Kukai has been pivotal to the success of Ubisoft, HicEtNunc, OneOf, and other notable NFT launches.</p> The Origin <p>The origin of Kukai goes back to 2018 when it was started as an open-source community project. The team spent the initial days figuring out the technical aspects and focused on security. Once the tech was sorted and the wallet started gaining traction — the team realized how the onboarding experience was integral to achieving their goals of acquiring millions of mainstream users.</p><p>That’s when Web3Auth came into the&nbsp;picture.</p> Deciding on&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai discovered Web3Auth at the perfect time when they decided to redesign the wallet user experience to drive user adoption. The ease of onboarding provided by Web3Auth’s social logins and key management solution made a lot of sense. The primary reasons they chose to integrate Web3Auth SDK&nbsp;were:</p>  The Decentralised Non-custodial nature of the private key&nbsp;handling  The Social logins to onboard blockchain non-native users  The Web3Auth’s Lookup feature to send crypto/NFTs to socials&nbsp;directly  The single-click setup, the documentation, and the dev support throughout  <p>The Kukai team was evaluating other solutions as well but did not proceed with them because of their inflexibility, low maturity, and centralized method of managing&nbsp;keys.</p><p>“We have been so happy with Web3Auth, and whenever we do our regular reviews of other solutions we continue to be convinced we made the right choice for Kukai users” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p> Winning the NFT space with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai took less than two weeks to integrate Web3Auth SDK. The detailed documentation and the code examples made the integration process straightforward and easy to complete. With Web3Auth developer support readily available, our engineers worked closely with the Kukai team to build the final product within a short developmental time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>It’s been one year since Kukai launched with Web3Auth handling their authentication and key management, and the SDK has processed more than a million social logins thus&nbsp;far.</p><p>“We never faced any roadblocks during integration because the Web3Auth team was always available at every step” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p><p>Kukai has onboarded hundreds of thousands of non-native crypto users with ease and they devote the success to the Web3Auth SDK which has made their app’s onboarding look like any other web2 app’s. The Tezos community loves Kukai and Web3Auth is excited to support the Tezos ecosystem in their Kukai 2.0 and the upcoming mobile wallet where they expect to multiply their user-base threefold.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-kukai-reached-a-million-user-logins-with-web3auth-sdk-58bdc08ca83d">How Kukai Reached a Million User Logins with Web3Auth SDK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to the first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity for this New Year 2022. And we have a very special guest who has been in very short clips in an episode we had in October, very recently in October. A very special episode, a storytelling episode called <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/openid-connect/" title="<em>How OpenID Connect took over the World</em>">How OpenID Connect took over the World</a>, and today’s guest was there. We are talking about our super special guest called Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura is a well-known identity and privacy standardisation architect and a representative partner of NAT Consulting. Besides being an author and editor of such widely standards such as the OpenID Connect, FAPI, JWT, OAuth PKCE among others, he helps communities to organise themselves to realise the ideas around identity and privacy. As the chairman of the board of the OpenID Foundation, he streamlined the process, bolstered the IPR management, and greatly expanded the breadth of the Foundation spanning over 10 working groups whose members included large internet services, mobile operators, financial institutions, government, etc. He has been serving in various committees in the Japanese government, including a Study Group on the Platform Services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and a Study Group on the competition in Digital Market of the Fair-Trade Commission of Japan.</p>
<p>Hello, Nat.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura: Hi, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a great pleasure talking with you, Nat. And well, Happy New Year. And let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: Likewise, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. And I think we know a lot of your involvement, of course, you are leading one of the most important standardisation organisations in the digital space. We’d like to hear a bit about yourself, something personal, of course, how life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So you wanted to know, how was my journey to the world of identity?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. There are three reasons. They all converge to identity. In the middle 1990s, I was working on VPN as an alternative way to secure communications than having dedicated leased lines. And at that time, we were using dedicated leased lines in the financial institutions. And that actually amounts to the identification and the authentication of machines and people as well as integrity protection and encryption of the communication channel. So there you have identity.</p>
<p>Then also, the second reason was that I found in the hard way that access to our personal data is not granted. My daughter had a failed surgery, she was three years old then, and for re-operation I needed to access the medical record quickly but it was not granted. So it was not useful for us. That was a surprise for me. We didn’t have the right nor technology in place to access our own data in a meaningful timeframe. So I started on the combination, the identity and privacy then.</p>
<p>The third one was the research commissioned by the Japanese Postal Agency. It’s been subsequently privatised, but it was still a government agency at the time, on the future of mails. And as part of the research, I got acquainted with Drummond Reed, who dragged me into the standardisation part of the identity arena.</p>
<p>All of these combined paved the way for me to get into the digital identity standardisation work.</p>
<p>Oscar: I see, it’s very interesting you mentioned these three points. One very technical, solving the security problem so that those time- the VPNs in ‘90s, 1990s. Then you needed to access personal data of your daughter, right? And even though I’m sure it was stored somewhere, but you were not able to access it in a timely manner, as you said so.</p>
<p>Nat: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And then I think the opportunity came, as you mentioned in the Japanese Postal Agency to start working on the standard. So, yeah, super interesting. And we have talked recently and you say you wanted to talk about FAPI, one of the… yeah, one of the main – well children of OpenID Foundation. We have <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="interviewed also Don Thibeau">interviewed also Don Thibeau</a> a bit more than one year ago. He a little bit talked about that standard. He has been very enthusiastic about talking that standard and I’m sure you have much more to tell us. But please tell us what is the… what – where is the beginning of that? So what were the challenges that you were working on OpenID Foundation found, led that – led to the, yeah, to start working on the creation of FAPI?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So, right after we have finished OpenID Connect in 2014, I think I have started working on FAPI- preparation for FAPI in 2015. OAuth and OpenID Connect are designed to scale from the point of view of security. If you use only the very basic, you can achieve entry-level security quite simply. Since you’re not using options, it was not that hard to achieve interoperability.</p>
<p>However, when you wanted to achieve more security, you had many options to choose from. And the different combinations not only led to different security properties, but also a lack of interoperability. We needed to bolt the options down so that we have known security properties as well as interoperability.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think interoperability is a word that always come to any standard because there are so many different… yeah, so many possibilities can be done and so many different needs in different, yeah, different industries, different places in the world. Yeah. FAPI is Financial-grade API, correct? And I understand also that from the beginning, it has been, as the name says it’s for financial transactions. Please tell us a bit, what is FAPI in practice?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, the FAPI is a general purpose security profile of OAuth and OpenID Connect to protect APIs. It started off from financial use case, from which the letter F comes from. But later, it also made clear that it has general purpose. So we changed the name from Financial API to Financial-grade API. It can be used by for example, healthcare, transportation, and name any.</p>
<p>So there are two notable characteristics of FAPI. Number one is that all the communication is integrity protected, so that it’s tamper-evident. All messages are authenticated. And the second characteristic is that no bearer token is used.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So even if the token was stolen, it cannot be used. You know, the bearer token is like metro ticket or something like that. So if you drop it, and if somebody picks it up, it can be used, right? And instead, in the case of FAPI, we decided to use something called sender constrained tokens. Sender constrained token is much like international airline ticket, I mean the boarding pass. So when you use it, it’s got your name, and you need to show your passport, for example, or travel card so that the person at the entrance can match that you are the rightful user of that boarding pass. So that’s the sender constrained token. And in FAPI, we have stopped using bearer token completely and went all the way to the sender constrained tokens.</p>
<p>So another way to look at it is that it fulfils four authentication properties. In many cases, when we talk about these things, we kind of focus on the user authentication. But there are many other kinds of authentication, which is really important. The number one is strong server authentication. Number two, strong client authentication. Number three, strong message authentication. And these combined with strong user authentication, you will have a pretty complete security picture. So that’s the security part.</p>
<p>And also, we wanted to address the interoperability. So to improve our interoperability, we also needed to provide a testing framework. That is now provided by the OpenID Foundation as FAPI Certification. There are now over 150 implementations that are certified and number is increasing quite rapidly now.</p>
<p>Oscar: And there is some sort of self-certification, correct?</p>
<p>Nat: Yes, it’s a self-certification. So, the test suite is also available as open source. So you can, for example, use it for the continuous development – some banks are actually using it like that. But when you are done with the development, and you have passed all the tests, you can submit the result to OpenID Foundation, and then it will be published from the OpenID Foundation site, and they can be checked by your peers as well so that you know, you have a conformant implementation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yeah. One thing I was not aware now that I said just before asking you is FAPI’s Financial-grade API. And when I read and when I heard for the first time that term, to me sound like yeah, it’s financial, but now you clarified that initially it was Financial API but then now it’s financial-grade, so as secure as the financial transaction, I guess that’s the idea, right? So now it’s more general purpose in a very secure profile from OpenID Connect and OAuth 2, so that’s interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, that’s correct. Yeah. I mean, so I think it was by 2017 or ‘18, we had a request from both the healthcare sector as well as the international travel sector, you know airlines, that they wanted to use it. But their request was to change the name because having labelled as financial, it’s going to be harder for them to actually make industry-wide adoption of it. So we kind of searched for the name. By then the acronym FAPI was quite popular so we didn’t want to change the acronym and we wanted to generalise the F part. And we couldn’t come up with anything better than financial-grade. But the intent is that it is for any industry, and it’s secure. That’s what we wanted to communicate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I think it’s very important also, for the ones who are not so familiar with the term yet, so yeah. And also, the fact you mentioned in the description that in FAPI, as a profile of OpenID Connect, you don’t – you get rid of the bearer token so that already tells a lot about how much secure it is per se, the bearer token is just – it’s not a possibility in this profile.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So we have removed the bearer token, removed completely to the sender constrained token, as well as other communications even through the browser, is integrity protected. That’s not the case in the usual OAuth or OpenID Connect. So…</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is correct.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds very interesting. I have to play myself in the browser, what can I see, what I cannot see, so it’s super interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: So unless the sender and the receiver is using the encryption model, you can still see it, but you cannot tamper it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Nat: &nbsp;It’s signed. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Exactly. The integrity, you cannot, yeah. You cannot modify it. OK, excellent. Please tell us, yeah, you mentioned that initially it was for financial, then at least healthcare and aviation or transport were interested, what are the – nowadays, let’s say, what are the main use cases? Those are still the main use cases or it’s even broader?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, as I’ve said, it’s general-purpose, so it can be used for any use cases that require high level security. Having said that, since we have started off from the financial world, they are leading in the implementation. They had like two years of head start. So the most popular implementation scenario currently is banking. So like accessing banking data, or making payments, and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And I know, I read from some examples from FAPI, the documentation is available. They mentioned some has been already – FAPI has been made part of some, I don’t know standards or regulations in few different countries, including UK, open banking is the most known. Could you tell us about those? How has FAPI being implemented in different countries?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so as you mentioned, the first mainstream usage was the UK Open Banking. Nine biggest banks were mandated by Competitive Market Authority, CMA, to open up the API and FAPI was chosen as the protocol to secure them. And I understand the first reason for that is to make banking data portable. But subsequently, PSD2 kicked in, and now it was expanded into the payment.</p>
<p>And then after that, Australian Consumer Data Standard adopted FAPI. So as the name suggests, it’s much wider than just banking. It’s for any consumer data costs. Again, they have started from banking, and if I remember correctly, they are now expanding into electricity and things like that.</p>
<p>And then Brazil followed the step. I actually had the opportunity to talk with the Vice Governor, I think of the Brazilian Central Bank in London, just before the COVID outbreak. And we agreed that adopting a standardised approach for the testing or certification coming together is going to be really, really vital for widespread adoption and quick adoption. So I think that was taken by Brazilian Central Bank and they are now mandating that to the banks and TPPs, they’re like parties in FinTechs.</p>
<p>And then more recently FDX in the United States announced its adoption, so did the Russian FinTech Association, they have been public. While FDX has made a written statement in the blog post on their website, in the case of the Russian FinTech Association, it’s still verbal, but they’ve been speaking about that in the conferences. So I think it’s, you know, public knowledge now.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a little bit of tweaks that are required for the Russian use cases. In the case of current FAPI, for the purpose of bolting down the options, we have specified a few encryption algorithms and signature algorithms to be used. But in the case of Russia, they need to use their own cost standard for those algorithms. So we need to expand it, modify it and expand it a bit. But that can be done as extension. We are talking about that right now.</p>
<p>And then most recently, we have started joint workshop with the Berlin Group, which is very prominent in continental Europe to seek a way to converge. So, it’s getting good traction now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Berlin Group, I’m not so familiar. It’s also into financial or what it covers, Berlin Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So Berlin Group is mainly… how can I put it? It’s an association of mainly banks. And then there are advisory groups made up which includes FinTechs and other industries as well. But although the name says Berlin, it’s not only Germany. It’s from many other countries as well. So it’s quite widespread in the continent of Europe. And also, I heard some of the Berlin Group banks are now implementing FAPI, or they have already implemented FAPI as well. So that’s an interesting development as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: And it’s also possible that some – in other countries, in different institutions they can implement independently, right, without having a regulation or a main association that – say it force them to use them.</p>
<p>Nat: Sure. Sure. It’s a standard and standards, unless required by regulations like in some other cases, it’s totally optional. It’s totally voluntary. But at the same time, you know, anybody can actually use it. So you don’t have to wait for regulators to come in, and mandating you to use it.</p>
<p>Oscar: So it’s very likely that we will hear in the next, well, in the new year and in the coming months, coming years more associations like this, or banking or even in other industries, more regulations in different other geographies that are embracing FAPI.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so one of the reasons for FDX I understand to adopt FAPI is to move ahead. Well, I don’t know if that’s correct in other countries, but in many countries, if industries or industrial body actually self-regulate themselves, the government regulations do not kick in and you’ll get more freedom. So I think it’s actually better for the industry to adopt something like this without being mandated by the government.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a>, the project you are heavily involved also, a project that was released a few months ago that also requires GAIN, or – I’m sorry, FAPI. Is FAPI part of GAIN, or could you tell us?</p>
<p>Nat: So GAIN itself is technology neutral, so…</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: It’s not mandating any particular technology. It’s open, but FAPI can also be used. And certainly, that is envisaged by some of the participants in GAIN as the first step. So certainly, you can use FAPI and there are people who are using FAPI in the GAIN POC that they’re self-organising right now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And could you tell us – leaving a bit outside of the main topic of FAPI, but could you tell us a bit what was also coming from in GAIN, what is happening lately and what is coming in the next months?</p>
<p>Nat: So, there are two distinct paths, at least two, or maybe depending on how you count, it can be three. One is a technical working group, which is hosted by OpenID Foundation and the others are the legal and the business working groups, which are hosted by IIF and Open Identity Exchange. IIF stands for International Institute of Finance, right?</p>
<p>And as to the technical part, we are currently working on the legal agreement, a legal participation agreement so that we can create a safe space for all the participants whose taking part in GAIN POC. We’re in the final phase of drafting such a legal agreement, so that we can participate in POC feeling safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So yes, more… the POCs are coming for GAIN. Excellent. And tell us, core FAPI is the project that has ended, I know you are you’re working on that. So tell us what is coming next for the FAPI Working Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So FAPI Working Group is very far from being done, right? And we have ever more work to do. In the beginning, we didn’t create a profile for dynamic client registration, or consent or intent grant, and every jurisdiction says it slightly differently, but grant management will be core. We had enough work to work then as well. So we kind of postpone the work.</p>
<p>However, after UK, EU, Australia and Brazil went online, it became quite clear, painfully clear, that there are compatibility and security headaches because of no standardised way of doing it. So we decided to start work to address them. So the new technical specification called Grant Management for OAuth is being drafted. And it’s gone through the first implementers draft for OAuth successfully so that it can be implemented by implementers without fear of being sued or something like that. And people are just ironing out the kinks about the draft. We’ll probably need multiple rounds of these things to get to the finalisation but it’s a good start, right.</p>
<p>And then now we’re just starting, just in this, like, a month or so, we’ve been starting dynamic client registration part. It’s been done slightly differently in the UK, Australia and Brazil, as well. And, you know, we are gaining a lot of knowledge from that as well. So we are trying to codify the best practices about those. And hopefully, that’s going to be a very good guidance for other jurisdictions to follow.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that relates to the enrolment of customers or identity for customers.</p>
<p>Nat: Well, actually, no, that’s KYC, right. The dynamic client registration is so the end users uses software to interact with the, for example, banks, in the case of open banking, right? And this software actually needs to be registered to those banks. And we have to exchange the keys and things like that. And that can, of course, be done manually but that doesn’t scale. So we needed to have some kind of programmatical way of doing it. That’s called dynamic client registration. And again, we have a lot of options there. And we need to fold it down for the interoperability purpose and to have predictable security. So that’s what we are doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the KYC part, KYC is a big field. And it’s a headache for all the financial institutions. It hasn’t been too effective to date, but we’re trying and one of the ways to help the pain there is to create a protocol which would make it easier and more secure to exchange those KYC data among the participants, like GAIN. And that’s not being worked on by FAPI Working Group, but in the adjacent working group called eKYC and IDA Working Group.</p>
<p>Actually, if you join the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> call without dropping off and calling another number or accessing new URL, you will be seamlessly taken to eKYC and IDA Working Group. It’s just happening at the same time, I mean at the same location, just they are connected to each other. And that working group is working on the data and metadata side. That is how to express verified attributes and how they were verified. And these attributes, in the first phase we are sorting out the natural persons, but in the coming days we will also be doing legal entities as well, just passing that this person has been verified as, for example, Nat Sakimura isn’t good enough, you really can’t trust it, right? You need more information and, for example, how it was verified, why it was verified, which evidence you have used, under which legal framework, and so on, so forth, and when.</p>
<p>So, these we call metadata needed to be sent with the data itself. And the specification called OIDC for identity assurance, or OpenID Connect for identity assurance, deals with it. And using that standard, you can get those data and metadata together in a signed format. So the combination of the standard, together with FAPI will be very, very powerful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see it’s needed definitely. It’s powerful as you said. So yeah, fantastic job that the FAPI Working Group and this other adjacent group is doing together. Nat, just one final question, for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation we had, what is the one actionable idea that you would like them to write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So while it’s been talked a lot about – the data economy, that it will be over 5% of GDP, it’s yet to be seen. Why? The data economy needs a secure and interoperable data network. And we are finally getting there with FAPI and eKYC standards. So, you guys need to get ready for the ride. It’s the time. You need to start acting, start preparing for that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And that will affect all industries.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, it’s not only financial institutions. Yeah, it’s for everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Nat for this very interesting conversation. We had knowing a lot more about FAPI and all the great work you do. And please let us know for people who like to continue the conversation with you or know more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you on the net, get in touch?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So, I’m in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">LinkedIn</a>. If you search Nat Sakimura, you can get there. I’m on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatSakimura">YouTube</a> as well, so you can get to me there as well, so is <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat_en">Twitter</a>. And of course, if you’re technical, I highly recommend you to join <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> so we can share the technical ideas in a safe IPR environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Nat for this interview and all the best and Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Nat: Thanks, much obliged and likewise.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   Basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5.0 runtime and SDK</a>, which includes the .NET CLI 
   Your favorite IDE that supports .NET projects, such as <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">JetBrains Rider</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
   A <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Microsoft Azure Account</a> (Azure free account) 
 

 Create a new ASP.NET project 

<p>Let’s create a new ASP.NET project. We’ll use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/">.NET CLI</a> to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Run the following commands to create the solution, the project, and add the project to the solution.</p>

   <code>dotnet new sln -n OktaProfilePicture
dotnet new mvc --auth none --framework net5.0 -o OktaProfilePicture
dotnet sln add ./OktaProfilePicture/OktaProfilePicture.csproj
</code>   

<p>Now you can open the project in your favorite IDE and run the app to ensure everything runs correctly. If you are using the command line to build and serve, use the following commands.</p>

   <code>dotnet build
dotnet run --project OktaProfilePicture
</code>   

 Secure your app with Okta 

<p>You’ll use Okta to secure the application quickly with Okta SDKs, so you don’t have to spin up an identity provider and deal with the tricky details of authentication.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>https://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Okta CLI will configure a new OIDC application and save some secret properties in the solution folder in a file called <code>.okta.env</code>. We’ll use the values in the app.</p>

<p>Some of the values in the <code>.okta.env</code> are secret, and ideally, they should be in a trusted store or in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&amp;tabs=windows">Secrets Manager</a> for local development. Since you’ll be making updates to configuration through this post, we’ll use App Settings so you can set up your configuration as you go along.</p>

<p>Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> to add a new section, <code>Okta</code>, with authentication details of your app as shown below. The <code>Domain</code> is the URL of the <code>Issuer</code> value without the path segments.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add authentication to the app. Open a terminal window, then run the following command to add Okta’s authentication middleware package.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.AspNetCore --version 4.0.0
</code>   

<p>To set up authentication services and register Okta’s authentication middleware services, open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
  {
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
  })
  .AddCookie()
  .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
    {
      OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
      ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
      ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret")
    });
</code>   

<p>Next, in the <code>Configure()</code> method, add a call to use authentication before adding authorization. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is having trouble figuring out references, add the following <code>using</code> statements:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll add a controller that handles login, logout, and protected data. Let’s add the methods for login and logout.</p>

<p>Create a controller named <code>AccountController</code> in the <code>Controllers</code> folder. Add the two methods to support login and logout. Your <code>AccountController</code> code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaProfilePicture.Controllers
{
  public class AccountController : Controller
  {
    public IActionResult LogIn()
    {
      if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
      {
        return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
      }

      return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public IActionResult LogOut()
    {
      return new SignOutResult(
        new[]
        {
          OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
          CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        },
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We’ll create an empty view for the <code>Account</code> controller as a placeholder. Create a new folder named <code>Account</code> in the <code>Views</code> directory. The <code>Account</code> folder is where the views to display and edit your profile will go. Add the file <code>Profile.cshtml</code> to the new <code>Account</code> folder, and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next we can update the initial view to add login and logout. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and add the following markup above the <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
  &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    @* &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; *@
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="LogOut" method="post"&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;a&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Sign In", "LogIn", "Account")&lt;/a&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>The parent <code>div</code> for the element we added needs some updates to the styles. Replace the</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;</code></p>

<p>with</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you run the app now, you can log in and log out, but there’s nothing to see yet.</p>

 View user details 

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta .NET management SDK</a> to get and update user data. Add the Nuget package by running the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.Sdk --version 5.3.1
</code>   

<p>The Okta management SDK requires an API token that we manually generate. Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens tab and press the Create Token button. Enter a name for the token (I will use “OktaProfilePicture”) and press the Create Token button to finish creating the token. Make sure you copy the token value because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now we can add the token to the settings file. Open <code>appSettings.Development.json</code>, and add a new property named <code>ApiToken</code> inside the Okta section. Add your token value. Your settings file should look like this.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": "",
    "ApiToken": "{token}"
  }
}

</code>   

<p>We want to add the Okta management SDK client to the Dependency Injection (DI) system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the method call <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt; new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration()
{
  OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
  Token = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ApiToken")
}));
</code>   

<p>Add the following using statements if your IDE didn’t already add them for you.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>Now we can use the service in the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add a private field of type <code>OktaClient</code> and add a constructor to set the field to the <code>AccountController</code> class. The DI system injects an instance of <code>OktaClient</code> that you will use. Your code will look like this.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>AccountController</code> class, create a private method to interact with Okta management SDK and retrieve user information.</p>

   <code>private async Task&lt;IUser&gt; GetOktaUser()
{
  var subject = HttpContext.User.Claims.First(claim =&gt; claim.Type == JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub).Value;
  return await _oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(subject);
}
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is confused about which packages to use, add the following using statements.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens;
using Okta.Sdk;
</code>   

<p>Let’s get your profile info. Create a new public method in <code>AccountController</code> named <code>Profile</code> to handle interacting with the Profile view. You’ll use the user model from Okta. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>We want to protect the <code>Profile</code> method against non-authenticated calls. With the Okta middleware configured, you can add guards. Add the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute directly above the <code>Profile</code> method.</p>

<p>Let’s update the profile view with user information. Open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and replace the existing code displaying your user info and a profile pic. You won’t have a profile pic to show yet, but that’s coming up soon!</p>

   <code>@model Okta.Sdk.IUser

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="card" style="width: 36rem;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
    @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null)
    {
      &lt;img class="rounded-circle border border-info" src="@ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"]" alt="Profile picture" width="300px"/&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="card-title h3"&gt;@Model.Profile.FirstName @Model.Profile.LastName&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="card-subtitle h6 mb-2 text-muted"&gt;@Model.Profile.Email&lt;/p&gt;
    @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.City) || !string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.CountryCode))
    {
      &lt;p class="mt-3 card-text"&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;📍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ml-2"&gt;@Model.Profile.City, @Model.Profile.CountryCode&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    }
    &lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-end"&gt;
      @* @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null) *@
      @* { *@
      @*    &lt;a class="btn btn-outline-danger mr-4" asp-action="DeleteProfilePic"&gt;Delete Profile Picture&lt;/a&gt; *@
      @* } *@
      @* &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt; *@
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now that we have a <code>Profile</code> method, we can update the main navbar. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and uncomment the line of code that links to the “Profile” view.</p>

<p>You can view your profile, but the edit button doesn’t work yet.</p>

<p></p>

 Edit your Okta profile 

<p>We’ll add the support to edit your profile info, except for your profile picture. We need a new model that supports the form fields for editing profiles. Add a new file named <code>UserProfileViewModel.cs</code> to the <code>Models</code> directory. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>#nullable enable
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace OktaProfilePicture.Models
{
  public class UserProfileViewModel
  {
    [Required]
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string? LastName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string? Email { get; set; }

    public string? City { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Country Code")]
    public string? CountryCode { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Profile Image")]
    public IFormFile? ProfileImage { get; set; }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next open the <code>AccountController</code> class. We need to add the methods to support editing your profile. First, we need a method to populate the view for editing, and we need another method to handle the profile update. Because both methods relate to editing the profile, we’ll name them the same and create a method overload.</p>

<p>Add a public method <code>EditProfile</code> to <code>AccountController</code> to populate the view and guard it against unauthenticated users. The method looks like the code below.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(new UserProfileViewModel()
  {
    City = user.Profile.City,
    Email = user.Profile.Email,
    CountryCode = user.Profile.CountryCode,
    FirstName = user.Profile.FirstName,
    LastName = user.Profile.LastName
  });
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll overload the <code>EditProfile</code> method with the user profile model. This method calls Okta management SDK to apply updates. Add the following method to <code>AccountController</code>.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the view for editing. Create a new view named <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> in <code>Views/Account</code> folder. Copy the code below and replace the contents of <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> with it.</p>

   <code>@model UserProfileViewModel

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "Edit Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
    &lt;form asp-action="EditProfile" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
      &lt;div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="FirstName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="LastName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="Email" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="City" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="City" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="City" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="CountryCode" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="CountryCode" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="CountryCode" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="ProfileImage" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;div class="custom-file"&gt;
          &lt;input asp-for="ProfileImage" class="custom-file-input" id="customFile"&gt;
          &lt;label class="custom-file-label" for="customFile"&gt;Choose file&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="ProfileImage" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Save" class="btn btn-primary" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Profile"&gt;Back to Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
  @{await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial");}

  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    const fileInput = document.querySelector('.custom-file-input');
    fileInput.addEventListener('change', (event) =&gt; {
      const fileName = event.target.value.split("\\").pop();
      document.querySelector('.custom-file-label').textContent = fileName;
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> to uncomment a line of code towards the bottom of the file. Uncomment the line that displays a button to edit profile - the line with <code>&lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;EditProfile&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to edit your profile information except for your profile picture. Next we’ll make it so your app persists your profile picture.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Azure Storage 

<p>To make your profile picture viewable, we need to persist the image somewhere. We’ll use Azure Storage to do this and use a custom attribute in Okta to store a unique identifier associated with the file in Azure. You’ll be able to upload and display a profile picture in the app.</p>

<p>First, we’ll create the custom attributes in Okta using the Okta admin dashboard.</p>

<p>Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Directory &gt; Profile Editor. You should see an item named User (default) in the list, which is Okta’s default user profile template. Select User (default) to open the Profile Editor. Press the +Add Attribute button.</p>

<p>You’ll add two string attributes, <code>profileImageKey</code> and <code>personId</code>:</p>
 
   Use “Profile Image Key” as the display name and <code>profileImageKey</code> as the variable name. 
   Use “Person Id” as the display name for the second attribute and <code>personId</code> as the variable name. 
 

<p>See the image below for the “Profile Image Key” attribute inputs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create another attribute named <code>personId</code>. If you look at the “User (default)” user type attribute list, you should see your two new attributes listed at the bottom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we’ll create Azure Storage. If you don’t already have an Azure subscription, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F">make a free account</a> before you begin. We’ll walk through the steps using the Azure Portal, but if you are an Azure pro, feel free to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-7.0.0">Azure PowerShell</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have an Azure subscription, open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a>. Open the menu by pressing the hamburger menu on the left, and select Storage accounts. Press +Create to create a storage account. In the Create a storage account view, create a Resource Group if you don’t already have one for test projects. I named my Resource Group “OktaDemo”. Enter <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> as the storage name, select a region (Azure’s default selection is fine here), then select Standard performance and Locally-redundant storage (LRS) for redundancy. Press the Review + create button at the bottom as the default options for the remaining selections are acceptable. Press Create to complete creating the storage account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we need to get the access keys for integrating the storage account SDK in the app. In the <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> storage account, open Access keys below the Security + networking section in the nav menu. Then press Show keys and copy the first Connection string field. Now we can move to the code!</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re going to add a new section for Azure resources to the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file in the solution to connect to the Azure resource. Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and add a new key named “Azure” with a property called “BlobStorageConnectionString” like the following code snippet.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll need to add the packages and set up the service. Add two Nuget packages — one for Azure Storage and the other for integrating Azure clients into the DI system. Add the packages by running the following commands in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.9.1
dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Extensions.Azure --version 1.1.1
</code>   

<p>Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAzureClients(builder =&gt;
{
  builder.AddBlobServiceClient(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:BlobStorageConnectionString"));
});
</code>   

<p>We can inject the blob service client into the <code>AccountController</code> and connect to the blob container. We’ll create the blob container that we’ll use in the constructor. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add the blob container client as shown below.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>Profile()</code> and <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> methods to upload and view the blob container image. First, let’s update the <code>Profile()</code> method.</p>

<p>The blob container’s access level is private, so we need to generate a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">shared access signature</a> that creates a read-only, temporary URL that we can use in the view. We’ll also use the custom attribute <code>profileImageKey</code> to retrieve an existing image if one exists.</p>

<p>Replace the existing <code>Profile()</code> method with the following code.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  var profileImage = (string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"];
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(profileImage))
  {
    return View(user);
  }

  var sasBuilder = new BlobSasBuilder
  {
    StartsOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
    ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(15)
  };

  sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobSasPermissions.Read);
  var url = _blobContainerClient.GetBlobClient(profileImage).GenerateSasUri(sasBuilder);
  ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] = url;

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> changes to</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  if (profile.ProfileImage != null)
  {
    await UpdateUserImage();
  }

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task UpdateUserImage()
  {
    var blobName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]))
    {
      await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);
    }
    await _blobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync(blobName, profile.ProfileImage?.OpenReadStream());
    user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = blobName;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>If you run the app, you can select a picture from local files to add to your profile and see your profile picture on the “Profile” page.</p>

 Add Azure Cognitive Services 

<p>Finally, we get to check out Azure Cognitive Services for facial analysis. We’ll use facial analysis in two different ways — for face detection and face verification.</p>

<p>First, we need to create the Azure resource and get the access keys. Open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace">Cognitive Services Face</a> resource page in the Azure portal. Press + Create to open the Create Face view. Select “OktaBlog” as the Resource group (or a Resource group of your choosing) and name the instance “OktaProfilePicture”. Since this is for demo purposes, I used the “Free F0” pricing tier. Press Review + create to create the resource. Open “OktaProfilePicture” Face service instance and open Keys and Endpoint. You will need both the key and the Endpoint.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file and add two new fields in the <code>Azure</code> section named <code>SubscriptionKey</code> and <code>FaceClientEndpoint</code>. Copy and paste the key and endpoint values from the Azure Keys and Endpoint view. The <code>Azure</code> section of your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> will now look like the following.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
    "SubscriptionKey": "{FaceResourceKey}",
    "FaceClientEndpoint": "https://{FaceResourceName}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>To add the packages, run the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.Face --version 2.8.0-preview.2
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the face service to the DI system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the call to <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt;
  new FaceClient(
    new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:SubscriptionKey")))
  {
    Endpoint = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:FaceClientEndpoint")
  }
);
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the service into the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code>, inject the face service in the constructor, then connect it to a private instance that we’ll use throughout the controller class. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;
private readonly FaceClient _faceClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient, FaceClient faceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _faceClient = faceClient;

  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>The first thing we want to do with the cognitive service is ensure there’s only one face in an image. To do so, we’ll use a built-in method to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.faceoperationsextensions.detectwithstreamasync?view=azure-dotnet">detect faces</a>.</p>

<p>In <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, we’ll add code to open the image file, detect the number of faces, and set an error if there isn’t exactly one face in the image. Replace the <code>if(profile.PageImage != null){await UpdateUserImage();}</code> statement with the following code.</p>

   <code>if (profile.ProfileImage == null)
{
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}

var stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
var detectedFaces = await _faceClient.Face.DetectWithStreamAsync(stream, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04, detectionModel: DetectionModel.Detection01);

if (detectedFaces.Count != 1 || detectedFaces[0].FaceId == null)
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", $"Detected {detectedFaces.Count} faces instead of 1 face");
  return View(profile);
}

await UpdateUserImage();
</code>   

<p>The <code>RecognitionModel.Recognition04</code> is the most accurate model currently available, and <code>DetectionModel.Detection01</code> is a model that avoids detecting small and blurry faces.</p>

<p>Now, if you try running the app and upload an image with you and your friends, you’ll see an error.</p>

 Perform facial analysis 

<p>Next, let’s add the facial analysis. We need to handle two scenarios.</p>
 
   You’re adding a profile picture for the first time — this sets the baseline for the facial features to use in future comparisons 
   You’re updating your profile picture — facial analysis runs against the face in this image and compares it to the baseline 
 

<p>Let’s handle the first scenario.</p>

<p>The Face API only stores the extracted facial features for 24 hours by default, so we need to set a baseline that we can refer to beyond the 24-hour window. We can store facial features within the “OktaProfilePicture” Azure Cognitive Services resource, which we’ll do for the first upload scenario.</p>

<p>In the <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, replace the line of code that calls <code>await UpdateUserImage();</code> with the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>var personGroupId = user.Id.ToLower();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["personId"]))
{
  await _faceClient.PersonGroup.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04);

  stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
  var personId = (await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login)).PersonId;
  await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(personGroupId, personId, stream);

  user.Profile["personId"] = personId;
  await UpdateUserImage();
} else {

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>PersonGroup</code> is a container object for a group of people. We’re using your Okta user ID as the unique identifier for this group, so each group is truly individualized. Other options could be group or department IDs. The <code>PersonGroupPerson</code> object is an individual within the group, so there is usually a 1:n relationship between <code>PersonGroup</code> and <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>. We’re also associating one face to a <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>, although you can add multiple images of an individual so you can train the service to analyze an individual better. We’re using a simple case here to showcase how this service works by a single image of an individual.</p>

<p>Now we want to handle the second scenario — where we want to perform facial analysis compared to the baseline facial features. We want only to allow the image to update when we have some measure of confidence that the new face image matches the baseline. Add the following snippet inside the <code>else</code> block from the code above.</p>

   <code>var faceId = detectedFaces[0].FaceId.Value;

var personId = new Guid((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
var verifyResult = await _faceClient.Face.VerifyFaceToPersonAsync(faceId, personId, personGroupId);

if (verifyResult.IsIdentical &amp;&amp; verifyResult.Confidence &gt;= 0.8)
{
  await UpdateUserImage();
}
else
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", "The uploaded picture doesn't match your current picture");
  return View(profile);
}
</code>   

<p>We used a confidence level of 80% in positive identifications since we only have one facial feature for comparison. With better training, you can increase the confidence level.</p>

<p>Now you can upload a picture of yourself and then upload a photo of a friend to see what happens.</p>

 Resetting profile pictures 

<p>Sometimes you need to clear everything out and start over. I uploaded a picture of myself wearing oversized sunglasses and a hat, and the face service no longer recognized me. 😎</p>

<p>Let’s add in the delete functionality so you can reset everything.</p>

<p>In <code>AccountController</code> we’ll add a new method called <code>DeleteProfilePic()</code>. This method deletes the image from container storage, removes links to stored facial features, and clears out the custom attributes set in your Okta profile. Copy the code below and add it to the end of the <code>AccountController</code> class.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProfilePic()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  await CleanAzureResources();

  user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = null;
  user.Profile["personId"] = null;
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task CleanAzureResources()
  {
    // remove image from blob
    await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);

    // remove face from Face services
    var personId = Guid.Parse((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower(), personId);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroup.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower());
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and uncomment the remaining commented out code. Doing so allows the “Delete Profile Picture” button to display.</p>

<p>Now you can reset your profile picture and upload that picture of you wearing a hat and sunglasses to test out the facial comparison ability.</p>

<p>How people pay bills, shop online, open accounts and experience their finances is evolving quickly. Fintech innovations are altering the way consumers think about and relate to money. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the digital transition. The shifting reality of how finances are managed is underway. Bank branches and paper checks are an afterthought to a growing number of consumers. Eight in 10 Americans are linking their bank accounts digitally, using these connections to automate everyday tasks like paying credit card and utility bills, according to Mastercard’s new study, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">The Rise of Open Banking</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sea change in consumer expectations is already in motion. With every leap in speed, security, and ease of use, open banking apps and services usher in the next generation of finance. The advent of the internet has trained the human mind to process far more information than in the past, and to do it quickly. When it comes to their personal finances, people want the real-time data whenever they want it. Save them time and money, and enhance their financial health, or they won’t adopt your platform.</p>
 1. Saving More Time, Creating Less Work 
<p>Just a handful of years ago, a group of friends out to dinner would have to all reach into their wallets and purses, chip in cash, write a check or stack a pile of credit cards on top of the bill, and wait for the server to swipe them all. With the massive adoption and growth of P2P payment apps, these antiquated processes are quickly becoming a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In real time, payments can be split between friends with a few taps on the mobile screen. Digital wallets allow a busy shopper to tap their phone against a payment terminal and breeze through checkout at retail stores. Encrypted credit card info auto-populates, saving time and reducing user error when shopping online. The countless hours these new processes save is the biggest driver for adoption. 59% of study respondents cited this as their number one motivator.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Saving Money 
<p>65% of Americans <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/budgeting/spending-knowledge-survey/">don’t know</a> how much money they spent last month. Saving doesn’t come naturally to many people, and our <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/why-are-we-so-emotional-about-money">emotionally-charged relationship</a> with money certainly doesn’t help. So much emphasis is placed on new and better ways to spend that saving becomes just a lurking afterthought. Open banking innovators are addressing this huge segment of consumers with a rich slate of apps and services. AI and machine-learning engines do the heavy lifting of savings calculation, goal-setting and projection, raising the level of users’ financial literacy. 42% of Americans surveyed wanted help saving their money, and trust technology to give them the advantage they need.</p>
<p>Open banking technology powers some of the most effective fintech apps for saving money, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to take a deep dive into spending habits and cash flow. Some even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">gamify finances</a>, injecting the process with fun and some healthy self-competition.&nbsp;</p>
  
 3. Improving Financial Health 
<p>Open banking and AI make a powerful duo. Open banking connections to third-party financial service providers are flipping the data experience to favor the consumer. Anyone can download a financial management app, grant permission to access their bank accounts, and be guided easily through opening accounts, investment suggestions, and loan applications. This happens in moments, not hours or days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fintech AI systems process massive amounts of data in milliseconds. App and service developers can leverage this power to analyze a consumer’s subscription payments, utility bills, direct deposits and loan obligations near-instantaneously. Machine learning and AI engines can use this rich, real-time data to suggest smart financial planning and investing options. It’s a growing expectation that has to be accounted for in app development. Exposure to the open banking ecosystem is raising the level of consumer financial literacy, and it’s happening quickly. As a result, financial decision-making can improve dramatically. Consumers are seeing the positive results of adoption in their bank balances: 35% of respondents to the survey say improved financial health is why they use fintech.&nbsp;</p>
 4. Automate It! 
<p>No one leaps out of bed in the morning in wild anticipation of paying the electricity bill. Mundane, time-consuming financial tasks don’t actually have to absorb anyone’s time. Open banking allows easy setup and maintenance of connections to financial institutions, allowing consumers to set a variety of monthly payments and subscriptions to auto-pay. With the average consumer spending <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">$273 per month</a> on a mixed bag of small payments, automation saves a considerable amount of time, and it ensures payments aren’t missed. U.S. households average <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/18/deloitte-consumers-load-up-on-subscriptions-but-are-frustrated-with-fragmentation/">nine separate payments</a> per month just for entertainment subscriptions. Add gym memberships, retail subscriptions and utilities to an ever-growing list of small, recurring transactions, and the benefit of utilizing technology to manage these payments becomes obvious. 26% of North Americans surveyed are attracted to technology to help them automate these little chores, freeing up their time for more important concerns.&nbsp;</p>
 5. Getting a Better Holistic View of Finances 
<p>Gone are the days when consumers used file drawers stuffed with manila folders, neatly tabbed, in an attempt to keep checking the pulse of their financial health. Open banking data has spawned a wealth of apps and services that give consumers and small businesses an up-to-the-moment picture of their finances. Open banking connections across accounts and across financial institutions power the apps that consumers are using to take their financial temperature. The growing expectation is that individuals should be able to see what their money is doing and where it’s going, 24 hours a day. 18% of North American users said that tracking their money was a major driver for fintech adoption.&nbsp;</p>

According to the order published by the CFTC, Polymarket offered at least 900 such markets over the last 18&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>These markets are swaps under federal&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Polymarket cooperated with the investigation, according the CFTC’s press release, leading to a reduced fine. The company will stop offering markets by Jan. 14 and commit to making all funds available to users by Jan. 24, according to the order. Polymarket will also cease and desist any further violations of the CEA, though it doesn’t appear the company itself will be shut&nbsp;down.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere, Berlin-based Neuhaus is<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/10/why-were-shutting-our-successful-fundraising-platform/"> preemptively shutting down a “viable security token business” due to lack of regulatory clarity</a> (via /gregkidd):</blockquote><blockquote>Our concept-proving case — Greyp Bikes — made the full cycle, from issuing tokenized shares for retail investors, through corporate governance on blockchain, to the exit to Porsche and proceeds distribution via ERC20 tokens. Effectively, there were never any compliance issues, technical problems or security breaches. An European tech company fundraised through the issuance of securities using a decentralized technology. And more than 1,000 investors from dozens of countries participated. How&nbsp;cool.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet, we are closing the Neufund business.</blockquote><blockquote>Why? Because today, more than two years after Greyp fundraised, we still are unsure whether regulation allows us to repeat the Greyp fundraising model with other similar companies. Despite engaging with regulators for years, we didn’t manage to get out of the limbo of legal uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote>And, I dare say, no DeFi (decentralized finance) company, aiming for regular investors on a bigger scale, has ever made it so&nbsp;far.</blockquote><p>Not the most encouraging updates.

<p><a href="http://dock.io/">Dock</a> is a bespoke blockchain designed and built to be used for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. One of the many important use cases where Dock’s technology can be used is alongside NFTs to reduce fraud and preserve the privacy of NFT owners. To help illustrate how this could work, we are sharing a specific use case with world-renowned vintage watch dealer, <a href="https://www.fogcityvintage.com/">Fog City Vintage</a>.</p><p>Before we dive into the use case, it’s important to understand the differences between NFTs and Verifiable Credentials, and how they can work together.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials contain cryptographically signed pieces of information that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer of the Verifiable Credential. Information contained in the Verifiable Credential is specific to the holder of the credential, which can be an individual, entity, or even an object, and Verifiable Credentials aren’t considered transferable or able to change ownership. In addition, Verifiable Credentials are stored off-chain, typically in a holder’s wallet, and the only data on-chain is the DID and a hash pointing to the credential ensuring data privacy. Some common use cases for Verifiable Credentials include credentials used to prove identity, skills, and achievements.</p><p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are blockchain-based tokens that contain digitally unique data and identifiers. They are designed to be transferable and can contain digital artwork, collectibles, or representation of real-world assets. Most NFTs today exist on the Ethereum blockchain and so their ownership is tied to a public Ethereum address. Dock has integrated with Ethereum to enable NFTs to be created directly on the Dock blockchain.</p> How can NFTs &amp; Verifiable Credentials work together? <p></p><p>Although they are fundamentally different, there are some very interesting use cases for Verifiable Credentials to be used alongside NFTs. Verifiable Credentials can provide a privacy preserving yet cryptographically provable identity linked to an NFT, and therefore provide tamper-proof information about the identity of an NFT owner, creator, or buyer.</p><p>Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a Verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. Verifiable credentials issued via Dock use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure data privacy, so the parties involved in the NFT transaction can prove their legitimacy without actually revealing their real-world identities or private information.</p><p>Another way that Verifiable Credentials can be used alongside NFTs is to prove qualifications in order to access an NFT or an NFT marketplace. For example, an artist may want their NFTs to only be accessible by their fans or specific members of a community who meet certain criteria. In this instance, Verifiable Credentials could be issued to community members demonstrating they meet the criteria and can then present the Verifiable Credential to enable them to receive the NFT. There could also be an NFT marketplace that is only appropriate for certain ages or populations; a Verifiable Credential could be used to prove that someone meets this criteria without compromising their identity in order to be able to transact in the NFT marketplace.</p> Dock and Fog City Vintage Watches <p>Fog City Vintage is a world-renowned vintage watch dealer who is using NFTs to address specific problems that exist in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/luxury-watch-shortage-drives-growth-of-20-billion-secondhand-market.html">$20 billion vintage watch industry</a>. Vintage watches are inherently unique, highly tradeable, and very expensive, but the market for these watches is highly susceptible to fraud and there are no quality standards. Most trades are based on loose connections and it’s not uncommon for sellers to be defrauded out of &nbsp;tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars. Tim Bender, CEO of Fog City Vintage, estimates that well over $1 billion is lost annually by buyers of fraudulent vintage watches.</p><p>Fog City Vintage is planning to use NFTs to represent the authenticity of the watch in order to prevent fraud and enhance the tradability of the watches. Fog City will be issuing NFTs that represent the vintage watches and provide an expert evaluation of the condition of the watches based on a new standard they are developing. By issuing NFTs, which can be done on the Dock blockchain, Fog City can provide watch buyers with the assurance that they are purchasing legitimate watches from reputable buyers.</p><p>Dock’s technology can be used to enhance Fog City’s watch marketplace in several ways. Verifiable Credentials can be issued to marketplace buyers and sellers that reflect their purchase history to eliminate fraudsters and ensure only legitimate parties are involved in the transactions. In addition, Fog City, as well as other vintage watch dealers, can have a Verifiable Credential that proves their own identity as reputable experts who are qualified to evaluate the condition of the watches. The watch dealers would issue certificates of authenticity for the watches based on their evaluations to ensure only genuine watches are being traded and therefore provide further trust and transparency in the marketplace.</p><p>Since Dock provides technology to issue anonymous credentials, all of the Verifiable Credentials shared in the transactions would protect the real identity of the marketplace participants without compromising the integrity of the marketplace. Verifiable Credentials and NFTs are stored in the holder's own digital wallets rather than in a centralized database, which removes the risk of holding customer data while giving customers control of their own identity and assets. Combining Verifiable Credentials with NFTs is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to marketplaces while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

Description: Welcome to lucky episode number 13! Your new host Aubrey Turner, Executive Advisor at Ping, is thrilled to welcome Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder of the award-winning data platform Meeco. Katryna discusses Meeco’s mission to enable everyone on the planet access to equity and value in exchange for the data and information they share. She talks about why she saw a need for Meeco’s services, what we need to know as we approach a more “physigital”world, and how her vision all started with a Tom Cruise film. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:34] Katryna talks about her journey of founding Meeco, and how she was inspired by Tom Cruise’s movie Minority Report. In early 2012 she sat down and wrote a Manifesto, and asked the question: what would happen if everyday people had the power to make really good decisions on data, the way that social networks, government, and enterprise do? How can we create meaningful value and make better decisions with our data? [8:12] Katryna shares some of her concerns around modern privacy and where she sees things evolving, both good and bad. [9:35] Technology is neutral. It’s what we do with it that gives it bias and can make it either creepy or cool. [11:33] What does Katryna mean when she says it starts with trust by design? [17:22] The next wave may be just starting to bring people and things into the direct value chain, through wearables or IoT devices for example. [18:31] How can we create better digital onboarding for employees, knowing that even post-COVID-19 our world will not go back to how it was in December 2020? One thing that Katryna is sure of is that we must lean into innovation rather than doing nothing and waiting to see. [36:13] We must make sure we are paying attention to the misalignment between law and technology, especially when it comes to ethics and the safety of children growing up in a digital-forward world. &nbsp; Quotes:    “I think the challenge for any kind of technology and regulation is a lag  factor, not a lead factor.”—Katryna         “The line between creepy and cool is one of the things we are always trying to address from a technology point of view.”—Katryna   “There isn’t really the option to not find better ways of digitally engaging.”—Katryna    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity AubreyTurner KatrynaDow Meeco “HowCOVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping point—and transformed business forever”     &nbsp;       &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

Our aim is to accelerate the deployment of DIDs and verifiable credentials, ensuring interoperability between available solutions and increasing the self-sovereignty of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve had the chance to engage with multiple partners in the past year, allowing us to broaden and deepen our SSI knowledge and, what’s more, partnering up in projects that mark a significant turn in the SSI world and increase engagement from both users and developers.&nbsp;</p>



 &nbsp;<br>Thank You to..&nbsp; 



<p>T-Labs/T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom)&nbsp;</p>



<p>T-Labs is the Research &amp; Development Department of Deutsche Telekom, focusing on bringing new technology trends to the market and delivering tangible results into Deutsche Telekom’s innovation portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2017, Jolocom has partnered with T-Labs to launch the development, bringing together a group of blockchain startups to build the prototype operating stack: the idea being that enterprises can build a decentralized back-end in a matter of minutes. Jolocom is developing a modular solution that enables individuals, organizations and companies to get a self-sovereign digital identity. In the T-Labs prototype, Jolocom provides the tool to create and securely verify claims about identity. This allows for the modeling of a trustworthy and complex relationships between entities (e.g. ownership structures of IoT devices with organizations/individuals). Modeling these relationships with a self-sovereign solution enables a frictionless bridge between different ecosystems and network environments. What we have begun with T-Labs in 2018, we are happy to continue from early 2021 into the middle of 2022 with T-Systems and others as part of our current project portfolios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Bundesdruckerei&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesdruckerei (BDR)&nbsp; is home to the digital experts supplying Germany’s ID cards and passports. They are working with different ID management solutions and technologies at the federal government security company. One of these approaches made use of Jolocom’s identity library and wallet. In 2019, the BDR demonstrated the potential of decentralized self-sovereign identity solutions in NAME OF PILOT, where identity information remains under the complete control of the citizen via the Jolocom SmartWallet downloaded onto their mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More precisely, researchers at BDR merged the Jolocom software for decentralized identity and access management with the existing government IT infrastructure for verification and identification. The goal: creating one of the earliest proof-of-concepts (POCs) for a decentralized digital ID in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This particular POC was an early example of an issuing and verification authority merging its existing technology with self-sovereign identity software. Jolocom’s software is fully open source. The part we played was adjusting our app interface to support BDR’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With more governments exploring the advantages of blockchain and, more specifically, self-sovereign identity solutions for common identity and access management challenges, we look forward to offering our open source library more widely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, we have engaged with the BDR in another main project of which you might have heard: ONCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft: ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ projects ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), where a dozen consortia were invited to present their concepts in an innovation competition and&nbsp;four projects that qualified for a fully-funded three year implementation phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of these four SDI implementation projects, to which we will lend our expertise in self-sovereign identity, years of experience in developing digital identity wallets and the open-source Jolocom stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch, followed by ID-Ideal and SDIKA. A few words about each:&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE aims to harmonize eID with SSI in user-controlled wallets. ID-Ideal has the goal of harmonizing trust providers and consumers from multiple networks and legal setups under one coherent trust framework. Finally, SDIKA pursues the realization of cross-use case identities in open ecosystems with widespread adoption. We thank our new and old partners for joining us on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these projects are funded and supported by the BMWi, and we are grateful for using this huge opportunity to bring SSI to the individual citizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical Information Library Hanover&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Technical Information Library in Hanover is the German specialist library for technology as well as architecture, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. TIB is the world’s largest specialist library for technology and natural sciences. What’s more, TIB and Jolocom have both been early adopters and pioneers of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and the Web 3.0 approach in Germany. Multiple encounters within the DLT community have led to a growing desire to join forces so we can further develop interoperability, open standards and open access. Together, we created the Conference Digital Identifier Integration (conDIDi) project. The idea was to implement the SSI approach in the academic sector, while also increasing global collaboration and interoperability due to the gradual integration of different solutions (i.e. ORCID, ConfIDent and conDIDi) into one single system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, conDIDi seeks to reduce the management burden for both participants and organizers: Automating the process of verifying that participants fulfilled requisite criteria, such as having paid fees, met requirements for paper submission, agreed to chair a panel, checked into the venue, etc, would reduce a large part of the bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly overhead of conference management.&nbsp; At the same time, automated exchange of verifiable participation credentials reduces the waiting time for academics to build their CVs and paper portfolios, and – more recently – for medical professionals to collect proofs of training and education requirements. ConDIDi is now an ongoing pilot project within TIB and we are excited to see what it will grow into and to support its continuous development in future collaborations with our partners at TIB. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stacks&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom also partnered with Stacks, integrating the Stacks into Jolocom SSI solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integration will enable any developer to easily add support for Stacks-based identities to their SSI service, and to build new SSI services (e.g. issuers, verifiers, mediators) with identities secured by the Stacks blockchain. Furthermore, the developed tools will also allow any user who owns a BNS name to easily derive a valid, globally resolvable DID and use it with various SSI services. Finally, the Jolocom SmartWallet will allow regular users to easily interact with SSI services secured by DIDs anchored on the Stacks network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, real-world activities providing any verifiable information for renting a bike or hotel room would happen in a much more seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving way. While the benefits of this technology will be globally available and relevant, we are applying to the Stacks Foundation with a time-sensitive opportunity to reach the European market with pilot projects that can really scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Jolocom are looking forward to continuing our great partnerships in current and upcoming projects, as well as building many more partnerships in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  In just a year, the Indicio Network has grown into the leading platform for enterprise-grade decentralized products and services—and a community of ground-breaking companies in decentralized and Web3 identity products and services  
			  
				
				
				 <p>What a year.</p>
<p>Last January, we launched the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, the keystone of the Indicio Network, a global platform designed to support mission critical uses of decentralized identity built on the open-source Hyperledger Indy code base.</p>
<p>The MainNet joined its older <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a> sibling, launched in 2020, and — in the summer of 2021 — both were joined by the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>.</p>
<p>Together, they enabled companies to build and test their products (TestNet), demonstrate their products in a safe environment (DemoNet), and then deploy their products in a global &nbsp;marketplace with the assurance that they were backed by a robust, professionally staffed, global MainNet.</p>
<p>That assurance is critical. We know how long it takes to test and demo products. We know what enterprises need to create and sell products. We saw the need, we heard, repeatedly, from our earliest clients that’s what they needed; and so we made it a reality.</p>
<p>Now, in January 2022, our growing global network of nodes is supported by twenty-six diverse companies on five continents. Each is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age. Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes the Indicio Network the best network for decentralized identity solutions?<br>Decentralized identity networks are often likened to utilities for identity, so what do people, typically, want from utilities? Dependability, affordability, and simplicity</p>
<p>Dependability. There can’t be outages. If technical problems occur, they need to be fixed fast. The Indicio Network meets these challenges, first by scale. Each node on the network supports a copy of the ledger, so unlike Facebook going down, there are 26 other Facebooks to make sure your product, company, or organization isn’t in the dark.</p>
<p>Second, our network is staffed and monitored by experts using state-of-the-art monitoring tools. This may sound obvious—surely every network has this? But it isn’t and they don’t. We as a company build solutions on the Indicio Network. We have skin in the network working dependably. We need it to be the best functioning utility for identity out there. This means our staff are your staff in this endeavor. We’re here for you — all the time. Your success is our success.</p>
<p>Affordability. Writes to the ledger are one way to monetize decentralized identity. We believe in making fees for writing to our ledger simple, cost effective, and predictable. We also believe that these fees should not be an obstacle to implementing the right architecture for a solution. No decentralized identity system should cut corners to save money or from fear of unexpected future costs. We see affordability driving reliability, and reliability driving and sustaining adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplicity. It’s no secret that decentralized identity can be tough to understand if you’re delving into it for the first time (and especially if you’re not an engineer). We get it! We want to make everything about decentralized identity as simple as possible, from onboarding a node to providing wizards to simplify technical processes and enabling machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Still too complicated? We will host and run a node for you.</p>
<p>We also have the largest range of hands-on <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/">training workshops</a> for all aspects of decentralized identity—and we were chosen by Hyperledger to develop and run technical training programs.</p>
<p>This is what we built in 2021—and it’s amazing to look back at the year and all we — and our node operators — achieved. But it was even more exciting to see what people began building and releasing on this foundation, projects such as the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Health Pass</a>, <a href="https://liquidavatartechnologies.com/the-liquid-avatar-verifiable-credentials-ecosystem/">LAVCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1k98Fpjr0-liquid-avatar-technologies-and-dynamics-inc-tap-payment-infrastructure-for-verification-of-digital-credentials.html">Passmate</a>.</p>
<p>As we move toward a more trustworthy digital world, 2022 is going to be one long, energetic build-athon. And if that excites you,<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"> we should talk</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know that until 2021 <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html">82.4 million people</a> have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to wars and conflicts? That’s almost the size of Germany’s population!</p><p>Yet, they are struggling for basic human needs such as food, clothing, and&nbsp;shelter.</p><p>Why?</p> An Identity&nbsp;Crisis <p>Much of their woes stem from the fact that they do not have the documents to prove their nationality or for that matter, even their refugee&nbsp;status.</p><p>Unfortunately, a majority of the documents that prove identity and nationality are in the form of physical documents such as a passport or driver’s license that can get lost, damaged, or stolen while fleeing from their country. Sometimes, it may even be left behind for security&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>As a result, many of these people become stateless and are unable to get refugee status or its benefits, and for the most part of their lives, languish in camps and work only in low-paying jobs.</p><p>The sad part is that this trickles down to their children as well, and the next generation of refugees are unable to study or find jobs because the parents don’t have the required documents.</p><p>In this sense, the state of refugees today is an identity crisis as they do not have documents to prove their identity and nationality.</p> What is the Solution? <p>From the above discussion, it’s clear that every refugee requires an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> that would enable that person and his/her family members to get the refugee benefits offered by the host&nbsp;country.</p><p>Ideally, the document must&nbsp;be,</p>  Verifiable, so the refugee can get access to financial and non-financial benefits under treaties and host nation programs.  Easy to access from anywhere, so an individual can digitally prove his or her educational credentials and job experience to make it easy for them to find work in the host&nbsp;nation.  Stored in a safe&nbsp;place.  Tamper-proof.  From a competent authority that is trustable by anyone in any part of the world. For example, the government of a&nbsp;nation.  <p>While these conditions may sound daunting at first, the truth is we already have such an identity in place. It’s called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and this is implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The existing format of these VCs has to be simply extended to meet the requirements of the host nation, so every refugee can prove his or her identity and credentials in no&nbsp;time.</p> How can Verifiable Credentials Help? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> meet all of the requirements mentioned above.</p><p>It is machine-verifiable, tamper-proof, and has the digital signatures of the entity that is authorized to issue&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here is how a VC&nbsp;looks.</p><p>As you can see, the cryptographic proof in the VC proves that it has come from an authorized entity while the identification details show the credentials of the holder. Furthermore, it cannot be tampered with or censored.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a real-world example.</p> Real-world Example <p>Let’s say Mr.X is forced out of his country due to war and he reaches the neighboring country but doesn’t have any physical document to prove his identity such as name, address, educational qualifications, work experience, etc.</p><p>Thankfully, he has them all in the form of a verifiable credential. So, he visits the Foreign Office of the host nation, logs into the office’s computer, generates a verifiable presentation, and shares the same with the government officials.</p><p>In turn, the officials scan the QR code and learn all about Mr. X. They check if he qualifies for the refugee status and grants the same through a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Now, Mr.X is all set to move around the host nation, collect refugee allowances, study, find a job, and get on with&nbsp;life.</p><p>As you can see, the entire process takes only a few minutes and gives Mr. X a chance to start his life all over again. That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Before we start dreaming about a pain-free world, note that VCs may not work well in all situations.</p> Are There Any Downsides? <p>There are a few problems that come with using VCs to handle refugee identities.</p><p>Let’s say Mr. X is going to his neighboring country because of political persecution. Knowing this, his country revokes all the VCs issued for him. As a result, he can no longer use the VCs to prove his identity, though he can use VCs issued by his employer and educational institutions, provided they are not <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>. In this sense, VCs can be used for political revenge.</p><p>The second issue is that <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> can become inaccessible if Mr.X forgets the password of his digital wallet where the credentials are&nbsp;stored.</p><p>So, is VC a solution at&nbsp;all?</p><p>Yes, in most cases. These VCs can be a life-saver for most refugees as it proves their identity, work experience, and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Curious to know how else VCs can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">used</a> across different industries and situations?

<p>If there were a sheriff in gaming country, he better be worried, cause there is a new player in town. Most gamers would be familiar with pay-to-win (P2W), an insidious game mechanic that enables faster progress to those who fork out real cash. Players can acquire more powerful weapons or equipment, extra health allocation, etc. -for a price-, thus giving these ‘premium’ players an unfair advantage...</p>

 Stories from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana <p>In 2021, together with <a href="https://habitusinsight.com/">Habitus Insight</a>, we explored stories on the human impact of identity exclusion for <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>. This is the first of two blogs on that research — the following blog will share the findings from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>As part of that work, we spoke to several people who have experienced ID exclusion. Va-Bene is a transwoman — or as she calls herself, a transvatar — based in Kumasi, Ghana. She faces challenges every time she goes to a physical bank branch. Her IDs (and particularly the photos on them) don’t reflect who she is&nbsp;now.</p><p>“If I have to withdraw money with my ATM card, that is fine. But any other thing I will do directly in the bank. Believe me, either we are going to fight in the bank or I’m just going to be delayed for several hours without any money.” Being denied access to her own money not only has a direct financial impact on Va-Bene. It also has an emotional impact: “it is very frustrating when I am excluded. Very, very frustrating. Very depressing.”</p> “Know Your Customer” and existing challenges of exclusion <p>In her book <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199463510.001.0001/oso-9780199463510">In Pursuit of Proof</a>, Tarangini Sriraraman documents how “identification” began as a need to recognise individuals for governance, but has become a process heavily shaped by social norms. Why is gender an important characteristic for identification? Who decides how that is categorised (male/female)? What happens when gender goes beyond binary, as in Va-Bene’s case?</p><p>“Know Your Customer” (KYC) is a legal requirement to comply with anti-money laundering regulations (AML) in most countries. Verification requirements to access financial services often include database checks, identity document verification, and, increasingly, biometric checks. For proof of address, utility bills or bank statements can often serve as acceptable documentation. By verifying a customer’s identity and intentions when they open an account, and then understanding transaction patterns, financial institutions can more accurately pinpoint potential account takeover or other suspicious activities.</p><p>However, many people get stuck when trying to prove who they are (like Va-Bene) or where they live. Obtaining an ID can be a time-consuming and expensive process, made more challenging for those who are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">female</a>, from an ethnic or racial minority background, live in a rural area or with a disability, or are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees or migrants</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/early-financial-inclusion-can-lead-to-exclusion-experiences-of-kenyan-youth-eb99c7476d7d">Youth, too, are emerging as a demographic</a> facing barriers to ID. Often these issues include not having a proof of address (being without a fixed address, having recently arrived in the country, or for other reasons) or not being able to easily prove who one is (not having <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems">foundational ID</a> documentation). These challenges can become even harder to address without knowledge of where to go or what to do&nbsp;next.</p><p>Interview with Payal, a recently arrived migrant in northwest London, UK, who faced challenges opening a bank account without proof of&nbsp;address.</p> Next steps <p>In addition to Va-Bene and Payal, we spoke to a range of participants who are or who have felt excluded from financial systems for different reasons and we’ll be sharing these stories over the next few months. This research is the foundation for Women in Identity to build an Identity Code of Conduct — a set of guiding principles and a framework for inclusive ID-product development.</p><p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in financial services, where ID is needed to protect users (e.g., from financial crime), but at the same time provide access to specific products. Service providers need to know who users are, but how does that process happen, why, and when does it become problematic? The Identity Code of Conduct will establish a set of guiding principles around inclusion, building on the broader <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles">Digital ID Principles</a>. It will offer a practical set of tools to address inclusion at every stage of identification.</p> Note from Women in Identity: <p>At <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> we believe identity solutions should be inclusive, built for all, by all. But we also believe this does not happen by&nbsp;chance.</p><p>The aim of our initial research and videos is to work towards this Code of Conduct: a practical guide for product designers to gain deeper empathy for the challenges experienced at the user end of the ID lifecycle and the knowledge to take these challenges into account when designing products.</p><p>Other sectors already take this approach to product development. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has an ongoing Code of Practice based on principles of care, fairness, honesty, and respect that impact agreed standards of product development (e.g., clear and transparent information on packaging).</p><p>We believe we can learn from other industries and create an Identity Code of Conduct which ensures inclusion is built into identity product design, thus making these products better for the organisations that rely on them and for the people that use&nbsp;them.</p><p>We look forward to you joining us on this journey and welcome feedback and suggestions. Please reach out to us on @WomenInID on Twitter or @WomenInIdentity on LinkedIn!</p><p>Read more about this project at <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">ID Code of Conduct</a> and follow us at @womeninID @WomenInIdentity @CaribouDigital @habitusinsight #DiversityByDesign #ForAllByAll #IDCodeofConduct #IdentityExclusion</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-human-impact-of-identity-exclusion-in-financial-services-ce1e0d769389">The human impact of identity exclusion in financial services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Introduction to Server Blazor apps 

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor">Blazor</a> is an exciting new technology from Microsoft that will allow developers to bring C# to clients. Server and client components are written in the same language and can be used and re-used interchangeably. Blazor comes in two flavors, server and client apps. In this tutorial you will be working with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0">Server Blazor</a> apps, where the C# code is run on the server, and messages are exchanged using <code>SignalR</code>.</p>

<p>I’ll show you how to integrate Okta with a server-side Blazor app. Then you will learn how to use Okta’s multi-factor authentication system to provide an additional layer of security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a technology in which a user must present two or more credentials before they can successfully gain access to complete a login or other transaction.   There are a number of ways this can be accomplished.  The most common is to email or text message a code to a user after the user is authenticated.  The user can then verify the code thus establishing that the user knows the proper credentials but also has access to the phone number or email address of record.</p>

 What you’ll need 

 
   Your favorite IDE (I will be using Visual Studio 2019, but Visual Studio Code is another great option.) 
   A <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">git repository</a> 
   .NET <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">5</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> 
   The <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> tool 
 

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Using the Okta CLI, <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/apps/create/">create a new Okta app</a> for .NET Blazor. Or, use your Okta admin portal to accomplish this: Navigate to Applications, click on <code>Create App Integration</code>, select OIDC for <code>Sign in Type</code>, Web for <code>Application Type</code>, and fill out the specifics for your localhost environment.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select ASP.NET Core. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://localhost:44378/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>https://localhost:44378/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnetcore3/create-okta-application/">Create a ASP.NET Core App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once you have completed an Okta application setup you will need to enable multi-factor authentication and then enable it on your application. Now, navigate to the admin portal and under Applications select the application you just created. Click on Sign on and under the Sign on Policy section click on Add Rule.</p>

<p>Under the Access section click on Multifactor Settings. For this application you will only be enabling SMS Authentication but you can see the Factor Types that Okta allows on this page. Under the SMS Authentication tab set the drop-down to Active.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Return to the Rule page and click Prompt for factor and then click Every sign on. Give your new rule a name and click Save. This sign-on policy will now trigger for anyone who attempts to sign on to this application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your Blazor application 

<p>Open Visual Studio 2019 and select Create a new project. Find the Blazor App entry on the Create a project page.  Please note, if you are using a different version of Visual Studio your project create templates may look different.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Create a new Blazor app section select Blazor Server App and give it a minute to set up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once it does you will see the Configure your new project screen.  Name your project Okta_ServerDemo and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After setup is complete, take a minute to run the application and see how Blazor is set up. For this tutorial, the demo application that comes with Blazor setup is enough. We will need to make some changes to the application though.</p>

 Set up your application 

<p>First install the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from NuGet via the Command Line or NuGet package manager. This will make integration with Okta quick and easy.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.0.0
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and edit the code with the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>If you don’t know where to find the values for your Okta settings, you should be able to find them in <code>.okta.env</code>. You can also retrieve them from the Okta admin console.</p>

<p>You can now alter your <code>Startup.cs</code> to configure authentication using Okta.</p>

            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Write your application 

<p>Next, you can turn your attention to the pages. First, you will want to edit <code>App.razor</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
</code>   

<p>Much of this page is boilerplate from the setup process. But you need to make a few important changes. First, wrap the entire code in the <code>CascadingAuthenticationState</code> element. This will cascade the authentication state to each of your routes. Next, you need to change <code>RouteView</code> to <code>AuthorizeView</code> and handle the <code>Authorizing</code> and <code>NotAuthorized</code> states.</p>

<p>At this point, you may have noticed that <code>UserComponent.razor</code> doesn’t exist, so create that now in the <code>Shared</code> folder. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>This component makes use of the <code>CascadingAuthenticationState</code> from above and presents two different views. If the user is logged in, then you display a logout button. If the user is unauthorized, present them with a login button.</p>

<p>The two routes here, <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code> need to be implemented next. Under Pages, add a new <code>RazorPage</code> called <code>Login</code>. Razor pages are created with two components, a <code>cshtml</code> file and a <code>.cs</code> file. Since your login page is hosted by Okta you do not need any presentation in the <code>.cshtml</code> file. However, you still need to tell the page which model file to use. Open <code>Login.cshtml</code> and add the following code.</p>

 <code>@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LoginModel


@{
   
}
</code> 

<p>Next, open <code>Login.cshtml.cs</code> and add the login logic.</p>

   <code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LoginModel : PageModel
    {
        public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
        {
            await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
            {
                RedirectUri = redirectUri
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This code should look familiar if you’ve used Okta with any ASP.NET application. You’re simply returning the <code>Challenge</code> provided by Okta. This will redirect the user to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>After you authenticate, you’ll either be asked for your phone number or prompted to send a code to your phone. This depends on whether you’ve set up your phone in Okta yet. If you haven’t, add your phone number to your account and verify the code; otherwise, click Send Code and then verify the code on this page. And just like that, your application is now secure with MFA using Okta! You can select several MFA methods found on <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa/mfa-home.htm">Okta’s site</a>, ranging from email and phone codes to physical authenticators.</p>

<p>Now you can add the <code>Logout</code> page the same way you added the <code>Login</code> page. Again, since there is no presentation here your <code>.cshtml</code> file will declare the model page without any HTML.</p>

 <code>@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LogoutModel
@{
}
</code> 

<p>Your <code>Logout.cshtml.cs</code> file will contain the stock ASP.Net Core logout logic.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LogoutModel : PageModel
    {
        public SignOutResult OnGet()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                new[]
                {
                     OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                     CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                },
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, the <code>Counter</code> and <code>FetchData</code> pages will require user authentication.</p>

<p>Open <code>Counter.razor</code> and add the <code>@attribute [Authorize]</code> annotation.</p>

 <code>@page "/counter"

@attribute [Authorize]

&lt;h1&gt;Counter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current count: @currentCount&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
</code> 

<p>This code is almost identical to the boilerplate code except for the <code>Authorize</code> attribute at the top of the page. Like ASP.Net Core, this attribute will require the user to be logged in before accessing it.</p>

<p>Similarly, edit the <code>FetchData.razor</code> file with the following code.</p>

 <code>@page "/fetchdata"

@using Okta_ServerDemo.Data
@inject WeatherForecastService ForecastService

@attribute [Authorize]

&lt;h1&gt;Weather forecast&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.&lt;/p&gt;

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Temp. (C)&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Temp. (F)&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.TemperatureC&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.TemperatureF&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.Summary&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await ForecastService.GetForecastAsync(DateTime.Now);
    }
}
</code> 

<p>Again the only change here is the addition of the <code>Authorize</code> attribute.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>Now start the application and navigate to the <code>Counter</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will see the message found on your <code>App.razor</code> page. Click on the Login button and walk through the authentication and MFA process. Once you’re logged in, you should be presented with the `** page.</p>

 Building the infrastructure and delivering the tools for&nbsp;Web3  Introduction <p>2021 draws to a close with Web3 firmly establishing itself in the consciousness of the crypto community. Perhaps more importantly, we have started to see signs that it is transcending into the minds of those outside of the cryptosphere. Web3, in its association with the Metaverse, looks set to capture the imaginations of people worldwide in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.</p><p>Our goal for 2022 is to make the Ontology high-speed, low-cost, public blockchain, the blockchain of choice for Web3 applications. Ontology’s efforts in creating interoperability between the different public chains, including the upcoming Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch, will provide the opportunity to incubate more high-quality Web3 applications in the new year across a multitude of industries and services.</p><p>Beyond providing a blockchain to build Web3 applications, delivering ease of access and a seamless experience is essential to the user experience. That is why ONTO Wallet aims to become the access point of choice in 2022, providing the easiest access to Web3 for every user by allowing them to own their identity and data. This approach of empowering developers and users alike, to build and experience together, underlines Ontology’s goals for&nbsp;2022.</p> Decentralized Identity and&nbsp;Data <p>Web3 should allow you to have self-sovereign identity and data, and it should allow you to choose which parts of your online existence, or perhaps we should say your existence in the Metaverse, you’d like to share with each other. This requires technical interconnectivity and interoperability, as well as more philosophical and collaborative discussions across the entire community for how identity is defined and&nbsp;changed.</p><p>In the end, there will not be a single blockchain, but rather a collection of different chains, each with their own characteristics, benefits, and subcultures. Whilst there will be competition, there is also tremendous opportunity for collaboration for the benefit of the overall ecosystem and user experience.</p><p>Ontology will continue to optimize deeper product integrations across different blockchains. With a focus on DID and data, users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence.</p><p>The launch of the new <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> website brings us 1 step closer. ONT ID, ONT Login, and ONT TAG empower both developers and users by providing cost-effective and private methods to authenticate and manage their identities.</p> Multi-VM <p>Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. By taking a Multi-VM approach, Ontology maximizes interoperability and allows more developers to create in the development languages they are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and represents the culmination of all the hard work by the team that began at the start of 2021 when Ontology’s tech team first began developing the Ontology EVM. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and&nbsp;WasmVM.</p><p>This is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain. As the most common virtual machine used on the traditional Internet, the support of Wasm also prepared Ontology for big-scale Web2 applications to transition to Web3 in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>From a dApp development perspective, the Multi-VM approach taken by Ontology allows dApps to be integrated into multiple platforms. This boosts long-term growth for cross-chain dApps, exposing them to a larger user base and to receive all the benefits offered by the various alternative chains.</p> Web3 <p>This Multi-VM approach, combined with a focus on DID and data, brings us back to the importance of Web3. Since the very beginning, Ontology has been building the infrastructure necessary for a cross-chain, interoperable Web3.</p><p>Ontology will continue to vigorously develop the following products, already familiar to the community:</p><p><a href="http://ont.id/">ONT ID</a> will be optimized to be more applicable to all blockchains, including products like ONT TAG, ONT Login, and OScore. Over 1.5 million users now manage their digital identity using ONT ID, with control over how, when, and with whom their data is shared. Furthermore, we continue to work on the design of more DID products for developers to further expand DID applications.</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, as the essential gateway for every individual to Web3, aims to provide crucial infrastructure for a seamless Web3 experience. Over the past year, we have seen tremendous growth in ONTO users (over 750K), and its social influence, with 30 times increase in social media channels and communities.</p><p>With ONTO, users can create their decentralized identities and verify credentials, powered by Ontology’s decentralized identity framework. The ONT ID digital identity wallet allows users to use a single private key to log into their multi-chain wallets. They can also manage their digital assets, including NFTs, perform cross-chain swaps, keep up-to-date with the latest industry developments and events via the ONTO news feed, and enjoy access to a full range of dApps anywhere and anytime, available as both mobile and web applications. Moving forward, ONTO will continue to expand its multiple chains assets and dApps support, making Web3 easily accessible in the palm of your&nbsp;hand.</p><p>The decentralized digital asset and distribution tool, <a href="https://anydrop.ont.io/">ONTO Anydrop</a>, also provides faster, cheaper, and more convenient event support for our partners, and will continue to benefit the expansion of our ecosystem.</p><p><a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a> will continue to utilize Ontology’s decentralized reputation solution for DeFi projects. Its unique and pioneering Inclusive Pool, coupled with Ontology’s OScore, allows people to under-collateralize assets and maximize their borrowing capabilities based on Web3-native credit and reputation scores.</p><p>Ontology will continue to work with Wing to develop further product lines, which will enable more types of assets to be lent, borrowed, and collateralized. There will also be continued expansion of accessibility, allowing more users to enter the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p><a href="http://protocol.sagamarket.io">SAGA</a> provides data management in the Web3 era. Offering a decentralized alternative, where the data providers remain in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Thanks to these platforms and more, whether it is DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, or one of the countless other innovative decentralized applications, Ontology is well placed to support their development and expansion. Ontology will keep developing more easy-to-use products and tools to meet the requirements of the era, making Web3 available to everyone, whilst maintaining the security and privacy of users, and bringing a decentralized experience to the&nbsp;world.</p> Looking Ahead <p>2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p><p>The upcoming launch of the Ontology EVM will bring the benefits of Ontology to a new, larger audience. More applications will be built on the Ontology network, expanding the opportunities for developers and users alike. The relevance and application of the Ontology approach extend to the entirety of Web3, regardless of the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>No doubt 2022 will bring new tech advancements, alongside ecosystem growth. We’re excited to journey into the decentralized future with you and appreciate all the support shown by our community throughout the year. Our Harbingers have continued to work passionately, to provide the best community experience possible. We are always looking to recruit more Harbingers into the Ontology family, and hope to welcome more new faces in the new&nbsp;year.</p><p>Ontology is proud to be part of this rapidly changing landscape and is excited to share more updates in the future. Here’s to another year exploring the future together.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>More than 7 billion people walk the face of the earth, and more than half (4.66 billion, to be specific) of us have access to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People love the internet because it makes everything easier. We buy and sell, we communicate with people from anywhere, and for most of us, our source of livelihood is heavily connected to the connected world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But (and there’s always a but), nothing’s perfect, not even the revolutionary “interconnected network.” The internet’s problems are underneath one overarching concern —security and fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does this all have to do with online marketplaces? Easy—they are big and just getting bigger. Thus, they are like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, especially for fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 So why are online marketplaces a big deal?&nbsp; 



<p>Online marketplaces can be described as “advanced department stores”.&nbsp; They are digital points (websites or apps) that facilitate shopping for several buyers and sellers, with Amazon being the best example. Not actually owning any inventory, its essence is to create a platform for numerous sellers to display their merchandise to attract and make transactions with all the buyers who use that platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basically, online marketplaces are the new way to shop. Everything from housing, consumer goods, automobiles, and digital services are accessible through online marketplaces. Plus, they are super convenient, especially from a buyer’s perspective, and that’s why they’ve been so successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom alone, Amazon, eBay, and Etsy get around <a href="https://www.webretailer.com/b/online-marketplaces-uk/">700 million visits</a> per month to their websites. Furthermore, several of the world’s fastest-growing online marketplaces are from Europe, which are included in our detailed eBook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prevalence of online marketplaces in Europe is the secret behind the geometrically progressive growth of e-commerce in Europe. Europe’s e-commerce sector is expected to be worth <a href="https://www.arcade.global/blog/online-marketplaces-europe-2021/">$575 billion by 2025</a>, and you can bet your bottom dollar (or your choice currency) that online marketplaces will be at the centre of that boom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s what makes them a big deal.&nbsp;</p>



 Online Marketplace Fraud: The Spoilsport&nbsp; 



<p>Online marketplaces are a treasure trove for fraudulent activities, and there are very few issues that keep the marketplace operator awake at night, like online marketplace fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, the United Kingdom lost around 400 million pounds to e-commerce fraud. And more than half of these instances of fraud took place on online marketplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s not just the United Kingdom that’s getting torn apart by fraudsters, as countries like Poland, Hungary, and Malta having a higher fraud rate than the UK. Rather, it’s the whole of Europe. But that should come as no surprise since Europe dominates around <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/online_fraud_2017.pdf">40% of global B2C e-commerce</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Two things which make online marketplace fraud very dangerous:&nbsp; 



<p>The first is obvious. The simple fact that marketplace operators, buyers and suppliers suffer enormous financial loss makes incidences of fraud undesirable. No one likes to lose money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is less obvious to everyone else except marketplace operators. Marketplace fraud is the easiest way to create a horrible user experience, lose customers and ultimately go out of business. A pest infestation of a field of corn offers a near-perfect analogy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless the right fraudulent strategies are implemented, a single fraudulent event is always a harbinger of more fraudulent events.&nbsp;</p>



 What makes online marketplaces attracted to fraudsters?&nbsp; 



<p>In one word:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more successful your marketplace becomes, the more attractive it looks to fraudsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most online marketplaces don’t just connect buyers with sellers; they also facilitate transactions. Online marketplace operators receive, pay and hold money for their platform users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ability to receive, pay and hold money is like a clarion call to unwanted third parties. They want to get in on the act and divert money for themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Granted, the desire to divert may not be enough until you add that these parties to the transaction are strangers to each other. They are transacting on faith and trust that both the operator and the person on the other side is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine sufficient liquidity with invisibility, and you’ll quickly discover that someone somewhere ends up with something that isn’t theirs. No one knows this better than fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Examples of online marketplace fraud&nbsp; 



  Fake money, real goods:&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Online Marketplace purchasers posing as fraudsters will acquire real goods and services without paying for them.&nbsp;</p>



  Real money, fake goods and services:&nbsp;  



<p>This is also known as marketplace supplier fraud. What typically happens here is that a supplier takes a confirmed order for goods or services and does not actually provide anything in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Where do fraudsters make their first move?&nbsp; 



<p>The typical gateway for fraudsters is at the initial entry point into the online marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonymity is a necessary tool for fraudsters, and the best time to create that anonymity is during customer onboarding. Fraudsters typically choose false profiles rather than create accounts with real identities behind them. These fraudulent profiles appear legitimate to the unsuspecting eye, so business carries on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you look closely, you may discover a few things. For example, a purchaser account might contain the exact same details as a supplier account, with the profile name being the only difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is precisely why the best fraud prevention strategy is to leverage a system that validly identifies new customers. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to disable systems in the marketplace software that allow people to sign up without connecting their true identities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, marketplace operators don’t have to start from scratch with identity verification because most citizens already have a recognised identity document. All that is left is to choose a service that can verify a person’s ID document and biometrics to check whether a person behind the transaction is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>

   by Alexei Balaganski  Yesterday, Google has announced that it has acquired Siemplify, a well-known provider of security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) solutions, for an undisclosed amount.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Yesterday, Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations">announced</a> that it has acquired <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/blog/siemplify-is-joining-forces-with-google/">Siemplify</a>, a well-known provider of security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) solutions, for an undisclosed amount. The stated strategic goal of this acquisition is to “change the rules on how organizations hunt, detect, and respond to threats”. The SOAR capabilities of the Siemplify platform will be integrated into Google’s own Chronicle security analytics platform to provide even better visibility and productivity for security analysts.</p>
<p>Now, at the first glance, one could simply ask: “What’s the big deal? Acquisitions happen all the time, especially in the cybersecurity market nowadays”. However, there are a few interesting observations to be made here that go beyond this particular purchase.</p>
<p>First of all, Google has never been seen by the public as a “security vendor”. Despite operating one of the world’s largest clouds and playing a role of an identity provider for (literally) billions of users worldwide, we usually don’t hear much about cybersecurity from Google (although to be fair, we don’t hear much about Google’s security problems, as opposed to some of its largest competitors). However, the appearances can be deceiving – just last summer the company has pledged to invest $10 billion in cybersecurity over the next five years, and an acquisition of a SOAR technology is just a small part of this strategy.</p>
 What is SOAR anyway? 
<p>Emerging less a decade ago, SOAR was hailed as a means to finally make traditional SIEMs useful and, more generally, to centralize the management and automation of multiple security tools in a single interface for security analysts. The biggest selling point of having a separate SOAR tool is its ability to integrate with a variety of existing SIEM, XDR, or other platforms that typically power a modern security operations center.</p>
<p>SOAR solutions usually provide several key capabilities:</p>
 
 Security data collection and enrichment – either on their own or through a bidirectional integration with existing SIEM platforms; 
 Security orchestration and automation – by implementing playbooks and automated workflows across disparate security tools and to let analysts concentrate on more creative tasks; 
 Incident Response – by coordinating mitigation activities across multiple teams, departments, and systems. Here the degree of automation might vary from opening support tickets to autonomous isolation and cleanup of malicious activities. 
 
<p>Siemplify was notably one of the few remaining independent SOAR vendors. This is not the first and certainly won't be the last acquisition in this space. A few SOAR specialist vendors we covered in the 2020 edition of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar">Leadership Compass on SOAR solutions</a>&nbsp;have been acquired in the meantime as well. Stay tuned for further updates: KuppingerCole is in the process&nbsp;of updating the SOAR Leadership Compass for 2022.</p>
<p>The trend is however completely logical and predictable from the start – since the primary strategic goal for every digital business is to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80476/security-fabric-a-methodology-for-architecting-a-secure-future">reduce the overall complexity</a> of their security architectures, having yet another standalone tool is not the best idea. Rather, most customers would prefer seeing SOAR capabilities integrated directly into their favorite SOC platforms. For security vendors, such technology acquisitions have always been absolute no-brainers, but nowadays, even companies that, like Google or Microsoft, were never calling themselves security vendors, see such investments as extremely important.</p>
 Security as a brand reputation factor 
<p>In the era of large-scale data breaches and constant cyber-attacks, being perceived as a “secure vendor” is crucial for every cloud service provider, and every major one now has a broad portfolio of services to assure their customers that their sensitive data and critical workloads remain safe at any time. However, while some vendors (like AWS or Oracle) are primarily focusing on protecting their own customers with their “cloud-native” (in other words, proprietary) solutions, others (like IBM and now Google) see multi-cloud support and open ecosystems as a potential competitive advantage.</p>
<p><a href="https://chronicle.security/">Google Chronicle</a> is an interesting example of the latter strategy. Created with a vision of a security analytics platform with unlimited scalability and intelligent automation, Chronicle harnesses Google Cloud’s infrastructure to offer a platform for managing security data at a petabyte scale. Although it is not positioned as a SIEM, it does offer all the features typically found in one: ingesting, retaining, and analyzing massive amounts of network and security telemetry from a variety of sources, including an ecosystem of third-party partners.</p>
<p>On top of this, Chronicle offers a range of tools for incident investigation, threat hunting, and attack detection. Adding SOAR capabilities from Siemplify will make Chronicle a very capable, scalable, and open security analytics service you’ve probably never heard about. Which is a shame, actually. Perhaps one thing Google still has to learn from its competitors is to invest more into spreading awareness about their newest developments in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Speaking of awareness – we’re planning to publish a new Leadership Compass report on the market segment of Intelligent SIEM Platforms soon. We’re covering over 20 solutions in this report, both big and small, including Google Cloud among the vendors to watch. Stay tuned!</p>

   Privileged access management is a top cybersecurity priority for enterprises. According to Gartner, "nearly every successful security breach involves a failure of privileged access management (PAM)."

<p>Today, I’m going to put this statement to the test! First, I’ll show you how to run a secure, OAuth 2.0-protected, Java REST API that allows JWT authentication. Then, I’ll show you how to build a native image with GraalVM. Finally, I’ll compare Helidon to the most popular Java REST API frameworks: Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
<p>My <a>Build Native Java Apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> post compares startup times and memory usage of these three frameworks. How does Helidon perform? Read on!</p>

 Get started with Helidon 
 
 
<p>I created a GitHub repository you can clone and run to get started with Helidon quickly.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples.git
cd native-java-examples/helidon</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In a section below, I’ll show you how I created this example. First, let’s see how to run it.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the <code>helidon</code> directory in your favorite IDE, so you have easy access to the example’s project files.</p>
 
 






If you just want to see how to build a native image, skip to the <a>build a native Helidon app</a> section.



 
 
 
 
 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run a Helidon Java API 
 
 
<p>In a terminal window, run <code>mvn package</code> to package the app into a JAR. Then use <code>java -jar</code> to run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package
java -jar target/helidon.jar</code> 
 
 
 






Helidon’s Maven Plugin doesn’t have a run command. You can install the <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/about/05_cli">Helidon CLI</a> and run <code>helidon dev</code>. Running this command allows you to change code and automatically recompile and restart your application.



 
 
<p>If you open another terminal window and try to access it with HTTPie, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ http :8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 0
Date: Tue, 4 Jan 2022 10:17:11 -0700
connection: keep-alive</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make it so you can access this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token and update the JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) URL to yours (in this project’s <code>application.yml</code>).</p>
 
 






If you’re unsure what OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are, see <a>What the Heck is OAuth?</a>.



 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Take note of the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> values. You’ll need those to get an access token and to configure each framework for JWT authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code> and change the Okta URL to match yours.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Stop your Helidon app with Ctrl+C, repackage it, and re-run it with ⬆️+Return.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package
java -jar target/helidon.jar</code> 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token 
 
<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click Send Request to continue.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have an access token, set it as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJZMVRxUkRQbEFEcm1XN0dX...</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Test your Helidon API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email address in it.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Helidon app 
 
 
<p>To compile this Helidon app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package -Pnative-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will take a few minutes to complete. My 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM took 2 min. 14 s. to finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/helidon</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/helidon

 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Helidon app from scratch 
 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "how did you build a secure Helidon app"? Did I just hide the complexity? No. It only takes five steps to create the same app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Install <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/about/05_cli">Helidon’s CLI</a> and run <code>helidon init</code> or use Maven:</p>
 
 
 mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
 -DarchetypeVersion=2.4.1 \
 -DgroupId=com.okta.rest \
 -DartifactId=helidon \
 -Dpackage=com.okta.rest 
 
 
 
<p>If you use <code>helidon init</code>, answer the questions like I did.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloResource</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest/controller/HelloResource.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.helidon.security.Principal;
import io.helidon.security.SecurityContext;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import java.util.Optional;

import static javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Optional&lt;Principal&gt; userPrincipal = context.userPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.get().getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloApplication</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest</code> to register your resource and configure JWT authentication:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import com.okta.rest.controller.HelloResource;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.auth.LoginConfig;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.Set;

@LoginConfig(authMethod = "MP-JWT")
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {
        return Set.of(HelloResource.class);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Delete <code>GreetingsProvider</code>, <code>GreetResource</code>, and <code>MainTest</code> since they’re not used in this example.</p>
 
 
 rm src/main/java/com/okta/rest/Greet*
rm src/test/java/com/okta/rest/MainTest.java 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now you can start the app or build the native image as shown above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Native Java startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>To compare startup times between Micronaut, Quarkus, Spring Boot, and Helidon, I first created native executables. You can run the following commands to do the same from the root directory of the example you cloned.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd micronaut
./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image

cd ../quarkus
./mvnw package -Pnative

cd ../spring-boot
./mvnw package -Pnative

# Helidon should already be built, but just in case it isn't
cd ../helidon
mvn package -Pnative-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I ran each image three times before I started recording the numbers. I then ran each command five times.</p>
 
 
<p>These numbers are from a 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. I think it’s important to note that my WiFi connection was 9.88 Mbps down and 0.37 Mbps up (according to the Speedtest app).</p>
 

Table 1. Native Java startup times in milliseconds







Framework
Command executed
Milliseconds to start




<p>Helidon</p>
<p><code>./helidon/target/helidon</code></p>
<p>53.6</p>


<p>Micronaut</p>
<p><code>./micronaut/target/app</code></p>
<p>31.2</p>


<p>Quarkus</p>
<p><code>./quarkus/target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code></p>
<p>19</p>


<p>Spring Boot</p>
<p><code>./spring-boot/target/demo</code></p>
<p>59.2</p>



 
<p>The chart below should help you visualize this comparison.</p>
 

 

 
<p>I also tested the memory usage in MB of each app using the command below. I made sure to send an HTTP request to each one before measuring.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I substituted <code>&lt;executable&gt;</code> as follows:</p>

<p>This data shows that Helidon has some work to do to catch up to its competition!</p>
 
 
<p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/bercut2000">Dmitry Alexandrov</a> about these numbers and he’s what he had to say:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The numbers may look higher than expected, but, in Helidon MP you’ve got a fully functional CDI container and full MicroProfile support, unlike other competitors. If you still require ultimate performance, you should try Helidon SE, which is a fully reactive "magic free" flavour of Helidon, designed for environments working under maximal pressure.</p>

But while the US government clearly recognizes the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">national security risks</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, it is yet to settle on a regulatory solution. We hope 2022 brings more progress.</p>



<p>So in the meantime, we encourage businesses to be proactive about how they protect their customers’ information. Joining in some of the Data Privacy Week 2022 activities and the wider&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/cybersecurity-awareness-month/">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>&nbsp;activities,&nbsp;which the National Cybersecurity Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched in October 2004, is a great place to start—as is talking to us about&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;would help your business.</p>

<p>While digital experiences are rapidly becoming the norm for mortgage lending, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. Fortunately, this is changing.</p>
<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, is the only authorized report supplier that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income, and employment authorized for representation and warranty relief through both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. By automating the asset and income verification process, providing transaction data for rent payment history and providing a 10-day pre-closing report, we can help you streamline the approval process and in turn even be a more inclusive lender.&nbsp;</p>
 Approved by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae&nbsp; 
<p>Finicity is an authorized supplier for <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor® AIM</a>, which automates borrower assets, income, and employment assessment for lenders. By leveraging the expertise of third-party service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service also accepts our <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-validation-service/du-validation-service-verification-report-vendors">mortgage verification services</a> to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing<a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty"> Day 1 Certainty®</a> on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>
 Rent payment history in credit decisioning 
<p>On September 18, Fannie Mae introduced the inclusion of rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in DU. Fannie Mae identifies recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/helping-renters-unlock-door-homeownership">inclusive credit assessment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For first-time homebuyers who may have a limited credit history but a strong rent payment history, the enhancement creates new opportunities for homeownership while still promoting safe lending. Fannie Mae <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners">said 17% of applicants</a> who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Finicity provides a <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/finicity-lend-reports/#finicity-lend-report-list-7">Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) report</a> through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes up to 24 months of transaction data that Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history and provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>The VOAI report can be called with a direct API or is available currently in <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect,</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to VOAI, we’re pleased to announce that we now offer Verification of Asset (VOA) as a standalone product. Lenders can utilize Finicity’s VOA report to provide 12 months of data and participate in Fannie Mae’s rent history assessment. Lenders have the freedom to access two and 12 months of data to satisfy their own underwriting requirements, while VOA automatically sends 12 months to Fannie Mae, keeping the file GSE-compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VOA report is available via direct API connection or on most ecosystem platforms.</p>
 10-day pre-closing verification 
<p>Additionally, Finicity’s 10-day pre-closing reports provide just the right data GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment.</p>
<p>In adding a 10-day pre-closing report to our mortgage verification services, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. You can use these<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> 10-day pre-closing reports</a> to view just your borrower’s employment status rather than refreshing our current full reports that contain financial data. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes.</p>
<p>One of the reports available is the VOE Transactions report, which contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description but no amounts or totals so that income is not re-assessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams so that it can be determined that the borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>Our 10-day pre-closing reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently only available for lenders connecting directly to Finicity.</p>
<p>These new reports could help you improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, which is simplifying the loan origination process even further without increasing risk. Because these products are part of Finicity MVS, you would no longer have to call your borrower’s employers to get the information or manually ask for any extra interaction from the borrower.</p>
 How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports? 
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints. You can find<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> documentation here</a>. As we integrate them further into LOS and POS platforms, they will be even easier for consumer loan officers to access.&nbsp;To see Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services in action,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> request a demo here</a>.</p>

  <p>Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture, as they allow you to split application development into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces. However, microservices introduce complexity when it comes to implementing authentication. Generally, you only need to worry about one point of ingress for auth with a traditional monolithic application. Still, there are multiple ways to set things up with microservices and just as many authentication patterns to suit.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll see how to build a small demo application consisting of four microservices and a simple API gateway. I’ll share some handy patterns for securing access to the microservices. Here is a rough diagram of the intended architecture and a sequence diagram showing the flow of communication between components.</p>

<p>Rough architecture:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sequence diagram:</p>

<p></p>

 Implementation 

<p>Before you get started, there are some dependencies you will need to install in order to follow along. First, you’ll need <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>, as this tutorial relies heavily on containers to run the microservices. If you do not already have Docker installed on your machine, please follow <a>Docker’s setup instructions</a> for your OS of choice.</p>

<p>This tutorial also heavily utilizes Okta for the various authentication patterns you will implement. As such, you will need to create an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Developer account</a>. For now, create a free account. The tutorial will cover any operations you need to perform as they come up later.</p>

<p>Finally, for testing the APIs and authentication methods, make sure you have the latest version of <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> installed. Postman dramatically simplifies the process of getting OAuth tokens and calling the APIs.</p>

<p>As this tutorial primarily focuses on the authentication patterns themselves, the actual microservices are not overly significant as long as you have an API to call. You can create some <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> projects to get a few microservices up and running. Though Laravel is a bit on the heavy side for such simple use cases, it is quick and easy to set up, comes with most of the libraries you will need out-of-the-box, and has a sound middleware system that you can use to implement these auth patterns. To create the Laravel projects, the official documentation suggests using the <code>laravel.build</code> site, which serves as a Bash script for you to run. It is a good idea to read the script yourself before piping it into Bash, so be sure to <a href="https://laravel.build/api-gateway?with=redis">review the script</a> before executing it if you are uncertain. It works by taking the <code>path</code> parameter and using that as the project name.</p>

 Getting started with microservices 

<p>To begin, create a directory to hold all of the microservices for this tutorial named something like <code>php-microservices-demo</code>. <code>cd</code> into this directory, and execute the following command: <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/api-gateway?with=redis" | bash</code>. This will create a directory containing a Laravel project named <code>api-gateway</code>. Once this step is done, you will need to run it four more times like so; once for each of the microservices you will create:</p>

   <code># service a
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-a?with=redis" | bash

# service b
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-b?with=redis" | bash

# service c
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-c?with=redis" | bash

# service d
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-d?with=redis" | bash
</code>   

<p>Now our directory should contain five projects in total. These projects are intended to run with <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail">Laravel Sail</a>, but it isn’t optimal for running five of them simultaneously. Use Sail to install dependencies and execute <code>artisan</code> commands, but for running the APIs, create a new <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in the tutorial directory. This file will allow you to start all the containers together. Luckily, because the APIs will be simple, you don’t even need databases for this, only the PHP containers. In your newly created <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, add the following content:</p>

</code>   

<p>This file specifies the network that the containers will share as <code>php_microservices_demo</code>, which you will need to create. Do this now by running <code>docker network create php_microservices_demo</code> in your terminal. Next, expose your current User and Group IDs as environment variables for Bash, so Bash can map the correct permissions when it builds the images. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:</p>

   <code>export UID=${UID:-$(id -u)} 
export GID=${GID:-$(id -g)}
</code>   

<p>The above command may return a warning about read-only variables depending on your OS. You can safely ignore this if it happens.</p>

<p>Now, if you run <code>docker-compose up -d</code> from the tutorial root directory, after a moment, you should be able to access the <code>api-gateway</code> Laravel project at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Before you implement authentication, you’ll need to make some simple mock APIs so that you have something to test. To do this, you can define a single route for each of the four <code>microservice</code> applications—something like <code>api/service/</code>—and have this route return a string indicating which microservice it is. Then, the API gateway can define multiple routes that will forward requests appropriately to the microservices. Because the API gateway is the only container with port mapping in the <code>docker-compose</code> file, this will be the only way for you to access the internal microservices. To do this, add the following routes for each corresponding Laravel instance’s <code>routes/api.php</code> file:</p>

 API Gateway: 

   <code>Route::get('/service1', function(Request $request) {
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::get('http://microservice-a/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});

Route::get('/service2', function(Request $request) {
   $bearer = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($bearer)-&gt;get('http://microservice-b/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});

Route::get('/service3', function(Request $request) {
   $bearer = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($bearer)-&gt;get('http://microservice-c/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});
</code>   

 Microservice A: 

   <code>​​Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::get('http://microservice-d/api/service');
});
</code>   

 Microservice B: 

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice b');
});
</code>   

 Microservice C: 

   <code>​​Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice c');
});
</code>   

 Microservice D: 

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice d');
});
</code>   

<p>Now, if you navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service1</code> in your browser or Postman, you should see the response from one of your microservices via the API gateway. With this out of the way, you can implement your first authentication pattern.</p>

 JWT verification at the gateway 

<p>The first pattern is a simple JWT verification at the API gateway. All API requests going through the gateway will require a valid JWT access token. To do this, you can use Laravel middleware. A middleware refers to code you can configure to run when a request is received but before the Controller or function that the route definition specifies can handle it. In practice, this means that you can have a middleware component that checks for valid access tokens and returns an unauthorized response if no valid token is found.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, you can use Laravel Sail to execute <code>php artisan</code> commands inside your containers. To do this, navigate to the directory containing the codebase you want to run the command on—<code>api-gateway</code>, in this case—and run <code>./vendor/bin/sail up</code>. You’ll create some more containers running on your system. While they don’t matter much for the actual API, the containers provide a convenient way of executing PHP commands without custom tooling. At this point, you should also create an alias for Sail: <code>alias sail=./vendor/bin/sail</code>. The rest of the Sail commands in this tutorial will assume you have an alias like this configured for brevity.</p>

<p>After running <code>sail up</code> in another terminal, navigate back to the same <code>api-gateway</code> directory and run <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt</code>. This action will create the middleware used by the gateway to check the access tokens for incoming requests. While you are here, you will also need to install two composer dependencies to verify the JWTs. To do this, run the following command: <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt</code>. Before fleshing out your newly created middleware, you will need to make a quick detour to the Okta Developer Portal to create an application so that your middleware has the details it needs to verify incoming JWTs.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">https://developer.okta.com</a> and either sign in or set up a new account. Next, navigate to applications on the sidebar and click Create App Integration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select a new OIDC integration with a “single-page application” application type and then click Next. Fill out the details of your new app integration by choosing a name to help you identify it, setting the “Grant type” to “Authorization code” and the “Controlled access” to “Allow everyone in your organization to access.”</p>

<p>Note: We’re keeping things simple for now by using a single client ID throughout this whole tutorial. In practice, you’d probably want to use separate client IDs for your front-end application and each of your microservices so that you have better audit logs and can better control access.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once these steps are complete, you’ll receive a page showing your client ID and Okta domain. Make a note of both of these for later.</p>

<p>Next, navigate to the middleware you created—<code>api-gateway/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php</code>—and set its content as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

      try {
       	$jwt = $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Then go to the<code>.env</code> file for the gateway, and add the following values:</p>

   <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>Next, navigate to <code>api-gateway/app/Http/Kernel.php</code> and find the <code>$middlewareGroups</code> array. There should be a key of <code>'api'</code> with a corresponding array. In this array, add <code>\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class</code> as a new item. This action will cause the middleware to run for any routes in the API group, including the ones you created earlier, to allow users to access the microservices. You can verify this by using Postman or your browser to access the same route from earlier—http://localhost:8080/api/service1 —except you should now be met with an unauthorized error, as you do not have a JWT yet.</p>

<p>To get a JWT, open Postman and create a new GET request. Open the Authorization tab, change the type to “OAuth 2.0,” and set Add authorization data to Request Header. Next, scroll down to the “Configure New Token” section and give it a name like “PHP microservices.” This name doesn’t affect anything besides how Postman displays it. Set the rest of the values as follows:</p>

 
   Grant Type: Authorization Code (With PKCE) 
   Callback URL: http://localhost:8080/login/callback 
   Auth URL: https://{{your okta domain}}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize 
   Access Token URL: https://{{your okta domain}}/oauth2/default/v1/token 
   Client ID: {{Your client ID}} 
   Scope: openid email 
   State: 1234 
   Client Authentication: Send client credentials in body 
 

<p>With these details set, when you click Get New Access Token, you should be presented with an Okta login window. Log in with your Okta Developer account details, and when the process completes, you should see your new token. Click Use Token to set it for this request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have not already done so, finish creating the request by setting the URL as http://localhost:8080/api/service1, and click Send. After a short delay, you should get a response from the API gateway forwarded from one of your microservices. Bravo! You’ve implemented the first auth pattern successfully. With this pattern, the gateway verifies the JWT, and Microservice A does no further verification. It assumes that the gateway has already handled verification. This approach is only viable when the underlying microservice is not publicly accessible via the internet. It works well enough when the microservice must be accessed via a gateway, as is the case here.</p>

 JWT Scope Validation 

<p>The next pattern to implement will be for Microservice B. Microservice B will perform its own local JWT token validation and look for a particular scope on the token. If this scope is not present, it will reject the token, even if the gateway has already accepted it.</p>

<p>Your first step is to add a custom scope for Microservice B to seek. On the Okta portal, navigate to Security &gt; API on the sidebar, and select the default auth server from the list. Go to the Scopes tab and click Add Scope. Give it a name like <code>microservice-demo-scope</code> and fill out the rest of the details like so:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next step, you’ll add the Microservice B middleware. If <code>sail up</code> is still running for the gateway, terminate this command (Control + C on macOS) and change the directory to Microservice B. Run <code>sail up</code> again. In another terminal, navigate to Microservice B’s directory.  Now run the following:</p>

   <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt
sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwtWithScope
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve run these commands, open the new middleware located at <code>microservice-b/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwtWithScope.php</code> and set the contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\UnauthorizedHttpException;

class VerifyJwtWithScope
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

   	// Microservice B verifies the token itself, and looks for a specific scope
      try {
       	$jwt = $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());

       	$scopes = Arr::get($jwt-&gt;claims, 'scp', []);
       	$requiredScope = 'microservice-demo-scope';

       	if (!in_array($requiredScope, $scopes)) {
           throw new UnauthorizedHttpException('missing required scope');
       	}

       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Note that after verifying the JWT, you can extract its claims. The <code>scp</code> claim will contain the scopes, which you can then check for the presence of your newly created scope.</p>

<p>Register this middleware in the <code>Kernel.php</code> file for Microservice B, just like you did with the API gateway, and add the following to Microservice B’s <code>.env</code> file:</p>

   <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>If you go to Postman and change your request’s URL to point to <code>/service2</code> instead of <code>/service1</code> when you fire the request, it should fail, as your token is missing the needed scope. Go back to the Auth tab in Postman and scroll down to where you specified your scopes. Add your new one so that it is now “openid email microservice-demo-scope” and request a new token. Once you select Use Token, your request to Microservice B should now succeed.</p>

 Remote token introspection 

<p>The third pattern to implement is for Microservice C. In this pattern, the microservice will again perform its own validation of the token. This time it will call the Okta <code>/introspect</code> endpoint to assert that the token has not been revoked. If this endpoint says the token is OK, the request will proceed; otherwise, it will be blocked.</p>

<p>Stop the running <code>sail up</code> job from the previous pattern, and change the directory to Microservice C before running <code>sail up</code> again. In your other terminal, run the following command from Microservice C: <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwtWithIntrospection</code>. Open the newly created middleware file and set its contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Validation\UnauthorizedException;

class VerifyJwtWithIntrospection
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $accessToken = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
      $accessTokenType = 'access_token';

      $oktaDomain = env('OKTA_DOMAIN');
      $oktaClientId = env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID');

      try {
       	// make api call to introspect endpoint
       	$introspectionResponse = Http::asForm()-&gt;post("$oktaDomain/oauth2/default/v1/introspect?client_id=$oktaClientId", [
           	'token' =&gt; $accessToken,
           	'token_type_hint' =&gt; $accessTokenType
       	]);

       	$isTokenActive = $introspectionResponse-&gt;json('active');

       	if (!$isTokenActive) {
           throw new UnauthorizedException('token is invalid');
       	}

      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
       	return new Response('Unauthorized - Token failed Introspection', 401);
      }

      return $next($request);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Register this middleware in Microservice C’s kernel and add the following to <code>.env</code> for this microservice:</p>

   <code>OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{your okta domain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>Now, when you call the gateway’s <code>/service3</code> endpoint, it will forward the request to Microservice C, which will subsequently perform an introspection to see if the token has been revoked. You can see this in action by taking your access token from Postman and revoking it with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/revokeatrt/">Okta’s revoke endpoint</a>. This will cause subsequent requests to <code>/service3</code> to fail when using that token. If you use this same token to call <code>/service1</code>, you will find that it still works, as this service only does local JWT validation and is not aware that the token has been revoked elsewhere.</p>

 Client Credentials Grant 

<p>The final pattern to implement is for Microservice D. Here, you will implement the Client Credentials flow. Microservice D will validate its own tokens, but the user-supplied token will not be adequate. Microservice D is not accessible directly via the gateway; instead, it is called by Microservice A. For this flow to work, Microservice A will need to request a token using the Client Credentials grant and use this token to make the request to Microservice D.</p>

<p>As before, stop any running <code>sail up</code> commands, navigate to Microservice D, and run <code>sail up</code>. In the other terminal, navigate to Microservice D and run these commands:</p>

   <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt
sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyClientCredentialsToken
</code>   

<p>Set the contents of the new middleware as follows, and then register it in the Microservice D kernel:</p>

   <code>​​&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyClientCredentialsToken
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
      * @param \Closure $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

      try {
       	$jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, head back to the Okta Developer portal, and go to Applications on the sidebar. Create another app integration and select API services as the sign-in method. Give it a name and click Save.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new integration will provide a new client ID and secret. Make a note of these. Next, go back to Security &gt; API, select the default auth server, and add another scope—this time calling it something like “machine-scope.” This will become the custom scope when Microservice A requests its token.</p>

<p>In the <code>.env</code> file of Microservice D, add the following:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your new client id from the API services integration}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>You should now find that Postman calls to <code>/service1</code> will fail, as Microservice A cannot authenticate with Microservice D yet. To solve this, you need to update the API route in Microservice A to use the Client Credentials grant to get a fresh token. Open <code>microservice-a/routes/api.php</code> and change the content as follows:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {

   // Microservice A needs to request a new token using the Client Credentials flow, and use that to authenticate with Microservice D.

   $customScope = 'machine-scope'; // This is the scope we created in Okta for our default auth server.

   // The details for our machine-to-machine application integration
   $clientId = env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID');
   $secret = env('OKTA_SECRET');

   $oktaDomain = env('OKTA_DOMAIN');

   $tokenResponse = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withBasicAuth($clientId, $secret)
   	-&gt;asForm()
   	-&gt;post("$oktaDomain/oauth2/default/v1/token", [
       	'grant_type' =&gt; 'client_credentials',
       	'scope' =&gt; $customScope
   	]);

   $token = $tokenResponse-&gt;json('access_token');

   return \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($token)-&gt;get('http://microservice-d/api/service');
});
</code>   

<p>Next, update the <code>.env</code> file for Microservice A to include these details:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your new client credentials client Id}
OKTA_SECRET={your new client credentials secret}
OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{your okta domain}
</code>   

<p>With these details in place, <code>/service1</code> should once again work, as it will get a token of its own and use it to communicate with Microservice D.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>If you have followed along in code, you should now have an API gateway with three endpoints, supported by four underlying microservices, with four unique authentication patterns. You’ve seen the basic local JWT validation used by the API gateway. This is the fastest method, but it is unable to catch revoked tokens. Next, there is Microservice B, which checks for a specific scope. This pattern is similar to the first method but gives more granular control around which users can perform specific actions based on the scopes attached to their tokens. Finally, you saw how to validate a token with remote introspection. This approach is more robust, as it is able to catch revoked tokens, but it has the drawback of requiring an additional HTTP call when compared to the local JWT validation.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has given you some idea of the different ways you can handle authentication with PHP microservices. All of these patterns are well supported by <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, along with many others. Okta offers a vast selection of authentication tools and services to make adding world-class authentication to your apps as easy as can be.</p>

<p>Financial services are going through a rapid digital evolution to keep up with the needs of digital-native consumers. The<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/125631/millennials-now-trust-fintechs-as-much-as-banks-mobile-app/#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20Americans%20who,2020%20to%2048%25%20in%202021."> percentage</a> of Americans who use fintech services daily rose from 37% in 2020 to 48% in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step in adopting a new fintech app is to set up a new account. Here is where you can lose those digital native consumers. Slow and time-consuming background checks, eligibility requirements, ACH microdeposits and inadequate credit scores are all major sources of friction and can cause abandonment of the account setup process. Integrating Finicity’s open banking data can reduce friction through secure account verification and eliminate frustrating delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Secure account opening is crucial for financial institutions today. Open banking data can reduce the friction and mitigate the risk associated with digital account opening,” said Andy Sheehan, President and COO, of Finicity, a Mastercard company. “FTA’s integration of Finicity’s open banking platform will further empower consumers to take charge of their financial data and financial futures.”</p>
 FTA Partners with Finicity to Add Secure Account Verification and Automated Personal Financial Management Capabilities to IaaS 
<p>The agreement with Finicity provides FTA’s customers access to consumer-permissioned account data for secure account validation and ownership when opening new accounts. This allows consumers to connect their primary account to deposit funds into a new investment account. It signals the end of tedious validation methods like micro-deposits, which can take days to clear, and can minimize risk by verifying the ownership of an existing account.</p>
<p>“Integrating consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking network streamlines account opening and funding, making it safer, easier and faster, which reduces account opening abandonment for our customers,” said David Park, Founder and CEO of FinTech Automation. “It’s a great example of how open banking can improve banking and personal financial management offerings and their customer experience at the same time.”</p>
<p>FTA will also utilize consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking platform to give consumers a holistic picture of their finances across all their financial and wealth accounts by allowing customers to download all transactions from their wealth account into their personal financial management tool.</p>
 Fintech Automation’s Unified Business Platform 
<p>The first era of fintech dealt with helping consumers more effectively visualize what is happening with their money across their different account types. In essence, building a better user experience and user interface on top of each of the specific accounts, providing a more user-friendly experience to customers.</p>
<p>While digital apps and interfaces may have changed how consumers experience financial services, the underlying systems facilitating those products and services have not advanced. To meet this growing market opportunity, FTA and its open-loop FinServ Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform offers financial institutions and other fintech companies a banking, payment and wealth management core system of records, bridging multiple financial verticals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The FTA platform can operate across several financial verticals while bearing the innate complexity, reducing the cost and difficulty of building and deploying financial applications. The platform will allow financial institutions and fintech companies to embed additional services into their existing offerings, providing a better customer experience and an opportunity to drive more profitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This enables FTA’s B2B customers to shift the burden of technology to FTA, focusing instead on relationships with customers and offering new types of services. A fast, easy, secure way to launch financial services such as banking, cards, wealth management and payments is critical to increasing customer engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;FTA’s platform offers a one-stop access point to various account types and services through a single point of entry. It also offers regulatory, compliance, and KYC/AML uniformly, while offering a suite of best-in-class providers through a single, secure integration with Finicity’s open banking platform.</p>
<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking platform, FTA is helping FamilyWealthTM, a startup personal financial management and digital advisory firm, to power its growing range of digital financial services that leverage artificial intelligence and automation algorithms to make better financial decisions for their users. FamilyWealth will analyze data to understand users’ spending habits, financial goals and risk tolerance, building a data profile that is used to enhance decision-making while maximizing financial performance. Finance features will include automatically moving funds to the highest-yielding accounts, automating portfolio allocation or paying bills. Key to FamilyWealth to automate finance are improvements in AI and data accessibility, such as financial data including debt, income, spending and investments.&nbsp;</p>

 GiD Report#193 — The 6 stories that matter in&nbsp;2022 <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-192-the-sec-v-ripple-a-year-later-8e2a65f35414">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Happy new&nbsp;year!</p><p>2021 was a year of milestones. We saw the explosion of NFTs and DeFi. Buzzwords like web3 and metaverse entered the mainstream lexicon — with Facebook even changing its name to Meta. Coinbase went public and we finally got a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin itself hit an all time high of $69,000 (nice) with one country — El Salvador — proclaiming it to be legal tender (albeit with plenty of snafus in its national rollout).</p><p>But 2021 is&nbsp;over.</p><p>These are the stories that matter in&nbsp;2022:</p>  It’s last call at the Fed’s easy money&nbsp;party  Chart of the week — S&amp;P 500&nbsp;edition  They aren’t just expensive jpegs&nbsp;anymore  Chart of the week — Punk&nbsp;edition  The year of regulators  New York gets a crypto-loving mayor  The buzziest&nbsp;buzzword  Web3 is in, but web2 ain’t&nbsp;out  The rise of the&nbsp;DAO   1. It’s last call at the Fed’s easy money&nbsp;party Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Photo: Brookings Institute<p>Inflation is at an all-time high. Fed chief Jerome Powell is aggressively tapering — i.e. unwinding the massive bond-buying program sparked by the pandemic induced recession and market fallout. Market analysts predict multiple interest rate hikes this year. Emergency stimulus packages are also running their course — the child tax credit just expired, and amid Congressional squabbling, hopes for a robust infrastructure bill are&nbsp;dimming.</p><p>In short, this latest period of easy money is coming to an&nbsp;end.</p><p>That will hit the stock market, but it will also impact all the other assets that have enjoyed the flow of easy money including crypto.</p><p>Bitcoin has long been touted as a check to freewheeling central banks and governments, the narrative that it serves as an inflationary hedge. It’s a story that remains untested. Since Bitcoin’s arrival in 2009, it’s existed in a predominantly easy money environment with the Fed struggling to meet its preferred target of 2 percent inflation — helping to boost crypto to over $2 trillion in&nbsp;value.</p><p>Inflation is now the highest it’s been in 30 years and the Fed is actively trying to pull the&nbsp;plug.</p><p>For crypto and the rest, we’re entering uncharted waters.</p><p>Caveat: Jerome Powell is only just starting to pull the plug. Even while tapering, the Fed is still buying bonds. Even with hikes, rates will still be near historical lows.</p><p>Other risks: China. Since entering the WTO in 2001, the Middle Kingdom has been an engine for global growth. A confluence of factors — the pandemic (and <a href="https://www.axios.com/china-zero-covid-strategy-xian-lockdown-533b794d-48a3-4656-bc62-c126ae8222c1.html">China’s zero tolerance policy</a>), Xi Jinping’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57739634">aggressive Maoist policies</a>, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0fe5b5e-6a0f-4b39-b457-db07294c696f">a looming demographic crisis</a> have <a href="https://www.axios.com/china-evergrande-debt-property-market-55d61183-6ae7-4ad6-96a1-61f961a52d72.html">some observers</a> wondering if China’s economy starts sputtering.

Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crypto-predictions-for-2022?rc=wsoyyg">The Information’s Hannah&nbsp;Miller</a>:</p><blockquote>NFTs will find their fit in gaming. In 2022, consumers will start to pull away from exclusive digital art collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, and gravitate toward NFTs with utility in gaming and the metaverse. Startups developing NFTs that represent in-game assets and accessories for avatars will gain more traction as a result. Ready Player Me, for example, raised $13 million in Series A funding just this&nbsp;week.</blockquote><p>Relevant</p>  <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/2021-dapp-industry-report">2021 Dapp Industry&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crypto-predictions-for-2022?rc=wsoyyg">Crypto Predictions for&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-and-snl-crypto-keeps-burrowing-into-the-mainstream-11640567423">NFTs and SNL: Crypto Keeps Burrowing Into the Mainstream</a>   2a. Chart of the week — Punk&nbsp;edition <p><a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/2021-dapp-industry-report">Dapp Report</a>:</p> 3. The year of regulators <p>The allure of DeFi is obvious. Anyone can go and deposit their coins somewhere and start earning returns — returns wildly higher than what they would get in a savings account. Others can play the other side of the trade, offering liquidity for a fee. Those looking for leverage can get instant collateralized loans.</p><p>All decentralized. All without an intermediary. All without any KYC (know your customer) processes. Everything is non-custodial, recorded directly on the blockchain, powered by smart contracts (i.e. open source&nbsp;code).</p><p>As someone living in New York who isn’t able to access centralized services such as BlockFi due to stringent regulations (BitLicense), DeFi becomes one of the few accessible portals to crypto innovation.</p><p>So the rise of DeFi should be no surprise.</p><p>It should also be no surprise that regulators are taking&nbsp;notice.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-2-trillion-cryptocurrency-market-is-drawing-interest-from-investors-scrutiny-from-u-s-regulators-11641119404">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>A rapidly growing set of cryptocurrency applications known as “decentralized finance,” typically allows certain users to vote on how they operate. They are often supported by software developers and charge transaction fees.</blockquote><blockquote>And even though networks like bitcoin can execute transactions without a middleman, there is still a small group of programmers, known as maintainers, who have the ability to change the underlying code in case bugs&nbsp;emerge.</blockquote><blockquote>Policy makers say the presence of people in all these systems creates the potential for conflicts of interest and necessitates oversight.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“Few technologies in history, since antiquity, can persist for long periods of time outside of public policy frameworks,” Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/wsj-ceo-council-tesla-intel-reddit-pfizer/card/MsUND2c5kqPJC9qYeOAk?mod=article_inline">said at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in December</a>.</blockquote><p>But this will be a fight for the ages. Here’s <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/128757/crypto-lobbying-kicked-into-high-gear-this-year">The&nbsp;Block</a>:</p><blockquote>Happily, we believe the crypto community has embraced the need for political power and is ready to engage at a new level of investment in the coming&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>First, some helpful context for the situation the industry finds itself in. The American public supports cryptocurrencies and their potential at unprecedented levels. Already, 61% of voters believe the US government should support the crypto industry so that our financial system remains a world leader. The sooner our national leaders understand the views the broader public already have on crypto, the sooner they’ll embrace the promise and potential of this technology. Many of the business world’s most recognizable figures have made owning and investing in crypto something close to boring. And other luminaries are leaving Web2 stalwarts for the green pastures of the Web3 frontier. Combine this with the growth of the crypto industry itself, generating good American jobs for workers right here in this country, and the tailwinds for crypto are&nbsp;clear.</blockquote><blockquote>To leverage this position, we are glad to predict that those telling the crypto story in D.C. will have access to much more resources over the next year and beyond. As crypto investors, founders, and others who have grown rich in this space come alive to the need for a powerful lobbying and advocacy force, the amount of money available to those shaping the policy and regulatory environment will undoubtedly increase. Likewise, new types of groups have and will continue to spring up, formed around new conceptions of lobbying, messaging, legal, and advocacy work that the industry&nbsp;demands.</blockquote><p>It will also be a boon for compliance-centric offerings. Here’s The Information’s Hannah Miller&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>Crypto compliance startups will gain favor. There’s no doubt that regulators will increase their scrutiny of crypto, and will likely home in on DeFi and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. All of this regulatory attention would be a boon for compliance startups that make it easy for crypto companies to meet the anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements common among traditional financial institutions. VC firms are already paying serious attention to crypto compliance startups. TRM Labs, featured in The Information’s 50 Most Promising Startups, raised $60 million in Series B funding this month from investors led by Tiger Global Management.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-2-trillion-cryptocurrency-market-is-drawing-interest-from-investors-scrutiny-from-u-s-regulators-11641119404">The $2 Trillion Cryptocurrency Market Is Drawing Interest From Investors, Scrutiny From U.S. Regulators</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/128757/crypto-lobbying-kicked-into-high-gear-this-year">Crypto lobbying kicked into high gear this&nbsp;year</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crypto-predictions-for-2022?rc=wsoyyg">Crypto Predictions for&nbsp;2022</a>   3a.

Unfortunately, New York ranks among the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/20/heres-where-to-meet-new-yorks-youngish-crypto-millionaires/">country’s least hospitable venues</a> for bitcoin and cryptocurrency innovation — indeed, “just wait” is what we’ve been doing for&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Before we can operate in New York, companies that work in this space are forced to navigate byzantine state rules and regulations — including obtaining what’s known as a “BitLicense.” The BitLicense demands that a company furnish extensive financial disclosures and demonstrate compliance with countless cybersecurity and anti-money laundering rules, complete with audits. Firms are also required to meet among the highest capital requirements in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>All that has deterred cryptocurrency and bitcoin innovation in New York. Obtaining the license can cost in excess of $1 million, and as a result, many firms in this space simply avoid the hassle. My firm is still not licensed in this state because of the many roadblocks.</blockquote><blockquote>Only 20 companies have a BitlLicense, according to the state’s Department of Financial Services. To give you a sense of the difficulty, PayPal’s license is conditional.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-adams-mayor-paycheck-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/">NYC mayor-elect Eric Adams says he’ll “take” his first three paychecks in&nbsp;crypto</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/bitcoin-in-new-york-eric-adams-says-crypto-should-be-taught-in-school.html">New York’s incoming mayor says crypto should be taught in&nbsp;schools</a>  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/15/eric-adams-hopes-for-nyc-bitcoin-boom-blocked-by-backwards-thinking-albany/">Eric Adams’ hopes for NYC bitcoin boom blocked by backwards-thinking Albany</a>   4. The buzziest&nbsp;buzzword <p>I’m technically a Millennial, but I’m basically a boomer at this point. (Or apparently what Gen Z calls “cheugs” these&nbsp;days.)</p><p>Case in point: I tried VR for the first time on NYE. (Very&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html">cheugy</a>.)</p><p>(Beat Saber was super&nbsp;fun.)</p><p>A few years ago, a friend gifted me a pair of Snap Spectacles — which I then never wore or used. (The yellow case looked really nice on my bookshelf though.)</p><p>So I’m clearly not best positioned to talk about the metaverse.</p><p>That being said — while some people equate the metaverse to VR/AR (in part due to Facebook/Meta/Occulus’s active involvement), the definition I prefer is a bit broader. From the perspective that this is really about the evolution of the internet, the metaverse can be seen as the culmination of everything else — crypto, NFTs, marketplaces, virtual worlds (from Zoom parties to Roblox to Axie Infinity), a decentralized and interoperable web3,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>In that sense, the metaverse is already here. It just isn’t evenly distributed yet. (Kudos, William&nbsp;Gibson.)</p><p>Some people, like me, are still logging on to The Information Superhighway. Others, however, have already entered the metaverse.</p><p>Anyway, here’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/what-next-22-emerging-technologies-to-watch-in-2022">The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>Coined in 1992 by Neal Stephenson in his novel “Snow Crash”, the word “metaverse” referred to a persistent virtual world, accessible via special goggles, where people could meet, flirt, play games, buy and sell things, and much more besides. In 2022 it refers to the fusion of video games, social networking and entertainment to create new, immersive experiences, like swimming inside your favourite song at an online concert. Games such as Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite are all stepping-stones to an emerging new medium.

Web3 is in, but web2 ain’t&nbsp;out <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith Teare&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>Web3 will continue to attract talent, especially from engineers and product designers. The promise of fully decentralized infrastructure will dominate but the first decacorns built on top of Web 3 will be minted, probably in the fintech space. The UK will become a major center for Web 3 projects that are fintech-centered. Bitcoin will reach $100k at some point in the year. But there will be no “killer app” pulling regular consumers into the Web 3 world. Consumers will continue to use Amazon, Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and other centralized Web2 infrastructures.</blockquote><p>And here’s <a href="https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother?utm_campaign=That%20Was%20The%20Week&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Albert Wenger on why it all&nbsp;matters</a>:</p><blockquote>Now the important part to keep in mind here is that prior to the Bitcoin Paper we literally didn’t know how to have permissionless. Yes, we had distributed databases. And yes, we had federated databases. But all of those still had a small group of entities in charge (cf pretty much every financial network such as ACH or VISA). We didn’t have a protocol for maintaining consensus — meaning agreeing on what’s in the database — that would allow anyone to join the protocol (as well as anyone to&nbsp;leave).</blockquote><blockquote>It is difficult to overstate how big an innovation this is. We went from not being able to do something at all to having a first working version. Again to be clear, I am not saying this will solve all problems. Of course it won’t. And it will even create new problems of its own. Still, permissionless data was a crucial missing piece — its absence resulted in a vast power concentration. As such Web3 can, if properly developed and with the right kind of regulation, provide a meaningful shift in power back to individuals and communities.</blockquote><blockquote>And if widely adopted Web3/crypto technology will also start to improve along other dimensions. It will become faster and more efficient. It will become easier and safer to use. And much like the PC was a platform for innovation that never happened on mainframes or mini computers, Web3 will be a platform for innovation that would never come from Facebook, Amazon, Google,&nbsp;etc.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith Teare:&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother">Web3/Crypto: Why&nbsp;Bother?</a>   6.

<p>Though Blockchain Commons initiatives date back to our 2016 foundation of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> and our 2017 work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> (initially funded through support from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Blockstream</a>), it’s only in 2020 and 2021 that <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Blockchain Commons</a> has come into its own as a full member of the blockchain design community. We’re thrilled with the work we’ve been able to produce in the last two years, with many projects seeing great advancement in 2021.</p>

 Our Vision 

<p>One of the core things we did last year was to define our vision and objectives in a concrete form. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">vision</a> is to advocate “for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny.”</p>

<p>We feel that this is particularly critical following the increased focus on digital life during the pandemic, and what we hope will be an increase in human prosperity as we emerge from the COVID crisis. At this crossroads, we must choose to either trust governments to have total control over our digital self, or we must fight for our digital freedom. Obviously, we choose the latter path.</p>

<p>We are working toward our vision through the creation of infrastructure that is open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. Four early objectives are intended to advance our vision in the next few years: the creation of a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">community of designers</a>; the definition of a self-sovereign design architecture; the creation of demand for this architecture; and the welcoming of peers into our industry.</p>

 Architectural Overview 

<p>To date, our biggest focus has been on our architectural objective. We began with community discussions about the extant flaws in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly related to interoperability between different applications and services. That led us into the creation of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">specifications</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a>, which outline our core desires for interoperable infrastructure.</p>

<p>This led to the development of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">reference libraries</a> that followed our specifications &amp; architecture objectives and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">reference applications</a> that used the libraries. The next step will be for these specifications (and libraries) to be deployed in physical products, which we’re just starting to see as 2021 comes to an end.</p>

<p>We generally see this as the model for Blockchain Commons development: we talk with the community, create a spec, and demonstrate how to use it, then the community creates applications.</p>

<p>So what did 2021 specifically bring for our architectural objective?</p>

 Our Specifications 



<p>Much of our original architectural work on specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">LifeHash</a>, <a>SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md">URs</a> occurred in 2020, but in 2021 we made few major expansions: we produced v2.0 of LifeHash, to make it more compatible with grayscale screens; and we released our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">Request/Response design for URs</a>, which we see as the interoperable end-goal of UR design.</p>

<p>With much of this base work done, we also increased our educational support for our specifications in 2021: our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a> overviews our work; while we also produced extensive docs for both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md">UR</a>.</p>

 Our Reference Apps 

<p>Our next goal with our specifications is to bring them into practical usage by the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Commons trailblazes the way with reference apps that demonstrate both their usage and our libraries. Our most notable release in this regard for 2021 was <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, an app now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">iOS and Mac App stores</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool demonstrates how to create an app based on the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. It also shows best practices and UX for specifications such as LifeHash, UR, SSKR, and PSBTs with animated QRs. The app is a complete reference for the feature set that we’d love to see all airgapped hardware wallets supporting in the coming year.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
We also produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool</a>, also for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple app store</a>, which reveals how the Gordian Principles can be applied to the wider world of data storage.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server platform</a> saw its 1.0 release: this is the linchpin of our Gordian architecture, meant to demonstrate how users can maintain independent control of their digital destiny.</p>

<p>We look forward to more of this work appearing in the deployments of blockchain manufacturers, with some of the first releases of Blockchain Commons specifications already out from
<a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/details/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, with more to come. We’ve already begun <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/Integration.md#using-sparrow-as-a-transaction-coordinator">documentation</a> on how shared use of these specifications creates a new world of interoperability.</p>

<p>Though our architectural work has been our biggest priority, we also did work on our two other major objectives: creating demand for our work and enlarging the blockchain community through education.</p>

 Creating Demand 

<p>Creating demand for open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastucture came mainly through work with legislative bodies. We’ve worked with Wyoming for years, and were thrilled to see their first-in-the-country definition of digital identity go into effect <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">in July 2021</a>. It depends on the delegatable power of a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a>, so we wrote about what that means for the future of digital identity. Because Wyoming is so far ahead of the rest of the country on digital matters, we’ve suggested they create an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNmCMVEdMpAHoqVZ7UBakr2PtHgQI4hIgSpRD07nkkU/">eResidency program</a>, to bring these advantages to everyone.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons also testified before other legislatures and lawmakers including ones in Nevada, North Dakota, Buenos Aires, and the Netherlands. We’re thrilled to be able to continue explaining the need for self-sovereign and compassionate digital infrastructure across the world.</p>

 Supporting Education 

<p>The flip side of creating demand is educating the next generation of blockchain developers. One of our prime thrusts in that direction has always been our Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course, which we minorly updated to keep up-to-date with Bitcoin 20.0 as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es"></a>
More importantly, we also released complete translation of Learning Bitcoin into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es">Spanish</a>. This was our first truly open-development project, initiated and entirely conducted by volunteers. We’re very grateful to these volunteers for managing the translations, as we think they’re critical in the continued design and development of blockchain technology internationally.</p>

<p>Our other long-term educational program at Blockchain Commons is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody">SmartCustody</a>: helping designers and users alike to increase the resiliency of their digital holdings. We feel that this is critical education because it allows people to take full andresponsible control over their digital assets and it helps them to avoid the most common losses, stemming from lack of knowledge and human error.</p>

<p>Though we’re still seeking funds for a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">v2.0 of our course</a>, we have written a few articles that cover some of the technological methods that can improve the resilience of custody in the future, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR shares</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a>. Some of the material remains preliminary, but that’s because integration of the technology is exploratory as well. We look forward to more completely bringing this material into #SmartCustody in the future, as these technical tools are what we’ve always seen as the end-goal of #SmartCustody work.</p>

<p>Finally, we also repeated our internship program in 2021, and were thrilled to herald another coterie of new blockchain developers (and others interested in the field) into the industry.</p>

 Our Future 

<p>Looking forward, there’s lots to be done.</p>

<p>We’re hoping to see even more third-party projects bringing our specifications to market: not only hardware and software wallets, but also online services that leverage them. We’ll also be continuing to support our specifications with reference applications that can be used by developers to test their interoperability.</p>

<p>
Gordian Recovery is our next planned reference release: it’s intended to demonstrate how to recover funds even if a wallet manufacturer disappears, especially for the more complex situation of multisig recovery.</p>

<p>More new initiatives will include investigations into Ethereum as another blockchain that could benefit from some of our infrastructural work and beginning to leverage Rust as a more fundamentally secure language for writing apps. Finally, we’re expecting to work with the recent Taproot soft-fork, and opportunities offered by its Schnorr signatures, as the biggest new advance in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

<p>This coming year, we also hope to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> design workshops, which incubated a lot of the ideas that have gone into Blockchain Commons. A second virtual salon is occurring <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-of-the-box-2052-tickets-231958081867">this month</a>, but the resumption of the full design workshops will of course be pandemic-dependent. In the meantime, we’re thrilled to see the continued development of RWOT’s ideas: we celebrated the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">five-year anniversary of self-sovereign identity</a> with Coindesk and were also thrilled to contribute to the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity book</a> from Manning.</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge going forward is that we need Blockchain Commons to be more self-sufficient, which has proven a difficult nut to crack given the foundational nature of a lot of the work we’re doing. We’re very grateful to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub sponsors</a>; if you’re doing work that will ultimately benefit from some of the specification and interoperability work we’re doing, we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor as well</a>, to ensure we can keep doing that work. You can also show your support for our ideals with the self-sovereign NFTs that we’re hoping to roll out in 2022.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for the support and interest in Blockchain Commons to date, especially including the early adoptors of our specifications, our sustaining sponsors: <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a>, and our many [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons].</p>

Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty   This month, <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1463809689775329284?s=20">Polaris</a> from the English Ontology community officially became an Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member has always been an active supporter, and will bring new energy to our community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-polaris-31234dc4c1dd">Polaris</a> from our English community said that Ontology uses blockchain technology to continuously promote the development of the smart economy on the basis of protecting user privacy, making it fairer, and more transparent. As such, he has become a supporter of Ontology.  This month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">Ontology Community Call</a> on Discord and Telegram was held as usual, focusing on topics such as “the value of a project” and “what is trust?”. Head of Community Humpty Calderon, Ontology Harbinger Polaris, and Atherton Hoge discussed those issues with community members, shared that a “Trustless” decentralized network should be able to protect the privacy of users through DID, and achieve anonymous and secure interactions by integrating the reputation system on the&nbsp;chain.  This month, we held our <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit/status/1469454043437223940?s=20">DeID Summit</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He invited bloXmove CEO Sophia Roediger and CTO Harry Behrens to discuss the application of DID technology in the field of mobile travel. The fragmentation of the urban transport industry means there is a great need to fortify user security and data through decentralized technologies. By integrating Ontology’s DID and data solutions, the whole ecosystem of bloXmove will be made more private, more secure, and will be easier to navigate.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1468066893168738304?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a> of our Spanish community for the first time, led by Ontology Harbinger Emilio. He reviewed the latest progress made in the fourth anniversary of Ontology with community members: Through the comprehensive deployment of DID, global users can maintain the unity of identity and the interoperability of&nbsp;data.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1476108226055876611?s=20">Telegram Community Discussion</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s 4th anniversary NFT event, recent popular NFTs and games, the current Metaverse construction, and the role of Ontology in the construction of Web3. Community members expressed their opinions enthusiastically.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

<p>Another year just flashed past us again with the COVID-19 problem continuing to affect us all socially, economically, physically, and mentally. I guess this will be the case for a long while more until they find a panacea for&nbsp;it.</p><p>After a tumultuous start to the year with a major restructure, we had gone through a lot of developmental changes in terms of the organization itself, and the design and development of the core. I have flattened the organizational structure of ProximaX now with each project group being headed by its respective lead on a regional basis. Eleazar heads Latin America, while Shin Neng looks after South East Asia. Our core development is being championed by Oleg and his team. He has been instrumental in regrouping the team and working towards getting the core solution up and running. We took close to seven months to redesign the service layers and started to code the new design in August this year. We had to do this because the original design was not optimal and lacked in-depth consideration of many things. This was due to indecision and poor technological leadership and direction at that time, which led me to reform and revamp the organization. We have now overcome most of these issues, put better management processes in place, and we are coming out stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Storage as a core service layer of our ProximaX Sirius platform is important for the other service layers to work. Streaming relies heavily on the storage layer as it needs to store its content there, whether in transit (live) or in storage (playback). Additionally, Supercontract requires the storage layer to store code, often also storing results from Supercontract executions.</p><p>The last four months have been spent on making the storage layer more robust for production. First, ensuring it works well on one node and then later, extending it to a few nodes, and now we are finishing to make it work on unlimited distributed nodes. We hope to roll out the storage layer on testnet before the end of Q1, 2022. Concurrently, we are working to finish the streaming layer which shouldn’t take much longer than the storage to complete. Finally, we hope to finish the Supercontract before the end of Q2&nbsp;2022.</p><p>As we progress towards the completion of the service layers, we are also putting together various tools to make the service offering complete. These include SDKs, APIs, the explorer, and the wallet. We are also enhancing the blockchain and merging our codebase with the relevant code from the Symbol blockchain. New features to look forward to include transaction finality; delegated and remote harvesting; staking XPX as a locked fund for other rewards; DEX; modifying the keypair implementation scheme; update and upgrade the SiriusID to be inline with W3C which is evolving rapidly; and roll out Silo, a cloud-based instant messaging service enhanced by blockchain encryption. All these will be rolled out in various stages throughout 2022.</p><p>On the gaming front, we are continuing to develop the Xarcade marketplace as a portal for game developers and gamers to publish their games and for gamers to download/play these games. Unfortunately in December 2021, Typhoon Rai hit South East Asia and crippled parts of southern Philippines where some of our developers reside. In addition to the displacement and devastation left by the typhoon a severe and extended power outage also ensued. We have been making arrangements to bring some sense of normality back to the lives of our team members and get them online so that the development of the Xarcade marketplace can continue. It is our hope to launch this marketplace as the first of many great centrepieces of the ProximaX public network and we are optimistic that we will see great utility of the XPX in time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>As part of an extension of the Xarcade marketplace, we are also designing our version of a metaverse. Named MetaXar, our metaverse is unique in that it does not place emphasis on NFTs but instead, makes it an incidental feature. The tokenomics for MetaXar will be tied in closely with ProximaX Sirius tokenomics. In fact, it is going to play a very important role as a catalyst to the tokenomics of ProximaX in the immediate term. Akin to what is commonly termed as Parachains, the MetaXar project is like a “Para-economy” of the ProximaX&nbsp;project.</p><p>The entire crypto landscape is fast evolving and it is imperative that our project evolves and adapts as quickly too. Fortunately, our platform solution has most of the elements needed to quickly change and meander through the ever changing terrain, and I am happy to say that we are well prepared for that. In our initial tokenomics plan, XPX was supposed to be designated as a utility coin. Today, as we evolve, XPX shall also be used as a precondition to partake in other tokenomic initiatives. For example, in the MetaXar project, we shall be airdropping a token associated with the project — MetX — and only those who possess XPX XAR can claim for this token through a conditional airdrop. MetX is therefore minted on the fly as a reward for those who participate in the activities of the ecosystem. Initially, about 9.2 million units of MetX shall be minted and airdropped. Later, owners of XPX can stake XPX by locking their XPX funds to gain more MetX as they harvest and participate in the validation of ProximaX transactions. The utility of MetX is explained in our paper titled “ <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Metaverse_Autonomous_Economy_20211230.pdf">Metaverse Autonomous Economy</a> “, or MAE in short. It gives a new dimension to the value of MetX and correspondingly, to the value of XPX. XPX is finite and its supply will deplete through the passage of time from lost keys. All of it has already been distributed and therefore no more can be minted. MetX will add a new twist to our tokenomics, in line with other initiatives, including DeFi initiatives which can be implemented on the platform once the Supercontract service layer is&nbsp;ready.</p><p>Having XPX allows us to have a strong say in the consensus mechanism. It is also a precondition for us to have a strong influence in the tokenomics of the ecosystem, e.g., MetX can only be rewarded to an XPX holder, which will be used for something else in the ecosystem. As we progress to build more ecosystem components, more tokens can be created to perpetuate the need for XPX to power the economy. This indirectly pushes the demand for XPX in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Many people have asked us how we are different compared with other storage projects, Smart Contract projects, and streaming projects. To answer this, we should liken the ProximaX Sirius platform to what Aristotle once said, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” Our platform has been designed in such a way that each service layer, while being useful on its own, contributes to a holistic development environment which individually, the service layers cannot provide. While we are a storage project, a streaming project, and a Smart Contract project, we are at the same time a project that provides an all-in-one infrastructure that can spawn all sorts of ecosystem projects. We are breaking new ground when it comes to utility and we hope to carry this through in the years to come, especially when developers start to discover that they don’t need to do Supercontract on one chain, storage on another chain, and streaming on yet another chain in order to provide a solution or application.</p><p>And this is exciting.</p><p>For the seeds have been sown, the perseverance and arduous nurturing will bear superior fruits that we can then reap and benefit from. Upwards and&nbsp;onwards!</p><p>Lon Wong</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://blog.proximax.io/en/proximax-in-2021/">https://blog.proximax.io</a> on January 1,&nbsp;2022.</p>

MetaMUI SSID App is the ultimate store of your valuable digital assets. Your asset is bound to your identity and you never have to worry about the loss&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>MetaMUI SSID is an identity application that allows building a fully-functioning national identification system and enables the digitalization of every government service ‘E-Government’ on the MetaMUI Identity Blockchain.</p><p>MetaMUI is a hybrid blockchain of identity-based token blockchain. The identity part of the MetaMUI is an implementation of Self-Sovereign Identity. Through this App, users can manage their private information in the form of Verifiable Credentials. These VCs are issued by the public identity such as the Governments, Banks, Hospitals, Universities Web Sites, Shopping Malls, etc. Government issues VC (Signed Document) related to the nationality of the user. The issued VCs are stored in the MetaMUI SSID and managed by the user through the App. The user can present VC to prove the identity of the&nbsp;user.</p><p>MetaMUI SSID App is a wallet for various digital assets, such as digital fiat currency, digital arts, digital stocks, gold certificates, real estate certificates, etc. Ownership of the assets is bound to the identity of the user, not to the private key, therefore it can be recovered in case the user lost the private key. User authorizes the transfer of the asset to another user by signing the authorization certificate on the blockchain. This authorization of critical actions is provided by the MetaMUI SSID App through two-way cryptographic binding.</p><p>With MetaMUI SSID App, users can connect to other public entities through Pairwise Trust authentication. Commercial sites that have a public identity on MetaMUI Identity Blockchain can offer Pairwise Trust login to their customers. The user no longer has to register the website and create an ID and password. User can simply connect their SSID to the website through Pairwise Trust connection and login instantly. User does not need to provide sensitive private information to every web sites anymore.

Is two-factor authentication (2FA) passwordless authentication? <p>Because the nature of two-factor authentication (2FA) is to add an additional layer of security to passwords, it can sometimes be mis-categorized as passwordless authentication.</p><p>However, 2FA methods such as <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/building-sms-authentication-c2cabccbd5f8">SMS-based authentication</a> would still be considered a one-time password which is a form of passwordless authentication.</p> 3 Types of Passwordless Authentication that Eliminate Single Points of Failure from Centralized PAP-based Authentication <p>Today’s password authentication protocols (PAP) are designed with centralized intermediaries or organizations that maintain a database of username-password pairs to prove a user’s identity.</p><p>The central point of failure of PAP-based authentication puts people at risk of hacks, data breaches, identity theft, fraud, and leaks, all of which can be mitigated with passwordless authentication.</p> 1. Public-Key Cryptography and Blockchain Authentication <p>Public key cryptography is a form of public and private key authentication, which has been broadly used in the current information world including WebAuthn, machine-to-machine communication, etc.</p><p>Public-key cryptography has exploded in popularity in the last decade in large part because of public blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana that use public-private cryptography to secure blockchain transactions of digital assets and Non-Fungible Tokens&nbsp;(NFTs).</p><p>Because blockchain technology is built on top of public-key cryptography, they can be confused as one and the same. However, public-key cryptography doesn’t necessitate authentication with a blockchain.</p><p>For example, although <a href="https://magic.link">Magic enables Web 3.0 platforms to connect to public blockchains</a> like Ethereum, throughout the entire authentication flow there is no interaction with the underlying blockchain; no consensus is involved or required to prove the user’s identity.</p> How does blockchain authentication work to prove a person’s identity? <p>Instead of using the traditional method of typing in a username and password, blockchain authentication uses public-key cryptography for self-sovereign identity management.</p><p>When a user creates a wallet account on the blockchain, they receive a private key which only they know, and it is paired with a public key that connects them to the wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>To access Web 3.0 applications or complete blockchain transactions, the user signs transaction requests using their private key which authenticates their account&nbsp;access.</p> How are blockchains secured using public-key authentication? <p>Blockchains have a variety of security mechanisms to protect the integrity of the blockchain and secure user’s information.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and Ethereum 2.0’s soon to be Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms ensure censorship resistant networks that are practically impossible to&nbsp;hack.</p><p>To hack (i.e. modify transactions on a blockchain’s distributed ledger) a malevolent user would need to control 51% of Bitcoin’s hash power, or more than 33% of Ethereum’s stake.</p><p>For example, the top four Bitcoin mining pools which power Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus, control ~60% of the mining power, and to manipulate the network, all four of these independent miners would need to&nbsp;collude.</p><p>As long as someone does not have access to your private key, it is highly unlikely for someone to access your wallet or impersonate the identity tied to your public-private key&nbsp;pair.</p> 2. Decentralized Authentication <p>Decentralized authentication means no single centralized platform, organization, person, or entity is needed to verify your identity.</p><p>While blockchain authentication has proven to be a strong use case for decentralized authentication, the two are not the same. You don’t need blockchains to use decentralized authentication methods.</p> What is an&nbsp;ITF? <p>Identity Trust Fabric (ITF) is a decentralized mechanism for establishing trust between credentialed users. ITFs act as middlemen by interacting directly with a centralized intermediary.</p><p>For example, an ITF could handle all the identification and access requests needed from a centralized party. ITFs decrease the risks of sending your confidential information to an organization.</p> What are the tradeoffs between decentralized authentication and blockchain authentication? <p>The main argument for using decentralized authentication methods like ITFs instead of blockchain authentication is the speed and cost of using blockchains.</p><p>However, with the emergence of lightning fast layer one blockchains like Solana, layer 2 solutions built to help Ethereum scale transaction throughput like Polygon, blockchains are quickly becoming a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional decentralized authentication protocols.</p><p>ETH 2.0 brought Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding to the scaling conversation. These aren’t bad options as they do increase the L1 transaction throughput, but to reach scalability where there are millions of transactions on the network on any given day, PoS and sharding simply aren’t&nbsp;enough.</p> 3. Distributed Authentication <p>Distributed authentication is a collection of hosts interconnected by a single network. While distributed authentication is the leading choice based on the adoption across the industry, it poses a high amount of<a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/common-flaws-of-distributed-identity-and-authentication-systems.pdf"> security&nbsp;threats</a>.</p> Two Common Flaws in Distributed Authentication <p>Two main flaws with distributed authentication are:</p>  Unconstrained delegation  Unbalanced authority   What is unconstrained delegation? <p>Unconstrained delegation allows some entity to authenticate you as an individual and also authenticate on your behalf (i.e. impersonate, act as you) to another&nbsp;party.</p><p>While unconstrained delegation has benefits such as allowing administrators to update database servers from a web server, it creates an area of exploitation where a hacker with access to admin credentials can unilaterally compromise the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Unconstrained delegation can lead to data breaches, exposing millions of confidential usernames and passwords, causing fraud and potentially billions of damages every&nbsp;year.</p> What is unbalanced authority? <p>Unbalanced authority is when a specific centralized party or system has information that identifies specific principles within the system (e.g.&nbsp;users).</p><p>Unbalanced authority occurs between enterprise businesses where an external business partner is trusted inside the system, allowing them to access company resources.</p><p>When the access granted is over-provisioned it allows external companies access to too much sensitive information that can cause harm to the internal organization and their customers.</p> What type of passwordless authentication does Magic&nbsp;use? <p>Magic uses public-private key authentication. While the authentication flow doesn’t involve interacting with blockchain, Magic’s authentication allows users to interact with blockchains after they are authenticated by binding the authentication to 16+ different blockchain key generation schemes.</p><p>Borrowing security principles from blockchain hardware wallets like Ledger, Magic secures accounts using a combination of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">hardware wallet security and AWS’s Delegated Key Management</a>.</p><p>Software developers can use Magic plug-and-play Software Developer Kit (SDK) to quickly add magic links secured with public-private key authentication to their application.</p><p>A magic link is a special URL that represents a login URL, typically emailed to users at login. This link contains an embedded token that authorizes users without requiring a username or password. Magic also supports other login methods like SMS, Social Logins, WebAuthn and&nbsp;MFA.</p> The Type of Passwordless Authentication You Choose Will Be Different for Each Application’s Security Requirements <p>Passwordless authentication removes the need to remember passwords and for password managers, and improves upon the security benefits of password-based authentication.</p><p>Scalable passwordless authentication tools like Magic help software developers reduce the complexity of securing their applications, while simultaneously hardening security using the best aspects of public-private key cryptography.</p><p>With the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology transforming every business sector, having the option to <a href="https://magic.link/docs/home">bind authentication with 16+ blockchain key generation schemes</a> helps today’s Web 2.0 companies prepare for the future of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Passwordless authentication isn’t a zero-sum game. Every business has different needs, and not every type of passwordless solution will fit within the regulatory and compliance needs of each business.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/types-of-passwordless-authentication-for-web-3-958062e9d265">3 Types of Passwordless Authentication for Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Look back at our year of product launches, partnership announcements, educational blogs &amp; more as we kick off a new year for our platform and community <p>What a year, Shyftoshis! We’ve come a long way since the official <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shyft-federation-launches-shyft-network-150000425.html">launch</a> of the Shyft Network Mainnet in July of 2021. It’s hard to believe how much has happened in only four&nbsp;months.</p><p>We find ourselves in an exciting and undoubtedly challenging time for the entire crypto and blockchain ecosystem. As our world experiences growing institutional adoption, regulation will inevitably increase, leading to even more of a need for compliant solutions and frameworks that maintain privacy and trust — and create opportunity out of these&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Crypto markets are experiencing constant turbulence as global economies navigate before unprecedented inflation rates and the continuous challenges of COVID worldwide. At Shyft Network, we’re hard at work bringing on new partners, exchanges, and governmental bodies who will utilize our attestation framework and Veriscope Travel Rule solution and look to the future of compliance across DeFi and NFTs. We’ve got a lot done in the last year since we published our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-roadmap-ee7c78fbc3ac">roadmap</a> back in April and had a massively successful IDO.</p><p>Below, we’ve listed some highlights from this monumental last year for our platform. Best of luck to everyone in these exciting yet uncertain times. We’re all in this together and share the same space and hope for a positive and productive future. Keep building and looking towards the long-term opportunities around us&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’ll see you in&nbsp;2022!</p> Shyft in the&nbsp;Media <p>We always love to see Shyft Network out in the media and on podcasts spreading our gospel! 2021 saw our fearless leader Joseph Weinberg appear on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7sI5oiNpjKN4p4ohwuNJDr?si=iGYjhSUlSJi0DTw28svzNw&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">Decrypt Daily</a> and <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124362/policy-scoop-with-aislinn-keely-unpacking-the-fatfs-guidance-and-its-impact-on-the-global-crypto-landscape?utm_source=twi">The Block</a> to discuss the newly-released FATF Guidance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cln5aD2p0NM">CryptoCoinShow</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpWmgGP_bM&amp;t=2s">Coin Desk TV,</a> and Charlie Shrem’s Beyond the Base Layer for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9r6Gbc0Keg">deep dive</a> on all things Shyft.

 Scores of illicit vendors are capitalising on vaccine scepticism in Europe and North America by selling counterfeit Covid-19 vaccination and test certificates for Bitcoin.

<p>Scores of illicit vendors are capitalising on vaccine scepticism in Europe and North America by selling counterfeit Covid-19 vaccination and test certificates for Bitcoin. Elliptic’s internal analysis, which has identified at least $100,000 in profits for these vendors, suggests that this lucrative business could be making individual criminals around $15,000 a month.</p>

 Redefining the Metaverse — MetaXar by Xarcade — ProximaX Official&nbsp;Blog  Prelude <p>Discovered by an expedition fleet sheerly by happenstance, the mysterious artifact, known as the Nexus — a massive city complex entirely abandoned — appears to be both an isolated pocketverse as well as a gateway to different routes throughout the multiverse.</p><p>As of now, the Nexus is of unknown origin. Investigations will be conducted ascertaining whether it is alien or man-made.</p><p>Scientists posited that the Nexus is not only a gateway to different realities but different times as&nbsp;well.</p>  Could humans have built the Nexus far into an alternate future timeline?  If so, where are the human settlers&nbsp;now?  Did they abandon the city intentionally or under&nbsp;duress?  Did they&nbsp;perish?  Will they be able to&nbsp;return?  <p>The technological benefits salvaged from the artifact are too valuable to ignore. Scientists estimate that only 1% of the dimensional gateway routes have been re-activating.</p><p>Who will discover the rest? The call has gone&nbsp;out.</p><p>Adventure, creative exploration as well as a multitude of yet untapped rewards await those daring enough for such an endeavor.</p><p>The story continues: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Founding_of_Xarnadu_and_the_Genesis_of_MetaXar_20211230.pdf">The Foundation of Xarnadu and the Genesis of&nbsp;MetaXar</a>.</p> Metaverse Autonomous Economy <p>ProximaX has conceptualized a unique tokenomy. It should be born out of creativity and be autonomous and egalitarian, giving everyone an equal opportunity to make it to the pinnacle.</p><p>The MetaXar project will be the first to roll out this autonomous economy. It shall be carried out in phases. The initial phases will involve gamers and game developers coming together with an aggregation of games and activities in a metaverse setting. More complexity will arise as the ecosystem grows, creating a broad spectrum of earning capabilities.</p><p>There will be an announcement for the MetaXar token, MetX, that shall be freshly minted and airdropped to XPX and XAR holders at a specific block height. To be eligible for this airdrop, XPX and XAR holders must stake a claim for it. No MetX will be airdropped to those who missed it or want to make a claim later. About 9.2 million MetX will be minted in this&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>Find out more: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Metaverse_Autonomous_Economy_20211230.pdf">Metaverse Autonomous Economy</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://blog.proximax.io/en/redefining-the-metaverse-metaxar-by-xarcade/">https://blog.proximax.io</a> on December 30,&nbsp;2021.</p>

<p>All of us have <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">multiple identities</a> at any point. We are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, partners, friends, colleagues, and more to different people.</p><p>Sometimes, we may want to keep our identities separate from one another. For example, we may not want our colleagues to know our personal identities or we may not want our personal information to get mixed with our online identity.</p><p>How can we do&nbsp;this?</p><p>One option may be Trusted Third Parties, where a third-party entity facilitates interactions between two parties, where both trust this third-party. In our above example, it can be your boss who knows your personal information, but will not disclose the same to your co-workers. But since your co-workers trust your boss, they may accept anything that he/she says about&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the real world though, a Trusted Third Party (TTP) is a term that is often associated with online security. Here, a domain or a third-party acts as a facilitator between the owner of an information and the verifier of that information, such that the TTP vouches the identity of the party and this is accepted by the verifier.</p><p>The big question here is — can these TTPs be trusted in a digital&nbsp;world?</p> Are TTPs a Viable Solution? <p>TTPs, in today’s world, are organizations or entities that store and handle your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Facebook is a company that stores your information, and authenticates you on other sites. The other sites, in turn, trust Facebook and since your data comes from it, they trust your data. Here, you are the owner and the other sites are the verifiers, and Facebook is the&nbsp;TTP.</p><p>While TTP may seem like the perfect solution to create online trust, it is unfortunately ridden with many problems.</p> Security and Privacy Loopholes <p>What happens when your TTP’s database is hacked? All the data stored in it gets stolen and used by hackers. Recent hacking incidents show that such centralized databases are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">not secure</a> enough to keep your data from falling into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Further, this centralized storage is a privacy loophole as well because anyone who has access to the database knows about you! Also, TTPs determine who can access your data and how it must be used. Some of them even monetize your data by targeting you with relevant advertisements.</p><p>So, from both a security and privacy standpoint, TTPs are a loophole.</p> Creates data&nbsp;silos <p>TTPs store data in silos, and this makes the data a lot less effective, both in terms of utility and leverage.</p><p>Data leverage is the degree to which we can use data. A prominent aspect that determines the usability and leverage of a data is its trust. In other words, when verifiers trust a data, it can have greater utility and leverage.</p><p>When a piece of information about an individual comes from a government organization, it is trusted implicitly, and this is an example of trusted data. Some examples of trusted data are passports, Adhar cards, Social Security Numbers, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Utility follows leverage because when the data is trusted, it is widely accepted and can be used extensively for authentication and authorization. In the current business world, most of the data do not come from the government, and hence are not&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Let’s take a practical scenario&nbsp;here.</p><p>Let’s say you go to a supermarket close to your house twice a week to buy groceries. One day, you forget to take your wallet and phone, so they are unable to sell their products to you on credit. Though you have a loyalty card with the supermarket, the data they have about you is not trustworthy enough to give you&nbsp;credit.</p><p>Likewise, a blue collar worker does many part time jobs. When he applies for a new job, he doesn’t have any trusted proof of the part time jobs he has done so far, and hence his potential employer has no way to verify his&nbsp;data.</p><p>In both the above scenarios, the available data is not considered trustworthy, hence it has little leverage and utility. The same can be extended to cross-border rentals, credit history, etc because the data that is generated is not trusted and hence is of little value to its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Thus, online trust is a major issue and to overcome that, TTP has been in vogue. But this TTP comes with privacy and security issues, and also, it creates data silos that have little utility for its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Much of this lack of utility stems from the fact that the data is not portable or interoperable and hence cannot be used in all scenarios.</p><p>Now comes the big question. What is the alternative to TTP and the data silos they&nbsp;create?</p> Self-Sovereign Identity <p>One option that can overcome the privacy and security problems of TTP and make the data more usable for its holders is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, or SSI in&nbsp;short.</p><p>Let’s see how this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">framework</a> overcomes the issues related to&nbsp;TTP.</p> Decentralized or Custodial Storage <p>In this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">identity framework</a>, every individual stores his or her own data and is responsible for its security. This may make it difficult for a hacker to steal data, and more importantly, there is little financial incentive for hackers as they would spend too much resources to steal a single&nbsp;record.</p> Ensures Privacy <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> gives complete control to users, so they can decide how their data is used and with whom it is shared. Such granular control reduces the possibility for unauthorized people to peek into an individual’s data.</p> Data Leverage <p>The trust associated with data is greatly enhanced when it is in the form of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential</a>. This is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">tamper-proof credential</a> that can capture even the smallest of details such as volunteering experience, rental history, and more. These small pieces of information can add a ton of value and give you an edge in securing the services you&nbsp;need.</p><p>Since these credentials can’t be changed by anyone, it is more acceptable as a trusted form of data, and hence, has a higher utility&nbsp;value.</p><p>As you can see, SSI can be a good alternative to TTP as it preserves privacy, enhances security, and creates trusted data that in turn can have wide-reaching leverage.</p><p>Do these sound interesting to&nbsp;you?</p><p>Visit Affinidi’s <a href="http://build.affinidi.com">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VCs and how you can leverage them to do more with your data in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a>, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/trusted-third-parties-vs-self-sovereign-identity-4e96de929b1b">Trusted Third Parties vs Self-Sovereign Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for reining in big tech, with all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">sorts of developments</a>&nbsp;and no doubt more to come in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/agcm-fines-apple-google/">story</a>&nbsp;is that Google and Apple were each fined&nbsp;€10 million by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">Italy’s competition and market authority</a>&nbsp;(AGCM) for not providing their customers with clear information about how they use their data commercially, and for being “aggressive” in pushing users to accept commercial processing of data. These actions violate Italy’s consumer code.</p>



<p>According to the AGCM, Google didn’t give users relevant information at the account creation stage and when using services so they could make informed decisions about whether or not to consent to their data being used for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>Apple copped the fine for reportedly failing to give users immediate access to clear information about how it uses customer information commercially when a customer creates an Apple ID or accesses digital stores like the App Store.</p>



<p>This news is interesting because let’s face it: we expected it from Google, but Apple is one of the good guys on privacy—or so its careful marketing narrative would lead us all to believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, these sanctions are yet another reason why every consumer needs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>—secure, customizable digital identities or ‘profiles’ that intentionally differentiate from a consumer’s personal identity and protect their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;Regulators and watch dogs usually don’t intervene in data misuse until after harm has been done. So isn’t it better to close the gate&nbsp;before&nbsp;the horse bolts?&nbsp;</p>

 A possible solution to the participation problem. <p>a16z, the famous venture capital company, is entering the DAO field through investments into DAO projects, such as the recent investments in social DAO project,&nbsp;FWB.</p>Source: <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/</a><p>Since 2020, DAOs have become more well-known and have gradually become mainstream players in the blockchain industry. Recently, we have seen major venture capital institutions disclosing their investments in DAO projects, which has attracted the attention of major blockchain media. Therefore, some people think that “2022 will be the first year of&nbsp;DAO.”</p><p>What is it about DAOs that attracts the interest of these market-leading investment institutions and the associated media??</p> Understanding DAOs <p>Human beings have entered the DAO era, and all this cannot be&nbsp;avoided.</p><p>— Stephenson, the Father of the Metaverse</p><p>Everyone has their interpretation of what a DAO is, but they all share a common logic: members vote with tokens, and open-source codes automatically run voting results. This trustless system eliminates human error and members can manage community finances as a collective.</p>Source: <a href="https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw">The DAO landscape</a>.<p>At present, DAOs have developed across many platforms, including social media, agreement platforms, project principles, and so on. Moreover, it is more like a bottom-up management company, where members rely on their personal abilities and subjective wishes to divide labor to build the entire DAO. The DAO will reward members based on their contribution value.</p><p>In the upcoming Metaverse, DAOs may well be at the core of governance models, as it returns the rulemaking and governance power to the public, promoting the complete decentralization of the Metaverse.</p> Still In Early&nbsp;Stages <p>Whilst the vision for DAOs is beautiful, the reality is still working towards fulfilling these goals. It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. These hurdles&nbsp;include:</p> Low ​​Member participation <p>Most DAOs use the digital assets of their members as key indicators. For example, voting is based on the number of tokens, and rewards are based on the proportion of digital assets. This approach not only inhibits the voice of DAO members but also makes members with a small proportion of tokens unwilling to invest time and energy in governance, due to the imbalance of investment returns.</p> Centralization crisis <p>The above-mentioned system employed by DAOs can easily lead to the emergence of a mindset that “the rich will always be rich, and the strong will always be strong”. The simple reality is that with the right to speak, comes the right to set rules that are more beneficial to you, and you can get greater benefits. This has pushed many DAOs into an unwanted centralized situation.</p> Decisions are difficult to&nbsp;balance <p>In a fully autonomous DAO system, the decision should be based on the number of votes. But sometimes there are conflicts between the opinions of the development team and the interests of community members. How to maintain a good balance is a headache for many DAO organizations. Sometimes the DAO development team will directly ignore the community opinions, resulting in accusations of centralization. The alternative is to completely follow the DAO community, which may result in constructive opinions not being&nbsp;adopted.</p> Which Brings Us to Reputation <p>The above problems essentially have a key point: what kind of incentives should be set up? The incentives should not only satisfy decentralization and fairness but also promote proactive DAO members that actively participate in governance.</p><p>Based on its own technology and past service experience, Ontology proposes the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO&nbsp;member.</p> Verification <p>When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.</p> Record <p>When participating in DAO governance, DID will record the amount time spent in the DAO and your contributions after joining. Contributions would include voting, suggestions, operational work, and so on. If you also use this DID to participate in the governance of other DAOs, those data will also be recorded in the same DID, increasing your data diversity.</p> Reputation Score <p>The reputation system will make a comprehensive score based on the above records. For example, the more DAOs you participate in, and the longer, and the more active you are, the higher your score will be. In addition, corresponding weights can be set when designing the reputation scoring model, such as reducing the weight of digital assets and increasing the weight of participation.</p> Decentralization <p>With reputation value, DAO can dynamically divide rights based on reputation. The higher the reputation value, the greater the power. This power could be manifested in the right to more votes (right to speak) and the right to more DAO dividends.</p> Participation <p>Based on this, we can imagine a completely decentralized DAO organization as:</p>  The acquisition of rights and benefits is no longer difficult for ordinary&nbsp;members.  The development team, like ordinary members, needs to rely on contribution to gain the right to&nbsp;speak.  It has become very important to increase your participation and enthusiasm.   To Summarize <p>Implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.</p><p>Whilst DID can help to solve some of the current DAO problems, this is still only the beginning.</p><p>In the future, DAOs will inevitably become the organizational form of the decentralized world, with more blockchain technologies being absorbed by DAOs, allowing for the quick and healthy development of ecosystems.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for [joining] the last episode of this year 2021 for Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. We are now talking about how to budget projects, identity and access management projects, and we have very a interesting guest for that.</p>
<p>Originally from New Zealand, Ian Yoxall started Intragen in 2006 after working for several companies in the US and in London. As Principal Consultant and CEO of Intragen, Ian has worked on many of the largest projects in the Netherlands and throughout Western Europe. With a broad experience with small and large scale implementations, both in the private and public sector, he brings a pragmatic approach to problems that arise around identity and access management projects. Prior to joining Intragen, Ian worked for global infrastructure and security vendors and consultancies.</p>
<p>Hello, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian Yoxall: Good morning. Hello. And how are you Oscar?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice having you here, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s great to be here. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Our pleasure. And please tell us a bit more how your career, your life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Ian: Right. Well, yeah, that’s a long train wreck of a story. So let’s start off. Originally, I started in consulting as a DBA working for the various database vendors in infrastructure, and then moved across into business consulting, still with an infrastructural angle and infrastructural projects. And one day I arrived in London and sort of fell into banking security. And after that, I dropped into the gravity well that became identity and access management. And once you start down the career of identity and access management, you can’t escape. That’s it. That’s the end. Yeah, you can’t go anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that attracts people to stay in it is it’s got a high failure rate. I have a personal hobby of flying, and when you fly a plane, nobody expects you to do everything perfectly, but it’s about making fewer mistakes and reducing your risks. And with the rapidly evolving industry that we’re in, it attracts plenty of bad actors. We’ve seen just recently the Log4j issues that have come up. And already that’s been weaponised and deployed very, very quickly. So when you’ve got bad actors who are so willing to try and make a profit here and attract businesses it’s an interesting field to work in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. It’s an exciting place to be working in these days, right? There are so many things happening, good and bad, of course, and that’s why we are here to solve the problems.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly, exactly. And it’s that engaging with businesses to help solve those problems that makes it such an exciting field.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. I know that Intragen works in several industries, education, we are doing projects together in education, but you also work a lot with SMEs, so medium businesses, not known as large corporations, or some of these who are becoming, but still not there. And often we talk about all the capabilities that advance identity and access management have, everything you can do, but of course that costs money. If there is unlimited budget and time, you can, yeah, achieve everything that the brightest minds of identity have delivered until now. But how far you can go when you have more tighter budget, you don’t have enough budget, but you need IAM? So what would you say about that? So what – with some organisations listening to that in, “Yeah, we need IAM but the budget is tight. What can we do?”</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, great question Oscar. And it’s something that we try and engage our clients with on a regular basis, is saying “What sort of budget should you set for the upcoming budget period?” And I think it’s – from a CFO perspective, you don’t want to be throwing money away, but you do want to be covering risk from the CISO perspective.</p>
<p>Let’s take the hospital sector. They want to set a budget that delivers as much patient care as possible, but you can’t ignore the cyber threat, whether it’s fines or whether it’s payments that they’re making to unlock hospital systems. There has to be budget spent here because it’s going to be spent either for the bad actors or preferably to defence against the bad actors.</p>
<p>When you look at a lot of projects in the space, they generally will set themselves a relatively large scope and that they’ll have a budget and a timeframe of years. And we fundamentally feel that that’s not a good way to go. Think, what’s the fastest time to business value? So when you’re replacing the old infrastructure, and it might be that you’ve got an old identity management or access management system. Everybody has one. It’s just a question of, is it automated? Is it good? Is it ugly? Or what have you.</p>
<p>And if you’re doing a rip and replace type project, often the question is, OK, we just want it to do whatever the old system did but then against that, when are you going to get new business value in there? People want to see business value enhanced and more engagement, particularly with end users to make their lives easier. So if you turn the question on its head and say, “Look, I want to get some really nice goal. How do I get there? So what’s my first step? What are the big rocks that I need to put together my whole project breaking those big rocks down?”</p>
<p>So when we take access management, probably the first thing you want to do is make sure everybody loves you. So that’s going to involve making sure that the SSO elements, and the easiest SSO elements are there as quickly as possible. So you’re going to need an MVP, a Minimum Viable Product of your infrastructure around access management, getting the user datastore sorted, and then looking at all the web apps that you’ve got in the landscape. Take the ones that are best suited to the technology, take the business owners there that do want to engage and deliver that.</p>
<p>That small budget – that small initial success will create a bigger ripple effect for the organisation, whereby more business units and more applications will want to engage. And that’s what it is, by doing that, that small delivery, you tipped the scales, you’ve shown people what can be done, and you’re able to go back to the CFO and say, “Look, we did X amount of spend. And we’ve delivered this level of improvement in security. And for example, we’ll remove passwords from 10 or 15 applications, improving people’s productivity, making them happier, and enjoying what you get with SSO and multi-factor authentication.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, as you said, minimal viable product in which you mentioned, I think it’s mostly, well, two main features: single sign-on that is the basic, basic has to be there, and yeah, replacing passwords with some type of multi-factor authentication. So those are the very basic that you think has to be always in mind.</p>
<p>Ian: Absolutely, because if you start, I mean, it is the one thing. I just had my family, and we have, we all have devices here. And you know, whether it’s our Wi-Fi passwords, whether it’s the email addresses for school, whether it’s their – getting into the home network, or what have you, they all have different usernames and passwords. And even in my own home, this is something which falls for some reason under my responsibility.</p>
<p>And users who have 5, 10, 15 applications, they don’t really love security. They want to get on with the job. So if we’re able to make their life better, we’re going to affect organisational change. And really, looking at security, it’s not about the zeros and ones, it’s about that organisational change. And you’re only going to be able to do that if you can make people’s life easier.</p>
<p>If you’re going to make it easy for end users to log on with single sign-on they’ll love you for it. Likewise, if you’re an administrator and have access to privileged accounts, if you can use multi-factor authentication, and the same multi-factor authentication for many applications, or step-up authentication, it’s going to make your life easier, not harder. And that’s what we want to be doing in security, improving the security level and making it easy.</p>
<p>And I see passwords as being the one thing that you ask anybody in the street, “Do you hate your password?” And the answer is yes. And of course by proxy, that means that they hate the security team. And it is kind of annoying when you have a project and nobody wants to sit with you at lunch. So we’ve got to make their lives easier and make them want to engage.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And I can imagine, I’m sure you know better how many organisations already at medium level, not so small, don’t have SSO or they have – yeah, not sufficient, maybe they have, if a software just a couple of their systems and all the rest is not covered.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. And on that I have a little follow up thought. One of the things that we try and do is make it easy to decide what to do and how do you prioritise these projects? So normally, they’ll say, “Right, let’s take all of our applications.” “Well, do you really want to start there?” So what we try and do is say, if you start colour coding your applications, and say, “I’ve got black applications, which are super-secret, I’ve got red ones which are finance, and I’ve got green ones, and yellow ones, and purple ones, and blue ones.” And you put them in buckets that way, and then you’re not trying to cover your whole landscape.</p>
<p>And what you can report back, as you engage with those businesses, you can report back and say like, “We’ve covered all of our red applications now, all that stuff, which is in the cloud, or on a web server internally, we now have it 100% secured.” And that is something which you can report back to the board. And they get an insight into saying, “Oh yeah, we’ve asked the security to step in, they’ve come back. And we now know a definable metric that would actually improve our security.”</p>
<p>Rather than say, “I’ve done 20 applications out of 400.” If you do that by colour coding, that in itself, it makes sense to people. If you say I’ve done 20% of my applications. Well, is that good? Is that bad? I don’t know. So knowing what good looks like and using that colour coding system, even for something as a simple step, such as SSO, this is a great way to communicate and engage users.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe that sounds more tangible and easier to explain with someone, let’s say the IT manager of that company has to convince people, others in the company with, this is important. Yeah, it’s definitely a good way to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Another thing that implies money indirectly is when time goes long. You plan one IAM project or any project, let’s say for six months, and it goes longer. And that means more money. So how would you go about running over time on an IAM project? I’m sure you have a lot of interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, sadly, both good and bad. You know, every project is always going to give you a new set of challenges. And how do you deal with those challenges? Now, there’s a great quote from the British naval historian and author, Cyril Northcote Parkinson, who said, “It’s a commonplace observation that work expands to fill the available time for its completion.” You know, if you ask somebody to tidy their room, and you give them, I have children so if you give them two hours to tidy their room, they’ll take two hours. If you give them 10 minutes, they’ll do it in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So how do you again, not just looking at budget but on time, how do you do that with identity and access management projects? I think there was a good report from Gartner a few years back saying that the number one killer of these projects is scope creep. And it’s very, very difficult to rein that in, because there are always things in every project that creep up. So you’ve got to have first off exceptionally strong project governance, not just on the project manager, on the project sponsors, and communicating that.</p>
<p>Let’s say you do increase the project scope for a very good reason, then there is still going to be a delay and will be perceived as a delay. So whether it’s doing things such as saying, “Well, this is the MVP core, and then MVP extra, any way in which you can separate that out and do it as the next step, in the next follow up, absolutely needs to be done.” Because something we talk about is losing the coffee corner argument, where people will talk about a project and about the perception of the project, and particularly around security where even when you’re taking…</p>
<p>Let’s take the passwords example. Up to now people have been using 10 passwords and they knew their 10 passwords. You’re going to replace that with single sign-on. It’s a change. Nobody likes change. And if there’s something that goes wrong, and generally something goes wrong in all projects, they’re going to blame the project. So it’s very important to take small bites at a time, you know how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Small incremental steps that deliver business value for each step and resist the temptation to increase scope. Put that into a tomorrow bucket. Always find a way to define a separate list. And that’s one of the reasons why we really like doing projects in an agile manner.</p>
<p>Again, looking at – let’s take access management. It’s very relevant. You’re going to need to have the relevant service set up, that core infrastructure. But that’s a relatively small part of the project. What’s going to take most of the time in the project is getting the application factory to onboard applications. And by doing that in sprints saying, you know we’ll do five applications this week, or 10 applications this week, depending on how big your factory is, you’re able to deliver business value quickly, and show people that it’s actually progressing.</p>
<p>You can increase the size of the factory by turning the tap up or tap down on funding. And by delivering value in each sprint it’s tangible to the business. They actually get to see from a risk perspective that the attack surface is reduced, you’re reducing costs because you’ve got fewer password resets, and you’re making everybody’s life easier. So step by step, as long as you’re always delivering business value, instead of doing it in three months increments or 12-month increments.</p>
<p>I was talking to a project a few days ago, and they’ve been doing a three-year phase so nothing would be delivered for three years. Now, I don’t know about you, but I can’t remember anything for more than three weeks, let alone in three years. So that sort of approach, we’ve got to move away from these big projects. And let’s be honest, a lot of consultancies like to work this way because it’s got a big budget attached to it. It’s, you know, you can put a lot of people on, it’s very easy to plan resourcing that way.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t really work for clients. And I think we as an industry, we need to make sure that we’re making our clients’ lives easier, not harder. Because the projects do go on, they do become business as usual processes. There will always be new cloud applications coming along. You want to make it trivially easy for the business to say, “Oh, I’ve gone and added a new cloud application. It just came on. It’s fantastic. It does everything we want. Can you tie that in to SSO?”</p>
<p>If that takes you longer than a couple of business days to engage with them, plan it and get it done, you’re doing it wrong. And I think that’s one of the values that companies like Ubisecure bring – standards-based ways to onboard these applications and really integrate the security. I’ve seen so many data breaches from luckily ex-customers, but still they’re data breaches that caused millions of losses and damages, where these orphaned accounts don’t get picked up. And with cloud computing, which is fantastic and great and enables businesses to move quickly, if we as IT security can’t make sure that we’re enabling the business to choose the applications they want, and onboard them so that we’re taking away this problem, we’re really not doing a good job if we can’t do that in a fast and easy way. And make sure that those sprints are done quickly.</p>
<p>So how do you dot on the horizon 100% coverage? Make sure that every single quarter or whatever accounting period you’ve got where you’re reporting progress vs budget, you can actually write down tangible business benefits. And this is what’s been going on. The board needs to know that things are working. And it’s up to us to do a better job of explaining that.</p>
<p>I see a lot of reporting up to the board on these projects where people say the project is now progressing through phase one. But what does that mean? If we can say we have taken out 30 business critical systems and made sure that then there are no simple passwords to be hacked there. They’ve all got password rotation on there, using multi-factor authentication. We’ve got encryption enabled via a single SSO access. This is the kind of stuff that they can say, “OK, I understand that. I can see why we’re funding these things.”</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry about the big rant there. But getting that corporate governance risk framework to match what we’re doing in security, it’s really important to have those communication so that people can see yes, it takes time but that during each of these cycles and time, it’s fixing things and it can’t be words. It’s got to be metrics.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you mentioned scope creep. So that one of the main… yeah, potential cause of problems starting – trying to start with too big scope, trying to put too much and that will very likely become longer and longer. And as you said, getting this what you call the sprints or phases in which you get results, that’s absolutely great.</p>
<p>You mentioned for instance, reporting to boards. So now we’re – if you think of smaller companies, less regulated companies, mid-market companies, organisations that they also are building products or services for their customers. Yeah, how they can – with the investment they are doing – maximise time to value for the services they are building?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, good question. So when I started this a long time ago, back when my hair was a different colour, it was all very artwork to put these projects together. I remember when the SAML standard started getting released. So this is the days before OAuth or what have you.</p>
<p>So the first thing is you’ve got to base your security vision on a standards-based product. So leveraging scalable products that give off the shelf functionality that matches what you’re looking for. So for example, you know, does it have a uer datastore that can be extended to support the various needs you have? What’s the vision of the company? Does it match your own vision? Using these products that are well-defined and well-understood and have clear standards in them, they’re off the shelf. So it should really be a plug and play type approach.</p>
<p>I’m seeing more and more companies want to move away from bespoke development. They want a roadmap that lets them get to those things as… well, let’s take the Joe Biden quote, you know, he’s been talking about single sign-on and cloud computing and zero trust. So defining those components that, you know, you can’t buy zero trust. Defining those components, means you’re going to need to leverage scalable products off the shelf that can be tied together relatively quickly.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s the first thing that says choose products that aren’t going to require a massive amount of customisation. And I think some of the organisations that we’ve seen have taken a gated funding approach to say, “Well, here’s a ton of money, go and do X and go and do Y and go and do Z.” You learn as you go along on these projects. Every organisation we deal with, it has a vision on security but as you engage with the business, you discover a whole bunch of issues and challenges that are different. And the company’s vision of what security looks like, and what good looks like will change very quickly.</p>
<p>I’m dealing with a customer right now, who’s about to start their project in January. And they’re clinging on to the belief that they can know every problem that they’re going to face for a two-year project on day one. And the short answer is, just can’t do that. So taking a more agile approach, understanding that you don’t know everything that will be, there will be hiccups. It’s just a safer, easier way to go because you can’t know everything around these spaces. So whether it’s, we talked about the profile database, do you know you’re going to need that? Well, in which case then make sure you’re going to choose a product with that. But there may be other aspects you don’t know yet. So be prepared for those unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Oscar: And who, as I said, in SMEs, in a medium organisation, who, from that side, from the customer side, from the organisation side, who would lead this project? Who is the best person to lead this project?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, actually, I’m about to head to a meeting to discuss that. So it’s important, you’ve got to define your stakeholders fairly widely. So of course, IT has a role to play in here. But it can’t be an IT party. That’s the sort of guarantee of failure, I guess. Failure is a strong word, but you’re only ever going to get an initial deployment within the things that IT sees. And IT has a very narrow focus of the business. So it’s important to get – people will say, engage with the business. Well, who is the business?</p>
<p>Whether it’s finance, whether it’s whatever operational units you have that do whatever you do as a business, engage with them, understand their problems. What are the 10 things – if they’re logging on 15 times a day, if they have a problem with people getting access, what are those things? You need to engage with those people. If they’re not with their hands in the steering committee, it’s going to very quickly become a pure IT exercise and that’s, you know, an academic thing which will deliver a project, but it will be, if you will, a successful failure.</p>
<p>You need to engage with the heads of business. If it’s a bank, talk to the head of trading. If you’re talking to a hospital, you want to be talking to the heads of department of the different areas, you know, in radiology or what have you. You need to be talking to those people, what are the real things that happen in their day so that you can match things up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so it sounds like, there’s not only one single person in the customer side, so this is going to be you as IAM vendor of consulting, selling the solution, the full solution had to convince several of these persons including IT of course to join forces.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah. Exactly. And getting that ownership of the systems, who then owns that core infrastructure? Should it stay with IT or should those business processes belong somewhere else? I mean, one of the things, whether you’re looking at customer identity and access management, you know, marketing has a huge role here. And it’s important for them to understand what the user journey is, and what we’re delivering there.</p>
<p>I know we’ve all had that experience where we try and buy something online and you know, it’s like, I want your date of birth, and you’re buying a pen, or whatever it is. Like, why do you need to know my date of birth, if I buy it? Make the buying experience as simple as it is when you go into a shop. You go into a shop, you get something off the shelf, you walk up to the counter, you do a financial transaction. Is it really essential to capture all that information of the end user? Make that the easiest, happiest process ever and you’ll get customers back.</p>
<p>Just this week, I was… rather in the run up to Christmas. I was buying things online. And in some of the customer identity and access management sites I was at, were so painful, I just closed it down. I’d already picked everything, put it in the basket. So making sure that you’re engaging with the stakeholders who are going to be using whatever security system you’ve got in place is fundamental.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And we also know that some organisations already have the policy of a gated funding approach for most of their projects, including IAM, that could be one of those. So what would you say about the gated funding approach? What are the problems you have found? And how organisations who are into this have good results?</p>
<p>Ian: When you look at projects, people are obviously very concerned about this scope creep issue. So they’ll try and define a fixed scope with a fixed set of deliverables, with a fixed budget. That sounds like a good idea. However, you’re always going to, you know, and when you baseline that plan, it all looks great and you start on day one. But whether it’s on day two, or day 10, or day 50, there will be changes come along. And how do you then account for that? Do you want to do exception reports, request for additional budget, and so forth?</p>
<p>So you can control a project that way. We find it’s a good approach. But it’s not the best approach. It tends to lead to waterfall type thinking and thinking that there will be a deliverable and then the project will stop. And as we know, security never stops, it becomes business as usual. So whilst it has the best intentions, no project ever completes the scope exactly as it was set.</p>
<p>So then designing a project with a minimal viable product for infrastructure, and then moving quickly to an agile based approach, where you can have a backlog and then vary the pace of the project according to funding, so you’re still controlling the spend. But the deliverables, again, are, this is what we delivered for this budget. We’re learning as we go, and our understanding of the IT security landscape and how it engages the business is evolving as a company.</p>
<p>There isn’t a company out there that wakes up and says, “I’d like to do identity and access management now.” No. Well, we do because that’s our business. But every other company out there is trying to do some other business problem. And they’re trying to solve that for their customers and their employees, or whoever the stakeholders are. And to get that thing delivered, they need to do identity and access management. So then they come to us and are looking for us as the experts in the field for what’s the best approach.</p>
<p>So again, buy a package, leverage what’s in the package, deliver the minimum viable product, learn as you go, educate the business, and it’s about effecting organisational change. And that can have a budget set, but understand that it will vary and you need to make sure you have good progress reporting, good dashboards on what has been delivered, understanding the key metrics around identity and access management. Maybe it’s about how many fewer password reset you’re doing. Or, again, we talked about what scope of systems are covered? Are all the red and yellow and green systems covered? Rather than just saying, you know, “70% of our applications.” What does good look like? We don’t know.</p>
<p>So again, we need to educate people on what those KPIs and measures are, what they need to do to find their big rocks, put the dot on the horizon, and then say, “We would set a budget of around this amount, but monitor progress versus budget, increasing the velocity of a project by adding more expert services in or decrease your spend and your velocity to stay within the budget you need to do.</p>
<p>We saw the zero day attacks come out with this Log4j. Obviously, people would have been very busy that first weekend, getting all their engineers to start scanning all their systems and patching everything as quickly as they can. That’s going to have a big impact on budget. You can’t know these things in advance. So you have to be able to turn the tap up and down in response to the environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent, excellent. Definitely. Very, very tactically important what you said the importance of reporting, knowing the status and yeah, going step by step, sprint by sprint, being agile as you said.</p>
<p>Ian: When we moved from passwords ourselves, because we were originally we had a little, well, data centre is a strong term for it, but we had a room full of computers. And then we moved to 100% cloud, and then you know, with a complete SSO and MFA solution as well. Getting the base infrastructure in place didn’t take long. What took a long time was tying all the elements together. So being able to report on that we know we’ve eaten our own dog food. We know the challenges clients have. So we have a lot of sympathy, and understand that you can’t pick up everything on day one.</p>
<p>So what’s the easy way to apply a budget to something and then monitor that and deliver that and show people that you’ve delivered it? If it remains a secret, it’s no use. If you’re able to evangelise that throughout the organisation, you’re going to get the organisational change you’re looking for. If you look at it from a security perspective, everybody talks about the X Factor. Today, the bad end user. Getting the X factor to understand, hey, security is not here to make your life bad. We’ve got to engage these end users so that they don’t run in fear and they do want to sit with us at the lunch table.</p>
<p>Oscar: Ian, final question for you. For all business leaders listening to this conversation we are having, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Ian: Talk to me. No, I’m sorry. Joking.</p>
<p>Oscar: Talk to Ian. Write down that.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. I’ve got all the answers they need. No, no. That’s a bit facetious there. So if there’s one thing that you need to do as a business, it’s have a plan here, have an actionable plan with actionable insights. So that’s going to comprise of a couple of elements. You need to know where you are. If you don’t know where you are, then you don’t know how far you’ve got to go. If you just say, for example, he has a ton of money to go implement PAM or MFA or what have you, well, where are you and how has the landscape changed?</p>
<p>So you need an assessment of where you are now, which should take a couple of weeks to get done, measuring a number of aspects around identity management, access management, role management, PAM, and so on and so forth, business alignment. And then say, “OK, looking at these measures, which one item do I want to fix first?” You need to have actionable insights come from that.</p>
<p>And that’s the key thing I’d say, if there’s one thing having actionable insights in security that you can say, “I need to do X now.” Not in a month or in six weeks, because cybersecurity can be a nebulous problem. It can feel OK, I read another hacking story on what have you or that company had a data breach or what have you. You’ve got to have actionable insight that say to the CFO, allocate budget, that give the CISO something to talk about and say, “These items need addressing.” So the CEO can then make the decision, “Yeah, that’s good. Let’s go get those things done.”</p>
<p>And then with those actionable insights, what are the KPIs and metrics associated with that, so that when it’s delivered, you can show how you’d move the needle. Now that the needles done and you’ve solved that problem, go back to the list. What’s the next actionable insight? If you’re not able to prove that you’re fixing things, then you’re just spending money and people kind of wonder, what are those security guys doing in the corner there? They’re costing a lot of money and they’re – half the time we can’t even log on. You’ve got to be able to prove those actionable insights and the delivery of them to everybody in the company.</p>
<p>I was at a company recently. In the middle of the lobby, they have all sorts of dashboards on big TV screens. And I was happy to see that they’d now added the security dashboards on there as well. So people could see things going to green, lines trending the correct way, traffic lights being the right colour. That’s exactly what we need to do to show people. “Yeah, IT security is doing what it needs to do.”</p>
<p>So if it’s just one thing I have to say, I know I said a lot there, define actionable insights for your business that will improve your security posture and demonstrate that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s where, for instance, it could be in a visible place in the office. Yeah, that’s something that I like the idea of, what we were discussing today. Well, thanks a lot, Ian, for this very interesting conversation. Please let us know how people who would like to continue the conversation with you, how to find you on the net?</p>
<p>Ian: Well, yes. So please reach out to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-yoxall-690184/">LinkedIn profile</a>, it’s an open profile. I’d love to hear from you. Whether you’ve got problems or you want to agree with me or disagree with me, always happy to engage with people. And I’d like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2022 and happy security days out there!</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Ian and for you, Ian, for everybody who is listening there. Happy New Year! Happy New Year 2022 and see you next year.</p>
<p>Ian: Thank you very much, Oscar.</p>

The SEC v. Ripple, a year&nbsp;later <p>About a year ago, the SEC dropped its infamous lawsuit on Ripple just before Christmas and on then SEC Chief Jay Clayton’s last day in&nbsp;office.</p><p>You can check out /gregkidd’s immediate reactions to the lawsuit here — <a href="https://youtu.be/v2gLHm-4qRM">in our first (impromptu) recording of the podcast on Christmas Eve</a>.</p><p>Since then, we’ve seen former MIT professor, CFTC commissioner, and Goldman Sachs alum Gary Gensler take Clayton’s place at the helm of the SEC, but not much has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>Rosalyn Clayton, who’s done <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/">a terrific job covering the lawsuit over the last year</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/12/05/who-will-protect-investors-from-the-sec/?sh=cf77a7f1caec">reported on Gensler and Clayton earlier this&nbsp;month</a>:</p><blockquote>Last Wednesday, the current and previous chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shared what was billed as a “fireside chat” to open the Digital Asset Compliance &amp; Marketing Summit. Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton spoke, took no questions, and agreed that the multi-trillion dollar crypto innovation space is a dark, menacing threat that legitimate crypto entrepreneurs must follow opaque rules or face crippling SEC lawsuits. Gensler made it clear that there is no difference between “fraudsters” and “good-faith actors” in crypto — both are lawbreakers endangering the&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>Many in the audience of crypto industry leaders, just maligned as crooks, were stunned. Gensler repeatedly said that “platforms need to come in and get registered,” as if everyone knew what he was talking about. Perianne Boring, the head of the Digital Chamber of Commerce tweeted, “People in the room are looking around and asking, “register as&nbsp;what?””</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a fair question given that the exchange Coinbase — the only crypto company to have gone public on the stock market — tried “going in”. Upon sharing to share its lending platform information, the SEC slapped Coinbase with a subpoena and the threat of what Gensler affectionately calls “the enforcement tool.”</blockquote><p>And so a year later, the U.S. continues to find itself in murky waters when it comes to regulatory clarity and crypto innovation.</p>  Jay Clayton’s crypto op-ed: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-future-depends-on-blockchain-crypto-bitcoin-payments-transfers-federal-reserve-11639668586?mod=article_inline">Opinion | America’s Future Depends on the Blockchain</a>  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s response: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockchain-crypto-defi-sec-ripple-regulation-lawsuit-access-warren-11640218049">Opinion | Great Potential, Great Obstacles for Blockchain</a>  <p>Some startups such as Open Props have tried to navigate the existing regulatory landscape in earnest — and failed. Here’s <a href="https://ketsal.com/blog/props-for-the-reg-a-reality/">Zachary Fallon’s take on Reg A</a> (via /gregkidd):</p><blockquote>It pains me to say it, but Open Props’ recent announcement of the coming termination of its ongoing Regulation A (“Reg A”) digital asset securities (Props) offering and the cessation of support for its Props Loyalty Program leads me to one stark conclusion:</blockquote><blockquote>While compliant, Reg A is neither a business nor investor friendly or workable regulatory path for cryptocurrency-related companies that intend to offer and sell investment contracts on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</blockquote><p>Jane Street Capital alum Sam Bankman-Fried is one of the rising stars in crypto. His company, FTX, is domiciled in the Bahamas and doesn’t serve U.S. customers.

<p>Happy holidays to the Magic community!</p><p>Since our last product update, we’ve launched a multifaceted set of capabilities that enable you to do more with&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover the latest highlights and improvements.</p> Multi-factor Authentication <p>Developers can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your users! This capability allows customers to add a layer of security to their end-user accounts. This means a secondary factor is validated along with the existing primary factor to log in to an account. Typically, the primary factor is an email, and a secondary factor is a phone number or mobile device authenticator. The idea is that both factors will need to be compromised to breach an&nbsp;account.</p><p>The benefits of enabling MFA&nbsp;include:</p>  MFA reduces the risk of a compromised account or stolen NFTs by requiring users to provide multiple credentials to access their accounts.  It protects users from theft. By requiring multiple authentication methods, MFA adds a layer of security from a stolen laptop or&nbsp;device.  MFA is one of the most straightforward and robust security methods a developer can enable. Magic makes enabling MFA simple with one click in the dashboard.  It helps your users meet regulatory compliance standards. You should enable MFA if your users must meet HIPAA, PCI, or CJIS compliance standards.  <p>Magic offers MFA through mobile authenticator apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. Email and SMS primary factors are currently supported. Magic will add WebAuthn, and social login primary factors support in the future. To get started, head to the dashboard and enable MFA or read more about the integration <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/mfa">here</a>.</p> Custom Email&nbsp;Provider <p>Have you wanted to customize the sender of your email magic link login? With Magic, you can now route emails through your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. Enabling the custom email provider gives you complete control over where your app’s login email is sent from, as well as the name of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>Magic will send email magic links through your SMTP server as soon as you configure the custom email provider. Disabling the custom email provider will restore sending emails from <a href="mailto:noreply@trymagic.com">noreply@trymagic.com</a>. Magic’s custom email provider is compatible with leading SMTP servers. Please visit our <a href="https://magic.link/docs/advanced/customization/custom-smtp">docs</a> for more information on how to get&nbsp;started.</p> Teams <p>We believe when it comes to building great apps, collaboration is critical. That’s why we are introducing Teams. Every Magic developer is given a personal team where you can invite up to two collaborators to help integrate Magic, update branding, or manage your users. As a collaborator, you will have access to any teams you have been invited to and your personal workspace.</p><p>Teams consist of two basic permission levels: a team owner and collaborators. The team owner has complete control over their account and is responsible for billing and managing team members. Collaborators have access to Dashboard functionality to collaborate on any project within the owner’s account. To add members to your project, head to your Magic Dashboard and look for My Team to get&nbsp;started.</p> Magic Login Form: Privacy Policy and Terms of&nbsp;Service <p>Our Magic Login Form enables a developer to integrate passwordless login with just 2 script tags. Seamlessly link to your applications Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and have them shown within the <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">Magic Login Form</a>. to new registering users and returning login users. For more information on embedding a URI, review our script options&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form#script-options">here</a>.</p> SMS Login for&nbsp;SDKs <p>SMS Login support has been expanded to our Mobile, Flutter, iOS, and Android SDKs! This release enables developers to easily integrate SMS Login to their applications on any of the supported platforms.</p> Thank you <p>As 2021 comes to a close, I want to thank you for your support over this last year! At Magic, we are focused on helping our fast-growing developer community solve complex authentication, decentralized identity, and blockchain problems. So I want to invite you to join the Magic community on <a href="https://community.magic.link/">Discord</a>, say hello, share product ideas and help others learn in this technology space.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-december-edition-7a24a3dcd4e4">Magic Product Updates: December Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction? <p>This is the fifth and final blog in our series about the UK Government’s proposals for data protection reform — “Data: A New Direction”. Previous blogs focused on the thinking behind the proposals. This blog summarises what the main proposals are.</p><p>Stated plainly, the UK Government is planning to end data protection rights for UK citizens. Reforms proposed in its paper Data: A New Direction would shift the core operating principle of data protection regulations from citizen protection (that personal data shall only be collected by organisations “for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”) to a new principle that organisations should have the right to build and maintain databases about citizens without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>This Briefing Paper shows how the Government is planning to achieve this radical ‘new direction’ for data. (Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Consultation, around which this ‘New Direction’ pivots are reproduced in the Addendum.)</p> Background <p>The Government is taking the opportunity of Brexit to ‘reform’ data protection law. “Now that we have left the EU, we have the freedom to create a bold new data regime,” says the Minister in his introduction. The stated intention of this “bold new data regime” is to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the UK”. This, to be achieved by creating “​​a better balance between protecting individuals and not impeding responsible data use” [Paragraph 59] — a ‘better balance’ that ends citizen data protection rights in all but name, replacing them with corporate rights&nbsp;instead.</p><p>The Minister’s introduction states that “The protection of people’s personal data must be at the heart of our new regime. Without public trust, we risk missing out on the benefits a society powered by responsible data use has to offer.” But the content of the actual proposals do the opposite.</p> What the law currently says <p>The core principle of existing GDPR data protection regulations is that personal data shall only be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes”.</p><p>A key supporting principle is that of data minimisation: that personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”.</p><p>There are six conditions for the lawful processing of personal data but the two central ones are&nbsp;that:</p>  the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  <p>Conditions for lawful processing envisage situations where “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”. But these legitimate interests come with a ‘balancing test’ to test whether they should be “overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal&nbsp;data”.</p> What the UK Government is proposing <p>On the grounds of addressing ‘consent fatigue’, the Government is proposing to:</p><blockquote>“create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]</blockquote><p>Paragraph 57 adds that “The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate.” But the ‘exhaustive’ list of exceptions to this rule provided in Paragraph 58 is so broad that organisations would have the right to process personal data without individuals’ consent in the vast majority of use cases. In other words, Paragraph 57 renders the safeguard meaningless, leaving it for window dressing&nbsp;only.</p><p>The pivotal clause is Paragraph 58 (i), which makes “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication” a ‘legitimate interest’ where organisations need not seek individuals’ consent for the processing of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This deft wrecking amendment turns the current rule — that personal data should only be processed for specified, explicit purposes — on its head, promoting organisations’ right to collect data about individuals without their consent instead. No limit or restriction to organisations’ right to collect data for their databases is mentioned.</p><p>The rest of the consultation extends the exceptions to cover most uses to which organisations put data, including for research, business innovation, web analytics, AI training, use of cookies, and data sharing. For example, Paragraph 58 (i) is supplemented by Paragraph 58(h) which includes “Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers”. No definition for ‘internal research’ or ‘business innovation’ is provided, making them vague enough for Cambridge Analytica to claim that its activities were entirely&nbsp;lawful.</p><p>Paragraph 58(c) has another exception. “Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems” would now also be a ‘legitimate interest’ where individuals’ consent for data processing is no longer needed. This might seem innocent. Desirable even. But practically speaking, the best way to use data to eliminate the risk of bias is to have as comprehensive and complete a database as possible — which means this clause could (and will) be used by some corporations as good reason to collect all possible data about every individual: it opens the door to total data surveillance. (It is also based on a false premise: that the main cause of bias in AI deployments is lack of access to data. This is not true. The main cause of bias in AI is poor management of the processes for testing and deployment: a people thing, not a data&nbsp;thing.)</p><p>That this is the direction of travel intended by the Government is confirmed by other proposals which include unspecified measures that would “permit organisations to use personal data more freely, subject to appropriate safeguards, for the purpose of training and testing AI responsibly” [Paragraph 81] and to ‘disapply’ individuals’ current right to object to automated processing [Paragraph 48]&nbsp;.</p><p>The Government continues in the same direction with its proposals to reduce ‘consent fatigue’ as it relates to cookies. Paragraph 195 proposes to “permit organisations to use analytics cookies and similar technologies without the user’s consent.” (The term ‘analytics cookies’ is used in a variety of different ways without a single, clear definition.)</p><p>Paragraph 197 would “permit organisations to store information on, or collect information from, a user’s device without their consent for other limited purposes” where ‘other limited purposes’ “could include processing that is necessary for the legitimate interests.” (In other words, the free-for-all created by Paragraph 58).</p><p>Question 2.4.4 simply asks “To what extent do you agree that the requirement for prior consent should be removed for all types of cookies?” Again, a door opener to total data surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile Paragraph 43(b) seeks to expand the grounds for lawful processing of personal data to include ‘research purposes’, with no stipulations on what may be included or not included in the definition of ‘research’.</p> Implications <p>The purpose of these ‘reforms’ seems to be to create a completely ‘free market’ for the trading of UK citizens’ data, without their consent. The Ministerial introduction talks of “secur[ing] the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (Note the word ‘responsible’ again. See&nbsp;below).</p><p>To this end, Paragraph 51(g) (part of an extended discussion on lifting restrictions on the ‘further processing’ of personal data) notes that “Innovative data uses may involve sharing personal data sets between different controllers”. This opens the door to corporations trading peoples’ data without their knowledge and behind their backs. To this end, the Government intends to clarify “When personal data may be re-used by a different controller than the original controller who collected the data, and whether this constitutes further processing.” If this ‘clarification’ is based on the new definition of ‘legitimate interest’, it could make UK citizens’ data a globally traded commodity over which they have no&nbsp;say.</p><p>In sum, the net effect of the new regulations would be to turn data protection regulation on its head, effectively removing all main citizen rights and giving organisations carte blanche to collect and use personal data as they wish, without individuals’ consent, thereby opening the door to unrestricted data surveillance and value extraction. All in the name of ‘innovation and&nbsp;growth’.</p> The regulatory environment <p>As part of this ‘New Direction’ for data, the Government is also seeking to compromise the independence of the regulator — the Information Commissioner’s Office. Key elements of the extended discussion on this subject are the proposals [Paragraph 326] to “place a new duty on it [the ICO] to have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging its functions”.</p><p>The absurdity of this concept becomes apparent if it is applied to other areas of regulatory enforcement. Should the Health and Safety Executive or Trading Standards Officers ‘have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging their functions’, ‘balancing’ the requirements of health and safety and honesty in trading against the ‘needs’ for economic growth? What such rules and regulations do is create boundaries that channel innovation and economic growth in a certain direction: a direction that protects health and safety rather than undermines it.</p><p>Likewise with data protection. When it comes to data, the Government wants to compromise rules and regulations that channel innovation and economic growth in a direction that protects citizens’ data to take the nation in “a new direction” (the title of its Paper) — one that exploits citizens’ data instead. Should the ICO have held back on fines on Cambridge Analytica on the grounds that it was promoting innovation and&nbsp;growth?</p><p>This overt political interference in the enforcement of law is confirmed by [Paragraph 319] which introduces “a power for the Secretary of State for DCMS to prepare a statement of strategic priorities to inform how the ICO sets its own regulatory priorities”.</p> The nature of the consultation process <p>At 146 pages and over 50,000 words of dense, technical (and often obfuscatory) commentary, the consultation seems designed not to be read, the purpose being to hide its true intent, made possible by carefully chosen wrecking amendments that are hidden in a welter of often irrelevant detail. How many people have had the time or energy to read and inwardly digest the full document to grasp its implications?</p><p>One of the stated justifications for the proposals are that current regulations are “unnecessarily complex or vague” and continuing to “cause persistent uncertainty”. Yet the consultation itself is both unnecessarily complex and&nbsp;vague.</p><p>Its use of the word ‘responsible’ is a good example. The consultation highlights the difficulty of defining terms like ‘the public interest’ and has an extended discussion of the meaning of ‘fair processing’, concluding that “Comprehensively defining ‘outcome fairness’ in the context of AI within the data protection regime may [therefore] not be a feasible or effective approach”. But with the word ‘responsible’ it introduces a term new to data protection regulations, using it 52 times&nbsp;… without ever defining&nbsp;it.</p> Rationale for&nbsp;reform <p>The Government’s main justification for these ‘reforms’ (other than to rectify ‘confusion and vagueness’) is to address ‘consent fatigue’ and “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses” thereby “ushering in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the&nbsp;UK”.</p><p>Neither of these justifications stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>‘Consent fatigue’ is mainly caused by the widespread gaming of consent systems, compounded by lax regulator oversight. The problem can be better addressed without any changes to the law, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">as we show&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The ‘innovation and growth’ envisioned by the Government in this Consultation represents a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">deep misunderstanding of what makes data valuable</a>; <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">misconceptions about where the biggest opportunities for innovation</a> lie and how to enable them; and a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and potential of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>In short, because it is intellectually incoherent and flawed, it will not achieve its stated goal: to “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses”. In fact, it is almost certain to do the exact opposite.</p> This blog&nbsp;series <p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Examines common misconceptions about AI, which the Government repeats and uses as justification for its proposed ‘reforms’.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">We Need To Talk About Consent</a> Explains why ‘consent’ to data processing got to be a problem and how to address it — without having to change the&nbsp;law.   Addendum: Paragraphs 57 and 58 in&nbsp;full <p>57. The government therefore proposes to create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent. The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate. For those activities not on the list, the balancing test would still be applied. The balancing test could also be maintained for use of children’s data, irrespective of whether the data was being processed in connection with an activity on the list. The government is mindful that Article 6(1)(f) of the UK GDPR recognises that particular care should be taken when data controllers are relying on the legitimate interests lawful ground to process data relating to children.</p><p>58. Any list would also need to be sufficiently generic to withstand the test of time, although the government envisages it could be updated via a regulation-making power. In that respect, the list would be similar to the approach in Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 for the public tasks processing condition. For example, it could cover processing activities which are necessary for:</p>  Reporting of criminal acts or safeguarding concerns to appropriate authorities  Delivering statutory public communications and public health and safety messages by non-public bodies  Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems (see section 1.5 for further&nbsp;details)  Using audience measurement cookies or similar technologies to improve web pages that are frequently visited by service&nbsp;users  Improving or reviewing an organisation’s system or network&nbsp;security  Improving the safety of a product or service that the organisation provides or&nbsp;delivers  De-identifying personal data through pseudonymisation or anonymisation to to improve data&nbsp;security  Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers  Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 SHR Staking and Swap are coming soon: make sure you’re #ONETHELIST for early access 



<p>Part of our mission at ShareRing is to enable frictionless access. By giving people control of their digital assets, identity, and economic freedom, we empower individuals to engage and move in-and-between industries with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital assets and earnings play a big role in this mission. In the centralised finance environment we exist in, transparency and control of your own assets are highly restricted and monitored. This inability to wholly manage your assets without a third party overseeing all movements impersonates characteristics of distrust and restriction. ShareRing can help overcome this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal">Sign Up Here</a> for your chance to be selected for our pre-release early access.</p>







<p>Today, we’re announcing new features to the ShareRing app, Staking and Swap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking will offer our users the choice to delegate their $SHR to our masternodes, and earn $SHR rewards in return. Staking also helps facilitate the economic security of ShareLedger (our blockchain), ensuring that our ecosystem runs at its optimum level at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal"></a>



<p>Swap has long been a feature in our roadmap. Initially we created $SHR as BEP2, however as we have matured we too see the need to develop a BEP20 token. Although this is still in development, you are now able to swap your $SHR with other ERC20 wallets, as well as those native to ShareLedger.</p>



<p>Available Swaps:</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; SLP3-SHR&nbsp;</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; ERC20-SHR</p>



<p>(SLP3-SHR is ShareToken native to ShareLedger)</p>



<p>Developing Community</p>



<p>Staking and Swap will be core features of ShareRing. With a lively, vibrant, secure community of masternode holders and stakers (delegators), we all share the belief and recognition that ShareRing enables a frictionless digital future, whether it be engaging with businesses, or managing your own digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
