<p>In the wake of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">DWeb Camp</a>, some internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> and <a href="https://press.holo.host/217917-holochain-apps-published-on-holo-network">Holo testing</a>, and other chances to test Holochain in the real world, the Holochain core dev team has been troubleshooting and fixing performance issues in Holochain’s network protocol.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.159: Gossip rate limiting bump <p>Release date: 6 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20, 0.0.21<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148, 0.0.149</p><p>This release optimises a hard-coded rate limit on gossip, bringing it from 0.5mbps for recent data and 0.1mbps for historic data, up to 10mbps for all data, with a burst limit of 1gb in a 10-second window. The burst limit is also now tunable from the conductor config. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1543">#1543</a>)</p><p>You may ask, why was the limit so tiny? Gossip mainly supports the resilience of data, a sort of price you pay for the privilege of participating in a network. We didn’t want it to be too painful, especially for people on slow connections. However, 0.1mbps was a bit too gentle and was preventing large entries from ever being gossiped. We recognise that most people have more spare bandwidth than that, and can even accept occasional spikes in traffic. This change has already improved performance of data-heavy hApps like DevHub.</p><p>There are some other small changes:</p>  Bugfix: Too-large gossip payloads could put the rate limiter into an infinite loop, preventing historical data from being gossiped even with higher bandwidth limits.  The conductor now tries to reconnect to the Lair keystore process, with backoff. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1529">#1529</a>)  The Lair keystore gives out separate TLS certificates to different conductors running on the same machine. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1519">#1519</a>)  All of the HDI and HDK types related to validation have had their members made public. This doesn’t break compatibility with previous HDIs and HDKs; it simply improves autogenerated documentation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1450">#1450</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1452">#1452</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1457">#1457</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1458">#1458</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220907014838">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.160: HDI 0.1.0 <p>Release date: 7 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20 to 0.1.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148 to 0.0.150</p><p>Nothing has changed in this release except a version bump: the <code>hdi</code>, or ‘Holochain Deterministic Integrity’ crate, has gone from version 0.0.x to 0.1.0. This signals that we think it’s made “significant progress towards stabilizing the deterministic integrity layer’s API”, in the words of Stefan, Holochain’s release manager. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1550">#1550</a>)</p><p>This brings us one step closer to putting the 0.1 stamp on the HDK itself (which includes but is broader than the HDI) and calling it stable for coding and validation. Expect a little bit of API churn yet before we hit that <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a> :)</p> Holochain 0.0.161: Gossip bug fix <p>Release date: 8 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20 to 0.1.1<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148 to 0.0.151</p><p>Bugfix: This release continues gossip reliability, fixing a bug in which a node can prematurely end a gossip round even if there’s more to be gossiped. This bug led to persistent timeouts between nodes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1553">#1553</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.162: Cell cloning part 1 <p>Release date: 13 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152</p><p>This release brings a long-awaited feature: the ability to ‘clone’ a cell. In Holochain, a DNA can be cloned, which results in an agent running multiple cells within the same hApp, each spawned from the DNA. Each of these cells has its own DHT, thanks to a different network seed which changes the DNA hash. This lets you create many separate public or private spaces that share the same functionality. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1547">#1547</a>)</p><p>The new conductor API call that supports this is called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.CreateCloneCell"><code>create_clone_cell</code></a>, found in the app API, and it <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.56/holochain_types/app/struct.CreateCloneCellPayload.html">takes</a> the installed app ID, the role of the cell to be cloned, a new network seed, properties, and origin time, and optionally a membrane proof and cell name. (Note: the network seed, properties, and origin time are all optional and are contained in a struct called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.56/holochain_types/prelude/struct.DnaPhenotypeOpt.html"><code>DnaPhenotypeOpt</code></a>. However, these properties become part of the parent object in their serialised form, making <code>DnaPhenotypeOpt</code> disappear. We realise this is surprising and undocumented, and we’re working on a clearer approach. So be aware that there will probably be breaking changes soon.)</p><p>Here are the rest of the changes:</p>  Breaking (host API): You can now order results in a chain query descending (newest to oldest); the default is still ascending (oldest to newest). <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.152/hdk/prelude/struct.ChainQueryFilter.html">ChainQueryFilter</a></code> has <code>.ascending()</code> and <code>.descending()</code> convenience functions in its builder API. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1539">#1539</a>)  Breaking (conductor admin API): The <code>add_records</code> API endpoint has been changed to <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.59/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.GraftRecords"><code>graft_records</code></a>, with modified functionality. You probably won’t have used this endpoint unless you’re working on a source chain backup or replication service, but just in case! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1538">#1538</a>)  New (app API): The <code>app_info</code> endpoint now includes cloned cells. This is a non-breaking change; they just show up in the existing <code>cell_data</code> field of the response. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1547">#1547</a>)  Removed (conductor config): Legacy Lair keystore config options have been removed. These options have been non-functional for a while. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1571">#1571</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220914013149">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.163: Maintenance <p>Release date: 21 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152, 0.0.153</p><p>This is a small release:</p>  Bugfix: A rare ‘Arc is not quantizable’ panic is now a warning. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1577">#1577</a>)  Breaking (Sweettest): If you use Sweettest, the Rust-based testing framework, some of the functionality that deals with inline zome has been changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1575">#1575</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220921145054">changelog</a>.</p> Known issues   There are still some reliability and performance issues with gossiping, especially for large entries.   Very rarely, the WebSocket for the conductor admin API will close.  The JavaScript and Rust clients haven’t been updated for the changes in the conductor APIs.   Future breaking change warning <p>Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#how-to-secure-functions-against-unauthorized-use">capability-based security model</a> means that all zome calls need to be authenticated by a valid capability. So far, the conductor has been giving a free pass to zome calls made by clients via the WebSocket app API, treating them as equivalent to the ‘author’ capability. But in the future, these zome calls will all need to supply their own capability.</p><p>For the most part, this won’t be a hassle. If you mean for your hApp to be hosted in the Launcher or the Holo hosting network, it’ll all be taken care of behind the scenes. The only remaining scenario is UIs that access Holochain over WebSocket ports, which will probably use some sort of UI password to authenticate. We’ll give details about refactoring your hApp when the time comes.</p> Holochain Launcher release notes  Launcher 0.6.0: Large hApps in DevHub <p>Release date: 14 September 2022</p><p>This release adds support for Holochain 0.0.162, which includes the cumulative bugfixes for gossip of large entries. This means that hApps in the DevHub are more likely to be accessible when you try to download and install them.</p><p>Here are the rest of the changes:</p>  Support for everything before Holochain 0.0.162 / HDI 0.1.1 / HDK 0.0.152 has been dropped.  The database is now encrypted at rest. This means that databases created with older versions of the Launcher are incompatible with the new one; you’ll need to create a new key and reinstall all your hApps.  Compatibility with Ubuntu Linux 22.04 has been improved.  There have been various bugfixes and UX improvements.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.6.0">changelog</a>.</p> Launcher 0.6.1: Debugging improvements <p>Release date: 21 September 2022</p><p>This release adds niceties for people who are debugging Holochain or hApps; custom conductors are now distinguished from built-in ones in the log, and other error messages and pieces of info are clearer.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.6.1">Read the full changelog and download the latest installer</a>!</p> hREA hits major milestone release <p><a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a>, the project that implements the <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a> economic vocabulary as a set of Holochain libraries, has hit its Sapling release, version <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/releases/tag/happ-0.1.0-beta">0.1.0-beta</a>. Connor, Pegah, and Wes at <a href="https://sprillow.com">Sprillow</a> have completed the work that they believe was necessary to help hREA get to a state that developers can start hacking hApps with, submitting feedback on, and building a community around. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA">code</a>, read the excellent <a href="https://docs.hrea.io/">documentation</a>, and join the <a href="https://discord.gg/um4UsxdFDk">Discord</a> server to get developing. We’ll be sharing more details about this project and the ValueFlows economic vocabulary in a few weeks.</p> Holochain In Action: IOEN and energy gamification <p>In this week’s Holochain in Action video, Philip Beadle of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">IOEN</a> demos how he’s using the Unity 3d game engine to run IOEN-powered community microgrid simulations. His tool lets you see how energy-independent your community may or may not be, given a certain amount of solar and power storage. You can also tweak settings and see how your community fares better, get a breakdown of individual houses’ revenue and costs, and even deploy an actual Holochain-powered IOEN network for all of the houses.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@beemagic275?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyTex">Nguyễn Phúc</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/secrets?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

On top of that, an increasing number of crypto hacks and rug pulls and a considerable drop in the global digital market cap added fire to the&nbsp;fury.</p><p>Speaking of hacks, the most notable one that irked the US regulators was a $625 million Ronin Bridge attack, reportedly carried out by a North Korean group known as&nbsp;Lazarus.</p> A Series of&nbsp;Actions <p>What followed next were a series of strict measures by the US government and authorities, the most notable one being the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s sanctions against Tornado Cash, popular crypto mixing service. Recently, the OFAC also <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1570442274039042055?t=9j5gCmxuk8AXLPsyrrj7Sg&amp;s=19">released FAQs</a> in relation to its sanctions against Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><blockquote>Despite these tough measures, the White House has indicated that although they are concerned about the misuse of cryptocurrencies by malicious elements, they want to “foster responsible digital asset innovation” with the first-of-its-kind digital assets framework. This is also significant as it comes after President Biden issued an executive order in March this year on the oversight of crypto&nbsp;assets.</blockquote> Covering NFTs&nbsp;Too <p>The report urges the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “aggressively pursue” investigations as well as enforcement actions against unlawful practices in the crypto space. In addition, it has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to double their efforts to monitor consumer complaints and enforce against unfair practices.</p><p>Moreover, there are plans to call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act to explicitly apply to digital asset service providers, including exchanges and NFT platforms.</p><p>The US Treasury is also set to complete an illicit finance risk assessment on DeFi by February 2023 and an evaluation on NFTs by July&nbsp;2023.</p> Providing Guidance <p>The Office of Science and Technology Policy and NSF will be tasked with developing a Digital Assets Research and Development Agenda.</p><p>The framework meanwhile encourages the Department of Treasury (DOT) and regulators to provide entities in the crypto space with guidance, best-practice information, and technical assistance.</p><p>Janet Yellen, the US Secretary of the Treasury, said that the reports clearly identify the risks and challenges associated with the usage of digital assets for financial services.</p><blockquote>So, “if these risks are mitigated, digital assets and other emerging technologies could offer significant opportunities,” she&nbsp;added.</blockquote><p>According to her, all the reports on digital assets and their recommendations provide a “strong foundation for policymakers” to realize their potential benefits while minimizing the&nbsp;risks.</p> Advocating for a Digital&nbsp;Dollar <p>As for a digital dollar, the Biden administration said a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could “offer significant benefits” to the US financial system. Besides being environmentally sustainable, facilitating faster cross-border transactions, promoting financial inclusion, and fostering economic growth, the White House said, a US CBDC could also help bolster its status as a global leader and support the effectiveness of sanctions.</p><p>The assessment was part of a wide-ranging report on digital assets following the executive order issued earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>A Treasury Department report published last week on the future of money and payments also advocated for a CBDC, noting a “natural use case” for&nbsp;them.</blockquote> Industry concerns <p>Although many from the industry welcomed the White House’s comprehensive framework on digital assets, some criticized it, noting its overt focus on the risks of digital assets, pretty much ignoring all the benefits it&nbsp;offers.</p><p>For instance, Binance’s CZ appreciated the framework, tweeting, “It’s great to see the US moving towards a proposed crypto framework. Getting it right will help protect consumers, markets and spark responsible innovation.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1570900731506589696">Image Source</a>)<p>He believes federal regulation will benefit the industry compared to the “current patchwork of state laws and regulations that govern this&nbsp;space.”</p><p>Cameron Winklevoss, on the other hand, believes that the framework fails to capture the potential and opportunities that the digital assets landscape presents.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1572245036124831752?s=20&amp;t=ub4apm6OCfnHZsj6xFpImQ">Image Source</a>)<p>He believes that it focuses too much on the risks that cryptocurrencies pose. Instead, he believes, the focus should have been on providing clear “Rules of the Road” over the current “Regulation by Enforcement” approach.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1570761113347977219?s=20&amp;t=ub4apm6OCfnHZsj6xFpImQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Some experts also called out the framework over its anti-Proof-of-Work stance and naming all things crypto as a scam or a&nbsp;threat.</p><p>So, what do you think about this comprehensive framework for digital assets?

 Earn by locking OCEAN and by Curating Quality Data. 482M OCEAN Available in&nbsp;Rewards  1. Overview <p>veOCEAN launches Mon Sep 26. Data Farming (DF) will resume immediately after.</p><p>You can lock OCEAN, to get veOCEAN, for as little as one week or as long as 4 years. The longer you lock your OCEAN, the more veOCEAN you get. The amount of OCEAN you receive when the lock ends will always be equal to the amount you locked; plus there will be rewards in the meantime.</p><p>⚠️ veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. If you’ve locked some OCEAN for a year, you can’t unlock it during that time, nor can you decrease the lock&nbsp;time.⚠️</p><p>As a veOCEAN holders, you get passive rewards by default. And, if you actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), then you can earn more. This is the DF&nbsp;aspect.</p><p>DF now has 481.8M OCEAN allocated. This is an increase from before, via an OceanDAO evolution towards automation.</p><p>Typical APYs will likely be 5–10%, but may be as high as 125% and as low as 1.5%. APYs will vary week to week. The value depends on total OCEAN staked and other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>veOCEAN uses <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a>’s veCRV contracts, which have been battle-tested over two&nbsp;years.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 has key dates. Section 3 describes veOCEAN. Section 4 describes Data Farming. Section 5 describes the evolution of OceanDAO. Section 6 is a walk-through of OCEAN release schedule and possibly APYs. Section 7 discusses security. Section 8 concludes.</p> 2. Key&nbsp;dates   Mon Sep 26: veOCEAN goes live. You can lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">df.oceandao.org</a> (linked from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean homepage</a>)  Thu Sep 29: Counting for DF resumes. As the previous DF round was DF4 (week 4), counting will start for&nbsp;DF5.  Thu Oct 6: First ve rewards distribution to veOCEAN holders available. Rewards = DF5 payout + cut of Ocean fees. DF6 counting&nbsp;starts.  Thu Oct 13: Next ve distribution: DF6 payout + cut of fees; DF7 counting&nbsp;starts.  Thu Oct 13: Next ve distribution: DF7 payout + cut of fees; DF8 counting starts. And so on, for each&nbsp;week.  <p>DF will follow phases as before. When it resumes, it will be with a new “DF/VE Alpha” phase for 4 weeks. “DF Beta” and “DF Main” phases will follow, as previously targeted. Details are below. As the first phase is alpha, the process may be rough at the beginning; we will iteratively improve this over weeks and months as we evolve from alpha to beta to&nbsp;main.</p><p>veOCEAN holders can claim their rewards distribution via the webapp, or smart contracts directly.</p> 3. Details:&nbsp;veOCEAN  3.1 veOCEAN&nbsp;Overview <p>veOCEAN will operate as described in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing veOCEAN</a>”. This section gives the highlights.</p><p>ve tokens have been introduced by several projects such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a> and <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a>. These tokens require users to lock project tokens in return for ve&lt;project tokens&gt;.</p><p>In exchange for locking tokens, users can earn rewards. The amount of reward depends on how long the tokens are locked for. Furthermore, veTokens can be used for voting in grants DAOs or for asset curation.</p><p>We are rolling out veOCEAN to give token holders the ability to lock OCEAN to earn yield, curate data, and [eventually] vote on OceanDAO proposals.</p><p>People can lock their OCEAN up to 4 years to get veOCEAN. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>veOCEAN supports passive locking of OCEAN by default. Users can get higher yield by active curation of data assets in the DF&nbsp;setting.</p> 3.2 veOCEAN Core&nbsp;Idea <p>The core idea is: lock OCEAN for longer for higher rewards and more voting power. A locker can be passive, though they earn more if&nbsp;active.</p><p>You receive proportionally more veOCEAN for longer lock times, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 week → get 0.0048 veOCEAN = 1 / (4 *&nbsp;52)  …  lock 1 OCEAN for 1 year → get 0.25&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 2 years → get 0.50&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 3 year → get 0.75&nbsp;veOCEAN  lock 1 OCEAN for 4 years → get 1.0&nbsp;veOCEAN  <p>Critically, veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. If you’ve locked some OCEAN for a year, you can’t unlock it during that time. Your veOCEAN balance decays linearly over time; the amount of OCEAN you’ll receive when the lock ends will always be equal to the amount you&nbsp;locked.</p><p>You can always extend your lock time or the lock amount. But, lock time can not decreased.</p><p>veOCEAN is non-transferable. You can’t send it to&nbsp;others.</p> 3.3 veOCEAN&nbsp;Earnings <p>veOCEAN holders have earnings from two&nbsp;sources:</p>  Community fees. Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants, etc. All earnings here are&nbsp;passive.  Data Farming: veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF Crunch. For DF rewards, veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if active. “Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely&nbsp;locked.)  <p>All earnings for veOCEAN holders are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. (Data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon,&nbsp;etc.)</p><p>There’s a new DF round every week; in line with this, there’s a new ve distribution “epoch” every week. This affects when you can first claim rewards. Specifically, if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first ve epoch that begins after day x+7. Put another way, from the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. (This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">Here’s the code.</a>&nbsp;)</p> 3.6 Flow of&nbsp;Value <p>The image below illustrates the flow of value. On the left, at time 0, the user locks their OCEAN into the veOCEAN contract, and receives veOCEAN. In the middle, the veOCEAN holder receives OCEAN rewards every time there’s revenue to the Ocean Protocol Community (top), and also as part of DF rewards (bottom). On the right, when the lock expires (e.g. 4 years) then the user is able to move all their OCEAN around&nbsp;again.</p>Flow of&nbsp;value 4. Details: Data&nbsp;Farming  4.1 DF&nbsp;Overview <p>DF incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to veOCEAN holders who curate towards data assets with high consume volume. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>DF will operate as described in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>”, with a key change: “staking” now means allocating veOCEAN to data assets, rather than LPing into data pools. And veOCEAN means OCEAN is locked for up to four years. Since it doesn’t involve pools (AMMs), there is no risk of impermanent loss. DF now supports fixed-price assets, and free assets (where “price” = gas cost to consume).</p><p>The rest of this section gives the highlights from the&nbsp;post.</p> 4.2 DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>DF has these&nbsp;phases:</p>  [completed] DF Alpha. Counting started Thu June 16, 2022. 10K OCEAN rewards were budgeted per week. Rewards were distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It ran 4&nbsp;weeks.  [new] DF/VE Alpha. Counting starts Thu Sep 29,2022. 10K OCEAN rewards are budgeted per week. Rewards are distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It runs 4 weeks. The aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.  DF Beta. Counting starts Thu Oct 27, 2022. Rewards are up to 100K OCEAN per week. It runs up to 20 weeks. The aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.  DF Main. Immediately follows DF Beta. Rewards are up to 1.6M OCEAN per week. It runs for decades; at least 481.8M OCEAN total is committed.   4.3 DF Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The reward going to a veOCEAN holder for a given Ocean data asset depends on the amount of veOCEAN they allocated to the asset, and how much that asset is being consumed ($ volume). Reward&nbsp;is:</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where</p>  Sij is amount of veOCEAN that user i has allocated to asset&nbsp;j  Cj is data consume volume for asset j, in&nbsp;$  veOCEAN holders receive rewards pro-rata according to&nbsp;RFij  <p>For priced data, consume volume = Cj = ($ price of asset) x (number of consumes of the asset in the week). DF now handles free data as well, where gas fees act as “price”: Cj = ($ gas paid at time of consume) x (number of consumes of the&nbsp;asset).</p><p>The higher the consume volume, the more the rewards. The more veOCEAN allocated, the more the&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>For a given week, OCEAN rewarded is bounded by the OCEAN budget, and keeping APY ≤&nbsp;125%.</p><p>This is the reward function for the next DF round (DF5). Based on learnings, we can expect it to evolve in rounds that follow DF6, DF7,&nbsp;etc.</p> 4.3 Data Assets that&nbsp;Qualify <p>Data assets that have veOCEAN allocated towards them get DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The data asset may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data. The data asset may be fixed price or free price. If fixed price, any token of exchange is alright (OCEAN, H2O, USDC,&nbsp;..).</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data asset must also&nbsp;:</p>  Have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">production networks</a>  Visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   4.4 Data Farming&nbsp;Q&amp;A <p>Q: I staked for just one day. What rewards might I&nbsp;expect?</p><p>At least 50 snapshots are randomly taken throughout the week. If you’ve staked just one day, and all else being equal, you should expect 1/7 the rewards compared to the full 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q: The datatoken price may change throughout the week. What price is taken in the DCV calculation?</p><p>The price is taken at the same time as each consume. E.g. if a data asset has three consumes, where price was 1 OCEAN when the first consume happened, and the price was 10 OCEAN when the other consumes happened, then the total DCV for the asset is 1 + 10 + 10 =&nbsp;21.</p><p>Q: Can the rewards function change during a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>No. At the beginning of a new DF round (DF1, DF2, etc), rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules. This is: rewards function, bounds, etc. Then teams stake, buy data, consume, etc. And LPs are given DF rewards based on staking, DCV, etc at the end of the week. Overall cycle time is one&nbsp;week.</p><p>Caveat: it’s no at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus, or a&nbsp;bug.</p> 5. Evolution of&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>With veOCEAN, OceanDAO evolves to be more like <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">CurveDAO</a>:</p>  ve is at the heart with v = voting (in OceanDAO grants) and e = escrowed (locked) OCEAN. The longer the lockup, the more voting and rewards, which reconciles near- and long-term DAO incentives.  The DAO has increased bias to automation, and to minimizing the governance attack surface. The 143.8M OCEAN that was originally earmarked for a DAO treasury will go into DF instead. And, 122.3M OCEAN earmarked for grants will go to DF (&gt;21.5M OCEAN remains for grants). This is on top of 215.7M OCEAN previously allocated&nbsp;. Therefore DF now has 481.8M OCEAN allocated; this is 34.2% of total OCEAN supply (1.41B&nbsp;OCEAN).   6. Walk-Through Numbers <p>This section walks through example numbers. It’s basically the same as in the previous <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">DF launch pos</a>t, because DF/VE Alpha phase has the same parameters as the previous DF Alpha&nbsp;phase.</p><p>The first subsection describes OCEAN disbursement with the most aggressive possible schedule; the subsection after describes a conservative schedule. The likely scenario is somewhere in between. A third subsection describes possible&nbsp;APYs.</p> 6.1 OCEAN Schedule with Aggressive Ramp <p>Here’s a scenario that goes through DF the most aggressively: DF Beta takes 10 weeks and emits 100K OCEAN per week, and each multiplier in DF Main time takes 0 time (goes to 100% multiplier immediately). All plots are computed from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=0">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>The image below shows the first half-year for the aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is OCEAN released each week. It’s log-scaled to easily see the differences. The x-axis is time, measured in weeks. Week 0 is Oct 6, 2022. We can see the distinct phases for DF/VE Alpha, DF Beta, then DF&nbsp;Main.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 0.5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below is like the previous one, but now shows for the first five years. DF Main starts at week 14 with full-blown OCEAN emissions. Recall that DF Main emission follows a Bitcoin-style curve where the rewards decrease according to an exponential with a 4-year half-life. With each DM main multiplier taking 0 time, it means that half of all the DF Main rewards are distributed in its first 4&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN released by DF for aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, aggressive ramp 6.2 OCEAN Schedule with Conservative Ramp <p>Here the opposite-extreme scenario, having a highly conservative ramp of DF rewards. DF/VE Alpha runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over four weeks. DF Beta runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over 20 weeks. DF Main starts at the 10% multiplier, transitions to 25% at 12 months, to 50% at 18 months, and to 100% at 24 months. The image below shows the first five&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, conservative ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN emitted for DF. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on.

This would result from a combination of conservative OCEAN emissions schedule (parameters from above), and higher community rate of OCEAN staking.

				<p>When my co-founder Tomislav applied to move to a new apartment, they requested his personal information to prove he would be eligible and able to pay rent. He sent in photographs of his government ID, marriage certificate, bank statements, and more. Someone at the rental agency tried to take his information and withdraw his life’s savings from his bank account.<br><br>At Trinsic we’re obsessed with creating a new paradigm that allows people to share personal information in a convenient and privacy-preserving manner. <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable credentials</a> make this possible, but people are just beginning to understand what VCs are and what they enable. This post will examine the world of verifiable credentials and answer a number of common questions that people have when exploring the space of decentralized identity.</p>

				<p>Both NFTs and verifiable credentials have attracted people who are interested in the future of digital identity, so we’re doing a deep dive on the benefits and drawbacks of both technologies.<br><br></p><p>First, a definition for Identity:<br><br></p>  Identity = identifiers + attributes  <p><br>Here’s what this equation has looked like over time:<br><br></p>  Physical example: name (identifier) + hair color, height, occupation (attributes)  Web2 example: username or email (identifier) + profile picture, bio, posts (attributes)  Web3 example: Public cryptocurrency wallet address (identifier) + NFTs and tokens you hold (attributes)  Decentralized identity example: DID address (identifier) + verifiable credentials (attributes)

				<p>Verifiable credentials are data containers for personal information.

While shipping containers revolutionized the world, they also don’t seem very revolutionary to the average person. The same thing goes for how our data flows online.<br><br>Verifiable credentials standardize the format of information allowing you to own your data and selectively share it with relevant parties across the internet. Instead of hosting information in siloes that only interact through API integrations, VCs put the power back in your own hands.</p>

				<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are unique representations of an asset on a blockchain, like Ethereum or Solana. NFTs can be bought and sold in marketplaces like OpenSea and Magic Eden. Thus far, NFTs have frequently been speculative “assets” used to represent community memberships, profile pictures, art, metaverse land, and more. NFTs are blockchain-specific, so a token that is on the Ethereum blockchain cannot be transferred to the Solana blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to own your data, making the process of sharing your data easier and more privacy-preserving. For example, sharing verifiable credentials could make the process of applying for an apartment easier. The purpose of checking documentation like bank statements and identity documents is to prove that you are who you say you are, and you can be trusted to pay rent. Currently, you have to show documentation and identification to each individual vendor you’re applying to. Instead, imagine that you held credentials in a digital wallet that could provide assurances about your identity and trustworthiness to pay rent.<br><br>Rather than sharing all of your personal information with each apartment vendor, you could share a cryptographic proof that you can pay rent. Concretely, what would be needed to make this a reality would be a trusted issuer, like a bank, who already has access to your financial history and could issue you a credential verifying that you’re able to pay monthly rent up to a certain amount each month. Now, instead of sharing documentation with the apartment vendor, you can instead share the credential and the apartment vendor can verify its legitimacy. The result is a more privacy-preserving system for sharing personal information.</p>

				<p>We’re seeing NFTs used primarily as a form of purchasable membership pass, allowing people special access to channels in a Discord server or to exclusive parties at events like NFT NYC. People also use NFTs as profile pictures and social signals on platforms like Twitter. NFTs could also be used in video games, allowing people to own in-game assets and monetize in new ways. Additionally, there are people selling their digital art as NFTs, giving them access to a worldwide audience of potential collectors.<br><br>NFTs facilitate the seamless buying and selling of digital assets. Because they are closely tied with blockchains, and often associated with speculative value, NFTs are inherently financial. Anyone can make an “offer” on an NFT that you own. You pay fees to buy or even transfer NFTs on most blockchains.</p>

				<p>NFTs are associated with static, public wallet addresses. So if I were to share my wallet address, you would be able to view every NFT that I own and have ever owned. This is beneficial for displaying your collection but has obvious downsides for privacy. Public wallet addresses are not a great place to store your private data.<br><br>Verifiable credentials are associated with <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>. VCs are not publicly viewable but instead are selectively shared with verifying parties as needed. You can have a VC issued to your wallet without the whole internet knowing. While you can make your DID public, which is very useful if you are issuing and signing credentials as a trusted authority, you can also rotate DIDs as a user interacting with different vendors.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Role of Cryptographic Signatures 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Since NFTs are associated with public addresses, you can easily check if someone’s wallet address holds a certain asset. The importance of cryptographic signatures is to prove that you are the person who is in control of the wallet. For example, if you go to an event and you are only allowed in if you hold a certain NFT, you will have to cryptographically sign a message from the wallet that holds the NFT to prove you’re the real owner.<br><br>When dealing with verifiable credentials, it’s not publicly known which VCs are associated with which DIDs. If you needed to hold a certain credential to enter an event, the vendor would request a cryptographic proof that you hold the required credential. You would then have the option to share the credential with that vendor, and they can check the legitimacy of the proof. Your information would only be shared with the event host and would otherwise remain encrypted and private to you.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 How Blockchain Relates to NFTs and VCs 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>NFTs are minted on specific blockchains, establishing a unique identifying address and a link to the digital asset. When transferred, NFTs must pay ledger fees to move them on their specific blockchain. NFTs are moved from public address to public address in easily trackable transactions. Blockchains are required and used for any minting and transferring of an NFT.<br><br>In comparison, verifiable credentials are issued to digital wallets, where the credentials are stored and can only be accessed by the wallet owner. Verifiable credentials are not tracked by their movement on a blockchain, and you would have no way of knowing another user received a verifiable credential, or if they presented a credential to a third party. Blockchains are not required for exchanging verifiable credentials, but layer-2 networks like Ion, built on top of Bitcoin, can provide an additional level of security when creating DIDs.</p>

				<p>NFTs are great for public and transferrable digital assets. Blockchains allow you to show that a specific wallet address owns a digital item. For example, we know that the owner of <a href="https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/5822">Cryptopunk #5822</a> is the Ethereum address 0xe648730be51893acd0045522a0830ec5399ae74c. This is great for showcasing a collection of things like art and membership passes. For this reason, NFTs can help to establish your reputation publicly as a collector, investor, community member, or donor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NFTs also provide a monetization strategy for artists, designers, and community builders, allowing them to tap into a global, decentralized market. The combination of public display and financial speculation has created viral marketing loops, leading to a large interest in NFTs over the past two years.</p>

				<p>You would not want to represent identifying documents as NFTs. You cannot “prove” claims about yourself such as “I am 21 years old” using an NFT. Even if the US government issued everyone an ID card NFT, you could sell it.</p>
<p><br>Note: It is possible to turn off the “transferability” function in a non-fungible token contract. These assets are often referred to as “Soul Bound Tokens” (SBTs) which means they are forever tied to a specific public wallet address. SBTs have more potential for use in an identity context but risk making private information like your date of birth and address public.</p>
<p>Since NFTs are tied to blockchains, you incur fees when transferring them. Thus, if you were to issue tickets to an event as NFTs, you would have an additional cost of paying fees to send the tickets to every attendee’s address. You’re also tied to the speed of that blockchain to complete the transfer of the ticket.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Key Benefits of VCs in Digital Identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Verifiable credentials are stored privately in a way that doesn’t save any personal information to a public blockchain. You can selectively share information with relying parties without leaking it to the entire internet. VCs do not have to be tied to a blockchain and can be faster and more scalable for implementing in the real world. Thanks to DIDs and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, it’s possible for VCs to be interoperable across different blockchains and even web2 environments. Lastly, VCs are non-transferrable nor purchasable, so you will not run into the issue of someone selling their government-issued ID.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>While privacy and a lack of financial speculation are two huge benefits of using verifiable credentials in digital identity, both factors have limited the social reach and virality of the concept. Search volumes for NFTs are several orders of magnitude higher than for verifiable credentials. When you hear about someone selling an NFT for $10,000 profit, you are likely to look into what’s going on and spend some time understanding the technology.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Both NFTs and VCs provide new approaches to trust digital information. NFTs allow you to publicly prove that you are the unique owner of a digital asset, whereas VCs allow you to privately prove the legitimacy of a claim made over the internet. At their best, both technologies create new avenues for digital coordination that are more humane, efficient, and user-centric.<br><br>The future of digital identity will be determined by builders, developers, designers, community builders, and dreamers.

				  The pandemic fundamentally changed the architecture of cyber security— now organizations must adapt to survive and eventually thrive  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Dr. Chase Cunningham Ph.D&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine a wall with a gate. The gate allows you to monitor and decide who you let inside the wall. It’s somewhat effective at achieving these ends. Some people climb over, some tunnel under, and some fake their way inside with stolen access credentials. Improbably, some allegedly managed to get inside one of these walls hidden in a big wooden horse. It happened in Troy, remember that?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Troy was our first proof of failure of a perimeter-based security model, and it happened in 1184 B.C. We have known for a long time, over a millenia, that this model is doomed to fail. Yet when it came to protecting digital assets, all we did was take a failed physical approach, digitized it, and expected to do better than the Trojans.&nbsp; Wow, were we wrong.</p>
<p>If I labor this point, it’s because the digital walls we have built&nbsp; now have thousands of gates: one for every employee, one for every employee device&nbsp;— maybe even one for every cloud application. Working from home during the global pandemic turned the wall into a sieve, everywhere, all at once, that operates at the speed of light (literally).</p>
<p>The wall has fallen and isn’t coming back. It’s not simply that hybrid work environments blew it up, it’s that the rapid pace of digitalization makes it impossible to rebuild. The expansion, every day, of digital services and e-commerce shows that we, collectively, want the convenience, efficiency, and opportunity of a more digitized life. Businesses require speed and dynamism, users want security and ease of use anywhere at any time, and global connectivity demands that we interoperate and optimize now, not later.</p>
<p>The sooner we realize that we need some “post-wall” thinking about security, the sooner we’ll be able to deal with the exponential growth in attacks on company and organizational infrastructure. If we accept that we are now living in a digitalized society, we need to start by acknowledging some new ground rules:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 People are not going to magically become security experts. You can train your workforce to be cyber aware, but all it takes is one person to click on a malicious link for your company to be phished. Training may reduce the odds, but not to zero. That we see phishing attacks work over and over again demands that we accept human nature as it is and not how we’d like it to be.. 
 

 
 People will seek the most convenient process. We are energy misers. The course of action most likely to be taken will be the one that requires the least amount of effort. So, while various forms of multi-factor authentication may increase security, they also increase cognitive burden and annoyance. We have to make security simple—a part of the architecture.<br>
. 
 Employees are not going to want to submit their personal devices for securitization. Putting security and surveillance software on all the devices your employee is likely to interact with is going to be challenging and likely impossible, for practical, privacy -related, and political reasons. People don’t want their employers to have access to and control of their personal mobile devices.<br>
. 
 We already have physical means of verifying and validating “who” a person is and “what” they are trying to do (ever boarded an aircraft since 9/11?). We should be able to apply that same methodology and metric into today’s digitized systems and not make people suffer through a network-enabled TSA. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What then is the answer</p>
<p>If the wall has been dissolved or, at the very least, rendered useless by a thousand gates, then everything must be verified everywhere continuously because the gates are now everywhere. And the only way to do this easily, effectively, and inexpensively is through using solutions like verifiable credentials coupled with a security technology stack that removes friction while increasing adoption and use.&nbsp; This is applied to the user and doesn’t rely on them to adopt any additional solutions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials make trust in identity and data portable, because the process of creating a verifiable credential means that the integrity of the transaction and the integrity of any information that transaction contains is guaranteed by a combination of decentralized identifiers, decentralized ledgers, cryptographic signatures, and biometric interfaces with mobile devices. To put it simply, using verifiable credentials means we know the “who” and “what” and are able to validate that there is a reason for an action to occur.&nbsp; We don’t just allow a connection because of a username and password —and we don’t enable default connectivity because a firewall rule says “allow all”.</p>
<p>These technologies allow trust to be triangulated between the issuer of a credential, the entity holding the credential, and the validator verifying the credential. And when the integrity of a verifiable credential is verified, the information associated with it is immediately actionable.</p>
<p>A critical feature of decentralized identity is that it enables the separation of form from content. It’s the form in which digital information is held that makes the&nbsp; information verifiable. This has huge implications: It removes the need to store critical data or personally identifiable information in a centralized database as part of the verification process as the nature of that validation triangulation is distributed from the start. All data is tied to its owner and shared in privacy-preserving ways over uniquely encrypted communications channels.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential replaces a login and password, and verification is instant and device agnostic. There is no “one ring to rule them all” that is the single point of failure in this model. If we take other security technologies and apply them to build out the security posture of the entities tied to that validated and verified credential, the rising tide of a better security position does finally raise all ships.</p>
<p>As the perimeter defenses of a billion digital entities dissolve, we can see online interaction as a much more open environment where information can move much more freely; that’s what the internet is for. It was designed for that very purpose, it was not built to be secure. But with today’s technologies applied in innovative but natural ways, we can operate in a secure and optimized manner. The only way to make this digital reality work is to accept that the old security architecture failed all of us and is never coming back. Thankfully.</p>
<p>The way we get better is to accept that reality and build our future to look the way that the internet was meant to operate. Distributed, diverse, adaptable, dynamic, and integrated with our physical selves.</p>

Our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise</a> is a web based platform which includes a cloud wallet, connection management system, verifiable credential issuance &amp; verification tools and more.</p>
<p>By using our products, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Today, let us show you how our NB Orbit Enterprise Presentation Proposals function allows an Organizational Holder to send a proposal to a verifier entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows an organization to initiate the workflow rather than waiting on a verifier to send a proof request. We have implemented the orchestration provided by <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>&nbsp;to enable all this to happen.</p>
 
    
 
<p>We’ve written a blog post about why credential issuance should be holder-driven (<a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">here</a>). We think that the same is true for verifications and other functions.<br>
<br>
The steps are the following:</p>
 
 The Proposal is sent by the Prover (your organization) 
 The Verifier can be automatically sent back a proof request to the Prover (this is configurable) 
 The Prover clicks on Proof Request and selects a credential to provide in the proof presentation. The Prover can add self-attested attributes if they wish. 
 The Verifier then receives the Proof Presentation (in Verification Monitoring if they are using NB Orbit Enterprise)

 Introduction <p>In 2022, a total of $2 billion has been already lost in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space as a result of scams and hacks. Centralized crypto platforms attempt to provide users with security features like account passwords and 2-factor authentication to secure their funds. However, the control of users’ crypto wallets and private keys still remains with the company. </p><p>This is the reason why you are hearing when centralized crypto lending platforms going bankrupt because they are taking users’ funds with them. With a custodial wallet, another party controls your private keys and most custodial wallets these days are web-based exchange wallets.</p><p>This is why we always say in crypto:<br></p><blockquote>“Not your keys, not your crypto.”<br></blockquote><p>This advice refers to two key points:</p><p>1) if you don’t truly own your private keys, you don’t truly own the cryptocurrencies in your wallet</p><p>2) if your private keys are, in any way, compromised, stolen, or in the hands of someone else, your funds are not safe. </p><p>The latest iteration of the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/the-complete-history-of-the-world-wide-web/">World Wide Web, Web3</a> is built on the blockchain with a decentralized infrastructure promising to give its users complete control and ownership of their data with much greater security. Decentralization of data networks or the financial ecosystem also means that the responsibility of the security of users’ data and funds also comes back to the users. </p><p>In this blog, we are going to discuss in detail the types of scams Web3 investors fall victim to and how to stay safe against them. Users have suffered due to these scams frequently and our team has <br></p> Types of Crypto Scams<br> <p>Web3 is no longer merely an idea. It is intrinsically linked to ownership of data and financial value. Millions of users are falling victim to the scams in the Web3 and crypto industry and billions of dollars of funds have been lost. This is preventing the penetration of Web3’s adoption into different industrial sectors as the hacking incidents portray a flaw in the technology. &nbsp;</p><p>In this blog, we are going to discuss in detail the types of scams web3 investors fall victim to and how to stay safe against them. Users have suffered due to these scams frequently. You will also find the best prac</p> Phishing Scams <p>Phishing scams are the most common type of scams in the crypto and Web3 space. Scammers only target one thing: your private key and seed phrase because this information gives full access to your funds. Every attempt people make in this type of scam is to get your private keys in any way possible. </p><p>What are these ways? Here are the types of phishing scams that are frequently used to deceive users into submitting their private keys.</p> Seed Phishing Through Ads <p>In a recent incident that happened in Q1 2022, scammers put Google Ads to promote the malicious URLs of their websites that were either claiming themselves to be a wallet or a wallet aggregator service. They made users submit their seed phrase on their website to access their own (different) crypto wallet on their platform. What it turned out to be was a simple form where they were collecting public addresses and seed phrases of users and using that information to draining all the funds which left users’ wallets empty. </p><p>Continuing the same warning, NEVER EVER share your private keys and seed phrases with anyone or on any platform. No legitimate Web3 and cryptocurrency platform will ever ask you for your seed phrase.</p>Google Ad of a fraud website Ice Phishing <p>In the real world, ice fishing is a practice of catching fish where the fisherman needs to create a hole in the middle of a frozen lake or let’s say an opening. A similar opening is created by hackers on the smart contract platforms where they tamper with the user interface. All the hacker needs to do is inject a code that will replace the receiver’s address with the attacker’s address. Being an encrypted randomly generated stream of characters, users don’t double-check before confirming the transaction and click ‘ok’.</p><p>Stay protected:</p><p>There is only one way to defend against this attack: DOUBLE-CHECK each and every character of the sender’s address at least twice, both in the receiver’s address box and the confirmation screen.</p> Social Media Phishing <p>Crypto security firm Certik released a quarterly report in July 2022 in which they noticed a 170% increase in phishing attacks. A striking fact that Certik also mentions in their report is that most phishing attacks are conducted on social platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. Social media is a huge hunting ground for crypto scammers.</p><p>Scammers will share quotes by famous billionaires or celebrities, slide into your DMs, or share links with exciting rewards to lure users into stealing or acquiring their private information. On Telegram and Twitter, it is easier to do as the security layers groups and projects can implement are very limited. These scammers will either ask you for funds in the promise of higher returns, risk-free profits, secure your wallets, or any other way to either take and run away with your money or get a hold of your private keys.</p>This is how fake accounts share fraudulent links on social media&nbsp;<p>Stay protected:</p>  Never ever share your private keys with them or send a single penny of your funds to them.  Do not click on any suspicious or unknown links.  Keep two-actor authentication (2FA) on all of your social accounts.  Never reply to any messages with suspicious links that you receive on your social accounts.<br>   Employer Phishing <p>Employees of Web3 and Crypto companies are constantly targeted with pretentious and fake emails by scammers who pretend to be seniors or bosses of these employees and ask them to either send funds to them or share their wallet addresses.</p><p>Additionally, scammers target job seekers by either faking themselves as potential employers or promising them jobs with lucrative returns. The scammers ask the job seekers to share their wallet private keys to send bonuses or advance payments for the roles. Do not share anything with them! Again, no legitimate person or organization will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.</p><p>Stay protected:</p>  Always check the domain name of the emails and make sure it is an official email address.  Organizations should implement anti-phishing code to help the receivers identify that the email is authentic and sent by the organization.  If you receive any such email, inform your company seniors or official team members right away. &nbsp;<br>   Malicious Airdrops <p>People surfing Crypto Twitter or crypto-based Telegram channel have seen images similar to the ones below, containing promises by global icons like Elon Musk, Joe Bidden, or Bill Gates running giveaways of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.</p><p><br>Clearly, these are fake! Despite Tesla having millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in their reserve, we are pretty sure they are not holding it to run airdrop campaigns for retail investors. Do not fall, a victim to these scams, because its super easy to create such Photoshopped images.<br></p><p>In addition to impersonating celebrities, scammers also create impostor accounts of crypto and Web3 projects, download the images from their official social profiles, and pretend to run airdrops to scam users. </p><p>Before falling for any of these seemingly lucrative offers, make sure to check the URLs and usernames of the channels and confirm on the official channels with the admins. Mostly, the official channels of any project are available either on the footers of the website or on the <a href="https://www.dock.io/community">community pages</a>.</p><p></p> Crypto Rug Pulls <p>Remember the Tom and Jerry cartoons where Tom pulls the blanket under Jerry’s feet and Jerry rolls over and falls on his head. A similar experience is often faced by crypto and NFT investors when they invest their hard-earned money into a new crypto/NFT project and the founders of the project run away with the funds which drop the price of their own token to zero. This type of scam is known as a Crypto rug pull. </p><p>It all starts with scammers attempting to convince the investors that their project is legitimate and holds a bright future. This convincing is done in various ways like by building a spectacularly looking website, adding the names of fake employers and advisors, and presenting a roadmap that demonstrates the project has a sustainable future. Retail investors around the world start investing in these projects, exchanging their tokens for the project’s tokens in IDO and ICO rounds, and trading on exchanges. </p><p>Then the founders play the real game and begin to pull the rug in one of the following ways:</p>  Dump their tokens in the open market and run away with the users’ funds and sold tokens.  Put a smart contract that locks users’ funds and disables them from selling their tokens.  Extract all the liquidity from liquidity pools they started on the decentralized exchanges leaving users with only tokens and no medium to trade them. <br>  <p>Stay protected:</p>  Research every aspect of the project starting with authenticating the team members and their backgrounds  Don’t fall for huge promises of returns or their claims of becoming the next ‘Bitcoin’ or ‘Ethereum’.  Research! Research! Research!<br>  Price of a rug pulled token dropping straight to zero Malware <p>Malware has always posed a threat to crypto and Web3 users since the inception of the industry. All scammers need to find is a way to inject a virus or malware into your computer system or mobile device. We all copy-paste wallet addresses when we send cryptos to a receiver’s address. This is the exact time when these malwares play their mischiefs and replace the addresses from the receiver’s address to the scammer’s address.</p><p>Addresses being a complex string of alphanumeric characters are not often double-checked by investors before sending and investors end up sending their funds to the scammers. <br></p><p>Stay protected:</p>  Enter the receiver’s address by scanning the QR code  Triple-check each and every character of the receiver’s address.  Try sending a smaller amount of funds before making a big transaction and confirming with the receiver.  Keep your devices virus-free with the help of antivirus programs.  Do not click on any suspicious links that you find on the internet or receive in your emails and messages.   Spoofing <p>Spoofing means when something pretends to be something else. Scammers attack via spoofing using URLs, websites, emails, text messages, and IPs. And now with the innovations in technology, add facial and GPS spoofing also to the list. For example, a spoofed URL is a fraudulent link that pretends to be a legitimate URL designed to steal your data. This is called URL spoofing. Scammers attack via spoofing using URLs, websites, emails, text messages, and IPs. And now with the innovations in technology, add facial and GPS spoofing also to the list.</p><p>Scammers will often use the name of a big trusted Web3 organization and send you communications about your activity or promotions. For example, it can be a promotional email from Binance that says you have won $50 for being a valued customer. However, the email will contain malicious links that will send you to a website that looks like Binance. This spoofed Binance page will have a sign-in form that has been created by scammers to collect your username and password. </p><p>This is just one example of numerous ways how a user can be tricked into believing the legitimacy of online communication or platform. Look at the example below where the scammer has sent an email that looks like it has been sent by MetaMask’s support team. But, if you look at the email address, the reality is different.</p>Email from a fake website impersonating as MetaMask<p>Stay protected:</p>  Always check the URLs, email addresses, and any link that you are accessing. Once you know you are really on the authentic website, bookmark it to reduce your chances of clicking on a scam site that can appear on Google.  Crypto and Web3 projects will never ask you for your seed phrases. Never share them with anyone.  Do not click on any suspicious links that you receive on any communications.  Straightly mark all such emails as spam as it will help other investors also  Never connect your wallet to an unknown platform  <p>In contrast to custodial wallets that are common to centralized crypto exchanges, there are platforms that offer non-custodial wallets where the entire responsibility for the security and safety of users’ funds is with the users. With a non-custodial wallet, you have complete and sole control of your private keys which means you fully control your cryptocurrency and prove the funds are yours.</p> Other Ways to Get ‘REKT’ <p>We have discussed all the major scams that are burning the pockets of Web3 investors. Additing to the ones discussed above, there are a few other ways that can leave Web3 users REKT!</p>  Scammers might blackmail you that they possess personal information, chat history, images, or videos about you and ask for funds.  They might send ransomware to your devices, encrypt all the files on your device, and demand a hefty fee in Bitcoin to decrypt the files.  They organize pumps and dumps on low trading volume altcoins on centralized crypto trading platforms.  They can build Ponzi schemes where at first, they will offer you magnificent returns on your investments, and later, they will run away once they convince you to deposit a large sum for higher returns.  The scammers may act as a romantic partner or someone dealing with life-threatening diseases to lure you to pay them money.<br>   Conclusion <p>Web3 is full of many creative ways to scam users and snatch their private keys and seed phrase to get access to their funds and private information.</p><p>Despite all the variety of scams, there are really only a handful of things you need to keep yourself as safe as possible:<br></p>  Always triple check the sender’s and receiver’s address as scammers will change the address so the assets will go to their address instead  Don’t click on anysuspicious or unknown links, buttons, and ads  Never share your private information, private key, and seed phrase  Always check website URLs, email addresses, and redirects closely  Never send any money to an unknown person or a company  Always keep strong passwords and two-factor authentication on all your accounts  Research every corner of a project before investing your money in it.  <p>If you can learn to implement all the above-mentioned points every time when you interact on a Web3, DeFi, or a crypto platform, your funds will be safe and secure. Your keys and your private information are only yours to keep. While Web3 promises to bring complete ownership of your data, it will be solely your responsibility to keep it secure. </p><p>Stay Safe!</p>

<p>This article was contributed by Rory O’Neill, Executive at strategic communications consultancy Wachsman.</p><p>The crypto market downturn has taken the world of Web3 by storm over the past three months. Subsequently, this has placed blockchain technology under the microscope of the media, leading to journalists and crypto sceptics alike flocking to provide varying opinions on what the future of the space might&nbsp;hold.</p><p>However, in the hangover of all of this hysteria, there is one issue which has perhaps been largely overlooked, and that is the need for strategic brand management by companies in this field, to effectively weather this crypto winter storm — however lasting it might prove to&nbsp;be.</p><p>In recent weeks, the crypto news cycle has been dominated by negative headlines and navigating this media landscape is no mean feat for firms deeply rooted in Web3 technology. While it might be tempting for brands to retreat into hibernation, it is almost certainly not the right time for those who intend to be in this industry for the foreseeable future to adopt a policy of radio&nbsp;silence.</p><p>Rather, in the throes of this tumult, it is important that blockchain brands act as the standard-bearers for their industry and demonstrate that there is infinitely more to Web3 and blockchain technology than many of these sensationalist headlines might suggest. Accordingly, this makes it the opportune time for companies in this space to keep the drum beating, even in the face of adversity. It’s a time for building, and direct attention should now be placed on the underlying value of Web3 technology.</p><p>We are at a juncture where it is crucial for brands to place a renewed emphasis on education, building and development, and spell out their long-term aspirations, not only for their in-house projects, but also for the industry as a whole. Only this will ensure that brands are well-positioned to enjoy the fruits of the future that lie ahead, in spite of the current downturn.</p><p>An abundance of media coverage is now — understandably — placing a significant emphasis on market conditions. However, against this backdrop, there exists fertile ground for thought-leaders to be a positive force, lean into their expertise, and provide direction to others in the sector on the business-critical decisions that must be made in the current market to enable them to weather this storm and poise themselves for success ahead of the next bull market. Not only does this type of commentary help cut through the noise that we are seeing in the headlines in the short-term, but it can serve to establish spokespeople as go-to sources for valuable analysis in this area, all while refocusing the narrative on the important mission of building towards&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Beyond this, with blockchain technology continuing to become ever more a part of our vernacular, and with big name brands continuing to delve further into the world of Web3, there also exists significant scope to educate those who are new to the industry. At this difficult time, it is imperative to show newcomers and the crypto curious the positive improvements that this budding industry can provide to existing Web2 infrastructures. While authenticity is key, showcasing the exciting projects that continue to make the blockchain space appealing is a great way to avoid going quiet while also making a meaningful contribution to the conversation.</p><p>Further to this point, it is essential that brands use this market downturn as a time to grow and develop, and insulate themselves against the fallout of these types of market fluctuations in the future. What has allowed Web3 to reach previously lofty highs is not pure hype, but rather the strong fundamentals of the underlying technology. It is important to not lose sight of this. Now is the time to focus on these fundamentals and develop technology offerings that can add real value for the companies and consumers who will use them. New product offerings and use cases continue to make headlines, and they provide a tangible positive lifeline for an industry that has an appetite greater than ever for good&nbsp;news.</p><p>By continuing to focus on development while promoting use cases, brands can simultaneously highlight that the positive impacts offered by Web3 technology stretch far beyond short-term fluctuations in the market. Doing so can provide a timely reminder that this winter is something seasonal, not only for individual brands but for the industry as a whole; proof of the lasting value of this technology is found in the fact that it continues to survive the whims of the market. This is perhaps one of the most valuable lessons to be learned from the current crypto climate, and accordingly, it will prove integral to the success of brands in this space from here on outwards.</p><p>Brand management is unquestionably an area that will prove increasingly important as we manoeuvre our way out of this difficult chapter in Web3’s history. Amidst a flurry of media attention, having a strategic approach to navigating this tricky period is paramount to ensuring success. If implemented correctly, not only will a successful branding project facilitate the avoidance of negative coverage, but it could in fact amplify a brand’s awareness while doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>Ultimately, now is not the time to retreat to the shadows, but rather, to rise to the occasion and act as a light at the end of the tunnel for&nbsp;Web3!</p><p>— -</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-08-add-value-not-noise-navigating-web3-branding-in-a-market-downturn-d0f4f376a8b7">OWN Insights 08: Add Value, Not Noise: Navigating Web3 Branding in a Market Downturn</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Secondo una recente ricerca IPSOS, “Violazione dell’identità digitale, comportamenti adottati e rischi percepiti”, quasi un terzo degli italiani ha subito una violazione della propria identità digitale e il 71% prenderebbe in considerazione strumenti di protezione assicurativa per far fronte a tali rischi.</p>



<p>Si pensi solo a quanto oggi siano diffusi strumenti come l’autenticazione biometrica o tramite username e password per l’accesso a conti bancari, agli account di pagamento e ai profili social e quanto queste “chiavi di accesso” siano poco tutelate.</p>



<p>Si inserisce in questo contesto <a href="https://www.wallife.it/it/wallet">Wallife® Biometrics ID</a> un innovativo prodotto assicurativo in grado di proteggere i dati sensibili legati alla vita online dell’individuo assicurando l’identità biometrica digitale, prevenendo il rischio e mitigando il danno.</p>



<p>La soluzione è stata realizzata da Wallife, la prima Insurtech al mondo in grado di fornire risposte sulla sicurezza e sulla protezione degli individui da rischi derivanti dall’utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie, e presentata in una conferenza stampa a cui ha preso parte anche InfoCert con Pasquale Chiaro – Head of Marketing.</p>



 Come ridurre i rischi provenienti dal mondo Cyber e vivere con fiducia il mondo digitale. 



<p>InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea e gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale in ambito SPID è stata tra i primi a credere nel nuovo progetto di Wallife.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Il cyberspace si è rapidamente affermato come una dimensione fondamentale e imprescindibile del nostro quotidiano. Purtroppo, questa rapida diffusione non è stata sempre accompagnata da un’adeguata educazione degli utenti. Il prodotto ideato da Wallife consente di colmare questo gap, permettendo di prevenire alcuni dei rischi propri del mondo cyber e, soprattutto, di mitigarne i danni. Siamo convinti che la partnership con Wallife contribuirà al nostro impegno quotidiano: lo sviluppo e l’offerta di servizi e soluzioni che consentano a imprese, professionisti e cittadini di vivere con fiducia sempre maggiore l’esperienza d’uso della propria identità digitale e il ruolo di attori della digital economy. Questa partnership conferma l’impegno di InfoCert a fianco delle startup più visionarie e innovative per l’accelerazione della trasformazione digitale del nostro Paese.” Carmine Auletta – InfoCert CISO.</p>

 QUESTIONS! 
<p>The question period began at around<a href="https://youtu.be/JSY66-wtZoY?t=2014"> 33 minutes</a>. We had some great questions sent in, including:</p>
 
 Trust Registries will prove essential, but going one layer deeper, the next question is who will be trusted to create, maintain, and validate entrants to the registry. A consortium? In some cases, a regulatory or governmental body? The trust chain is difficult to seed. 
 Do you see a model like a stock market for trust registries? One can buy stocks privately, but to trust that you are getting the correct information and buying legitimate stocks, you would go to one of several stock markets (with their own governance details while also under regulation). There could exist markets of registries that are overseen by regulation (and you could still have private registries) 
 It doesn’t end with a Trust Registry. How do trust registries verify you are the owner of credentials 
 
<p>Participant shared: At the end of the presentation, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-m-ubani/">Marcus Ubani</a> shared that he created an open-source platform as a learning path for himself and newbies to DID/SSI. The platform aims to provide easy access and an overview of all the projects. <a href="https://ssi-did-directory.gitbook.io/open-directory-for-all/">The Open SSI / DID Directory</a>.</p>
 Get Involved! 
<p>Now that we’re starting work on v2 of the Trust Registry Protocol Specification at the ToIP Foundation, we’re excited to open a dialogue on Trust Registries. We want to get people thinking about how Trust Registries will help answer tough questions within an ecosystem to create a whole experience.</p>

<p>The “Ultimate guide to credit cards” advisory service&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cardrates.com/news/sudo-by-anonyome-labs-enables-secure-digital-identities-and-transactions/">CardRates.com</a>&nbsp;recently spoke to Anonyome Labs’ Director of Marketing, Rich Sordahl, and Fintech Operations Manager, Dave Glass, to review&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;for CardRates’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cardrates.com/about/">15 million + users</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CardRates, which reports the latest news, studies and current events from inside the credit card industry, broke down exactly what our privacy tools for both enterprise customers and everyday consumers do, and why they are essential for protecting identities and transactions online.&nbsp;</p>



 Here are seven great things CardRates.com told its 15 Million+ readers about Sudo Platform and MySudo:&nbsp; 



  “Anonyome Labs has built a simple but effective solution through its Sudo Platform — a set of tools that protect online activity through customizable virtual identities known as Sudos. Anonyome works with large enterprises interested in providing privacy protection to end users, and it offers the MySudo app directly to consumers.”<br>  “It’s not too much to say that a privacy crisis threatens the ability of the internet to facilitate modern conveniences without destroying consumer privacy. Credit bureaus, insurance agencies, personal privacy protection companies, and other enterprise-level clients use Anonyome’s Sudo Platform to foster a more protective internet.”<br>  “Sudos are at the heart of the platform. Many consumers typically keep separate work and personal profiles online. Sudos provide a platform that enables individuals to create up to nine virtual identities for different aspects of their online lives.”<br>  “Companies determine how they deploy that functionality based on their use cases. Through Sudos, end users deploy virtual email addresses and phone numbers for voice calling and texting. The platform also houses a host of other privacy protections — all easy to integrate into existing corporate infrastructure via preconstructed user interface modules, sample apps, and software development kits (SDKs).”<br>  “The Sudo Platform keeps communications private with tools that include encrypted messaging, voice, video, and email. Private browsing, ad blocking, and site reputation services protect end users from online threats. And the ability to create virtual credit and debit cards enables users to shop securely by creating a different card for every purpose.”<br>  “Signup [to virtual cards] through the app or one of Anonyome’s partners requires a comprehensive KYC (know your customer) identity check that Anonyome’s services perform. After they’re validated, users connect a debit or credit card to make transactions. ACH based funding via bank account is coming soon. Creating and changing Sudos for shopping, browsing, social media, or anything else is simple.”<br>  “There’s no turning back from the efficiencies and conveniences of digital life. But every click and tap has the potential to become part of a bank’s or merchant’s revenue model. Sudos give consumers a simple way to control how they present themselves online.”

		 NB Orbit Enterprise Platform used in Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) initiative to enhance Sustainability Reporting between multiple stakeholders. 
<p>As leaders in climate change legislation, the Government of British Columbia (B.C.) is helping to deploy cutting-edge technologies to complement them in their journey towards a low-carbon economy. In an effort to improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT)</a> was established to incentivize the formation of a digital trust ecosystem.</p>
<p>Northern Block partnered with EMDT and provided our no-code <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise Platform</a> to support two pilot projects aimed at better managing sustainable mining practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporting environmental impact data can be a complicated and laborious process. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data.</p>
<p>This project demonstrated an improved method for exchanging data, by allowing participants to share and receive digital credentials, including Verifiable GHG Emissions data related to specific mining sites and natural gas facilities.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, we accomplished some nice feats:</p>
<p>(1) Successfully demonstrated Interoperability between NB Orbit Enterprise and BC Traction in the exchange of Carbon Emissions Credentials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image taken from EMDT Case Study (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">here</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Successfully piloted the Presentation Proposal function (Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0), so mining companies (Holders) are capable of initiating holder-driven proof requests with Verifiers such as the Climate Action Secretariat, whom they owe sustainability reporting to.</p>
  
<p><br>
Northern Block is committed to driving digital transformation by supporting the implementation of digital trust solutions which lead to value creation for entire ecosystems. Our mission is to build impactful solutions to achieve self-sovereignty, and we are proud to be actively contributing to these goals in collaboration with the Government of British Columbia, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Copper Mountain Mining Corporation and many others.</p>

<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re thrilled to introduce Nikhil Khare, Product Manager of Identity Operations at GlobaliD. Nikhil has been working in the technology industry for about ten years and has held positions at Cisco Systems and Duo Security. He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan before receiving a Masters degree from San Jose State University.</p><p>Now, he is helping bring our digital identity solutions to businesses and the people who power them in order to help fix the broken identity systems that exist&nbsp;today.</p> Meet Nikhil <p>My name is Nikhil Khare and I’m the Product Manager of Identity Operations at GlobaliD. I’m based in San Francisco, California and I’ve been working in the identity access management space for about five years. I’m really excited to be at GlobaliD and help develop identity solutions for businesses that also enable users to take more control of their data and preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p> What attracted him to&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>As I mentioned, I’ve been in the identity access management industry for a while and I also have a cybersecurity background. A lot of my work has been based around understanding who the user is, who the customer is, and enabling them to have a safer online experience. That’s why GlobaliD really resonated with me because I could help build a future where our online identity is privacy preserving by default. The company seemed to be one of the organizations in the industry that was ahead of the curve in that&nbsp;regard.</p><p>I was also looking to have a larger impact with my role and truly get in the trenches with my team. Since GlobaliD is a startup and still relatively small I thought I would have a great opportunity to do&nbsp;that.</p> Before joining the GlobaliD&nbsp;team <p>I graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor’s degree in social computing information systems. After finishing college I got a job in California at Cisco Systems where I started out as a front end developer. Eventually I moved into a product management role where I gained an interest in cyber security. I also received my Master’s degree in software engineering while attending a part-time program at San Jose State University. The majority of my identity access management experience comes from my time at Duo Security where I managed the core authentication product.</p> How GlobaliD can help&nbsp;users <p>The best way to think about how people can utilize GlobaliD is in situations where you have an option to sign in to a website with a third-party like Apple or Google. You can also sign in with GlobaliD which is a more privacy preserving way to access your&nbsp;account.</p><p>When you utilize a sign-in option from Apple or Google, you’re supporting their business model which is based on harvesting your data in order to try and better understand your online behavior.</p><p>GlobaliD has a really different approach and it’s primarily ethos driven. We want to give users control over what data they share. That is the methodology and the ethos behind the company. Our hope is that by bringing a privacy preserving solution to the market we can offer end users a different option compared to what exists today where they’re trading privacy for convenience.</p> How GlobaliD can help businesses <p>One of the biggest problems that businesses have is ensuring that people who are trying to interact with them online are who they claim to be. They’re constantly trying to make sure that people aren’t committing fraud or acting maliciously.</p><p>GlobaliD’s identity platform enables companies to offer secure onboarding and authentication via a passwordless, mobile app based process. For example, we have customers who require that their users verify a photo ID document as part of their onboarding process. They can add GlobaliD as an option to their login and configure a KYC (know your customer) check in our admin panel without having to handle any of the integration themselves.</p><p>That’s where we can add a lot of value because businesses just want to know that a customer went through a reliable KYC process. They don’t want to store images of all their customer’s driver’s licenses. They don’t want to store any PII (personal identifying information). GlobaliD allows businesses to not have to deal with that issue which in turn helps them manage&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If they don’t have PII data about their users then when the inevitable happens and they have a data breach or get hacked, bad actors can’t access anything.</p> Why he’s looking forward to verifiable credentials <p>GlobaliD is building support into our platform for a new W3C technology called verifiable credentials. This is really exciting because if we get this right, we have the opportunity to solve the online identity problem in a different way than what is offered today. Current solutions like liveliness checks, SMS verification, email verification, and even physical document verification all have multiple points of failure, and the most determined bad actors can spoof&nbsp;them.</p><p>In contrast, verifiable credentials will enable a business to independently trust another organization who makes a claim about a GlobaliD user, and then issues that user a verifiable credential. This will give businesses a higher degree of certainty the user is who they claim to be while making the verification process easier for the individual.</p><p>An example where you might see this play out in real life is in the fast growing market of decentralized finance (DeFi). By nature, DeFi only requires a crypto wallet to access funds and transact on the internet. However, we still want to make sure these funds aren’t being laundered or used nefariously, so we have to bridge that gap between decentralization and security.</p><p>We can do this by having other centralized crypto exchanges who require users to go through a KYC process, like Coinbase or FTX, issue a verifiable credential to your GlobaliD. This enables smaller DeFi projects to be regulatory compliant while not requiring the user to repeat the same process over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>While we still have a long way to go to achieve this vision, these identity building blocks are beginning to stack on top of each other. It’s really exciting to be a part of and I believe it’s what’s going to get us to the future we’re trying to&nbsp;build.</p> The benefits of a remote work lifestyle <p>We’re so fortunate to be working in technology and be given the ability to work remotely. One of the biggest positives is how my work and personal life have managed to meld together in a really flexible way. I’m very thankful for our leadership who prioritize our mental health and well being. They do a great job of making sure we’re not burnt out and allow us to step away and take care of ourselves when we need to. That allows me to bring my best self to work everyday.</p><p>It also makes it really exciting when we get to meet up and see each other in-person. When I first started I was able to attend the RSA Security Conference with Kevin Boehm (CEO) and Todd Collins (Head of Design). I also got to meet Trey Steinhoff (Product Marketing Manager) when he traveled to San Francisco for a company meeting. When you don’t see these people everyday and then you get the opportunity to meet them in-person it makes you really appreciate the interactions you’re able to have. You can figure out what their passions are both at work and outside of the company and it helps you build camaraderie with everyone.</p> On his hobbies and interests <p>Right now I’m learning how to play the piano. I’m taking lessons remotely every Wednesday. I also have a personal goal to get better at surfing throughout the rest of the year. I live in San Francisco which is next to the ocean, so I feel like I should take advantage of that and improve while I can. Those are the things I’m doing in my free time when I’m not focusing on identity standards.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, sign up for the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter.</a> You’ll get monthly updates on digital identity, company news and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Also, ICYMI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-stefanie-van-dyk-3af2016568e1">Meet the Team — Stefanie van Dyk, People Operations Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team- Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care&nbsp;Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Erik Westra, Head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-nikhil-khare-a75fbaa3bbaa">Meet the Team: Nikhil Khare, Product Manager</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Understanding the Ethereum Virtual Machine and&nbsp;Solidity</blockquote> Ethereum virtual&nbsp;machine <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. EVM is sandboxed and has the characteristic of running completely isolated from other environments. Thanks to this, the code running in the EVM cannot be accessed by other processes, nor can it be accessed by an unspecified network.</p><a href="https://ethereum.org">https://ethereum.org</a> Ethereum structure reorganization<p>The role of EVM can be broadly divided into two categories: Calculation and data&nbsp;storage.</p> Calculation <p>To avoid consensus problems, EVM keeps instruction sets to a minimum. Basic algebraic, bitwise, logical, and comparison operations are supported, as well as conditional and unconditional jumps. In addition, EVM supports commands for accessing information such as block number and timestamp so that the information of the blockchain can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>With the hard fork, the cost of each operation may be changed, and new operations may be added and&nbsp;deleted.</p> Data Storage <p>EVM’s data storage space is generally divided into three types: storage, memory, and stack. From the perspective of Ethereum as a whole, it can include Calldata or even block-level areas.</p><p>Storage is an area that permanently preserves data and is a key-value store that accesses 256 bits of value from 256 bits of the key. Because I/O uses a lot of hardware and time, storage-related instructions are relatively expensive and consume more gas. Because it is expensive, minimizing storage usage is the key to smart contract development. Also, storage in the EVM requires explicit permissions for read/write. Stored values that are not set to the public and set to internal or private cannot be accessed by other contracts. Instead, it can be accessed through functions with getter and setter roles, with visibility set to public or external functions.</p><p>Memory is a temporary space used by the contract, newly secured for each message call. It increases linearly, of course, the more it scales, the more expensive it becomes. Currently, since the cost increases to the quadratic level, it is necessary to consider a memory-saving technique in contract development.</p><p>For reference, the message call also has another storage area called Calldata, and it is possible to prevent a considerable cost due to the increase in memory by using it as it is without copying it to the memory. However, the memory area can be modified, but Calldata can only be&nbsp;read.</p><p>The stack is an area that handles input and output values for operations. EVM is not a computer hardware-like register machine but a stack machine with a simple structure. Therefore, all operations are performed on the stack. Since the maximum stack size is limited to 1024, be aware of this and use local variables or parameters appropriately.</p><p>The Log can also store data at the block level. The defined event can be stored by emitting it. However, the contract cannot access the same Log after the Log is created. Instead, it is an efficient area to access outside the blockchain. Since these log data are also recorded through the bloom filter, the Log can be found even by light clients that do not have full blockchain data in a cryptographically secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>In addition, there is a virtual ROM area for uploading codes to prevent forgery/falsification during code execution, and an area for storing block information and information of the blockchain itself.</p> Solidity <p>Solidity is a high-level object-oriented language for implementing smart contracts targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any programming is possible by paying the fees within the block gas&nbsp;limit.</p><p>Solidity was greatly influenced by several existing programming languages, especially in the early days, and was designed with much influence from JavaScript. Its effectiveness can be seen in a curly-bracket language and import methods. Even in the early days, it was very similar, such as function-level scoping and the var keyword, but now it is no longer supported for security reasons. Instead, it can be said that version 0.4 is closer to C/C++, such as variable declarations, looping statements, and overloading. Convenience and safety have been improved through subsequent major version updates, and it currently has its own unique style, such as strict type conversion. It was also influenced by Python, such as decorators (called modifiers in Solidity), multiple inheritances, the super keyword, and copy semantics of value and reference types.</p> Contract development languages <p>In addition to Solidity, EVM bytecode can be written in various languages. Vyper is a Python-like contract language. Yul/Yul+ is an intermediate language, and low-level language is used when optimization and security are essential. It is mainly used to implement EVM and common denominator work with Ewasm and optimistic rollup. FE is being developed as an easy-to-learn, easy-to-learn, developer-friendly language inspired by Python and&nbsp;Rust.</p><p>Although various languages exist, contract development through Solidity is the most active, for the following reasons:</p>  Numerous tutorials and sample open source&nbsp;code  A variety of tools to improve development and ease of&nbsp;use  Large development community  Inline assembly can be used when low-level development is required while providing reasonable functionality   Solidity Inline&nbsp;Assembly <p>Solidity’s inline assembly is a feature that facilitates low-level development beyond the functionality of Solidity. Although it is an assembly, it is easy to develop by providing a functional style.</p><p>Example of low-level code:</p> 3 0x80 mload add 0x80 store <p>Coded as&nbsp;follows:</p> mstore(0x80, add(mload(0x80), 3)) <p>It has the same meaning, but convenience is increased thanks to the functional style, readability, and development.</p><p>Inline assemblies allow direct optimization of code to be written, but conversely, they may not benefit from optimization performed by the compiler. Therefore, it is efficient to write inline assembly only when it is determined that it can be clearly optimized and leave the rest to the compiler.</p> EVM Compatible Blockchain Source: <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth/">https://ethereum.org/en/eth/</a><p>Most of the projects that forked Ethereum also use EVM as it is or provide compatibility. That makes it possible to develop contracts using Solidity and a natural connection to many existing tools and services, such as REMIX, a web IDE that supports debugging, convenient contract deployment and execution, and multiple extensions.</p><p>However, since Ethereum’s EVM command update and Solidity version upgrade are being made steadily, it can be said that it is a healthy project to reflect the upgrade even after the chain fork continuously.</p> Metadium <p>For example, in the case of Metadium, the contents of the Istanbul hard fork of Ethereum are applied based on the master branch and the latest release version as of September 2022.</p><p>Istanbul is a hard fork with changes at the EVM level, including the addition of CHAINID and EXTCODEHASH opcodes. The code can be verified that these two opcodes are added to Metadium.</p>Two block-related opcodes have been added to the Istanbul Hard&nbsp;Fork.<p>In Istanbul, the gas cost of existing opcodes has also changed several times. For example, the gas cost of SLOAD has been changed from 200 to 800, and related codes can be found in Metadium.</p>Code reflecting changes in the gas ratio of opcodes related to the tri-size.<p>Even after Istanbul, there were many significant and minor changes to Ethereum, and their reflections could be found in the Metadium development branch. The London Hard Fork has been applied, and the famous gas-ratio mechanism change, EIP-1559, has also been&nbsp;applied.</p>The BASEFEE opcode that appeared from EIP-1559 can be verified.<p>Although it still exists in the development branch, Metadium tracks and continuously reflects Ethereum’s updates.</p> References   <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/</a>  <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/">https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/</a>  <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/evm-and-solidity-overview-e09c32a54935">EVM and Solidity Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Organisationen, die die Digitalisierung ihrer Businessprozesse versäumen, werden es in naher Zukunft schwer haben, wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben. Mit zunehmender Digitalisierung steigen aber auch die Cyberrisiken, weil die Verlagerung von Dienstleistungen in die Cloud und die zunehmende Unterstützung von mobilem und dezentralem Arbeiten die Bedrohungsflächen rapide vergrößert. IT-Sicherheitsteams haben nicht zuletzt wegen geringer Budgets und mangelndem Know-How Mühe, Bedrohungen zu erkennen, darauf zu reagieren und sie einzudämmen, zumal diese zunehmend von staatlicher Seite ausgehen und mit Lieferketten zusammenhängen.</p>
<p>Sicherheitsexperten von KuppingerCole Analysts und Sophos erörtern die neuesten Entwicklungen in der Bedrohungslandschaft und erläutern, warum interne Sicherheitsteams in der Lage sein müssen, ihre Fähigkeiten zur Erkennung, Analyse, Behebung und Wiederherstellung von Cyberangriffen zu erweitern und zu verbessern, um Sicherheit und Compliance zu gewährleisten. Hierzu bieten sich Lösungen im Bereich Managed Detection and Response (MDR) an.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst bei KuppingerCole, wird die wichtigsten Herausforderungen der heutigen Cybersicherheit skizzieren, die neuesten Überlegungen zur Cyberverteidigung erörtern, die Bedrohungen hinter einigen aktuellen Cyberangriffen untersuchen. Zudem wird er die Notwendigkeit einer Rund-um-die-Uhr-Überwachung, effektiver Erkennungsmechanismen, schneller Reaktionszeiten und proaktiver Verteidigungsfähigkeiten erläutern.</p>
<p>Michael Veit, Technology Evangelist bei Sophos, wird die Vorteile von MDR für Unternehmen aller Größenordnungen erläutern, darunter den Wert von Threat Hunting, die Bestimmung des Umfangs und Schweregrads von Bedrohungen, die Anwendung von Geschäftskontext, die Neutralisierung von Bedrohungen und die Beseitigung der Ursachen von Vorfällen. Darüber hinaus gibt er Einblicke in die Sophos Angebote Managed Threat Response und Rapid Response.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity-teams-mit-mdr-staerken"></a>

<p>So far, in the GlobaliD 101 series we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-every-company-is-an-identity-company-a851beed999d">Part 4</a>: Why every company is an identity&nbsp;company  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-bring-your-own-identity-5b9927008190">Part 5</a>: What is Bring Your Own Identity?  <p>Today, we’ll discuss a key topic that’s core to the future of digital identity — reusable identity.</p><p>Your driver’s license is a form of reusable identity. You receive one after you’ve verified yourself at the DMV with required identifying documents. (And, of course, after you’ve passed your road&nbsp;test.)</p><p>You can now present your driver’s license whenever some form of identity verification is required. The same goes for your passport.</p><p>That’s not how identity typically works online. Instead, you need to re-verify yourself with each new service. Imagine having to go back to the DMV every time you needed to prove that you’re legally allowed to&nbsp;drive.</p><p>Having to redundantly verify your identity online is also incredibly insecure. Every time you do so, your sensitive personal information is stored on yet another server on the internet. Security practices across businesses will vary. The point here is that each server is another potential target for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>It’s also bad for business. Not only are there costs associated with managing user data, the need to verify identity every time you onboard a customer increases friction by an order of magnitude.</p><p>While some forms of reusable identity already exist, they are more often than not associated with your social media accounts — for instance, Google or Facebook. With one account, you can sign up and connect to a large network of services. Known as Bring Your Own Identity, we discuss that framework in our previous piece in the series. The problem here is that these forms of identity don’t have the same level of trust necessary for more important tasks, say, opening a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>In an ideal world, we would be able to reuse our identity just as we reuse our driver’s license. With an identity that you own, you could verify your driver’s license once and receive a credential for doing so. You should now be able to reuse that credential without going through the same verification process wherever a driver’s license is required.</p><p>Businesses love this form of identity because it reduces the hurdles customers need to jump over to use their service, expanding their pool of potential users. With a reusable credential that they can trust, they can have the peace of mind of knowing who their customers claim to be without needing to deal with all of that expensive management of sensitive data.</p><p>Bottom line, we all need an easier way to prove who we are online. Reusable identity is the next step towards that solution. In fact, the market for reusable digital identity applications is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/reusable-digital-identity-applications-to-reach-266b-by-2027-liminal-report">projected to reach $266B by&nbsp;2027.</a></p><p>With the technology continuing to improve and governments continuing to adopt electronic identity systems, reusable identity is set to play a big part in making our digital lives&nbsp;easier.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about <a href="https://www.global.id/">GlobaliD</a>, visit <a href="https://www.global.id/">our website</a>, contact our sales team or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-reusable-identity-9dc6a1860e8">GlobaliD 101: Reusable Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>If you look at the internet just 15 years ago, the concept of trust only went one way. It was all about organizations on the internet needing to trust the end user. They needed to make sure the end user was who they were claiming to be; after all there was the famous New Yorker cartoon that stated, "On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog." This spoke to the anonymity that the internet provided in those days. That led to the mentality that strong security was of the utmost importance — to mitigate risks and assure data integrity to protect themselves from bad actors — with little concern for the customer's experience or data.</p>

<p>In an effort to be sure of whom companies were doing business with, they could put in a lot of steps and collect a lot of data from end users to assure they had the right person. And it didn't really matter. It didn't matter because the use of the internet wasn't as pervasive as it is today — it was almost more of a privilege for the tech savvy. Customers didn't have choices, there weren't a lot of businesses on the internet, and people had no idea just how valuable their data was.</p>

<p>Everything has changed. The rise of Google and Facebook showed people just how valuable their data was, while exposing the common practice of many companies to share or sell data to other organizations. With this information out in the news, coupled with regulations like GDPR to protect PII, people have become much more protective of their data. Now, the pendulum has swung and the internet trust model has become much more circular, with customers very concerned about privacy and about ensuring that their data is only used for the actions they consent to. In today's internet, if organizations want to collect data from their end users, they have to make their customers feel that they can be trusted with the data, showing themselves to be good stewards of their customers' data.</p>

<p>To build that trust with end users, organizations need to give them the tools and the proper choices to feel that the organization can be trusted. Tools that allow users to give consent for their data to be collected and used appropriately, for example, or to opt into a marketing campaign. Most importantly, users must have the ability to easily review and change those settings. Furthermore, as organizations leverage social media for user registration, it is important to give users choices. Some might feel more comfortable using one form of social media vs. another. Some companies are even exploring what social media providers actually reduce the initial perception of trust simply by offering them as a choice.</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we help our customers grow and retain their user base by providing the tools that allow their users to easily manage their data. Through the use of our Intelligent Access Orchestration engine, users can easily opt in and out of marketing choices and give consent during the initial registration. Once an account has been created, we offer a dashboard where users can go and see how their data is being used and easily make changes to their settings. These changes are immediately acted on by setting off events to remove a user's data from platforms they no longer wish to be a part of. Lastly, we provide choices on what social media providers can be utilized for initial registration. All of these capabilities make ForgeRock the Identity provider that companies can rely on to build the trust in their digital identity brand.</p>

<blockquote>The bill aims to clarify the country’s regulatory scenario for crypto&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><blockquote>It proposes to establish the country’s central bank as the regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal needs approval from the Chamber of Deputies and its Senate to be enacted into&nbsp;law.</blockquote><p>The executive branch of Uruguay has submitted a bill to Congress that aims to clarify how crypto-related activities will be regulated in the South American country. The bill will give the country’s central bank legal powers to regulate cryptocurrencies if approved.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/realunique104/status/1570396845217816576?s=20&amp;t=-cJ3PKev2netfz_L0TENOg">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill is currently awaiting approval by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of the Senate for it to become&nbsp;law.</p> Virtual Assets Categorization <p>The document refers to virtual assets as securities and categorizes them into four types: tradable assets, stablecoins, governance tokens, and debt&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>On top of that, the bill proposes to create a new category of companies for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It further seeks to amend the organic charter of the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) and put VASPs under the supervision of the central bank entity, the Financial Services Superintendence (SSF).</p><blockquote>SSF will ensure that malicious elements do not use crypto assets to bypass the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) safeguards.</blockquote><p>Speaking of AML &amp; CFT safeguards, Uruguay hasn’t yet adopted the FATF Travel Rule, but if the country green-lights the crypto bill, it will adopt the Crypto Travel Rule sooner or&nbsp;later.</p> Giving Central Bank&nbsp;Control <p>Introduced on Sept 5, the proposed bill aims to amend the Securities Market Law and treat crypto assets as book-entry securities.</p><p>Such a treatment means crypto can only be issued by a registered entity that complies with laws and regulations. With this, the document introduces another class of operators, the “virtual asset&nbsp;issuer.”</p><p>This new organization will be in addition to companies facilitating the purchase and exchange of virtual assets, custody providers, and third parties that lend financial services related to the sale of a crypto asset that the text establishes as part of this asset&nbsp;class.</p><blockquote>“With the proposed amendments, both the previously regulated subjects and the new incorporated entities that operate with virtual assets will be subject to the supervisory and control powers of the Central Bank of Uruguay,” states the&nbsp;bill.</blockquote> Crypto Regulation in&nbsp;Focus <p>Last year in August, Uruguayan Senator Juan Sartori introduced a bill to allow the use of crypto as payments and regulate their use in the country. Yet, so far, it hasn’t been successful. Then the Central Bank of Uruguay issued Binance a summon due to its offering of savings-oriented crypto-based financial products.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1445139436186923015?s=20&amp;t=V1Pl14YWZ5dljQn6LzPpjg">Image Source</a>)<p>Towards the end of 2021, the central bank started working on a plan to lay the foundation for regulating companies that offer crypto-related services.</p><p>The South American country has now introduced a new cryptocurrency bill that will address the gray area in its crypto&nbsp;sector.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1519141072055775232?s=20&amp;t=xhaXN3AvW3HfaDy7-FaUjQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Interestingly, Uruguay’s neighboring country Brazil, the largest economy in the region, is also looking to change its legal framework to recognize crypto tokens as securities &amp; bring them under the SEC’s&nbsp;control.</p><p>The bill’s final version was approved by the Senate in April 2022 and needs Congress revision before being signed by the president.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1565746284081942529?s=20&amp;t=XxJQgiJ9Yi8QLYU5i2oZ7Q">Image Source</a>)<p>Meanwhile, in another South American country, Paraguay’s President Mario Abdo has <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining">vetoed a proposed crypto regulation bill</a>, stating crypto mining is an “energy-intensive” low-value-added activity. The bill has since been returned to Congress to be approved again or to be rejected.</p><p>It is to be seen if Uruguay gets ahead of Paraguay and Brazil in giving legal recognition to virtual assets. That said, a comprehensive crypto bill is a good start, nonetheless.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Why Implement Biometric MFA? 
<p>We are all aware of the risks associated with password-based authentication. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of password-based breaches that we see in the news every day. Some companies have attempted to mitigate password risks by adding two-factor authentication (2FA), pesky one-time codes sent via email or text.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you authenticate users who access your systems by way of username-password combinations, even if enhanced by so-called 2FA or MFA methods, then you could improve security a lot, reduce user friction, and cut operating expenses by implementing a biometrics-based solution.</p>
<p>While some solutions claim to solve these problems, many are only exchanging the password for FaceID/TouchID. These legacy apps fail to do the one thing that they are supposed to do – prove who the user is.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could prove each user’s identity every time they logged into a resource. That makes all of the other pillars much easier.</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers identity based Zero Trust- with real biometrics and cryptographic proof of possession and audit.</p>
 Identity Is One of the 6 Pillars of Zero Trust 
<p>Take this diagram:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other solutions base the “binding” on a username and password exchange which can be done by anyone. This is a problem because when an issue like a lost phone occurs, other solutions fall back to a username, password, 2FA as the bootstrapping process to re-enroll. What do you think the bad guys are going to do with this recovery process? That’s right, exploit it.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity? 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo in government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents, and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that<br>
1)&nbsp; Establishes user-controlled identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with that previously established identity</p>
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are other key values of the BlockID platform:<br>
– Can be <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrated</a> with every system that matters – Remote Access (VPN, Citrix, ZScaler, Appgate, etc.), Desktops (Mac/Windows), SSO systems (Okta/Azure AD/Ping), PAM (Cyberark/Thycotic)<br>
– Can be implemented in parallel, without impacting the existing mechanisms<br>
– Supports multiple company accounts in the same app: Domain Admin, Regular users, AD, Unix Account, etc.<br>
– Supports password reset in the app<br>
– Combines physical and logical access<br>
– Has built in integrity checking</p>

<p>65,000 USD in OCEAN is available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grant DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month, retroactively, rewarding the projects that contributed the most value to the ecosystem.</p><p>Round 22 has 65K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on October 10th, 2022, at midnight UTC.) 55K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD is via our micro-grants run by <a href="https://www.algovera.ai/">Algovera&nbsp;AI</a>.</p><p>Round 22&nbsp;Dates</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is October 4 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends October&nbsp;6  Voting Starts on October&nbsp;6  Voting Ends on October&nbsp;10  Funding Deadline on October&nbsp;24  <p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>OceanDAO Evolution</p><p>We are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who are engaged with the community and who are aligned with our value-add mission.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead  <p>We aim for OceanDAO to stay minimal (just grants; no treasury) and get more minimal yet; and double down on more automated incentives with lower governance attack surfaces (veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming).</p><p>Towards this, the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-21-is-live-690fd301b9c1">OceanDAO R21</a> post described some recent steps for R21 and planned steps for R22. While that post targeted a move to retroactive grants, upon deeper investigation we have found it to be high operational overhead, which we have instead focused towards veOCEAN. Therefore we are not moving to retroactive grants at this point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>We are moving towards these goals in other ways. First, in the vein of minimal OceanDAO, we are winding down the Parameters WG due to the low scope of governance, low turnout, and ongoing engineering work to further minimize governance. And, the OceanDAO Engineering WG will streamline to use of its OPF internal label as the “Nile”&nbsp;team.</p><p>Second, we are shifting more community budget to veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming (more automated, yet aligned objectives), and away from grants (higher governance touch). Therefore, R22 total grants will be 65K USD worth of OCEAN, and R23 total grants will be 45K USD worth of OCEAN (both including 10K USD to Algovera micro-grants). Max funding amounts have been tuned proportionally. The increased funding to veOCEAN &amp; Data Farming will lead to higher APYs for staking OCEAN and curating Ocean data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Round 22&nbsp;Specs</p>  Total funding of 65,000 USD&nbsp;(min.)  10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants.  100,000 USD max. per project in a&nbsp;lifetime  100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)  Funding ceiling per tier, in a round (max possible that a project can request in a round)&nbsp;:  New projects — 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO))  Existing projects — 6K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)  Experienced projects — 12K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more&nbsp;grants)  <p>Grant Funding Categories</p><p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  The building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;Software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Submitting Proposals</p><p>We encourage you to submit proposals early.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-22/83">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the essential criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Teams can reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for any guidance or assistance.</p><p>Please, do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>Funding Tiers are achieved by teams delivering on their grant promises, to unlock higher funding ceilings.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.    Existing Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.    Experienced Project    Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6,000 USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  3,000 USD For New Teams (non-outreach)  3,000 USD For New Teams (outreach)  12,000 USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  12,000 USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  25,000 USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There is specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-22-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R22</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features</p><p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the treasury.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Here are the&nbsp;WGs:</p>  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  Outreach Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p><a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> has a channel for each WG. The pinned message will have WG meeting times, and other key info. WGs typically meet weekly or bi-weekly. When a WG meets, it’s in its respective discord voice channels.

 Breaking Digital Borders: Scaling User-Owned Data from Zero to One Million — Key Takeaways <p>The Berlin Blockchain Week is an annual event that all web 3.0 enthusiasts, crypto experts, and techies from all walks of life look forward to. And this year, it was extra special for us at Affindi, as we showcased our MVP Console to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>On September 14, we hosted some of the most curious minds in Berlin at our “Breaking Digital Borders: Scaling User-Owned Data from Zero to One Million” event, as a part of the Berlin Blockchain week. Over some delicious food and drinks, Marco Podien, our Developer Evangelist, started the evening with his enthusiastic welcome.</p><p>Glenn Gore, the CEO of LemmaTree and Affinidi, was our first speaker, and he brought out the importance of changing data ownership for good and why it matters to everyone today. He described LemmaTree in general and Affinidi in particular, and also touched on the role of other ventures within LemmaTree, such as Trustana and GoodWorker.</p><p>Following Glenn, Junius Ho, our Chief Product Officer, talked about one of Affinidi’s most successful projects to date — the CommonCheck. He described the critical role that CommonCheck played in seamlessly verifying COVID vaccination credentials while preserving the privacy of every individual.</p><p>Next, Niandong Wang, our Chief Foundations Officer, took the stage. He started by explaining the ecosystem around data ownership and where Affinidi fits in. Next, Niandong talked about Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Affinidi Console, and the importance of a collaborative approach.</p><p>This introduction built the expectations for Affinidi Console, and Zain Yousaf, our Product Principal, and Marco took over to showcase Console to the audience. They did a walkthrough of the Console to help everyone understand how they can build privacy-preserving apps through this no-code dev&nbsp;tool.</p><p>This walkthrough and the potential impact of Console created a buzz among our guests, and some of them wanted to know more about it. After an informal Q&amp;A session, we wrapped up a memorable day with pride in the journey so far, and looking forward to creating more impact in the world of data ownership and identity.</p><p>To know more about our Console and to understand how it can fit into your organization, talk to <a href="mailto:marco.p@affinidi.com">Marco Podien</a> today. Also, <a href="http://build.affinidi.com/affinidiconsole">sign up for early access to our Console</a> for a hands-on feel of this platform.</p><p>Join the Community</p>  Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and the community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>  Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>  Please get the latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi; join<a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v"> our mailing&nbsp;list</a>  Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?

<p>Back in 2020, I was going through a crisis of faith. I wasn’t sure if my involvement with Holochain was worth the effort. Sure, it was a noble idea. I mean, who doesn’t want to be more in charge of their own online lives? But I worried that it was a lot of energy wasted on the wrong solutions — maybe we’d convinced ourselves that the tech was more important than it really was. Maybe it was time for me to move on.</p><p>Then I learned about a group called Digital Democracy. They were building a mapping tool called <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/">Mapeo</a> with the help of Hypercore, a <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/">protocol</a> for peer-to-peer data sharing. But this tool wasn’t just for people who wanted to find the nearest coffee shop. It was being used by <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/ourwork/case_study_waorani/">indigenous groups</a> in the Amazon basin, people whose way of life was threatened by oil exploration. Mapeo allowed them to record the richness around them, from ancient burial sites to important food sources to ant nests. Eventually they were able to compile such a compelling argument for the preservation of their homeland that they won a lawsuit against a decision made by the Ecuadorian government that would have threatened their ecosystem; they currently live free from immediate danger.</p><p>That’s when I realised that decentralised tech matters. No, it’s not going to save the world, but it is a powerful, even transformative, tool in the hands of the right people. Mapeo couldn’t have been done as a traditional cloud app — there’s no internet out there in the rainforest. Only a peer-to-peer protocol was up for the task.</p><p>Two years later, I find myself at <a href="https://dweb.org">DWeb Camp</a>, an event in north California hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. All of us there have weathered many storms, from COVID to political unrest, and we’ve come out just a little disillusioned. But here, among colleagues, friends, and strangers, I find hope. It’s not that the people here are untouched by the grief and confusion of the past two years — it’s that they still believe we can move humanity’s course in better directions.</p><p>Here, I meet people who recognise that the tech that’s gotten us into such a nasty spot can also be used to help us create patches of light in the midst of darkness.</p><p>I hear <a href="https://twitter.com/jburrows">Jill Burrows</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneUssher">Leanne Ussher</a> of <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> describe the way our global economy creates flows of goods and resources that degenerate the health of ecosystems and communities, then offer a new way of looking at economies that could shift us toward regeneration using digital tools for whole-systems accounting. And I get excited when I learn that real groups are ready to use them for their sustainable textile, food, and electronics supply chain networks.</p><p>I listen to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-tairea/">Ben Tairea</a> talk about <a href="https://ahau.io/">Āhau</a>, an app he’s creating with the help of <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>. Ãhau lets Māori families record and share their stories to keep them alive. For Ben, peer-to-peer tech is not just an ideological choice; it’s deeply rooted in pragmatism. He tells me that “from our villages’ perspectives, yeah, it was absolutely about — we want to have our own stories; we don’t want to be putting them on these platforms; we don’t want to be entrusting somebody else to hold onto that information for us. And we have heard horror stories of people that had been using different services that no longer existed, and so they lost their database.”</p><p>I witness demos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaaK6oXL6Ls">Social Sensemaker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a>, working examples of Holochain apps that help groups create healthy online social spaces to work and play in. These tools are built on peer-to-peer tech because, in the eyes of the projects’ creators, that’s the only way for a group to assert their power to create the software, data, and infrastructure that suits them best. We lets you cobble together little configurable applets — “generic tech, specific culture”, in the words of <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a> founder <a href="https://twitter.com/SidSthalekar/">Sid Sthalekar</a>. Both of these projects aim to carve out areas of sovereignty in an internet where big platforms define the game and choose who can play, often leading to ideological polarisation and disempowerment.</p><p>I listen to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2022/08/25/introducing-the-2022-dweb-fellows/">DWeb Fellows</a> from Brazil, Colombia, India, and Mexico share their experiences helping build community-governed internet and cellular networks where they live. These networks give indigenous and rural people access to the power of global connectivity while preserving their right to engage on their own terms.</p>DWeb Fellows share their experiences helping to build community-run mesh and cell networks<p>I chat with countless people who are devoting themselves to beautiful, courageous, demanding visions of a future they want to live in. Every one of their stories is a gift of hope that I will carry home with me.</p><p>I see people from all sorts of outlooks — not just rich white tech bros but children, wise sages, trans people, people from the global south and indigenous territories in the north.</p><p>One thing that I notice repeatedly is people building bridges instead of shouting at each other from their own islands. They arrive with open minds, ready to share and listen, ready to build a web with <a href="https://twitter.com/GETDWeb/status/1569371422392483840">many winners</a>. Scuttlebutt and Holochain folks show up at each other’s workshops. People from various governance camps put their heads together to find new approaches to the wicked problems of the internet. And many people without a stake in any project show up to discover allies and tools that can help them in their journey to improve their corner of the world.</p>People discuss digitally augmented governance at a workshop<p>This feels different from DWeb Camp 2019 and the DWeb Summits that came before it. I’m not the only one to notice it; afterwards some of my colleagues echo the same feeling. We think things in the <a href="https://getdweb.net/">DWeb</a> community are shifting — from solo acts to ensemble pieces, from head to heart, from thoughts to actions, from beliefs to relationships. This event both displays and <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/our-mission/">nurtures</a> that spirit, thanks in large part to the careful and heart-led work of Wendy Hanamura and her team of organisers, space stewards, and volunteers.</p><p>And that makes sense. We’re here, not because of technology, but because of the things we want to see birthed in the world. Of course, we’re united in believing the DWeb is a tool that can help our work immensely. But it’s ultimately just a tool. We — you and I, and the rest of us — are the ones who are going to make change happen.</p> How about Holochain? <p>While I would love to focus entirely on the beautiful community spirit, I know some of you want to know what the Holochain community was up to. Here are some highlights, in no particular order:</p>  Jill Burrows, Leanne Ussher, and <a href="https://github.com/weswalla">Wesley Finck</a> presented a talk and a workshop on <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> and its underlying ontology, <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a>, which describes itself as “a vocabulary for the distributed economic networks of the next economy”. The workshop, which focused on practical applications to real economies, was attended by all sorts of people interested in regenerative economics, not just Holochain folks.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamieklinger">Jamie Klinger</a> gave a lightning talk on the ideas behind <a href="https://metacurrency.org/">Metacurrency</a> and <a href="https://metacurrency.org/portfolio-item/deep-wealth-a-post-monetary-jazz-ensemble/">Deep Wealth</a>.  Wes and <a href="https://twitter.com/zippy314/">Eric Harris-Braun</a> gave a lightning talk on the organisational principles behind <a href="https://acorn.software">Acorn</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/emalinus4">Emaline Friedman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mhuesch">Michael Hueschen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/sidsthalekar">Sid Sthalekar</a> gave a demo of <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>’ Social Sensemaker engine that allows groups to define their own cultural and reputational norms in the form of metadata that can be calculated against contributions, then filtered and sorted. Once again, a lot of people from other projects showed up, which led to a lively discussion of how reputation systems can and should be designed.  <a href="https://twitter.com/5thingol">Guillem Cordoba</a> and Eric Harris-Braun gave a demo of <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a>, showing how groups can create and customise their own spaces to communicate and get things done. I was particularly impressed by a <a href="https://youtu.be/oKD2HlLqpI8">toggle</a> that lets you switch your UI from a group-centric perspective to an agent-centric perspective that shows information from all the groups you participate in.  <a href="http://twitter.com/zaunders/">Viktor Zaunders</a> led a brainstorming session to identify useful applets to add to We. And once again, this event attracted people from outside the Holochain sphere. This led to small group discussions about one of my favourite topics — how to build bridges between different DWeb protocols.  Eric and Art led a discussion on governance in DAOs and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">other forms</a> of organisations, along with the tools and processes needed to support them.  Paul Krafel, an unwitting mentor of many people in the Holochain community through his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548071.Seeing_Nature">Seeing Nature</a>, held a Q&amp;A about his book and led a few exercises in learning to see flows in nature and human interactions.  Eric Bear gave from his heart as a volunteer and Space Steward, organising event schedules, helping people feel supported, and generally cultivating a feeling of care and connection among participants.  I took lots of photos and videos for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022">Internet Archive</a> — I even got to film an impromptu wedding!  Some of us participated in a meet-and-greet session — Marcus (the lead facilitator of our recent <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">Developer Immersive</a>) and his partner Kaitlyn treated everyone to charcuterie and we all got to share what Holochain is about with anyone who was curious.  Every one of us found ourselves in many conversations about a thousand subjects — governance, education, economics, sovereignty, and of course Holochain.  After DWeb Camp ended, the Internet Archive graciously lent us space in their San Francisco headquarters so the remaining participants could plan the future of Holochain and its community together.   Postscript <p>I want to leave you with this piece I recorded at DWeb Camp called Five by Four, performed by the <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/">Del Sol Quartet</a> and written by their violist Charlton Lee. As you listen to it, pay attention to the story the musicians are telling. At first, it almost seems confused, as if they’re trying to figure out how to play with each other. The notes don’t fit quite right. Some are playing in 4/4; others in 5/4.</p><p>As the piece moves on, the apparent discord begins to resolve — gradually at first, then rapidly. Rather than give up their individual perspectives, they blend them together in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o11VT-g5sBA">upward spiral</a> of greater coherence, greater beauty. Some are still playing 4/4 and others 5/4, but their contributions only add to the richness; each individual gracefully dances with the rest of the ensemble.</p><p>And I love watching their body language. The subtle glances, the smiles and grimaces, the moment-to-moment changes of bow and finger. There’s no leader to keep them all in sync, and the sheet music only gives the notes. The music comes alive because of these human signals, carrying a much higher bandwidth than conductor or ink could.</p><p>For me, this piece tells the story of the DWeb, both the present moment of the people building it and the rhythm and notes of the societies we hope to help nurture. We’re growing in our capacity to cooperate, and I think that’s an important prerequisite if we want to help the world do the same. Let’s hope that we may continue to build bridges, connect our islands, come together to create many ensemble pieces.</p>

<p>It’s been a very exciting summer for the team here at 1Kosmos. Analysts are taking notice! We are honored to be recognized as an overall leader in the KuppingerCole Leadership Compass Providers of Verified Identity 2022.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Leadership Compass Providers of Verified Identity 2022 analyzes digital identity solutions that perform identity proofing and verification or enable a verified digital identity to be imported and easily reverified. The Leadership Compass compares full-service verified identity providers or vendors that conduct digital identity verification alongside providing several of the identity lifecycle stages. As defined by Kuppinger Cole.</p>
<p>This could include:</p>
 
 Vetting/Proofing 
 Registration 
 Authentication 
 Additional services: fraud reduction, electronic signing, attribute verification, orchestration 
 
<p>1Kosmos was recognized as a leader in three of the four categories:</p>
 
 An Overall Leader 
 A Product Leader 
 An Innovation Leader 
 
<p>We would be very honored just to be mentioned but Leadership recognition is tremendous, especially a technology leader. This validates our push to provide a verified portable identity and a passwordless experience to all. This rewards all of the hard work and dedication by our 1Kosmos team. We created a platform to ID users at the other end of the digital connection, taking into consideration user privacy and data security. Organizations around the globe have recognized this as ideal for passwordless authentication because it drastically simplifies the user experience, it’s Kubernetes underpinning, and ease of integration with SDK / API, but it does all of this without introducing new vulnerabilities, need for additional tailoring of network or IT / Security talent.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform uses a private blockchain that enables organizations to create irrefutable decentralized digital identities and unifies identity proofing with passwordless authentication. The Gartner Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022 provides evidence that interest in decentralized identity is increasing and will enable new digital business opportunities.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID is built with specific capabilities for the onboarding, verification and authentication of employees, contractors, customers and citizens. 1Kosmos digitally transforms the standard onboarding process, by automating and delivering the highest degree of end-user assurance. This transformation eliminates the need for new users to share copies of government IDs, protecting their privacy.</p>
<p>By binding users to their proofed identity, 1Kosmos BlockID creates an identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. Users will utilize their trusted mobile device for daily authentication and step-up authentication for physical or logical access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap (September 12th — September 18th) <p>Welcome to another exciting edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In this week’s edition, we look at the recent crypto regulation guiding principles published by Abu Dhabi FSRA to the White House’s first-ever digital assets regulatory framework. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Abu Dhabi FSRA Publishes Crypto Regulation Guiding Principles (<a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/en/plan-your-visit/visiting-uae/visiting-abudhabi">Image Source</a>)<p>In its new guidelines that define six key principles on which its approach would be built, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Free Economic Zone (ADGM) defined its regulatory approach to virtual asset activities.</p><blockquote>The agency highlighted four “risk drivers” that need heightened focus, one of which relates to the obligations of virtual asset custodians, even when they contract out work to external&nbsp;parties.</blockquote><p>There will also be an emphasis on technology and governance controls that businesses use. The FSRA also plans to examine whether companies adhere to legal obligations when exchanging virtual assets, particularly to ensure that laws intended to safeguard virtual asset investors, such as disclosure requirements, are being followed.</p><blockquote>As such, the new guide reaffirms the FSRA’s dedication to providing a strong, transparent, and consistent regulatory framework for companies engaging in virtual asset activities, prosecuting regulatory violations, and upholding “high standards” throughout the authorization process.</blockquote><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.adgm.com/documents/legal-framework/guidance-and-policy/fsra/fsra-guiding-principles-for-virtual-assets-regulation-and-supervision-ia-202209012.pdf">https://www.adgm.com/documents/legal-framework/guidance-and-policy/fsra/fsra-guiding-principles-for-virtual-assets-regulation-and-supervision-ia-202209012.pdf</a></p> SEC’s Gary Gensler Says Proof-of-Stake Crypto May be Securities (<a href="https://twitter.com/sandy_carter/status/1571073767857860608?s=20&amp;t=tGq4RK-G_OYu3txrUKImJg">Image Source</a>)<p>Recently, Gary Gensler, the current SEC supremo, insisted that any cryptocurrencies that follow the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism are likely to be securities.</p><blockquote>In his own words, PoS blockchains “might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.”</blockquote><p>As for how a distinction is made between crypto, which is a security, and one that is not, courts utilize the Howey test to evaluate it by determining whether an investor expects to make money from owning the respective asset.</p><p>This statement from Gensler is pretty significant, considering that it comes at the heels of the successful Ethereum merge rollout, which marks its move from the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the Proof of Stake&nbsp;(PoS).</p><p>Interestingly, there were rumors that Gensler wanted to backtrack from the previous SEC stance that Ethereum is a non-security, but he was held back by a lack of sound reasoning to pull this off. That may change now with Ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake, as it may very well be the ammo that Gensler&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Read More&nbsp;Here:</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/15/secs-gensler-signals-extra-scrutiny-for-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-report/">https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/15/secs-gensler-signals-extra-scrutiny-for-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-report/</a></p> US DOJ Launches Digital Asset Coordinator Network (<a href="https://twitter.com/CamNguyenHome/status/1571720033939902467?s=20&amp;t=tGq4RK-G_OYu3txrUKImJg">Image Source</a>)<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-report-digital-assets-and-launches-nationwide-network">launched</a> the National Digital Asset Coordinator Network, with over 150 federal prosecutors joining the team. According to the authority, the new network will advance its efforts to counter the growing threat the misuse of digital assets by malicious actors pose to the American&nbsp;public.</p><blockquote>According to the DOJ, the DAC Network will be the main venue for prosecutors to receive and disseminate specialized training, technical know-how, and advice on investigating and prosecuting digital asset offenses.</blockquote><p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the DOJ’s Criminal Division said, “Through the creation of the DAC Network, the Criminal Division and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team will continue to ensure that the department and its prosecutors are best positioned to combat the ever-evolving criminal uses of digital asset technology.”</p><p>Read More&nbsp;Here:</p><p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-report-digital-assets-and-launches-nationwide-network">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-report-digital-assets-and-launches-nationwide-network</a></p> White House Publishes First-Ever Crypto Regulatory Framework <p>The White House published the “First-Ever Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets” to enhance regulatory control of the digital asset&nbsp;market.</p><blockquote>The crypto framework is pretty detailed and consists of segments on investor protection, safe access to cost-effective financial services, strengthening the financial ecosystem, promotion of responsible innovation, ways to maintain the country’s financial competitiveness and leadership, combating illicit finance, and pros and cons of&nbsp;CBDCs.</blockquote><p>It also lays the groundwork for regulators like the SEC and CFTC to coordinate among themselves to ensure strict regulatory compliance in the crypto space and build an information-sharing mechanism to keep tabs on consumer complaints.</p><p>The White House report further shines a light on “a potential US CBDC,” directing the US Treasury to consider the “potential implications of a US CBDC, leverage cross-government technical expertise, and share information with partners.”</p><p>Read More&nbsp;Here:</p><p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/</a></p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer!

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>The cost of cyber-attacks to the global economy has risen to more than 400 billion US dollars per year. Cyber-attacks affect every business, from small companies to enterprises and governments. Recovering from attacks is expensive and time-consuming. So, how to make an organization more resilient to cyber-attacks in today’s digital world?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital transformation has changed the business and delivered new opportunities to organizations. However, going digital also increased the risk of becoming a victim of a cyber-crime. Fighting cyber-attacks are an unfair battle because companies face a silent enemy. In most successful attacks, organizations only learn about the attack when it is already too late. This is the case with ransomware, an attack that encrypts files and frequently also steals data of an organization until a ransom payment is made. Nitish Deshpande describes the evolution of ransomware in an article "<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/deshpande/ransomware-in-2022">How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware in 2022</a>".</p>
 Attacks have no border&nbsp; 
<p>In the last years we have seen many different ransomware attacks across the globe affecting every industry and organizations of all sizes. Several of these attacks caused major damage. Here are some prominent examples of the past few years:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 In 2019 the city of Baltimore was a victim of a ransomware attack called “RobinHood”. This attack encrypted files and shut down all the servers except essential services. Attackers claimed a ransom of 100 thousand US dollars to give the access back to the state and threatened with permanently deleting the data. Consequences reached enormous proportions: real estate transactions could not be completed, card payment and debt checking were inaccessible, and city employees lost access to their email accounts. The recovery took the city several months and costed approximately 18 million US dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 At the beginning of 2021 the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack left the US in checkmate. A bug invaded the system and impacted the computerized equipment managing the pipeline.&nbsp; President Biden declared a state emergency in Virginia since 71% of the filling stations in the area were out of fuel for several days. This was known as the largest cyber-attack on an oil infrastructure target in the history. Overseen by the FBI, the company paid the amount asked by the attackers to sort the problem: 4.4 million US dollars. 
 In May 2021, the Health Service Executive of Ireland suffered a major ransomware attack that affected the entire country and caused the IT systems to be shut down nationwide. The attackers claimed 20 million US dollars threatened to publish patients’ information online. The Irish government did not pay the ransom and, unfortunately, data of 520 patients have been published. Ireland spent more than 100 million US dollars to recover the HSE system after the ransomware attack. 
 In May 2022, the Ministry of Finance of Costa Rica was hit by a ransomware attack that affected, among others, customs, and HR systems. The consequences affected the national economy, especially because the customs stopped processing import and export taxes and the salary of public employees was suspended for a month. The government declined negotiations with the muggers, but it ended up paying high expenses anyway: 9 million US dollars were used from the reserve to pay the salaries and pending movements that were on hold due to the attack. The country remains under national emergency alert. 
 
 The beneath of the iceberg&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp; it is not possible to avoid attempts of attacks, and there has been a considerable increase of ransomware attacks since the COVID-19 outbreak:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/ransomware-during-the-pandemic-crisis">Ransomware During the Pandemic Crisis</a>. Companies need to prepare themselves as best as they can to survive that moment. The obvious detriments are related to data compliance, technical issues, and large investments in the cybersecurity system. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The damage on a brand name is difficult to revert. The brand is one of the most valuable assets in business and being the target of a cyber-crime would devaluate the name and reputation of the company. This is a major issue since there are several expenses arising out of it such as losing reputation and breaking current customer relationships, devaluation of trade name of the organization, and high costs due to operational disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intellectual property loss is another major issue. It damages the name of the organization, as well as slowdown the business growth.&nbsp; If third parties access trade secrets or publish documents that are under copyright, it would be hard to recover customers’ trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would require efforts from different teams, which means time spent to sort this problem, and thus money loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing a company needs to become a target is to be online, and as such, the key is to stop thinking about “if a cyber-crime occurs” and change the mindset to “when the attack comes”. Becoming more resilient and vigilant is part of a good cybersecurity strategy. Mike Small, a Senior Analyst of KuppingerCole explains this very well and advice steps to follow&nbsp; in case of the worst scenario: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/when-will-ransomware-strike-disaster-planning">When will Ransomware Strike? Plan for the Worst</a>.</p>
<p>It is vital to realize that while cybersecurity professionals work on refining the prevention tools, hackers are developing in parallel their tactics, techniques, and procedures to bypass the controls and succeed in their next attack.&nbsp; The priority then, is understanding the potential risks and focusing on programs to minimize the impact and thrive against a cyber-crisis.&nbsp;</p>

   When fraud occurs as a result of scams and social engineering, organizations can struggle to stop it. This is because when legitimate customers fall prey to online imposter scams—for instance, in the case of authorized push payment fraud (APP)—the impact from losses can snowball, affecting not just the customer, but the organization at which the fraud took place.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-28-million-fraud-reports-consumers-2021-0">FTC</a>, American consumers reported losing over $2.3B to imposter scams in 2021. Meanwhile, across the pond, <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/government-coordinated-action-needed-fraud-losses-rise-30-cent">UK Finance</a> reported that losses due to authorized push payment fraud rose by 71% in the first half of 2021 in the UK, the same report stating that the amount of money stolen through this type of scam even overtook card fraud losses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, financial institutions need to find ways to effectively combat thes massive losses that can come from APP fraud before they’re left footing the bill.</p>

   How to protect your organization from a social engineering attack 

<p>Cyberhacks are commonplace in today's world, and they can happen to any company. Today it's Uber, last week it was U-Haul and the week before it was Samsung. At the root of many of these attacks is a malicious actor masquerading as a corporate IT manager or other technical role. Using this disguise, the perpetrator knows that all they have to do is convince one employee or contractor to share their credentials to gain a foothold into the targeted company's internal network. This tactic is called social engineering and is one of the key methods used in attacks that result in data breaches. These types of "unauthorized access" attacks account for 50% of all data breaches and can cost companies as much as $9.5M dollars to remediate per incident.</p>

<p>It's a frustrating reality for CIOs because these types of breaches are preventable as long as their companies implement the right technologies, policies, and procedures and educate their employees on how to be extra vigilant in the digital world.</p>

<p>In my experience, one of the most difficult aspects of protecting an organization is making sure all team members understand the importance of building security into their everyday roles. Employees need to adopt the mindset of "security first." Simple things such as not clicking on unknown attachments or deleting a suspicious request for a passcode are easy ways to stay out of harm's way.</p>

<p>CIOs must come to grips with the fact that we're all human and that shortcuts don't have a place when developing strong cybersecurity habits. Even the smallest and seemingly insignificant technical toe-stub can open the door to a potential bad actor. Our job is to look at the problem holistically. No amount of investment in the latest technology can provide 100% protection because technology alone is not enough. It has to be complemented with well-designed, enforceable policies, proven procedures, and strong system hygiene coupled with continuous education and awareness.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some practical steps you can take to protect your organization now:</p>
	
  Embrace zero trust. 
   Building strong policies and procedures. 
   Continuously educating your workforce. 
  Zero Trust Goes Beyond Products 
	
<p>Zero trust is built on the principle that no person or device inside or outside of an organization's network should be granted access to connect to systems until authenticated and continuously verified. A CIO's top priority is to incorporate zero trust into their approach to cyber security.</p>

<p>User access must be calculated constantly from as many different data points as possible. Companies need to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to combat account takeovers and tackle fraud at the front door and subsequently throughout their networks.</p>

<p>As an example, the ForgeRock Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform continuously assesses risk as part of its access management capability to provide a zero trust environment. However zero trust needs to be applied to everything we do online. This means deploying the best cybersecurity technology that implements a zero trust paradigm; developing and implementing policies and procedures that reinforce zero trust and redundancy; and educating users and systems administrators to follow procedures that mitigate risk.</p>

 Build Strong Policies and Procedures 
	
<p>Most successful attacks are the result of routine lapses and failing to know what endpoints are connecting to your network. To prevent this, it is important to practice good cyber hygiene by patching operating systems and applications, backing up data, updating and whitelisting applications, limiting privileges, and using multi-factor (MFA) authentication</p>

<p>CIOs need to understand where their technology assets are, what software is in use company-wide, and identify unsanctioned software which, more often than not, has not been properly configured, patched, updated, or secured, creating an attractive entry point for attackers.</p>

<p>Internal hygiene is critical, and that includes ensuring that system level usernames and passwords are not hard-coded. If that is necessary, make sure there is regular rotation of those system passwords. Performing regular, routine maintenance, automated patching, and isolating personal devices is all part of ensuring your organization is protected.</p>

 Continuously Educate Your Workforce 
	
<p>Outside of technology, there is the element of human error and risk. It is critical to any business that employees are regularly educated and tested to ensure they have a strong understanding of cyber risk and the part they play in minimizing it.</p>

<p>One important and often overlooked element is social engineering education. For example, how much personal information are your employees actually sharing online via social media such as LinkedIn or FaceBook? This is an increasingly strong attack vector that bad actors use to understand the structure of a company. I've seen attackers target new, junior employees with a high pressure, time-sensitive request seemingly from a senior member of staff to unlock access to a company's network.</p>

<p>Finding new ways to keep your teams educated requires some serious thought. Training should not be a "one size fits all" approach. It needs to be tailored to teams and roles. I am sure that sometimes I drive my team crazy, but I have been known, on occasion, to contact my help desk team in an attempt to impersonate various employee roles to ensure they stay on their toes. I think it's an important aspect of understanding the maturity of a team with elevated access to many systems.</p>

<p>Phishing scams are another common method used to gain unauthorized access. Employees should be trained to identify malicious emails, URLs, and attachments that often are sent by attackers to their corporate or personal inboxes, or any other avenue, such as SMS.</p>

<p>Lastly, training has to be non-negotiable. Companies need to follow up to ensure that employees have participated in relevant training and fully understood its implications. Furthermore, employers need to make it clear there are ramifications should individuals intentionally circumvent security policies and procedures.</p>

<p>The correct balance for preventing any cyber attack spans people, process and technology. If you get that trio right, your organization will thrive.</p>

<p>Consumers are embracing digital payments and turning to fintech for everyday finance needs. According to Mastercard’s 2022 Global New Payments Index, emerging payment methods like account-to-account payments, digital wallets and Buy Now, Pay Later are all on the rise. Eighty-five percent of consumers have used a digital payment method within the last year. And 93% are likely to use a digital payment method in the coming year.</p>
<p>Many of these emerging digital payments are powered by open banking and are a natural progression of the shifting landscape of payments. Through our latest research, we wanted to share five key trends to consider when integrating digital payments into your fintech innovation.</p>
 1. Consumers want convenience when paying bills 
<p>Consumers across the globe are relying on digital channels for paying bills because it is more convenient and makes it easier to manage finances.</p>
<p>Subscriptions, bills, utilities, loan repayment and retail payments are more convenient with open banking-powered apps and services. Eighty-one percent of consumers have already heard of account-to-account payments, but they may not know that open banking added speed and convenience to A2A, or that A2A payments can now be made at the point of sale, without typing in card details or writing checks.</p>
<p></p>
 2. Consumers seek flexibility in making payments 
<p>The majority of global consumers want the flexibility and control to optimize digital payments. Similar to the motivations around bill pay, consumers are connecting their accounts to automate repayment for BNPL and installment loans. Fifty-eight percent of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments, and 52% percent say that they use digital repayment tools because they help to prevent missed or late payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 3. Security is top of mind 
<p>Consumers recognize the convenience that digital payments offer, and security remains a top concern, highlighting an opportunity for providers to build trust. Building comfort with emerging digital payments is key to supporting future adoption as the two trend together. Faster transactions, convenience and transparency are the top reasons that help consumers overcome security concerns.</p>
<p></p>
 4. Consumers rely on fintech to manage finances 
<p>Consumers are relying on fintech, and indirectly open banking, to accomplish everyday financial tasks. Eighty-three percent of consumers have used digital tools for at least one financial task, and over half use technology to accomplish five or more tasks. The majority see making a payment as the most beneficial use case.</p>
<p></p>
 5. Emerging payments are strongest among Gen Z and Millennials 
<p>Younger generations have gone more digital in their purchasing and payments behavior globally and it’s anticipated that their use will continue to increase. These generations are less likely to make in-person purchases and payments: 50% for Gen Z compared to 78% of Boomers. They are also less likely to use cash for purchases. While security remains a concern for them, it is less heightened than for older audiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building the Future of Payment Choice at Mastercard</p>
<p>At Mastercard, we have always powered experiences that enable customer choice. Our solutions are built to meet consumers’ financial needs and designed with security at the center.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have further differentiated Mastercard in the market by diversifying beyond the card. We’ve built a complementary open banking platform that enables ACH and account-based payments with best-in-class capabilities across infrastructure, applications and services. Empowering people to pay and get paid using a card, bank account, cryptocurrency, or even cash. Using any device or no device. In real-time or later, truly empowering people with flexibility and control.</p>

<p>1Kosmos had the pleasure of attending the Gartner IAM Summit 2022 in Las Vegas. It was our first time exhibiting and sponsoring the event. I have to say it was great to see long time friends, former colleagues, customers, partners and prospects. It was a great feeling to meet people face to face again. As we move beyond our COVID shutdown, it makes me appreciate the things I lost appreciation for. For me, the show was very busy. It felt as though everyone came out just to go meet the folks that they used to be in touch with!</p>
<p>I attended as many sessions as I could balancing my time between meeting customers at the booth and attending the highly informative sessions.</p>
<p>In this blog, I wanted to share some observations and highlights of the event because I know not everyone had an opportunity to attend.</p>
<p>1. Passwordless is a Day 0 imperative</p>
<p>My first observation was that <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/password-alternatives/">passwordless</a> authentication was a frequent (or top of mind) topic. Gartner VP Analyst Ant Allen has been talking about the end of passwords and the need to eliminate them for years! Based on the presentations and focus of the exhibitors, this is a hot topic. I was happy to see that the discussion has moved past just passwordless and in fact it is simply “expected “ now. Gartner took it much further in fact, and described the journey to MFA and RBA (risk based authentication). And then they dropped the big one- Continuous Adaptive Trust! Learn from the environment. Learn from the user’s previous access and form an opinion about the inherent risk of each new access. I believe this is where the world of user authentication is headed and selfishly, no one can provide Day 0 passwordless as we can here at 1Kosmos. But, yes it’s good to see the market and analysts move in our direction. Also, passwordless is accelerating across workforce, customer, and citizen use cases.</p>
<p>In speaking with attendees, many express some doubt about their ability to achieve the goal of being passwordless or communicate that they don’t know where or how to start. Of course, I was more than happy to talk about our approach and show prospects how it’s not only possible but, with our approach, it’s very practical, and it provides an excellent experience for users. I said it here- passwordless is just the beginning and there is much much more to come to remove friction from secure user access journeys!</p>
<p>2. Signal Orchestration with Predictive Analytics</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-mfa-zero-trust/">Multi-factor authentication</a> is an absolute must these days. That’s nothing new. But what was new is the need to move past a risk based (RBA) model and into a continuous authentication model. The shift will ultimately mean that authentication journeys will not be preordained as it is today. The industry will move from a stepwise imperative to a desired end-state declarative model!</p>
<p>With the addition of signals, security teams can orchestrate the appropriate journey based on the user and their action. For example, security teams could base authentication on a NIST IAL level. If the user does not meet that IAL requirement, say they are IAL 1 presently but they need to be IAL2, then the system would adaptively put them through a journey to achieve the assertion corresponding to a NIST IAL2 level!</p>
<p>This move to a predictive – based on AI/ML – approach to access via declarative journeys and orchestration will be the future of access management. The shift here is that currently security teams already know the signals they are supposed to be looking for. So security is based on what is known. But the world is moving on. The hackers have moved on. We need to move to a continuous model – Adaptive trust. This is another way of saying we need to try to predict when the system might be at a higher level of compromise or threat, and then go and introduce obstacles, sensible obstacles, contextual obstacles, into the authentication journey. That’s really what they were trying to drive towards.</p>
<p>3. Web3 and the Rise of Privacy!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/decentralized-web/">Web3</a> was a surprising discussion point. What was clear is that this is in its infancy. Many are talking about – specs, requirements, technology, and even implementations but the strategic imperative is clear.</p>
<p>Web3 is promising a complete redesign of the web as we know it.<br>
Decentralized compute, storage, and always-on application execution will be executed via distributed ledgers.<br>
Everything will live on a blockchain and will have an address. All nodes work together to compute, verify, and record the state change of the tokens (the things that represent value), which will lead to a token economy.<br>
An application called a wallet is the human interface to the blockchain technology stack. It holds the seed phase, all your blockchain accounts/addresses, the corresponding public/private key pairs, your tokens, and above all, initiates the state change. Early talks of a standard to allow for wallets to work anywhere are underway.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. Web3 promises a utopia where everyone online is a known entity. No more anonymity but the fundamental principle to uphold will remain user privacy. Users and creators alike will need, and regulations will mandate, a consent driven journey with sufficient recourse available to users for consent revocation. These drivers will, over time, fundamentally alter the way we engage online. Gartner is already beginning the analysis.</p>
<p>While this is just a high level view, there was more to the event than just this. But these were my key takeaways. As a PM I already have much of this in production, in development, or on a roadmap. As an organization and the leader of the strategic direction of our platform I believe we are headed in the right direction to help you meet the future demands of your workers, customers or citizens.&nbsp;</p>

 With the common use of heuristics and especially the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in automated cyber threat mitigation, why do we still need to focus on user cybersecurity awareness?&nbsp; 
 
<p>In cybersecurity, there never was just one solution to reduce risk or fix mitigations. But you always need multiple layers of security. So each layer consists of additional aspects. Software and hardware measures are excellent at catching mass and known threats, with the advance in AI and also the detection of new threats based on known issues. But we can never neglect the human factor as a first, but also the most important line of defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often give the example of driving a car. You can make a car very safe to drive with airbags, ABS, and even some measures with automatic street lane detection and object detection. But even with all the advances in self-driving, at least for now, you still need a human who knows how to drive so that a person can react in new or unexpected situations. This is the same for technology and specifically cybersecurity, therefore users need to have an awareness that we need them to fight cyber threats and crime. So if users know how important they are and how they can help, this can only be our advantage. So give them the knowledge, train them and users can be a first, last, and often also the best line of defense.&nbsp;</p>
 What are methods of cyber social engineering and how to identify them?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Social engineering is an age-old tactic to trick people into doing something they do not want to do. So users are tricked by communication, emails, phone, SMS, or videos pretending to be from trusted parties such as banks, colleagues, executives, online payment processors, IT admins, or social websites. So all social engineering attacks have one or more common traits. The scammer will focus on your good nature and human emotions. The criminal will use a false title, a position of authority, for example, as someone you would normally trust, a bank manager, social services, a doctor, etc. and they will try to create an urgency, a time-sensitive situation which will put you under pressure and to act. They may request urgent information, money, or something similar for their criminal gain. So currently the most prevalent social engineering attacks we have seen are via email, voice, SMS, and social messaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social engineering attempts via email are called email phishing or business email compromise. So even with the constant barrage of emails everyone receives, it's normally not difficult to recognize them. Was the email expected? is the first question you should ask yourself. Check from whom this email is. Is the sending domain suspicious or are there some obvious misspellings? Many companies also use technology to insert an external email banner warning to indicate that this email is from outside of their organization. You always should remain suspicious if there is an attachment that asks to enable macros, in office documents mostly, and also be very careful if the email has some information that tries to raise a sense of urgency, "You need to do this immediately", this is always a warning sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very similar to phone phishing attempts, where criminals may try to lure victims into handing over valuable information. Employee names, title roles, or anything like that. So they will normally call via the switchboard or directly from an unfamiliar number claiming to be a colleague or a well-known vendor, or a third party and create again a sense of urgency with their request. Similar to SMS phishing, people may receive SMS messages asking for a piece of personal information or asking to click on links. This SMS may look legitimate, being from a bank or parcel delivery service or something similar. Always, before clicking or replying, check if this SMS was expected and if the link goes to a legitimate website. And of course, keep your mobile phone updated to avoid security exploits.&nbsp;</p>
 How did the increased Working from Home change the cyber threat landscape in the last two years from a user perspective?&nbsp; 
<p>Let's start with something outside of the cyber domain, but still related to safety, specifically health and safety. What we have learned in the last two years is that it is important to have an environment at home which enables a safe, healthy, and economical workspace. So this means having sufficient and good lighting, a comfortable and ergonomic chair and the right size desk is much better than sitting on the kitchen table or working from a sofa. But working from home reminded us also to be mindful of who and what is around us when conducting confidential work conversations. So do not discuss confidential information with your IoT devices like Alexa or Google Home nearby, in case they may be listening and sending it to their servers. So, collaboration with your team is very important. It is vital when you are working remotely, but make sure to only use company-approved methods for communication. Don't use any personal or social media apps to discuss work-related topics and of course, the usual advice, upgrade your home network and any personal computers, game consoles, internet-connected TVs, baby monitors, and other IoT devices, and never use a default password. So the security basics also apply at home - or even more at home.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we expect from your talk at CSLS 2022?&nbsp; 
<p>We have traditionally seen cybersecurity as a domain for technology, with the expectation that solutions for cyber resilience have to be provided by IT. And we happily accepted this challenge and deliver numerous software and hardware solutions, design and development principles, policies, and process controls. However, the most successful cyber attacks in recent times have started with targeting users with phishing emails or other kinds of social engineering, and therefore raising awareness of the users' role in increasing cyber resilience is at least as important as providing just a technical solution. So my presentation will be based on a very famous example, a real robbery in Berlin in the early 19th century showing how user awareness can become an important line of defense in cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>

 It’s time we had a serious discussion about the risk-based system…&nbsp; 



 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6c5ab95-7be4-432c-83a5-79b7471afc1a">fraud epidemic</a> is sweeping the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criminals bilked UK victims of a record £1.3 billion in 2021, according to new<a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/"> </a><a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/">figures</a> by top industry lobby group UK Finance. The numbers were so bad that publication of the report was <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/annual-fraud-report-2022">delayed</a> for banks to consider their response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 91% of identity fraud cases reported to UK authorities in 2021 were carried out online. Although anyone can fall victim to online fraud, tackling it is not a priority for law enforcement, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/158/treasury-committee/news/166100/treasury-committee-publishes-government-response-to-fraud-scams-and-economic-crime-report/">according to the government</a>. Instead, firms are being asked to do more to protect their customers and themselves or run the risk of heavy fines or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year of 2020 saw a record-breaking <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202109/financial-institutions-fined-nearly-11b-worldwide-for-kyc-regulatory-non-compliance">£9.2 billion</a> in penalties for KYC and customer identification failures, which triggered a demand for outsourced services and better technology, with automation of key onboarding processes deemed as particularly vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digitization has revolutionized the finance landscape and left manual ID verification processes firmly in the past; customers no longer want to wait days or weeks for their accounts to be approved, and they want to be able to do all this through their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking to IDnow on condition of anonymity, the Head of Operational Risk at a mid-tier UK investment bank said: “I believe, and I am not alone, there are significant problems, weaknesses with how external auditors check over all applications manually. It’s just too time-consuming, expensive and prone to errors. We are looking at how we can automate more and it’s the same issue whoever you ask up and down the street.”&nbsp;</p>



 Lost in the wash&nbsp; 



<p>The advanced payments infrastructure, almost zero policing of fraud-related crime, and use of the world’s most widely used business language, has made Britain the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/welcome-britain-bank-scam-capital-world-2021-10-14/">global incubator for scams</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money launderers exploit the poor standard of identification checks, the weaknesses in manual processes and physical documentation requirements to slip through the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just two years ago, Commerzbank’s London branch was <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures">fined more than £37 million</a> for a series of compliance failings, including outdated customer onboarding processes. The bank allowed a queue of 2,350 accounts awaiting background checks to build up, but some were able to trade freely, in clear contravention of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the near-constant updates to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) laws, knowing exactly who their clients are appears a problem for many UK financial services firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk-based approach to<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/"> Know Your Customer (KYC) </a>processes favored by the UK, but eschewed in most other developed nations, is gatekeeper to an environment where fraud continues to run rampant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>” In the Western world, it is almost impossible to find a major, global bank that has not been sanctioned for AML or other financial crime failings in recent years.</p>



<blockquote><p>Now that AML-related concerns and failings have resulted in many large banks being sanctioned, regulators are beginning to pay increased attention to other areas of financial services.</p> Malin Nilsson, Managing Director, Financial Services Compliance and Regulation at Kroll</blockquote>



<p>For example, regulators have started to implement guidance for digital identity verification, such as in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> released in 2020. In it, it states that an obliged entity must identify the customer, either through traditional documentary evidence or information obtained from a reliable and independent source, including electronic identification means. Those electronic identification methods must comply with <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910">Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014</a>, which sets out criteria for identity verification services.&nbsp;</p>



 Outdated processes&nbsp; 



<p>Before assessing the risks associated with a customer in relation to money laundering or financing of terrorism, financial institutions must first verify the individual’s identity. This is done via the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20helps%20banks%20to%20comply,money%20laundering%2C%20corruption%20or%20bribery.">KYC process</a>, which involves scrutiny of government-issued identification documents, such as a passport or driver’s licence, or other means, such as utility bills or bank statements to ensure the customer or client is who they say they are, and to prevent illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that process looks like differs around the world (which creates complications of its own), but there are a set of general guidelines overseen by a global group of regulators from various jurisdictions sitting as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-customer-guidance/know-your-customer-guidance-accessible-version">The UK’s interpretation</a> of these rules requires firms to take a risk-based approach, which means assessing the specific threats the business is exposed to, such as banking vulnerable or politically exposed individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current rules and regulations were originally created to address the risks and controls associated with retail banking, which has unintentionally created regulatory barriers and AML complications for non-banks like PayPal, alongside other fintechs, and sectors like online gambling and crypto trading companies. A “low risk” for a bank may be a “high risk” for another sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As legislation around anti-money laundering and risk-based-approaches was largely written in the pre-digital era, access to the data that helps firms calculate risk was limited. Ironically, there is now almost too much data to handle, with many organizations struggling to take advantage of the insights and technology available to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Thomson Reuters investigation <a href="https://www.bobsguide.com/articles/kyc-pain-financial-institutions-and-their-clients-are-still-struggling-with-ongoing-challenges/">into KYC challenges</a> impacting financial institutions and their corporate clients found rising onboarding costs, lengthy onboarding times and sub-par ongoing maintenance of client records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Costs are spiralling, with resourcing and the need to hire more staff a major concern. It still takes too long to onboard customers, and the time taken to refresh client data is torturous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multinationals face further complications dealing with the UK’s risk-based approach, which allows more time to make decisions on threats and has no international standards to follow. As regulations can be interpreted differently, banks also often request inconsistent things from their clients, which results in inefficient operations of their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most common issues that IDnow hears from financial leaders responsible for supervising KYC and AML compliance within their organizations is the disconnect between their work and the business functions of the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making sense of the exponential amount of data and documentation required for KYC and AML checking can be tough and, due to complicated and inefficient processes, can halt processes such as onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watchdogs like the FCA say cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are only <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart/cryptoasset-investment-scams">magnifying the fraud problem,</a> despite the growing sector <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/65eb9636-d253-42af-8526-50d70c41a19b">working hard</a> to shake off its reputation as a haven for bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



 New school thinking&nbsp; 



<p>Ironically, the answer to avoiding ever-tougher controls, circumventing inflexible processes, and improving both standards and efficiencies in the KYC process may come from an unlikely source: the world of crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must also keep detailed records of beneficiaries, complete further enhanced due diligence of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed persons</a> (PEPs) and appoint an individual to oversee compliance and regulatory issues in the wider financial space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC is one of the biggest roadblocks that cryptocurrency firms face, especially given the nature of digital tokens to protect or shield the identity of the owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency firms have an opportunity to give regulators and customers confidence, outshine competition and demonstrate credibility by implementing industry-leading compliance practices.</p>Ben Luddington, Director at PwC UK.&nbsp; </blockquote>



<p>Unburdened by years of legacy system upgrades, bolt-ons and software changes, alternative finance companies have automated large swathes of the KYC process and built systems that can process a much wider source of data. This has created faster, safer and more robust paths to verification than in place at traditional banks and financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Configurability is essential to addressing the challenges faced by firms operating in multiple jurisdictions, but rigid technology stacks at many financial organizations jam up KYC compliance workflows. Indeed, every bank, insurance, accounting and law firms will likely have dusty rooms full of photocopied identity documents clogging up the filing archives of the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenger finance apps and crypto exchanges have also advanced the integration of Multi-Factor Authentication systems based on SCA (Strong Customer Authentication), Liveness checks, and other forms of biometric-based authentication. These types of identity verification processes, which sometimes require little more than a selfie and a PDF of a household bill, dramatically improve the customer’s onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



 How intelligent technology enhances the KYC process&nbsp; 



<p>Document verification determines if something is genuine or fake through a series of checks, but the quality of the process varies wildly. Field-to-field consistency, data validations and font anomaly detection, among others, are popular, but where smaller, nimbler services beat the larger incumbents is by combining the identity verification document check with biometrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These platforms have also made good use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esign/">electronic signatures</a> to communicate with their customers, further allowing them to promote additional financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smartest solutions have AI-based face and emotion recognition capabilities, or the ability to scan the internet for negative sentiment, making KYC procedures more cost-effective, accurate and customer-friendly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All firms must turn to technology to bolster KYC frameworks and accelerate the detection and mitigation of financial crime, Luddington said. This may be a build vs buy decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Deciding which processes will benefit from what technology requires considerable and careful thinking, but this will bear fruit in the long run,” he said. “We’re already seeing the FCA using analytics to innovate its regulatory approach and recognizing the importance of technology in driving financial crime compliance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk management has become more challenging over time as regulations tighten, and financial institutions have faced larger fines where compliance programs have failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Banks have long struggled to balance fraud prevention and customer service, and existing paper-based and risk-based processes are simply ill-suited to the demands of modern finance, while advanced, intelligent identity proofing developments are proving critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s more important than ever for financial services firms, particularly those in the UK, to understand the benefits of automation and apply them to the KYC process in order to truly manage fraud.</p>



<blockquote><p>Regulators should do more to create robust identity verification guidelines and set expectations that firms leverage better technology in order to stop the unwanted headlines about bank fraud.&nbsp;</p> Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I came across an article titled “<a href="https://fcw.com/digital-government/2022/01/no-easy-fix-id-verification-government-benefits/361120/">No easy fix for ID verification for government benefits</a>” that explored a major challenge that governments have been facing for the past few years. This problem involves balancing fraud prevention in unemployment insurance claims and ensuring that qualified individuals can access the benefits that they are entitled to. The concern is that anti-fraud measures may prevent benefits from reaching the constituents that they are intended to help.</p>
<p>Since COVID-19 relief programs started in 2020, states have grappled with a dramatic increase in fraudulent claims. This led 27 state governments to work with a commercial identity verification provider in hopes of flagging potential fraud. Unfortunately, this resulted in a new issue that made the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/irs-to-back-off-third-party-facial-recognition-what-happens-to-id-me/">news</a> earlier this year called Identity Decisioning Bias. Identity Decisioning Bias was used in algorithms designed to verify identity but is built in a way that disadvantages certain populations, such as racial and gender groups. Depending on the identities that the AI algorithms were trained on, databases show bias towards certain populations. This means that some users might not be recognized and denied access to services.</p>
<p>What’s the solution to this problem? First, pooling data to build “intelligence” is risky because it leaves private data at risk of being hacked. Instead, data should be stored on a private, immutable blockchain to eliminate the possibility of theft. Additionally, live biometrics should be used for identity proofing instead of device level biometrics. The 1Kosmos BlockID platform can use mobile phones to perform a live selfie or a “liveness test” which can determine if the face in front of the camera is real or not with 99% accuracy. This eliminates the possibility of Identity Decisioning Bias in the 1Kosmos BlockID platform. Our platform was tested on iBeta to produce zero false matches in 200 live biometric attempts on iOS and Android devices, validating the reliability of the BlockID platform for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p>As the world continues to move to an online-first environment and begins to adopt zero-trust constructs at scale, we find we have architected a solution to suit the security needs of government and organizations today and well into the future.</p>

 SEC Head Honcho Gary Gensler Double Downs on Demand for Strong Crypto Regulations and Investor Protection <blockquote>Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chairman, rejected the notion that current securities law is incompatible with the crypto&nbsp;market.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC Supremo also asked crypto intermediaries such as crypto exchanges to register with them as securities exchanges and broker-dealers.</blockquote><blockquote>He also supported giving regulatory authority over the crypto industry to the CFTC when it comes to nonsecurity tokens.</blockquote><p>Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), is yet again calling for crypto regulation.</p><p>A “vast majority” of crypto are securities issued to the public in violation of federal laws, he said at the Practicing Law Institute.</p><p>“These are not laundromat tokens. Promoters are marketing, and the investing public is buying most of these tokens, touting or anticipating profits based on the efforts of others,” highlighted Gensler.</p> Can Securities Law be Extended to Cryptocurrencies? <p>Many in the crypto industry have been calling for a new set of rules designed particularly for crypto assets due to existing securities law being unsuitable.Gensler completely rejected that notion saying, “Nothing about the crypto markets is incompatible with the securities laws.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1007303263807508482?s=20&amp;t=7qxQfl5whPN3H_T2dw_BjA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>It is important to point out here that the SEC officials, both current and former, have reiterated multiple times that most cryptocurrencies are actually securities, barring&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><p>Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, too, has been given a clean chit in the past. Still, the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has denied giving any definitive statements on Ethereum’s status. So, the SEC’s stance toward Ethereum is unclear at the&nbsp;moment.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1567870504941281281">Image Source</a>)<p>However, a piece of news making rounds on crypto Twitter indicates that Gensler would love to back away from the previous SEC stance that Ethereum is a non-security but hasn’t found a credible way to pull this&nbsp;off.</p> Protecting Investors <p>The focus has been on protecting the investors, which is “just as relevant” in crypto “regardless of underlying technologies,” he added. According to him, investors need disclosure to “help them sort between the investments that they think will flourish and those that they think will flounder.”</p><p>The SEC chairman further called for crypto intermediaries like exchanges to be registered with the agency as securities exchanges and broker-dealers. On top of that, he wants crypto and stablecoin operators to “get their tokens registered and regulated.”</p><blockquote>Gensler concluded his remarks by quoting Joseph Kennedy, the first Chairman of the SEC, “<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-sec-speaks-090822">No honest business need fear the&nbsp;SEC</a>.”</blockquote><p>James Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, echoed Gensler’s sentiments, saying the sector needs to be “appropriately regulated” if it intends to play any role in the global financial system.</p> Sharing Power With the&nbsp;CFTC <p>At a separate event, Gensler signalled that he would support Congress handing more authority to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/us-senate-bill-proposes-to-make-cftc-the-go-to-regulator-for-bitcoin-ether-and-other-digital-commodities">the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a> greater power to oversee certain cryptocurrencies.</p><blockquote>Speaking at an industry conference, the Chairman said he looked forward to working with Congress to give the SEC’s sister markets regulator added power to oversee and regulate “non-security tokens…and the related intermediaries.”</blockquote><p>Gensler also said he is open to working with the lawmakers as long as they “don’t inadvertently undermine securities laws.”</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

15 September 2022 - 15:01

                    
      
    
      
             <p>This week, CEUR-WS.org has published the paper titled ‘<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3214/WS6Paper2.pdf">Harmonization Profiles for Trusted Data Sharing Between Data Spaces: Striking the Balance between Functionality and Complexity</a>’ in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Co-authored by INNOPAY’s <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en/employees/bauke-rietveld">Bauke Rietveld</a> and <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en/employees/vincent-jansen">Vincent Jansen</a> in collaboration with TNO, the paper explores what is required to enable interoperable data sharing between a wide variety of data spaces, in alignment with the EU Data Strategy. The paper was presented at the <a href="http://i-esa2022.webs.upv.es/index.htm">I-ESA 2022 conference</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>The ambition of the EU Data Strategy can be summarised as a ‘federation of interoperable data spaces’. Current data space implementations are already seen to have a wide range of architectures, frameworks and protocols. The Data Sharing Coalition and the NL AI Coalition Data Sharing Working Group have done considerable work to identify the concept of harmonisation profiles required for interoperability. Building upon this work, the paper presents a framework for structuring these harmonisation profiles.</p>

This duo discusses the challenges of finding an internal stakeholder champion to "own" identity across business units, why the UX battleground isn't just about your competitors, it's about any consumer experience across industry verticals, and the importance of shifting enterprise perspective on identity to encompass the entirety of the "digital identity lifecycle.”</p>

   ForgeRock introduces next-generation identity orchestration features to deliver superior digital identity experiences 

<p>ForgeRock announced today a major update to our industry leading identity orchestration capability, known as Intelligent Access Trees. This is a proud day for the ForgeRock team as we advance our vision around identity orchestration. Enterprises can now deliver great user experiences with much less effort. It's faster and easier for organizations to personalize customer and workforce journeys, deliver innovative experiences with no-code development, integrate identity into applications, and measure user engagement with the industry's first journey analytics dashboard.</p>

 Five New Capabilities Put Intelligent Access Trees in a Class of their Own 

<p>Our approach to identity orchestration is grounded in the belief that creating effortless digital experiences should be as natural as breathing. That's why it was natively built into our unified platform from the start. These 5 new capabilities help organizations take the user journey to the next level:</p>

  Dynamic and Contextual User Journeys Make Personalization a Breeze 
 <p>We've introduced the ability to enhance user journeys and make them "just right" for an individual without disrupting their experience or creating extra work for developers. It's easier than ever for organizations to change a person's user interface, language, and terms and conditions — or even offer a more accessible experience for someone with unique needs.</p>

  No-Code Drag-and-Drop Nodes Support Broad Use Cases 
 <p>Pre-built out-of-the-box nodes span a wide variety of use cases ranging from registration, social authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), A/B testing, and zero trust, to name a few. Plus, more than 150 additional third-party integrations are now available through the ForgeRock Trust Network. All of this adds up to faster out-of-the-box use case solutions, while reducing development and maintenance costs.</p>

  Infusing AI Directly into the Journey 
 <p>We've combined the best of Intelligent Access Trees and Autonomous Access. Our updated orchestration engine is infused with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered threat protection that can be leveraged with no-code drag-and-drop capabilities. By leveraging AI, organizations can optimize a journey to minimize friction and improve the user experience while protecting against account takeover and fraud. We are especially excited to share that we continue to focus on what's important: making it as easy as possible to use AI with the latest advanced enhancements.</p>

  Measure User Engagement with Journey Analytics 
 <p>The new journey analytics dashboard helps administrators measure and project trends for multiple parameters: total and engaged users, number of new sign-ups, and success and failure rates of individual user journeys across the identity lifecycle. These powerful analytics give organizations insights into how friction in user journeys affects the user experience.</p>

  Managing Journeys at Scale 
 <p>Organizations often house large libraries of journeys that are difficult and costly to manage. To lighten the burden, we've added features for testing and debugging, tagging, organizing, and searching journeys. These features vastly simplify processes for developers, and are particularly helpful when journeys are connected to a specific region, brand, or customer segment.</p>

 Natively Built Into Our Unified Platform 
<p>Our vision came into being with our 2018 release of Intelligent Access, a first-of-its-kind no-code/low-code identity orchestration capability that allows organizations to quickly and easily define personalized and secure user journeys across the identity lifecycle. Intelligent Access enables organizations to finely orchestrate every aspect of the user journey — from registration to password and profile self-service, to authentication and ongoing authorization. Because all these features are now native to our unified platform, organizations reap these benefits:</p>

  Reduced complexity: Development and administration from a single pane of glass means configuration of end-to-end flows does not require integration of disparate, bolted-on products which are administered separately. 
   Simpler, less risky policy creation: Policies for registration, authentication, and authorization are configured in one place to avoid inevitable "drift" that arises when security is configured in unintegrated systems. 
   Flexible user journey design: Context can be injected at exactly the proper point in the user journey, if needed. The user journey can dynamically respond to context and then adjust for less friction or more friction, in line with requirements. 
   Easier, faster updates and changes: Our SDKs are fully integrated and automatically reflect any changes to user journeys without the need to republish applications. Adding new MFA flow to journeys? No problem. There's no need for re-integration. 
   Minimized risk: Execution takes place inside the same runtime as the rest of our platform. This means all of the security, controls, service uptime, and performance characteristics are also unified. Organizations can take comfort in knowing that our proprietary, patented <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud/architecture">cloud security architecture</a> with full tenant isolation applies to all of our products equally, with nothing bolted on that could expose the organization to increased risk. 
   Streamlined management and operations: Built-in orchestration means there is only one product to manage from an operational and SLA perspective. Furthermore, it's available across the platform, whether you use our cloud service, self-managed software, or you're operating a hybrid environment. Troubleshooting and diagnosing issues does not require stitching together complex logs from different systems without the ability to trace transactions end to end. 
 <p>Native, built-in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/orchestration">orchestration</a> is a smart choice. Organizations benefit from lower risk and tremendous cost savings in development and ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to seeing what our customers do with these new capabilities.</p>

   One of the traditional approaches for communicating between microservices is through their REST APIs. However, as your system evolves and the number of microservices grows, communication becomes more complex, and the architecture might start resembling our old friend the spaghetti anti-pattern, with services depending on each other or tightly coupled, slowing down development teams.

  <p>One of the traditional approaches for communicating between <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2021/02/microservices/">microservices</a> is through their REST APIs. However, as your system evolves and the number of microservices grows, communication becomes more complex, and the architecture might start resembling our old friend the spaghetti anti-pattern, with services depending on each other or tightly coupled, slowing down development teams. This model can exhibit low latency but only works if services are made highly available.</p>

<p>To overcome this design disadvantage, new architectures aim to decouple senders from receivers, with asynchronous messaging. In a Kafka-centric architecture, low latency is preserved, with additional advantages like message balancing among available consumers and centralized management.</p>

<p>When dealing with a brownfield platform (legacy), a recommended way to decouple a monolith and ready it for a move to microservices is to implement asynchronous messaging.</p>

 What is Kafka? 

<p>Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It was initially conceived as a message queue and open-sourced by LinkedIn in 2011. Its community evolved Kafka to provide key capabilities:</p>

 
   Publish and Subscribe to streams of records, like a message queue. 
   Storage system so messages can be consumed asynchronously. Kafka writes data to a scalable disk structure and replicates it for fault-tolerance. Producers can wait for write acknowledgments. 
   Stream processing with Kafka Streams API, enables complex aggregations or joins of input streams onto an output stream of processed data. 
 

<p>Traditional messaging models are queue and publish-subscribe. In a queue, each record goes to one consumer. In publish-subscribe, the record is received by all consumers.</p>

<p>The Consumer Group in Kafka is an abstraction that combines both models. Record processing can be load balanced among the members of a consumer group and Kafka allows you to broadcast messages to multiple consumer groups. It is the same publish-subscribe semantic where the subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process.</p>

<p>Popular use cases of Kafka include:</p>
 
   Traditional messaging, to decouple data producers from processors with better latency and scalability. 
   Site activity tracking with real-time publish-subscribe feeds. 
   As a replacement for file-based log aggregation, where event data becomes a stream of messages. 
   Data pipelines where data consumed from topics is transformed and fed to new topics. 
   As an external commit log for a distributed system. 
   As backend log storage for event sourcing applications, where each state change is logged in time order. 
 

 Microservices communication with Kafka 

<p>Let’s build a microservices architecture with JHipster and Kafka support. In this tutorial, you’ll create <code>store</code> and <code>alert</code> microservices. The store microservices will create and update store records. The <code>alert</code> microservice will receive update events from <code>store</code> and send an email alert.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prerequisites:</p>
   
     <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a> 
     <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">Docker 20.10.17</a> 
     <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js 16.17.0</a> 
     <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI 0.10.0</a> 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Install JHipster.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.9.3
</code>   

<p>The <code>--version</code> command should output something like this:</p>

   <code>$ jhipster --version
INFO! Using bundled JHipster
7.9.3
</code>   

<p>Create a directory for the project.</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-kafka
cd jhipster-kafka
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>apps.jdl</code> file that defines the store, alert, and gateway applications in JHipster Domain Language (JDL). Kafka integration is enabled by adding <code>messageBroker kafka</code> to the store and alert app definitions.</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName gateway,
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway,
    applicationType gateway,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    prodDatabaseType postgresql,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka,
    testFrameworks [cypress]
  }
  entities Store, StoreAlert
}

application {
  config {
    baseName store,
    packageName com.okta.developer.store,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    databaseType mongodb,
    devDatabaseType mongodb,
    prodDatabaseType mongodb,
    enableHibernateCache false,
    serverPort 8082,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
    messageBroker kafka
  }
  entities Store
}

application {
  config {
    baseName alert,
    packageName com.okta.developer.alert,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    serverPort 8082,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
    messageBroker kafka
  }
  entities StoreAlert
}

enum StoreStatus {
  OPEN,
  CLOSED
}

entity Store {
  name String required,
  address String required,
  status StoreStatus,
  createTimestamp Instant required,
  updateTimestamp Instant
}

entity StoreAlert {
  storeName String required,
  storeStatus String required,
  timestamp Instant required
}

microservice Store with store
microservice StoreAlert with alert
</code>   

<p>Now, in your <code>jhipster-kafka</code> folder, import this file with the following command:</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl apps.jdl
</code>   

 Configure microservices deployment with Docker Compose 

<p>In the project folder, create a sub-folder for Docker Compose and run JHipster’s <code>docker-compose</code> sub-generator.</p>

   <code>mkdir docker-compose
cd docker-compose
jhipster docker-compose
</code>   

<p>The generator will ask you to define the following things:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Type of gateway: JHipster gateway based on Spring Cloud Gateway 
   Leave the root directory for services as default: ../ 
   Which applications to include: gateway, store, alert 
   Which applications do you want to use with clustered databases: (none) 
   If monitoring should be enabled: No 
   Password for JHipster Registry: <code>&lt;default&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Almost when the generator completes, a warning shows in the output:</p>

   <code>WARNING! Docker Compose configuration generated, but no Jib cache found
If you forgot to generate the Docker image for this application, please run:
To generate the missing Docker image(s), please run:
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/alert
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/gateway
 ./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild in /home/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka/store
</code>   

<p>You will generate the images later, but first, let’s add some security and Kafka integration to your microservices.</p>

 Add OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication 

<p>This microservices architecture is set up to authenticate against Keycloak. Let’s update the settings to use Okta as the authentication provider.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Then, change the Redirect URIs to:</p>
   <code>http://localhost:8081/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc
</code>   
<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8761</code> for the Logout Redirect URIs.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct (see above, below are the default values) redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>In the project, create a <code>docker-compose/.env</code> file and add the following variables. For the values, use the settings from the Okta web application you created:</p>

   <code>OIDC_ISSUER_URI={yourIssuer}
OIDC_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and update the <code>SPRING_SECURITY_*</code> settings for the services <code>store-app</code>, <code>alert-app</code>, <code>gateway-app</code>, and <code>jhipster-registry</code>:</p>

   <code>- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=${OIDC_ISSUER_URI}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=${OIDC_CLIENT_ID}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=${OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}
</code>   

 Use Spring Cloud Config to override OIDC settings 

<p>An alternative to setting environment variables for each application in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> is to use Spring Cloud Config. JHipster Registry includes Spring Cloud Config, so it’s pretty easy to do.</p>

<p>Open <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and add your Okta settings there.</p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: /oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: {yourClientId}
            client-secret: {yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>The registry, gateway, store, and alert applications are all configured to read this configuration on startup.</p>

 Communicate between store and alert microservices 

<p>The JHipster generator adds a <code>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</code> dependency to applications that declare <code>messageBroker kafka</code> (in JDL), enabling the Spring Cloud Stream <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_main_concepts">programming model</a> with the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka.html#_usage_examples">Apache Kafka binder</a> for using Kafka as the messaging middleware.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Stream was recently added back to JHipster. Now, instead of working with Kafka Core APIs, we can use the binder abstraction, declaring input/output arguments in the code, and letting the specific binder implementation handle the mapping to the broker destination.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: At this moment, JHipster includes Spring Cloud Stream 3.2.4, which has <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-preface-notable-deprecations">deprecated</a> the annotation-based programming model, <code>@EnableBinding</code> and <code>@StreamListener</code> annotations, in favor of the functional programming model. Stay tuned for future JHipster updates.</p>

<p>For the sake of this example, update the <code>store</code> microservice to send a message to the <code>alert</code> microservice through Kafka, whenever a store entity is updated.</p>

<p>First, create an outbound binding for a new topic <code>store-alerts</code>. Add the interface <code>KafkaStoreAlertProducer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.config;

import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.Output;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;

public interface KafkaStoreAlertProducer {
    String CHANNELNAME = "binding-out-store-alert";

    @Output(CHANNELNAME)
    MessageChannel output();
}
</code>   
<p>Include the outbound binding in the <code>WebConfigurer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.config;

@EnableBinding({ KafkaSseConsumer.class, KafkaSseProducer.class, KafkaStoreAlertProducer.class })
@Configuration
public class WebConfigurer implements ServletContextInitializer {
...
</code>   

<p>Add the binding configuration to <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      ...
      bindings:
        ...
        binding-out-store-alert:
          destination: store-alerts-topic
          content-type: application/json
          group: store-alerts
</code>   

<p>In the <code>store</code> project, create an <code>AlertService</code> for sending the event details.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service;

import com.okta.developer.store.config.KafkaStoreAlertProducer;
import com.okta.developer.store.domain.Store;
import com.okta.developer.store.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageHeaders;
import org.springframework.messaging.support.GenericMessage;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.util.MimeTypeUtils;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Service
public class AlertService {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AlertService.class);

    private final MessageChannel output;

    public AlertService(@Qualifier(KafkaStoreAlertProducer.CHANNELNAME) MessageChannel output) {
        this.output = output;
    }

    public void alertStoreStatus(Store store) {
        try {
            StoreAlertDTO storeAlertDTO = new StoreAlertDTO(store);
            log.debug("Request the message : {} to send to store-alert topic ", storeAlertDTO);

            Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
            map.put(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, MimeTypeUtils.APPLICATION_JSON);
            MessageHeaders headers = new MessageHeaders(map);
            output.send(new GenericMessage&lt;&gt;(storeAlertDTO, headers));
        } catch (Exception e){
            log.error("Could not send store alert", e);
            throw new AlertServiceException(e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the referenced <code>AlertServiceException</code> class.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service;

public class AlertServiceException extends RuntimeException {

    public AlertServiceException(Throwable e) {
        super(e);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>And add a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> class in the <code>...service.dto</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.store.service.dto;

import com.okta.developer.store.domain.Store;

public class StoreAlertDTO {

    private String storeName;
    private String storeStatus;

    public StoreAlertDTO(Store store){
        this.storeName = store.getName();
        this.storeStatus = store.getStatus().name();
    }

    public String getStoreName() {
        return storeName;
    }

    public void setStoreName(String storeName) {
        this.storeName = storeName;
    }

    public String getStoreStatus() {
        return storeStatus;
    }

    public void setStoreStatus(String storeStatus) {
        this.storeStatus = storeStatus;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Inject the <code>AlertService</code> into the <code>StoreResource</code> API implementation, modifying its constructor. Also modify the <code>updateStore</code> call to publish a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> for the <code>alert</code> service:</p>

   <code>@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class StoreResource {

    ...
    private final StoreRepository storeRepository;
    private final AlertService alertService;

    public StoreResource(StoreRepository storeRepository, AlertService alertService) {
        this.storeRepository = storeRepository;
        this.alertService = alertService;
    }

    ...

    @PutMapping("/stores/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity&lt;Store&gt; updateStore(
        @PathVariable(value = "id", required = false) final String id,
        @Valid @RequestBody Store store
    ) throws URISyntaxException {
        ...

        Store result = storeRepository.save(store);

        log.debug("SEND store alert for Store: {}", store);
        alertService.alertStoreStatus(result);

        ...
    }

   ...
}
</code>   

 Enable debug logging in production 

<p>Since you are going to deploy the <code>prod</code> profile, let’s enable logging in production. Modify the <code>store/src/main/java/com/okta/.../config/LoggingAspectConfiguration.java</code> class:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class LoggingAspectConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Profile({JHipsterConstants.SPRING_PROFILE_DEVELOPMENT, JHipsterConstants.SPRING_PROFILE_PRODUCTION})
    public LoggingAspect loggingAspect(Environment env) {
        return new LoggingAspect(env);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>store/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> and change the log level to <code>DEBUG</code> for the store application:</p>

   <code>logging:
  level:
    ROOT: INFO
    tech.jhipster: INFO
    com.okta.developer.store: DEBUG
</code>   

 Add an <code>EmailService</code> to the alert microservice 

<p>Now let’s customize the <code>alert</code> microservice. First, add the consumer declaration <code>KafkaStoreAlertConsumer</code> to the config:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.config;

import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.Input;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;

public interface KafkaStoreAlertConsumer {
    String CHANNELNAME = "binding-in-store-alert";

    @Input(CHANNELNAME)
    MessageChannel input();
}
</code>   
<p>Include the binding in the <code>WebConfigurer</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.config;

@EnableBinding({ KafkaSseConsumer.class, KafkaSseProducer.class, KafkaStoreAlertConsumer.class })
@Configuration
public class WebConfigurer implements ServletContextInitializer {
...
</code>   

<p>Add the inbound binding configuration to <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        ...
        binding-in-store-alert:
          destination: store-alerts-topic
          content-type: application/json
          group: store-alerts
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>EmailService</code> to send the store update notification, using the Spring Framework’s <code>JavaMailSender</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

import com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.mail.SimpleMailMessage;
import org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSender;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmailService {

    private JavaMailSender emailSender;

    @Value("${alert.distribution-list}")
    private String distributionList;

    public EmailService(JavaMailSender emailSender){
        this.emailSender = emailSender;
    }

    public void sendSimpleMessage(StoreAlertDTO alertDTO){
        try {
            SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
            message.setTo(distributionList);
            message.setSubject("Store Alert: " + alertDTO.getStoreName());
            message.setText(alertDTO.getStoreStatus());
            message.setFrom("StoreAlert");
            emailSender.send(message);
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            throw new EmailServiceException(exception);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the referenced <code>EmailServiceException</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

public class EmailServiceException extends RuntimeException {

    public EmailServiceException(Exception exception) {
        super(exception);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StoreAlertDTO</code> class in the <code>...service.dto</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto;

public class StoreAlertDTO {

    private String storeName;
    private String storeStatus;

    public String getStoreName() {
        return storeName;
    }

    public void setStoreName(String storeName) {
        this.storeName = storeName;
    }

    public String getStoreStatus() {
        return storeStatus;
    }

    public void setStoreStatus(String storeStatus) {
        this.storeStatus = storeStatus;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Add a new property to <code>alert/src/main/resources/config/application.yml</code> and to <code>alert/src/test/resources/config/application.yml</code> for the destination email of the store alert.</p>

   <code>alert:
  distribution-list: {distributionListAddress}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You’ll need to set a value for the email (e.g. <code>list@email.com</code> will work) in <code>src/test/.../application.yml</code> for tests to pass. For Docker, you’ll override the <code>{distributionListAddress}</code> and <code>{username}</code> + <code>{password}</code> placeholder values with environment variables below.</p>

<p>Update <code>spring.mail.*</code> properties in <code>application-prod.yml</code> to set Gmail as the email service:</p>

   <code>spring:
  ...
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: {username}
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
</code>   

 Add a Kafka consumer to persist alert and send email 

<p>Create an <code>AlertConsumer</code> service to persist a <code>StoreAlert</code> and send the email notification when receiving an alert message through Kafka. Add <code>KafkaProperties</code>, <code>StoreAlertRepository</code>, and <code>EmailService</code> as constructor arguments. Then add a <code>start()</code> method to initialize the consumer and enter the processing loop.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.alert.service;

import com.okta.developer.alert.config.KafkaStoreAlertConsumer;
import com.okta.developer.alert.domain.StoreAlert;
import com.okta.developer.alert.repository.StoreAlertRepository;
import com.okta.developer.alert.service.dto.StoreAlertDTO;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.annotation.StreamListener;
import org.springframework.messaging.Message;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.time.Instant;
@Service
public class AlertConsumer {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AlertConsumer.class);

    private StoreAlertRepository storeAlertRepository;

    private EmailService emailService;

    public AlertConsumer(StoreAlertRepository storeAlertRepository, EmailService emailService) {
        this.storeAlertRepository = storeAlertRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    @StreamListener(value = KafkaStoreAlertConsumer.CHANNELNAME, copyHeaders = "false")
    public void consume(Message&lt;StoreAlertDTO&gt; message) {
        StoreAlertDTO dto = message.getPayload();
        log.info("Got message from kafka stream: {} {}", dto.getStoreName(), dto.getStoreStatus());
        try {
            StoreAlert storeAlert = new StoreAlert();
            storeAlert.setStoreName(dto.getStoreName());
            storeAlert.setStoreStatus(dto.getStoreStatus());
            storeAlert.setTimestamp(Instant.now());

            storeAlertRepository.save(storeAlert);
            emailService.sendSimpleMessage(dto);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            log.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: Any unhandled exception during message processing will make the service leave the consumer group. That’s why there’s code above that catches <code>Exception</code>.</p>

<p>As a last customization step, update the logging configuration the same way you did for the <code>store</code> microservice.</p>

 Microservices + Kafka container deployment 

<p>Modify <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and add the following environment variables for the <code>alert</code> application:</p>

   <code>- SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=${MAIL_USERNAME}
- SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=${MAIL_PASSWORD}
- ALERT_DISTRIBUTION_LIST=${DISTRIBUTION_LIST}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/.env</code> and add values for the new environment variables:</p>

   <code>MAIL_USERNAME={yourGmailAccount}
MAIL_PASSWORD={yourPassword}
DISTRIBUTION_LIST={anotherEmailAccount}
</code>   

<p>Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then generate the Docker image for the <code>store</code> microservice. Run the following command from the <code>store</code> directory.</p>

   <code>./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
# `npm run java:docker` is a shortcut for the above command
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you’re using Apple Silicon, you’ll need to use <code>npm run java:docker:arm64</code>.</p>

<p>Repeat for the <code>alert</code> and <code>gateway</code> apps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before you run your microservices architecture, make sure you have enough RAM allocated. Docker Desktop’s default is 2GB, I recommend 8GB. This setting is under Docker &gt; Resources &gt; Advanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, run everything using Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker-compose
docker compose up
</code>   

<p>You will see a huge amount of logging while each service starts. Wait a minute or two, then open <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and log in with your Okta account. This is the JHipster Registry which you can use to monitor your apps’ statuses. Wait for all the services to be up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open a new terminal window and tail the <code>alert</code> microservice logs to verify it’s processing <code>StoreAlert</code> records:</p>

   <code>docker logs -f docker-compose-alert-1 | grep Consumer
</code>   

<p>You should see log entries indicating the consumer group to which the <code>alert</code> microservice joined on startup:</p>

   <code>2022-09-05 15:20:44.146  INFO 1 --- [           main] org.apache.kafka.clients.Metadata        : [Consumer clientId=consumer-store-alerts-4, groupId=store-alerts] Cluster ID: pyoOBVa3T3Gr1VP3rJBOlQ

</code>   

<p>Once everything is up, go to the gateway at <code>http://localhost:8081</code> and log in. Create a store entity and then update it. The <code>alert</code> microservice should log entries when processing the received message from the <code>store</code> service.</p>

   <code>2022-09-05 18:08:31.546  INFO 1 --- [container-0-C-1] c.o.d.alert.service.AlertConsumer        : Got message from kafka stream: Candle Shop CLOSED
</code>   

<p>If you see a <code>MailAuthenticationException</code> in the <code>alert</code> microservices log when attempting to send the notification, it might be your Gmail security configuration.</p>

   <code>alert-app_1           | org.springframework.mail.MailAuthenticationException: Authentication failed; nested exception is javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at

alert-app_1           | 	at org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl.doSend(JavaMailSenderImpl.java:440)
</code>   

<p>To enable the login from the <code>alert</code> application, go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">https://myaccount.google.com</a> and then choose the Security tab. Turn on 2-Step Verification for your account. In the section Signing in to Google, choose App passwords and create a new <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833">app password</a>. In the Select app dropdown set Other (Custom name) and type the name for this password. Click Generate and copy the password. Update <code>docker-compose/.env</code> and set the app password for Gmail authentication.</p>

   <code>MAIL_PASSWORD={yourAppPassword}
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT: Don’t forget to delete the app password once the test is done.</p>

<p>Stop all the containers with CTRL+C and restart again with <code>docker compose up</code>.
Update a store again and you should receive an email with the store’s status this time.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, authentication (of producers and consumers), authorization (of read/write operations), and encryption (of data) were not covered, as security in Kafka is optional. See <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security">Kafka’s documentation on security</a> to learn how to enable these features.</p>

				  Trust Registries Tweetstorm 
<p>Darrell’s tweetstorm over the weekend has been getting a lot of attention (<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1569093372920614914.html">Threadreader unroll here)</a>. We want to start a conversation on <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> and get people thinking about how Trust Registries will help answer the hard questions an ecosystem needs to create a whole experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He points out the easy questions we already know to ask:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>Where do the systems you want to work with go to get the answers to questions like

How do I know can trust

- this Issuer for that Credential?
- trust that Verifier?
- that Wallet App?

				 However, there is much more to explore – many other questions are just as essential. We are starting the v2.0 of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> over at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a> to further investigate some of these questions.<p></p>
<p>A few things to mull over are below:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>questions like...

What credential formats does the ecosystem define?

-- NO - there is no interoperable standard for real-world use of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerifiableCredentials?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VerifiableCredentials</a>, so you can't say, "just use W3C Verifiable Credentials".

				 <blockquote>
<p>How do you do delegation in your ecosystem? Is it baked into your DID Method?

How does someone confirm delegation is still valid (revocation may help - it may not)?

				 <blockquote>
<p>How do you support revocation in your ecosystem - if you need it?

most don't - do your homework on that one - i.e. not more later.

				 <p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> will discuss the questions above at the end of this month. We are starting the Trust Registry Protocol Specification next week, and you are welcome to join us at the Task Force meeting. We would love to have individuals with diverse backgrounds join us and share their knowledge and expertise.

<p>The Department of State’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) is sponsoring a training series to counter malware created by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The nine-day training program will be offered to six partner nations from Africa, Asia, and the western hemisphere, predominantly targeting employees and their public sector equivalent from security incident response teams. Increased training for cybersecurity across the globe is a key part of the US commitment to promoting a stable and reliable internet for all. In recent years malicious cyber activities by the DPRK have increasingly threatened the integrity and stability of the global financial systems, <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA5MDcuNjMzNTk2MTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLWNlcnQuY2lzYS5nb3YvbmNhcy9hbGVydHMvYWEyMC0yMzlhIn0.M6wyfUs5gjZ0zycBPrxoefXP6VQKXRnJlUZWxaAoOdE%2Fs%2F1436012980%2Fbr%2F143636521009-l&amp;data=05%7C01%7CSimmonsJX%40state.gov%7Cb3d65a3d286040f5242d08da910699b1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637981754784879132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wwhcgMgpmfPRnPZ3%2FocV537bJCS9uAi4HAoZW86RpL0%3D&amp;reserved=0">even stealing directly from banks.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/patreon-lays-off-its-entire-security-team">Patreon Lays Off Its Entire Security Team</a></p>
<p>This is probably the biggest news in the security space this week, and it has been covered by several news outlets. Here, we have a brief summary by Nathaniel Mott, a contributing writer to PCmag. While some believe this to be a particularly bold move, Patreon claims that this will in no way impact their ability to provide a secure platform and that they have partnered with a number of external organizations to continue to develop their security abilities. Security is an extremely important aspect of any business or product, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ%C2%A0">can be very costly when it goes wrong.</a> One great aspect of verifiable credentials that Indicio is always stressing is their ability to tie into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RQ3-YHaVE&amp;list=PL3LvHy3eIPsmb-mFf_kZickFs51T1hGzq&amp;index=2">Zero Trust</a> and your security stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/security-awareness-training-must-evolve-to-align-with-growing-e-commerce-security-threats">Security Awareness Training Must Evolve to Align With Growing E-Commerce Security Threats</a></p>
<p>Digital transformation is creating new security headaches for e-commerce, says Bruno Farinelli, a Fraud Analytics Manager for ClearSale. He points to shipping fraud, email phishing attacks, and ransomware and malware that exploit hybrid and remote workforce trends as the major trends. Citing TransUnion’s “<a href="https://content.transunion.com/v/2022-global-digital-fraud-trends-report">2022 Global Digital Fraud Trends</a>” Farinelli points out that shipping fraud has skyrocketed year-on-year since 2019, with package- rerouting scams exploiting good customer service practices. Similarly, business email compromise is a growing problem, with hackers pretending to be trusted suppliers or vendors. In this fascinating article, Farinelli argues that e-commerce businesses need to see employee security awareness as a process rather than a one-off training, as the points of attack and the means of defrauding business are constantly evolving. While this is ideal, it is unrealistic to expect employees to maintain sufficient security vigilance to defeat fraud. The reality is that all these problems can be solved with verifiable credentials that provide the kind of reliable authentication within a Zero-Trust framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/cyber-insecurity-healthcare/">‘Cyber insecurity’ in healthcare is leading to increased patient mortality rates</a></p>
<p>Esther Shein, a freelance writer for TechRepublic, summarizes a <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/threat-reports/pfpt-us-tr-cyber-insecurity-healthcare-ponemon-report.pdf">recent report</a> that found ransomware attacks are actively delaying procedures and tests, leading to increased complications and worse patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article breaks down statistics from the report, some of the most staggering being:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The study surveyed 641 healthcare IT and security practitioners, and more than 20% of organizations that experienced the most common types of attacks (cloud compromise, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ransomware-cheat-sheet-everything-you-need-to-know/">ransomware</a>, supply chain and business email compromise) saw increased patient mortality rates. 
 Healthcare organizations have an average of more than 26,000 network-connected devices, only 51% include them in their cybersecurity strategy. 
 Ransomware attacks are most likely to have a negative impact on patient care, leading to delays in procedures or tests in 64% of the organizations. 
 Only 59% address employees’ lack of awareness, with 63% conducting regular training and awareness programs and 59% resorting to monitoring employee actions. 
 
<p>Shein says that training and awareness programs are the top two defenses for healthcare providers, but lack of funding and resources is a consistent hurdle for security teams. The article leaves us with Ryan Witt, healthcare cybersecurity leader at Proofpoint, weighing in on the state of cybersecurity in healthcare – “Healthcare has traditionally fallen behind other sectors in addressing vulnerabilities to the growing number of cybersecurity attacks, and this inaction has a direct negative impact on patients’ safety and wellbeing… as long as cybersecurity remains a low priority, healthcare providers will continue to endanger their patients.”</p>

<p>As you can see from the above articles good training is important for both the organization and the employees that help make it successful. For those of you interested in training your own teams in decentralized identity, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the workshops offered by Indicio. <a href="https://indicio.tech/new-indicio-executive-workshop-provides-essential-grounding-in-digital-identity-the-business-and-investors-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity/">The Business and Investor’s Guide to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> is a great place to start for leadership or investors looking to understand the technology and be able to talk through their ideas with an industry expert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Signing documents involves a lot of effort in the office: documents travel back and forth between departments, must be printed out and copied. If the parties involved are also in different locations and for example suppliers are involved, the process of signing becomes even more time-consuming and complicated. For a long time, this posed challenges for those involved in the circular economy. <br>Thanks to the cooperation of <a href="http://www.wandrei.de">Dr. Ing. Wandrei</a>, <a href="https://authada.de/en/">AUTHADA</a> and <a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">InfoCert</a>, this process has been optimised and an important milestone in the digitalisation of the circular economy has been achieved for all parties involved.</p>



<p>Since 2010, according to the electronic waste records procedure (eANV), actors in the circular economy in Germany such as carriers and disposers have already been obliged to sign disposal records and consignment notes digitally and by means of a remote signature, the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES). Until now, however, this was only possible in a roundabout way – with card readers. A procedure that no longer reflected the actual processes and necessities in an up-to-date manner. </p>



<p>Dr. Ing. Wandrei, a Berlin software company with 30 years old experience with software solutions characterised by cloud capability, platform-independent standards and a range of interfaces, took on this problem and looked for partners with whom it could further develop and optimise a mobile solution for NSUITE for the electronic waste records procedure (eANV) and expand it to include a hardware-independent QES.</p>



<p>The sticking point during the search was that most signature service providers only offered the possibility to sign Word or PDF documents via remote signature. AUTHADA and InfoCert provides a solution where documents could be signed in the prescribed XML format, becoming two perfect partners for Dr. Ing. Wandrei</p>



 Uncomplicated and fast with new technology 



<p>Thanks to the technology from AUTHADA and InfoCert implemented in NSUITE, the signature process in the circular economy is now faster and more streamlined. Drivers no longer have to carry signature cards and expensive hardware, go to the office or call an employee from the office. Instead, the signature can now be done on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets with the new NSUITE.mobile product, with a consequent streamlining of the entire process.</p>

<p>Web3 developers can now grant access and verify user eligibility based on private user data.</p><p><br>Zug, Switzerland – 14 September, 2022 – Dock, a pioneer in the <a href="http://dock.io/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a> space, today announced the availability of <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a> on <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/">Auth0 Marketplace</a>, a catalog of trusted technology integrations to extend the functionality of Auth0’s customer identity management platform. Dock’s Web3 ID enables privacy-preserving user verification for Web3.<br><br>Web3 ID is a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that allows developers to grant access and verify end-user eligibility by requesting private data from users' non-custodial identity wallet apps. Web3 developers can now implement privacy-preserving age verification for Web3 gaming, gambling and entertainment; verify eligibility to enter Metaverse and IRL (in real life) experiences based on private data; or verify token ownership without the users revealing all their wallets’ contents. Dock’s Web3 ID complements Auth0 extensible identity, and the ease in which customers can seamlessly integrate adjacent technologies to facilitate the successful execution of larger projects such as digital transformation, threat detection, compliance, and customer conversion. </p><p>Web3 introduced the ability to sign in using cryptocurrency wallets. But with crypto wallets, all the user data that a developer can request and verify has to be publicly available on the blockchain. Dock's Web3 ID gives developers the ability to verify private user data. With this integration, Dock brings decentralization, ownership of their identifiers, and the ability to privately sign in to apps and services to Auth0 customers.</p><p>“Dock Web3 ID was built to provide all the convenience of OAuth style login while also ensuring that individuals don’t leak their data, and remain in control of their login credentials at all times. Working with the industry-leading customer identity platform, Auth0, is a key aspect of Dock’s growth strategy as their reach amongst development teams is extensive and we anticipate this collaboration paving the way for Dock Web3 ID to be used at scale.” said Nick Lambert, Dock’s CEO.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/">Auth0 Marketplace</a>. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. “After speaking with many customers, we have identified the types of integrations that matter to them, and we are so thrilled to have Dock’s Web3 ID as a vetted and valuable vendor in Auth0 Marketplace.” </p><p>Auth0 reviews partner integration functionality, and makes available integrations that are easy to discover and integrate for customers. Partners can participate in the growing demand for digital identity solutions and increase their visibility as part of Auth0 Marketplace, and can learn more here: <a href="https://auth0.com/partners">https://auth0.com/partners</a>.</p><p>About Dock</p><p>Dock brings decentralization, ownership of digital identifiers and privacy-preserving user verification to identity management. Dock's Decentralized Identity Platform provides a highly secure and scalable solution for businesses and developers to issue and verify digital identity credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology. Enabling organizations and individuals to create and share verified data.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href="https://dock.io/">https://dock.io</a></p>

<p>The project focuses on a versatile open source data aggregation system for the Ocean Protocol Community</p><p><a href="https://www.directimo.com/">Directimo</a> — a company driven by the mission to create a database with verified properties for the proptech industry, is the latest grantee to benefit from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Shipyard</a> — the $2M grants program for entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>Directimo will develop an open-source parsing system able to gather valuable data from any public website for anyone in the Ocean Protocol community. The project aims to deliver the foundation to scrape most of the websites around the globe by developing a tool to extract data from various sites for further processing. The solution will minimize the programming knowledge that developers need to have to extract data from multiple sites in parallel.</p><p>This kind of data will provide access to powerful insights from the market. For instance, the tool can be used to collect daily inputs from a real estate agency, extract all product data from competitors in one go, including full pricing/product description, category, and brand information and the data can be plotted to discover new trends and create reports. Directimo will support all users in bootstrapping their projects and finding solutions for specific use&nbsp;cases.</p><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“The data parsing tools directimo are building are a great match for Ocean Shipyard. We are particularly excited because Directimo tools will be available to the entire Ocean community and will dramatically help onboard quality data onto&nbsp;Ocean.”</blockquote><blockquote>Alexandru Dan, CTO of Directimo further commented:</blockquote><blockquote>“Web scrapers automatically collect information and data that are usually only accessible by visiting a website in a browser. By doing this autonomously, web scraping scripts open up a world of possibilities in data mining, data analysis, statistical analysis and much more. Everyone with some basic computer knowledge will be able to clone the open source project and start a journey into web parsing and data aggregation in order to collect meaningful information from the&nbsp;web.”</blockquote><p>The project will employ advanced technologies including Python, Redis and Kafka to create a distributed on-demand scraping cluster. The goal is to distribute URLs among many waiting spyder instances, whose requests are coordinated via&nbsp;Redis.</p><p>The benefit of using a distributed system is that it will enable communication between spyders and generate flows. If a user wants to obtain the title from a paginated list, they will be able to use 2 spyders: one to open each page and one to instruct the other spyder to take the titles. Using Kafka Directimo will also allow the system to track the status of each request and trigger them if the configuration is&nbsp;faulty.</p><p>The goal is to create customizable spyders, allow users to write their own and eventually pave the way for future orchestration. All required data will be exported to a database in order to create specific reports for the users. The goal is to leverage this to further facilitate a real-estate model that’s scalable on a global level and a platform that integrates marketing tools for 4x superior conversions, lead nurturing and buyer advisory services.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Applications for the next wave of Shipyard contenders are opening on September 15. Start filling out your application today, visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/new-grantee-directimo-joins-ocean-shipyard-1437e6338f5e">New grantee Directimo joins Ocean Shipyard</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with David Birch, Principal at 15 Mb and author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. 
<p>In episode 75 David Birch discusses digital currencies – the differences between digital currency and cryptocurrency, the role in which identity plays in digital currency and the importance on identity verification within digital currencies.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Digital currency needs some form of digital identity, that might actually drive digital identity forward and help digital identity to develop into the mass market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>David G.W Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. Principal at 15Mb, his advisory company, he is Global Ambassador for the secure electronic transactions consultancy, Consult Hyperion, Fintech Ambassador for Digital Jersey and Non-Executive Chair at Digiseq Ltd. He is an internationally-recognised thought leader in digital identity and digital money. Ranked one of the top 100 fintech influencers for 2021, previously named one of the global top 15 favourite sources of business information by Wired magazine and one of the top ten most influential voices in banking by Financial Brand, he created one of the top 25 “must read” financial IT blogs and was found by PR Daily to be one of the top ten Twitter accounts followed by innovators (along with Bill Gates and Richard Branson).</p>
<p>His latest book “The Currency Cold War—Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony” (published in May 2020) “paints a fascinating and stimulating picture of the future of the world of digital payments and its possible impact on the wider global and economic orders” – Philip Middleton, OMFIF Digital Monetary Institute. His previous book “Before Babylon, Beyond Bitcoin: From money we understand to money that understands us” was published in June 2017 with a foreword by Andrew Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England. The LSE Review of Books said the book should be “widely read by graduate students of finance, financial law and related topics as well as policy makers involved in financial regulation”.&nbsp; The London Review of Books called his earlier book “Identity is the New Money” fresh, original, wide-ranging and “the best book on general issues around new forms of money”.</p>

<p>David Birch: Hello, Oscar. Thank you so much for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure talking with you and super interesting topic we’re going to discuss today about digital money. So yeah, let’s start a conversation. Let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear first, a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>David: Oh, sure. OK. Well, my background originally was in secure communications, and originally for military and government purposes. And then, of course, in the ’80s, that became part in the financial services sector was developing a networking and suddenly those skills were needed in financial services. And then I began to specialise in the area of payments, which are very, very interesting to me.</p>
<p>But after a while, I began to realise that a lot of the problems that we were facing in the payment sector, things like fraud and so on, were really not payment problems, they were really identity problems. And so, I became very fascinated by the world of digital identity, and how to, if you like, re-imagine identity for an online and interconnected world. And so that’s how I came to originally edit a book. And then I came to write a book about it.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, I’ve become… well, I’ve become more convinced than ever, that digital identity is the fundamental enabler for all sorts of new business, new ways of working and new society, but also a fundamental problem, because we don’t seem to have been able to fix it. And we all still struggle with passwords and logging on and scamming and fraud and all sorts of things. So yeah, so I began to realise that digital identity was really the fundamental problem needed to be solved. And then I became very interested in how to solve it in different ways.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, super interesting. And as you said, there are problems that are dragging for many years already and we’re still dealing with those. But you are working with the very latest, as I said earlier, not many people here, what we’re going to discuss today, particularly in about digital money, there is a type called CBDCs digital currencies. So, could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>David: People are very familiar with cryptocurrencies. And there’s lots of fun and interesting things happening in the world of cryptocurrencies. I mean, there’s also lots of crazy things happening and lots of and lots of criminal things happening. But nonetheless, the technology is very interesting. But cryptocurrencies are valued by the market. They have no inherent value. There’s– A Bitcoin is worth what people will pay for a Bitcoin. It’s not backed by anything.</p>
<p>A digital currency is something that’s backed by something. So, for example, you could have a digital currency like the circle, you know, USDC, where you have cryptographic tokens, but they’re redeemable for one US dollar. You could have tokens that are backed by commodities, like oil or gold or something like that. Or you could have tokens that are backed by goods and services, or future products and services, all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But in my very nerdish distinction, cryptocurrencies are backed by supply and demand, only. Whereas digital currencies are backed by something that has value, which might be another currency, it might be a commodity, it might be a company, or you know, whatever. Now, within that world of digital currencies, lots of central banks around the world are starting to think, “Well, we want our citizens to have access to new innovation, new ways of doing things, better ways of doing business. So perhaps we should look at making digital versions of our currencies.” And these are what people call digital fiat, because central bank currencies are what is called fiat currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies, CBDCs. I’ll use that latter word, because that’s what people– I mean, I know it’s longer, but that’s what people have come to use.</p>
<p>So, when we’re talking about Central Bank Digital Currencies, we’re talking about using some of the technologies of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets and decentralised finance and all that kind of thing. But we’re using them to transport these tokens which are backed by something else. And if you think about it, I mean the reason why lots of people want to do that is because it can be much more efficient to trade values across distributed ledgers in a decentralised manner, using decentralised finance protocols. You can easily see why this is.</p>
<p>Because after all, if let’s say, you buy a share in Apple from me, for you to get that share in Apple involves all sorts of third parties in different layers, you have brokers and dealers and market makers and front office and back office, and middle office, settlement and reconciliation, clearing, you know, you have lots of things that have to happen. But if I send you a token, that’s worth one share in Apple, it just goes from my wallet to your wallet. So, the financial services people, the serious financial services people are very interested in this because it’s a much more cost-effective way of doing business, not because of they have any ideological commitments but because it’s a lower cost way of doing business.</p>
<p>So Central Bank Digital Currencies exist in that world. And you know, the idea that you and I might trade through some protocols, in some sort of decentralised finance market, and I send you my token that represents an Apple share, and you send me some tokens that represent dollars. That’s not crazy. That’s where I think we’re going. And I think that’s what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, seeing as a token, something simple one– something simple that can be, as you said, given directly from one person to another, it simplifies a lot what– how things are doing today, as you say, with the example of buying– you sell me, for instance, an Apple share, indeed. How does that token goes from you to me? For instance, I read one of your articles and you mentioned that it has to be offline, or not, it’s like device to device, or that’s known as…</p>
<p>David: Yes. So, this is– that’s a slightly different argument. So, if we say, well, OK, a Central Bank Digital Currency is a good thing. It would be nice if we had tokens that were pounds or dollars, pesos that we could exchange with each other. That’s good. But actually, if a central bank is going to provide those, and it’s going to provide them for all its citizens, not just some people that have nice computers and high-speed broadband, if it’s going to provide those for all of its citizens as a potential alternative to cash, then it has to satisfy some additional criteria. And in particular, it has to be able to work where there are no networks.</p>
<p>So, if you and I – I mean I always take a simple example, which is car parking. If I go to the underground car park, I want my car to be able to use digital currency to pay for its parking place. But in the underground car park, there’s no mobile signal. So, it’s annoying, when you try to use apps and things like that. A digital currency that’s going to be a cash alternative has to be able to function in a device-to-device mode, when there’s no mobile network, no internet, possibly even no electricity.</p>
<p>I should be able to transfer money from my phone to a merchant’s phone so that I can buy some milk, even when there are no networks, perhaps because of there’s a natural disaster or power failures or so on. Because otherwise, you’re not really providing a real alternative to cash. If it’s a real alternative to cash, it has to work everywhere all the time. And this means it has to operate in a device-to-device mode, so that I can send money from my USB stick to your phone, like direct by NFC or tapping them or I mean, whatever, you know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it has to work with or without internet, as you said, right? Be the replacement of cash.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And to also clarify, because many people have been, not only talking but also buying and selling cryptocurrencies, well until very recently, but yeah, it’s a term that has been used a lot in the last year. People get more familiar, maybe not everybody understand it but yeah, we have an idea what is a cryptocurrency. What are the main differences? You already mentioned a bit, but let’s say the top differences between cryptocurrency like the Bitcoin and the CBDC.</p>
<p>David: Well, like I said, cryptocurrencies don’t have anything behind them. They’re only valuable according to what people will pay for them. Their value is set by supply and demand. But digital currencies have a backing. And in the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, that’s central bank money. So, if the Bank of England issues a Central Bank Digital Currency, that Central Bank Digital Currency will be backed by Sterling. You’ll be able to take your Central Bank Digital Currency tokens and get Sterling for them. They’ll be a reserve in Sterling. The real difference between cryptocurrencies and digital currencies is that digital currencies have a backing. There’s some asset sitting behind them that you can have access to. And in the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, that Central Bank money.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. That’s a core difference. OK, thank you for clarifying that again. And also, cryptocurrencies, well, I would say, anybody could create a cryptocurrency, right? Basically, you can. That’s why there are so many, too many. And many come and go. That’s how it is. But of course, the CBDC is very different that way. So, there will be rules on that. So are there already regulation rules on that, or what kind of regulation would come in?</p>
<p>David: So, in general, we need proper regulation of the whole sector, of course. But many of these finance people I’ve spoken to have said that when there is appropriate regulation in place, they intend to tokenize everything, equities, bonds, commodities, everything. Because trading tokens is a more efficient way of trading. So, lots of people want that regulatory structure to come into place.</p>
<p>In the case of Central Bank Digital Currencies, you can already see what that should be like, because in Europe, we already have the example of the electronic money regulations. We can already issue electronic money against reserves that are sufficient quality, what you call tier one capital or HQLA (High Quality Liquid Assets). So, we can sort of see what that regulation should look like. Basically, anyone will be able to issue a currency provided they have this backing. And in the particular case of Central Bank Digital Currency, I mean, bear in mind that no central banks really want to issue this to customers directly. They want to do it through intermediaries, like banks.</p>
<p>Any digital pound token that you hold, will be backed by a Bank of England pound. I imagine. I mean, who knows what exactly those regulations will look like. But I imagine those regulations will say that you’re not allowed to charge fees on transferring in and out, I think it will have to sort of say that. You know, I don’t know exactly what the regulations will be. But I can sort of see roughly what they will be. And in that case, I assume, and I think a lot of central banks assume this, the reason that those digital currencies will become worthwhile and useful, isn’t to replicate what we already have. Like, I don’t need digital currency to go to the supermarket. I already have a debit card, it works fine. You know, that’s not the issue.</p>
<p>But the potential for innovation with those currencies, I think is very real. So, if you imagine I mean, some people talk sort of loosely about imagining money with an API. And I think that’s an interesting way of thinking about it. If you have cash that has an API, then that would mean that there will be a whole, lots of creativity could come in that space. I’m sure even now, you know, students in a lab somewhere could be building some terrific new products and services. And you know, maybe I’m too old to imagine what those will be. But I sort of think of things like micro payments, I think will be a good example. But the idea of the regulation is not to create something which allows us to do what we do now. But to put in place a platform for innovation, new ways of doing things, new products and services in the future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. One you already mentioned, you know, you are on the underground parking, yeah and you cannot use internet to pay electronically. There are many others like cases there’s no other solution today. Yeah, I guess that the most interesting thing to hear now is also what is the role of identity in this type of Central Bank Digital Currency?</p>
<p>David: Well, look, I mean, it’s very hard to imagine. It’s very hard for me to imagine that central banks will allow unlimited amounts of anonymous digital currency into circulation. And that would be catastrophic, because it would enable the criminals and terrorists and oligarchs to be free of any kind of control. And I don’t think any of us would want to live in that kind of society.</p>
<p>So therefore, there must be some kind of identity in the digital currency space. And in fact, I’d go further than that – we want some kind of digital identity in that space. It’s a good thing. And actually, the need, because digital currency needs some form of digital identity, that might actually drive digital identity forward and help digital identity to develop into the mass market.</p>
<p>Now, exactly what form that digital identity will take, that’s a very interesting subject for discussion. Should it be pseudonymous in some way? Who should know who these identities are? Who should be able to follow the transactions and manage them in this kind of thing? Those are complicated discussions, much too complicated just for a podcast. But you see what I’m driving at. There has to be some kind of digital identity.</p>
<p>And therefore, it’s good to start the discussion now, and bring the stakeholders together so that the stakeholders, and stakeholders I mean, not just banks and central banks, but I mean, law enforcement and citizens groups and lawyers and regulators. There are lots of people, because there are many issues around this to do with financial inclusion and this kind of thing. There are lots of issues that need to be resolved to get a Central Bank Digital Currency together. Identity is a really important part of that. And I think it’s useful to begin that discussion now so that people can have an educated and informed debate on how exactly that digital currency should work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. I agree with that is a topic that yeah, not only people are talking about. And it’s, yeah, I think it’s going to happen. I think it’s something that you, every time you write, you say this is going to happen. From what I see, you could imagine from that not a desire option that this data currency is – it’s like cash, completely anonymous, going to pseudonymous and going to verify identity. It’s something still we don’t know who would verify. But yeah, it’s something– I agree with you there’s a lot of discussion have to be done now.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I’m not saying, I’m not saying I know exactly what all the answer to that should be Oscar, like, where exactly we should set the dial? I do feel that we need to have an informed debate about where to go. I think the people who are the extremists, the people who say that digital cash should be completely anonymous are clearly wrong.</p>
<p>But simultaneously, the people who say that every transaction should be traced and monitored, they’re probably wrong as well. We need to figure out exactly where the balance lies. And I don’t think that decision should be left to technologists, like me, I think that decision should involve civil society. And it will take some time, people like the Bank of England are saying that a Central Bank Digital Currency could be sort of five years away. I agree with them. But you know, it could easily take five years to work out all of these issues as to how exactly it should all work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it can be, as you said, five years and still, do you know, in some countries there is more progress or more work on that, or how is it around the world?</p>
<p>David: Well, look, I mean, I think, you know, in different parts of the world, it’s progressing in different ways, because there are different cultural attitudes to how this should all work. So, what people in America might want and what people in China might want, will be very different, I think with this sort of thing. So, around the world, it’s progressing in different ways.</p>
<p>In the sort of developed countries, I think that those debates actually have some time to go, I really do. I don’t think it’s going to happen tomorrow. It’s just too complicated and too important to get those decisions right. Decisions that we make about how exactly is Central Bank Digital Currency going to work? These are important decisions that have ramifications for a long time. So, I am a big fan of Central Bank Digital Currency. I want to see it, but I don’t need to see it now. I need to see it; I need to see it in the future working in such a way as to benefit everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And I guess when you say, of course, some countries have more progress and Central Bank have more progress than others, of course, the ones who, yeah, have a right solution first, also we’ll take advantage like, that’s what I can– I could foresee. Yeah, it’s very difficult to see the future. What is your best way of foreseeing the first implementation, what kind of… yeah, how would you see it in practice?</p>
<p>David: We’re already seeing the pilot implementations in China, implementations in other places around the world. I think in the US and in the UK, my feeling is that we will choose privacy-enhancing technologies to be part of the infrastructure. So, if you talk to the technologists, they already have techniques, cryptographic blinding, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, this kind of thing. They already know how to do things in a more private way. What we need to decide is how exactly those will all come together to form the infrastructure.</p>
<p>But I’m actually quite optimistic about it, Oscar, because I think those technologies are already there. They already work. It could be that the legislators and the regulators may not understand how powerful those tools are or what they can do. But I do feel that we have the tools that we need. So once these stakeholders can come together and say, how anonymous or how non-anonymous it needs to be, then I think we can implement the relevant digital identity infrastructure. I think we already have all the technology; we need to do that. So yes, it will take a while, but I’m optimistic.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, there are already some pilots in some countries. Interesting. Definitely have to… yeah, interesting for everybody, I think, to have a look at those. And yeah, be prepared. Yeah. Because I think no matter which job functions, we are, I think we have to, as you say, not only technologists take part into making the decision how this system is going to be designed. Yeah, definitely very difficult to see the future. But we’ll see quite a lot progress in, as you say, in five years from now.</p>
<p>Final question I would like to ask you, David, for all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>David: I think for most businesses that I’m involved with and because I do a lot of work in finance and payments, I think for most businesses, what they need to do is to have a strategy towards digital currency. They don’t need to implement digital currency right now, it’s downstream. But they have to have a strategy because we need them to provide input into that stakeholder consultation process. So, it makes sense for retailers, for people in the value chain acquires, issuers processes, governments, law enforcement, it makes sense for them to have their strategy towards digital currency, because we need that strategy as input.</p>
<p>So just because it’s not going to happen for four or five years, well, four or five years is not a long time if you’re a bank. So, what I would say to them is, you don’t have to do anything about digital currency tomorrow, but you do have to start building a strategy towards digital currency. I hope that’s helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I think if you’re– I agree with having a strategy, preparing for the next 5, 10 years when this will for sure happen. OK, well, thank you very much, David. It’s super interesting this conversation about the Central Bank Digital Currency. Definitely, we’re going to hear more and more in the coming months and years. Please let us know, for someone who like to get in touch with you follow you, what are the best ways?</p>

BOOOST recently released its <a href="https://www.booost.live/files/BOOOST%20Litepaper.pdf">litepaper</a> which you can find on its&nbsp;website.</p><p>AERGO has 3 key features; SQL base, D-DPoS (deterministic) consensus and Merkle Bridge. It is well known for being the leading hybrid blockchain for enterprises. In living up to its name, AERGO has built its partnership and use-cases with numerous companies.</p><p>From Dec. 2014 (even before Ethereum appeared), AERGO’s main aim was to become the de-facto blockchain for enterprises. Recognizing companies’ need for processing large volumes of data in real time with SQL/JDBC, AERGO targeted the private blockchain market specifically. This is where AERGO provides a conducive environment for traditional businesses to create their own mainnet immediately. AERGO’s sidechain allows enterprises to connect with AERGO’s public blockchain based on SQL’s high compatibility. Lastly, the Merkle Bridge that facilitates interoperability and asset transfer between each blockchain and sidechain allows AERGO-enabled enterprises to create their own blockchain and manage it flexibly. In summary, AERGO’s public mainnet acts as a kind of central dogma for sidechains.</p><p>During KBW 2022, AERGO was introduced as a ‘Layer 1.5’. The main reason AERGO is unique enough to be called a ‘Layer 1.5’ is due to its versatility. In other words, AERGO has both the characteristics of a Layer 1 and&nbsp;2.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that AERGO has a public chain with its own consensus structure like other layer 1s. AERGO also has layer 2 advantages — such as high ETH compatibility, low fees and high TPS — and characteristic of layer 2s which not all data is stored in a single chain but through each sidechains.</p><p>In summary, AERGO allows users to: <br> 1) configure on-demand sidechains;<br> 2) interconnect each sidechain through AERGO public; and <br> 3) provide interoperability with large blockchains such as&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>AERGO is an accessible smart contract platform for enterprises. Furthermore, AERGO enables enterprises to anchor data easily and transfer assets to a public chain by connecting the private chains in a single sidechain form. AERGO SQL, a smart contract engine, supports connecting existing DBs around the private&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Going forward, AERGO aims to expand its service scope for not only enterprises but also individual users, allowing for the issuing and utilisation of various tokens / STO / NFT / SBT, etc between all&nbsp;Layers.</p><p>These plans will be embodied through the upcoming AERGO&nbsp;Dapps.</p><p>아르고는 지난 8월 7일부터 14일까지 진행된 Korea Blockchain Week(KBW)에 공식 파트너로 참여했습니다. 아르고는 이번 행사에서 기존 파트너와 구축해온 다양한 블록체인 생태계를 소개하고, 아르고 체인을 기반으로 하는 최초의 Live-2-Earn 앱인<a href="https://www.booost.live/"> BOOOS</a>T, 디파이 서비스 <a href="https://plusfi.net/">Plusfi</a>, NFT 마켓플레이스인 <a href="https://cccv.to/nft">CCCV</a>에서 CSB(CCCV Soul Bound Badge)를&nbsp;공개했습니다.</p><p><a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a>는 리브 투 언(live-to-earn, 일상생활에서 돈을 버는) 라이프 스타일 앱으로, P2E를 포함한 기존의 ‘-투 언(to-earn)’ 모델이 지닌 한계를 허무는 것은 물론, 우리의 일상 활동과 유기적으로 연결된 Web 3 생태계를 구성합니다. 최근 공개된 <a href="https://www.booost.live/files/BOOOST%20Litepaper.pdf">BOOOST 라이트페이퍼</a>는 <a href="https://www.booost.live/">웹사이트</a>에서 만나보실수있습니다.</p><p>이번 아르고 KBW 부스에서는 특히 ‘레이어 1.5’라는 표어가 추가되어 특히 눈길을 끌었는데요. ‘엔터프라이즈를 위한 하이브리드 블록체인’이라는 기존 표어가 아르고의 다양한 기업 파트너 및 상용화 사례를 바탕으로 했다면, 레이어 1.5는 어떤 의미를 담고 있을까요? 아르고는 어떤 의미로 레이어 1.5를 표방하고, 또 이를 달성하기 위해 어떤 노력을 진행하고 있는지, 함께&nbsp;알아보시죠.</p><p>아르고는 자체 합의 구조를 가진 레이어 1의 특장점은 물론, ▲높은 ETH 호환성 ▲높은 TPS ▲ 낮은 수수료를 비롯한 레이어 2의 특장점을 모두 갖췄습니다. 물론, 여러 레이어 1 체인들이 이더리움 생태계의 유동성을 흡수하기 위해 EVM 호환을 지원하며 최근 몇 년 사이 급격한 성장을 보여주기도&nbsp;했습니다.</p><p>아르고는 이더리움이 세상에 등장하기 이전인 2014년 12월부터 엔터프라이즈를 위한 블록체인이라는 초기 방향성을 바탕으로 기획되었습니다. 업종과 시대를 불문하고, SQL/JDBC 지원을 통해 대량의 데이터를 실시간으로 신속히 처리하고자 하는 니즈는 꾸준했기 때문입니다. 아르고는 기존의 기업 고객들이 바로 블록체인 메인넷과 연동할 수 있는 환경을 제공해 프라이빗 블록체인 시장을 공략해&nbsp;왔습니다.</p><p>아르고는 ▲SQL 언어 기반 ▲D-DPOS 합의 구조 ▲머클 브릿지라는 핵심 기능을 바탕으로 엔터프라이즈부터 퍼블릭 블록체인까지 다양한 환경에서 자원과 로직을 연동하고 활용할 수 있는 사이드 체인을 만들어&nbsp;왔습니다.</p><p>특히, 머클 브릿지는 각 블록체인과 사이드 체인간의 상호운용성과 자산 이동을 용이하게 하는 기술입니다. 아르고는 머클 브릿지를 통해 사이드체인 기반의 손쉬운 엔터프라이즈 블록체인 제작 및 유연한 운영을 지원합니다. 아르고 퍼블릭 메인넷은 각 사이드 체인의 일종의 센트럴 도그마와 같은 역할을 수행합니다. 아르고 생태계에서 모든 데이터는 하나의 체인에 저장되는 것이 아닌, 각 사이드 체인에 저장되고 운영됩니다. 레이어 2의 보편적인 특성을 갖고 있는 동시에 아르고 퍼블릭과 같은 레이어 1의 면모도 함께 갖춘, 말 그대로 ‘레이어 1.5’ 인&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>다시 한번 정리하자면, 아르고는 다음과 같은 3가지 핵심 기능을 구현하고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>1) 기업 고객 및 사용자가 용도에 맞는 별도의 사이드 체인을&nbsp;구성하고,</p><p>2) 각 사이드 체인은 메인 네트워크를 통해 상호&nbsp;연결되며,</p><p>3) 최종적으로 이더리움을 비롯한 다양한 블록체인과의 강력한 상호운용성을&nbsp;형성합니다.</p><p>기본적으로 아르고는 기업 입장에서 접근하기 굉장히 용이한 스마트 컨트랙트 플랫폼입니다. 대표적으로 아르고의 엔터프라이즈 제품은 프라이빗 체인을 중심으로 Aergo SQL이라는 스마트 컨트랙트 엔진을 통해 기존 DB를 연동하는 기능을 지원합니다. 이러한 이점을 기반으로 프라이빗 체인을 하나의 사이드 체인 형태로 연동하여, 퍼블릭 체인으로 쉽게 데이터를 앵커링하거나 자산을 이전할 수 있는&nbsp;기술입니다.</p><p>앞으로 아르고는 기업은 물론, 여러 계층의 개인 사용자를 중심으로 한 다양한 블록체인 서비스를 기획하고 있습니다. 이를 위해, 블록체인 간의 자산 이동과 각종 유틸리티 토큰/증권형 토큰/NFT/SBT 등을 적극적으로 발행하고 사용할 수 있도록 기술과 서비스를 제공하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>이러한 계획은 앞으로 선보일 아르고 Dapp들을 통해 구체화될&nbsp;것입니다.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/layer-1-5-aergo-going-forward-ad144a204823">Layer 1.5 AERGO — going forward</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Today’s IT environments blend applications and services from multiple public cloud networks, private clouds and on-prem networks, making it difficult to view and inventory assets deployed across complex hybrid networks, and keep track of the security risks. Organizations need to find a way to improve visibility, identify and prioritize risks, and maintain cyber resiliency.&nbsp;Join security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and cybersecurity posture automation firm Balbix as they discuss the need for a common approach to measuring and managing cyber risks across modern IT environments, which is a major challenge to successful digital transformation.</p>
<p>Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole will describe the challenges to managing risk in hybrid environments, the current hybrid cloud approaches and platforms, and the approaches needed to reduce complexity to govern the cyber risks to business-critical services on-prem and in the cloud.&nbsp;Chris Griffith, Chief Product Officer at Balbix will explain the business and security benefits of a unified risk model across cloud and on-prem environments. He will describe how to create a unified view of cyber risk monetary terms and automate the identification, prioritization, dispatch, and mitigation of vulnerabilities, with reference to real world implementations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cyber-risk-hybrid-multi-cloud"></a>

So how do we as multinationals help our partners with implementing basic controls such as PAM in a way that works in their business reality?<br><br>In this session we will be looking at how you as a relatively cybersecurity mature company can do to help your less mature partners.

<p>If you are not familiar with the Gartner Hype Cycles, they “provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities. Gartner Hype Cycle methodology gives you a view of how a technology or application will evolve over time, providing a sound source of insight to manage its deployment within the context of your specific business goals”(<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a>). In our opinion, being recognized in the analyst space is a validation and something every organization covets. We believe, the recognition justifies the time, effort, and vision of an organization, or at least that’s how we feel here at 1Kosmos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe recognition in these Hype Cycle reports validates our push to provide a verified portable identity and a passwordless experience to all. This also means that the market is catching up to where we already are.</p>
<p>According to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022, “Existing approaches for digital identities cannot scale to the accelerating needs of a digital society.” Fragmentation is a problem due to service providers (banks, retailers and governments) forcing consumers to create individual identities for every service. Decentralized identity (DCI) offers an approach with increased security, privacy and usability compared to traditional digital identity approaches. As standards continue to be reﬁned, and legislative efforts around the world are multiplying, use cases for DCI are emerging in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users gain greater control of their identities and data, and service providers gain higher trust, speed and conﬁdence. Currently, providers collect huge amounts of identity information about users, in order to increase assurance to an acceptable level. DCI can help identity and service providers increase trust, security, privacy, and access convenience for end users without the need for centralized data; thereby reducing risks of data breaches, account takeovers and privacy compliance violations.[1]</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform uses a private blockchain that enables organizations to create irrefutable decentralized digital identities and unifies identity proofing with passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gartner Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022 states that the growing adoption of DCI is a key driver for implementing VCs to streamline business processes.[1]&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID is built with specific capabilities for the onboarding, verification and authentication of employees, contractors, customers and citizens. 1Kosmos digitally transforms the standard onboarding process, by automating and delivering the highest degree of end-user assurance. This transformation eliminates the need for new users to share copies of government IDs, protecting their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By binding users to their proofed identity, 1Kosmos BlockID creates an identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. Users will utilize their trusted mobile device for daily authentication and step-up authentication for physical or logical access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

		<p>September 13, 2022 By Mathieu Glaude</p>
 Introduction 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieuglaude/">Mathieu Glaude</a>. I’m the CEO of Northern Block, a company bringing products to market that will help people regain sovereignty and privacy over their lives.</p>
<p>We’re hopeful that we can be one amongst the many contributors that put the building blocks in place to ensure that people’s rights are protected.</p>
<p>We’ve therefore chosen to build our products (<a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">Orbit Edge</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Orbit Enterprise</a>) on self-sovereign identity principles and open standards &amp; technologies.</p>
<p>I only personally started diving deeper into the world of digital identity in 2019, when as a company, we lacked an elegant way to let users interact with decentralized governance systems that we were building using combinations of blockchains, crypto, smart contracts, etc.</p>
<p>I must say that these past few years have been quite the learning journey for myself. I’m fortunate to be&nbsp; surrounded by a team of brilliant curious individuals who help push my knowledge every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also took it upon myself in 2021 to start doing the <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a> with thought leaders in the digital ID space, with an objective to push the industry forward.</p>
<p>Today, Northern Block is one of the many organizations contributing to Hyperledger Aries (and consuming it).</p>
<p>At this time, I felt like it made sense for me to share some of our learnings as contributors and developers of systems that use Aries, Indy and various verifiable credential implementations.</p>
<p>As I wrote this blog post, two things became apparent to me.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The various elements are evolving with the community to address specific use cases, and interdependencies between them are being eliminated to allow for ultimate flexibility and interoperability, where required. 
 Convergence seems to be happening across various elements of the ecosystem. Standards such as OIDC and mDL are all now in dialogue with W3C, AnonCreds, Aries, etc. Mobile is a predominant technology, just like the way laptops were once upon a time. To reduce consumer friction and drive adoption, convergence of all these different technologies is required inside a mobile environment 
 
<p>I hope this blog post is helpful both for people familiar and unfamiliar with Aries, Indy and AnonCreds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing learning together to help people regain sovereignty and privacy over their lives.</p>
 <br>
Learnings from Aries, Indy and Various Verifiable Credential Implementations 
 <br>
1&nbsp; Aries Protocols vs Aries Frameworks 
<p>When talking about Aries, I think it’s important to first differentiate Aries Protocols from Aries Frameworks.</p>
<p>Aries Protocols are the defined set of Request for Comment (RFCs) for the Aries project. They basically describe important topics that we want to standardize across the Aries ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Aries Frameworks are implementations of the Aries Protocols. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent – Python</a> (ACA-Py), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Aries Framework JavaScript</a> (AFJ), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Hyperledger Aries Framework Go</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Some folks in the community have reasons to use one Aries Framework over another. We at Northern Block have chosen AFJ for our mobile wallets and ACA-Py for our cloud wallets. We wrote about some of the reasons for choosing AFJ in <a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">this recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Challenging implementations is one thing, but the protocols are what the community is committed to continuously improving together.</p>
<p>The tools (frameworks) can come and go, but if we mess up the protocols, it won’t matter what tool we wish to use to implement them.</p>
 <br>
2&nbsp; Aries Protocols Aren’t Tied to Indy 
<p>Aries is a messaging protocol between peers, with no reference to specific implementations, meaning that Aries is detached from Indy.</p>
<p>And what you move on these messaging pipes needs to refer to something stored externally, such as a wallet, ledger, or context.</p>
<p>You don’t know what tech stack the recipient is using. So you need interoperability on the pipes so that people can receive, interpret, etc. How they store it after that doesn’t matter. So Indy isn’t actually on the pipes.</p>
<p>The fact that Aries refers to Indy today is only as reference implementations. Though it’s mentioned, we shouldn’t read it as it’s tightly coupled, but instead a reference storage format.&nbsp; While it is important that protocol definitions stay independent from technical stacks, today they are not. Work must be done to make it clear in documentation that they aren’t tightly bound.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of an Aries RFC that refers to Indy. In the Present Proof protocol, you can implement the Aries protocol and attach different presentation formats.</p>
From Aries 0454-present-proof-v2, not tying Aries to any presentation formats
<p>The Aries protocol choreography (the heart of Aries) also shows that any presentation format can be attached to run it. It has nothing to do with any particular storage technology.</p>

3&nbsp; Aries Protocols Aren’t Tied to AnonCreds&nbsp; 
<p>Now that we’ve separated the messaging protocol from the storage, let’s look at how credentials can be stored.</p>
<p>Right now Northern Block is focused on building use cases which are privacy-preserving, thus best suited for AnonCreds. We have looked at use cases where JWT and JSON-LD credentials would be a good fit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds specification</a> is being developed to address a privacy-preserving specific use case with participation from the community.</p>
<p>It’s an independent specification which has evolved into its own things. AnonCreds are completely separate from Aries. And the community is working towards making AnonCreds independent of any ledger stack.</p>
<p>It’s good to see the data exchange protocol and the process protocol being developed independent of how credentials are stored. Aries is being developed to address data exchange and business process protocols, whereas AnonCreds are being developed for how credentials are stored and how they can be cryptographically secure. They are totally independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the use case, you can choose the right combination of business process protocols. For example: mDL. For interoperability to work, one can replace Aries with mDL and use AnonCreds. Work is also in progress where the AnonCreds specification will be used to store credentials which can be consumed by OIDC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is interoperability and this is what we’re moving towards. That’s where community contributions are happening.</p>
<p>The next version of the AnonCreds specification (tentatively v1.0) will remove from the v0.1 specification any dependence on Hyperledger Indy by removing any requirements related to the storage of the objects used in AnonCreds, whether they be stored remotely on a “Verifiable Data Registry” (including Hyperledger Indy) or in local secure storage.</p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; AnonCreds are Purposely Different from the W3C VC Data Model 
<p>AnonCreds are intentionally different for a good reason:&nbsp; the ideal number of credential formats/types is &gt; 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain credential types are better for different use cases. Indy/Aries does support multiple credential types to allow for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest concern is with high assurance government credentials such as a verified person. This type of credential must support the privacy preservation provided by zero knowledge proofs and supported by AnonCreds. We don’t want to create the equivalent of a modern tracking cookie bound to a high assurance credential that uniquely identifies a person.</p>
<p>Further, we might want to use different credential formats for different schemas. Combining different credential formats could be great for certain use cases.</p>
<p>For example, I may want my address to be privacy-preserving (AnonCreds), whereas my tickets to a sports game shouldn’t be, and should be transferable (pick your W3C credential data model).</p>
<p>Again, If you’re looking for more details around this, we’d suggest you refer to <a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/response-to-kaliyas-being-real-post-13fddb9410f0">Daniel’s paper</a>, which did a great job at explaining this.</p>
<p>Though current implementations are that credential and schema definitions are posted on an Indy ledger, nothing is stopping anyone who implements the Aries Framework and the AnonCreds specification to use their ledger technology of choice.</p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; CL signatures 
<p>Currently, CL signatures are used to serialize the payload prior to storage.</p>
<p>First, CL-signatures have a long history of successful usage. Real-world usage shows it is at an acceptable level for the performance of hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, Anoncreds are not explicitly tied to CL Signatures, and are replaceable/upgradeable in the future.</p>
<p>In the current state, CL signatures solve specific use cases around privacy preservation that are not possible with traditional public/private key cryptography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy preservation for high assurance issued credentials is a must have requirement for certain use cases and must be addressed by the digital ID community.</p>
<p>Now that some of the advantages of BBS+ signatures have become relevant for privacy-preserving use cases (such as selective disclosure), Northern Block is actively involved in having W3C verifiable credentials with BBS+ signatures in Aries agents. It’s being developed right now and is close to being available across the various frameworks.</p>
<p>This is an area of considerable alignment across all standards, although there are still some technical challenges to solve.&nbsp; As an industry we need to push NIST, BSI and other standards bodies to fully certify the core crypto technologies. This is not only an Aries problem.</p>
 <br>
6&nbsp; Aries Protocols Are Built with Interoperability in Mind 
<p>If VCs can be stored in different formats, can we achieve interoperability when business processes involve multiple participating entities who may choose different tech stacks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Peers can be on different tech stacks. For example, Northern Block uses ACA-Py for cloud agents and AFJ for mobile agents.</p>
<p>Interoperability isn’t about how credentials are stored. Interoperability is about the proofs that are exchanged, not what a holder is storing. How data is stored isn’t what matters in this context; what is returned is what matters. What a holder exchanges is a proof, not a credential itself.</p>
<p>Aries frameworks are where interoperability gets demonstrated and tested. Hence the message sent by one peer must be interpretable by the recipient peer. Aries agents / Aries frameworks developers must ensure that they are developing with interoperability in mind.</p>
<p>For those developers there are the Aries RFCs that outline all of the protocols and interopathon events to put all of the parties together. There are multiple reference implementations that any party can use to test their implementation, and all of this is open-source.</p>
<p>Interoperability is assessed using the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH), an open-source software that runs a series of Aries interoperability tests and uses a <a href="https://aries-interop.info/">Behavior Driven-Development</a> (BDD) framework to run tests that are designed to exercise the community-designed Aries Protocols, as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFC GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2021, Northern Block demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">AIP 1.0</a> Compliance of its Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet against the AATH (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials.</p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Aries Frameworks Are Built For Mobile 
<p>Now let’s move to Aries frameworks.</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve built multiple Aries wallets. Over the past few years, we’ve built them using different architectures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, we have selected AFJ (<a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>), but earlier we were using other technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more choices became available, we had more options to choose from. As the adoption of SSI increases, we expect more options to become available.</p>
<p>For the time being, there is no Aries Framework Swift – not because it is impossible – just that not enough people have wanted to put in the effort to make one. The same thing is true with Flutter. There is nothing stopping people from writing these and making them open-source.</p>
<p>AFJ is currently fitting the role with support for React-Native cross-platform mobile development.</p>
<p>Newer wallets have sizes of 50 megabytes or less. This represents 0.3% of the storage space on low end (cheap) smartphones.</p>
<p>We’ve however seen an issue in size with the limitation in the revocation registry, rather than storage. This is an issue to be addressed, but is proven to work today and is sufficiently scalable for real-world large credential deployments. No standard has a great revocation story right now and we need to ensure revocation scalability is there for use cases which need it.</p>
 8&nbsp; Aries Protocol And Frameworks Continue to Evolve Through Community Learnings 
<p>Open standards should be given time to emerge, evolve, and mature. And this has been the case with Aries protocols and frameworks. This has been a global effort.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take the evolution of how connections have been handled by Aries:</p>
<p>RFC-0160 –&gt; RFC-0023 –&gt; RFC-0434&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see an evolution of the protocol as we continued to learn, making this one a good example of agility and upgradeability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the first implementation (0160), there were challenges (e.g., the ability to re-use connections wasn’t possible, limited support for the type of DID Documents).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It evolved into the second RFC (0023) based on DID Exchange and supporting multiple DID Documents.</p>
<p>It was then superseded by 0434 which addressed remaining challenges and provided a way to support the previous two, while creating a space for new handshake protocols to be supported as they evolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main value is that when I create an invitation, I give the choice of protocols that are supported. And we can list any number of them, which takes ties away from any one specific way of doing things. Earlier this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>We expect other protocols to continue evolving through community participation.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we want to continue building robust privacy-preserving solutions and would love to engage in more conversations on how those solutions can be built while keeping interoperability with other use cases and tech stacks while avoiding vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap (5th — 11th September) <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We are back with exciting news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from the US Treasury’s decision to warn the White House over digital assets to the latest UK notifications over sanctions compliance to VASPs. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> US Treasury to Warn the White House About Crypto-related Risks <p>As per recent reports, the US Treasury Department will alert the White House regarding cryptocurrencies if the federal government doesn’t enact significant new crypto laws, given the serious financial risks to US consumers and the&nbsp;economy.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1567832478957637635">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The Treasury intends to release four distinct reports that will showcase the viewpoint of top economic officials towards cryptocurrencies while pitching for strict regulation, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/08/treasury-crypto-warn-white-house/">Washington Post</a>.</blockquote><p>Read More here: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/treasury-to-call-for-more-crypto-regulation-report-says/">https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/treasury-to-call-for-more-crypto-regulation-report-says/</a></p> Indian Finance Minister Asks IMF to Take the Lead in Crypto Regulation <p>Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s finance minister, has urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to play “a lead role” in regulating cryptocurrencies while meeting IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in New&nbsp;Delhi.</p><p>Ms. Georgieva, too, agreed, saying that the IMF is prepared to collaborate with India on issues like climate change, cryptocurrency legislation, and other contemporary world problems.‍</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1567916983676542976?s=20&amp;t=Ouegs6RoB4PMm5Ecaef4Sw">Image Source</a>)<p>While speaking to CNBC TV18, Ms. Georgieva reiterated that the IMF supports Indian crypto legislation and emphasized the significance of achieving a balance between the advantages and disadvantages after she met with Sitharaman.</p><blockquote>She also noted, “India’s digital ecosystem is on steroids as cryptos have emerged strongly without regulations. It is important to remember that cryptos are like the wild, Wild&nbsp;West.”</blockquote><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/indias-finance-minister-meets-imf-chief-to-discuss-globally-coordinated-approach-to-crypto-2888358">https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/indias-finance-minister-meets-imf-chief-to-discuss-globally-coordinated-approach-to-crypto-2888358</a></p> New German Regulation to Issue Investment Fund Units as Crypto Fund&nbsp;Units (<a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1567832478957637635">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>It is now possible to issue units of German investment funds digitally, popularly referred to as Crypto Fund Units, according to the new German Regulation on Crypto Fund Units (Verordnung über Kryptofondsanteile — KryptoFAV).</blockquote><p>As for how this will work, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain-based decentralized Crypto Securities Register will be used to issue Crypto Fund&nbsp;Units.</p><p>The fund’s depository will be responsible for maintaining the relevant Crypto Securities Register, but they can alternatively assign this responsibility to a third-party business that is permitted to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Interestingly, German investment funds organized as contractually constituted common funds (Sondervermögen) are subject to the KryptoFAV. However, corporate-organized investment funds are&nbsp;not.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/germany-new-regulation-kryptofav-6746579/">https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/germany-new-regulation-kryptofav-6746579/</a></p> The UK Mandates Crypto Exchanges to Notify Suspected Sanctions Violations <p>According to new regulations put in place amid growing concerns that sanctioned parties are turning to crypto assets to get around the restrictions imposed in rebuttal to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the virtual asset exchanges are now required to notify the UK authorities of any suspected sanctions violations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1567193412268441601?s=20&amp;t=fjRSFBXyiyo5JuiK0SaN3w">Image Source</a>)<p>Official regulations were updated on August 30 to clearly list “crypto assets” as one of the key items that must be prohibited if sanctions are imposed on a person or an&nbsp;entity.</p><blockquote>Any Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that fail to report clients who are subject to sanctions will be in violation of rules set forth by the United Kingdom Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) of Her Majesty’s Treasury.</blockquote><p>The agency further stated that if “any other payment instruments” and assets, including cryptocurrency, are used with the intention of obtaining funds, goods, or services, it will be a gross violation of the sanctions.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/04/crypto-exchanges-suspected-sanction-breaches-russia">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/04/crypto-exchanges-suspected-sanction-breaches-russia</a></p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer!

				  Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy have given enterprises and governments a powerful way to build and use open source, interoperable decentralized identity technology. The reasons? A large and diverse community of developers and users is driving a virtuous cycle of robust, flexible technology and innovative implementations that meet market needs  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren and Mike Ebert</p>
<p>Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy are dedicated to making privacy-preserving identity solutions a reality, the exchange of trusted data easy and reliable, and the interactions between people, organizations, and systems enriching.</p>
<p>As a combination, they have demonstrated that they are robust, flexible, and extensible — capable of incorporating many new codebases, technologies, and cryptographic signatures, capable of delivering powerful solutions that have led to significant growth in implementations, community members, and customers.</p>
<p>While no technology runs perfectly on every device, a signal strength of Aries, AnonCreds, and Indy is that they work on the vast majority of current devices and systems, including $35 smart phones and low powered IOT/embedded devices. They represent the most inclusive way into this technology, which is an important factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>But as with any technology, they are also constantly evolving to meet the growing demand for decentralized identity solutions. To date, scaling has not been the primary challenge, but Aries and Indy are responding to this need. Important progress has been made, such as incorporating the Askar wallet, and work continues in areas such as clustering and multi-tenancy. The vision of having billions of verifiable credentials, devices, and users participating in trusted digital interactions all around the world has never been closer.</p>
<p>While solutions can’t simultaneously be new and tried and true, AnonCreds has been used since 2017. It is a battle-tested and reliable solution to identity and verifiable credential problems. Perhaps even more important, it is the only current credential specification that is able to meet the EU’s and real world privacy requirements; it offers the key privacy preserving features needed for marketplace identity solutions — selective disclosure, predicate proofs, and privacy-preserving holder binding. Formalization of the proven standards and best practices into an official specification is underway.</p>
<p>AnonCreds also coexists beautifully with other signature styles. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but when used for the right purposes, they complement each other powerfully. Aries added support for W3C credentials two years ago and is committed to supporting the best credentials and signature styles; Indy is incorporating cross-ledger compatibility and governance feedback.</p>
<p>All of this shows that Indy, Aries, and AnonCreds are robust, proven, trusted, dynamic, and adaptable — as are the community members, organizations, and customers that back them. They will continue to grow and be an important part of the decentralized identity and verifiable credential space, and we, as backers of these solutions and communities, are committed to creating the best solutions and making the right choices to implement and improve identity for all.</p>
 Some myths about Hyperledger Aries, AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy — and the reality 
<p>Inaccurate claims spread effortlessly on simplification, while understanding often requires mastering and translating complexity. That’s the challenge in communicating advances in science and technology. It’s easy to misunderstand what’s happening if you’re not immersed in the data or the code and then it’s hard to correct errors once they reach critical velocity or become sunk intellectual costs.</p>
<p>As leaders and active participants in the open source community, we urge people to attend these groups to learn about what they are doing, to ask questions, and, above all, to help solve problems that you see. This is the magic of open source technology—it’s open! And this openness accounts for its success in creating robust code and innovation.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is able to do this. Which is why we want to address some of the myths and misconceptions about the core open source technologies that we build on, contribute to, and use: Hyperledger Aries, and AnonCreds, and Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myth 1: Hyperledger Aries is fragile and isn’t flexible or extensible enough for decentralized identity to scale in part because it’s tied to AnonCreds</p>
<p>Reality: The reason Hyperledger Aries is the most widely used codebase for implementing verifiable credentials— by enterprises and governments alike— is that it currently provides the best extensible, flexible, and reliable platform for building verifiable credential solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far from being structurally dependent on the AnonCreds verifiable credential specification, Hyperledger Aries supports multiple credential formats including those that follow the W3C data model. Again, this flexibility is why Hyperledger Aries is so popular: it’s the easiest way to get a verifiable credential solution implemented.</p>
<p>In addition to the support for JSON-LD W3C credentials that has been available for years, the Aries community is working on chained credentials which will, in many cases, carry both AnonCreds and JSON-LD credentials in the same message of a credential workflow. The DIDComm protocols for issuance and presentation first developed with Aries have no opinion about which credential types and signature schemes are passed within its messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all the open source codebases mentioned here, Aries has a large developer community devoted to improving the specification and code. One strength of this is that the community is able to respond to real-world needs in enterprise and public sector implementations. Technology evolves through use, and this synergy between implementation and development is an example of the virtuous cycle created by open source technology.</p>
<p>Some of the criticism of Aries appears to be driven by a “good is the enemy of the perfect” attitude; to which the answer is, “well come join the Aries community and make the good better.” We’re at the beginning of the decentralized identity journey, not at the end—and we’re in a phase of rapid growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Myth 2: Aries doesn’t adapt well to mobile use</p>
<p>Reality: We’ve heard concerns that there just isn’t enough space on a mobile phone to use Aries—or that the space issue will block scale. Newer digital wallet apps are around 50mb in size, and some are smaller. This represents just 0.3% of a low end $35 smartphone.<br><br>Other concerns focus on the unavailability of libraries for different mobile codebases. As Aries is an open source effort, libraries will be added or expanded when interest exists and contributors show up for the work. We’ve seen interest and work expand and anticipate it will continue.</p>
<p>Myth 3: Hyperledger Indy can’t manage large-scale issuance or verification</p>
<p>Reality: The idea that Hyperledger Indy networks can’t manage the mass use of verifiable credentials is contradicted by real world use. The Government of British Columbia <a href="https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">has issued millions of credentials</a> based on a few (&lt;10) writes to a ledger.</p>
<p>Any evaluation of scale requires understanding how a ledger is used. With AnonCreds, the use of a ledger scales with the number of issuers and credential schemas and, as nothing specific to a credential issuance is written to the ledger, issuance scales without impact on the ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification only requires a cached copy of the relevant ledger assets, allowing verification to scale according to the number of&nbsp; verifiers calibrated by caching policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words both issuance and verification scale independently of the number of issued or verified credentials and the assets required for verification will be downloaded and cached prior to verification, which solves the speed problem.</p>
<p>Myth 4: Current revocation is insufficient for business needs&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reality: Hyperledger Indy has the only working open source privacy-preserving revocation; it has not proved a limiting factor in any current business or public sector deployment that we’ve built and implemented.</p>
<p>Will it get better? Yes, the community is working to make it better. But the concerns about business needs are theoretical when contrasted with real world practice.</p>
<p>Myth 5: The AnonCreds specification is out of date&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reality: There are two key reasons why governments, in particular, choose to build verifiable credential solutions using AnonCreds and why the specification is the most widely used in decentralized identity solutions around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the AnonCred credential format&nbsp; is battle-tested. As an open source codebase, it’s been around and continuously updated since 2017. You can find the specification <a href="https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, it’s the only credential specification that provides the privacy-preserving features that enable verifiable credentials to comply with data privacy law. No other credential specification is able to meet these critical legal and political needs. This is a non-trivial issue (see answer below).</p>
<p>On both counts, newer isn’t better. But at the same time, open source specifications are constantly evolving. You want to make AnonCreds better? Then get involved in the <a href="https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-spec">AnonCreds Specification Effort</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myth 6: Anoncreds doesn’t align with the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model.</p>
<p>Reality: The AnonCreds specification provides privacy-preserving features that no other credential specification provides: selective disclosure of data, and zero-knowledge proofs. AnonCreds also predates the W3C credential data model;&nbsp; as updating AnonCreds would yield few improvements in interoperability, such work has not been prioritized by the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The features provided by AnonCreds are essential for organizations to comply with data privacy law. This is not a theoretical point: Indicio has many global enterprise customers and they want and need privacy-preserving features in their verifiable credential implementation. If the current amendments to the European Union’s digital identity proposal are accepted, AnonCreds will be the only current verifiable credential specification that meets the EU’s privacy requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power of Hyperledger Aries and Indy is that they can support multiple credential specifications and thereby provide enterprises and organizations with the flexibility they need to build their solutions. The focus within the Aries community has been to support W3C credentials alongside AnonCreds, as they generally serve different use cases but are complimentary.</p>
<p>Two ways to learn more</p>
<p>Nothing beats learning by doing. And to this end, Indicio has created a<a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/"> series of hands-on workshops </a>on every aspect of open source decentralized identity technology for technical and non-technical audiences. We understand that the multiple concepts and codebases and workflows can be difficult to grasp on paper!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those willing to dive in directly, we invite you to attend&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/join-a-group">the working group meetings</a> at Hyperledger. It’s always best to talk to the people actually developing these codebases rather than second-hand opinions!</p>

 Ocean Protocol joins leading Web3 projects on the €20M+ Gaia-X moveID initiative to advance pan-European mobility <p>The initiative will leverage the Ocean tech stack to implement decentralized, digital identities and power the future of&nbsp;mobility</p><p>Singapore, September 13: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the Web3 platform to unlock data services for AI and business innovation, has joined forces with <a href="https://chainstep.com/">Chainstep</a>, <a href="https://datarella.com/">Datarella</a>, <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai,</a> <a href="https://www.peaq.network/">peaq and</a> <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/en/">51nodes</a> to develop the system architecture for European mobility with the preservation of data autonomy as its core principle, within the <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">Gaia-X</a> <a href="https://moveid.org/">moveID</a>&nbsp;project.</p><blockquote>Ocean Founder, Bruce Pon&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol is proud to support the moveID initiative with the technology stack needed for building a digital identity infrastructure and an inclusive Data&nbsp;Economy”</blockquote><p>Rising as an alternative to centralized platforms, Gaia-X is a pan-European cross-sector initiative for a more open and democratic data infrastructure, bringing together more than 300 companies and organizations, including top industry names such as Bosch, Continental, and&nbsp;Airbus.</p><p>The <a href="https://moveid.org/">moveID consortium</a> is focused on driving innovative solutions for decentralized data sharing and generating real-world mobility use cases for blockchain technology. The consortium members will work to deliver secure and verifiable digital IDs. This is a crucial foundational feature enabling all mobility participants — humans or machines — to identify each other, transact, and interact between themselves without mediation from centralized third&nbsp;parties.</p><blockquote>Peter Busch, Product Owner for Distributed Ledger Technologies (Mobility) at Bosch&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“With moveID, we are setting the foundation for a hyper-connected mobility infrastructure by leveraging self-sovereign device identities and decentralized data sharing to enable hundreds of potential use cases. We are thrilled to be exploring this exciting prospect side by side with some of the leading projects in the decentralized space such as Fetch.ai Network, peaq, Ocean Protocol, Datarella, 51nodes, deltaDAO, and Chainstep.”</blockquote><p>Through BigchainDB, Ocean Protocol will contribute by providing key technical elements needed for building moveID’s infrastructure. Essential components of Ocean’s decentralized data marketplace technology, Compute-to-Data, and data pricing mechanisms are being leveraged to build a system architecture that ensures a seamless exchange of information between providers and customers of mobility applications. deltaDAO will support the effort by implementing the Ocean tech stack to the moveID infrastructure.</p><p>The other participating Web3 protocols will also take on the following roles:</p><p>Chainstep, one of the leading deep tech companies for enterprise implementation and connection of DLT, IoT, and Machine Learning, will develop connectors to build the link between the digital and physical world. The company is developing a solution for connecting Edge IoT (V2X) devices securely to the Gaia-X cloud platform. Self-sovereign identities (SSI) work as the basis for decentralized integration security, allowing the removal of the single point of failure in relying on a centralized authorization provider.</p><p>Datarella, a leading developer of industrial blockchain solutions, will co-develop the infrastructure for decentralized digital identities and data sharing, leveraging SSI components, Autonomous Agents. To ensure a future market acceptance of applications based on moveID, Datarella also contributes its experience in Web3 mobility applications, such as&nbsp;MOBIX.</p><p>Fetch.ai is developing the infrastructure and tooling for creating Web2 and Web3 AI applications. Fetch-ai Network has a Cosmos SDK-based self-sovereign blockchain ledger and the supporting tools for developing DApps on the network and also the modular Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs) and the Digital Twin Platforms that can efficiently and securely communicate peer-to-peer and provide interconnectivity with multiple networks.</p><p>peaq, the Web3 network powering the Economy of Things, will conduct intense research and development within the project. peaq will further build up its layer-one blockchain in line with the co-created requirements and standards, aiming to grant Gaia-X’s moveID the perfect infrastructure for decentralized mobility applications. peaq will also provide its core functions: peaq ID — Self-Sovereign Machine Identities (SSMIs), peaq access, and peaq&nbsp;pay.</p><p>51nodes, a Web3 developing and integration company brings to the project its experience with SSI architecture and implementation in the context of decentralised mobility infrastructure. In addition to developing and integrating various SSI technologies, the focus of work will be on SSI interoperability challenges.</p><p>deltaDAO, a web3 software development, integration and consulting company, will co-develop decentralized data infrastructure and federation services in the context of the broader Gaia-X ecosystem. deltaDAO contributes its extensive knowledge regarding Gaia-X compliance, interoperability, and integration.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 IDnow is supporting IATA to simplify the passenger journey through digital identity 



<p></p>



 



<p>Munich, September 13, 2022&nbsp;– IDnow, a leading European identity proofing platform provider, is pleased to announce its participation in the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/press/accelerateiata-announces-new-airline-partners-and-3-batches-of-startups/?utm_campaign=mkg-twitter-pressrelease-all-europe-tvl-TRIBE&amp;utm_content=218930183&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-966737811448606720">Accelerate@IATA</a>&nbsp;2022 accelerator program. IDnow is working with IATA and its members, providing expertise and regulatory know-how in the field of identity proofing and digital identity. Together, IATA and IDnow are working on the shared goal of making&nbsp;flying more seamless and low-touch for passengers, while lowering fraud risks for airlines.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.iata.org/en/">IATA</a>&nbsp;is the trade association for the world’s airlines, representing some 290 airlines or 83% of total air traffic. As a leading industry association, IATA is shaping industry standards and the future of aviation.<br></p>



<p>Through the Accelerate@IATA program, IDnow is contributing to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">IATA One ID</a>&nbsp;working group.&nbsp;The goal of IATA One ID is to set industry standards that further streamline the passenger journey with digitalization of admissibility and a contactless process through secure biometric enabled identification. Under the One ID vision, upon completing document checks remotely, passengers will be able to arrive at the airport ready to fly and proceed through each airport touchpoint via simple biometric recognition. The objective is to achieve a truly interoperable global system across airports, airlines and governments.</p>



<p>IDnow is collaborating with airlines and other technology providers members of the IATA Think Tank on a white paper about the application of digital identity in the air travel industry. In parallel, a proof of concept is being developed to show how digital identity can support people with reduced mobility with traveling, and airlines and airports to prioritize the required staff for the necessary support.</p>



<p>“We are very pleased to have IDnow participation in the heart of industry innovation conversations. IDnow brings their expertise on the secure decentralized digital identity to support the airline industry for the journey to customer-centricity.” – Kat R. Morse, Senior Manager Innovation, Partnerships and Events at IATA.</p>



<p>“We understand that in the modern air travel industry, digital identities have a huge potential to shape a whole new traveler experience. From lowering the fraud risk for airlines, to creating a more seamless and low-touch experience for passengers and offering a GDPR compliant solution for storing and sharing of biometric pictures for airports and other players – Digital identity is the key. We are excited and proud to have been selected by IATA to work together and to partner with some of the most prestigious airlines of the world to shape the future of air travel”, says Michael A. Binner, Director Digital Identity at IDnow.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>If there is one universally true statement about every organization regardless of size, location, or industry – it is that they all have too many security problems to deal with comfortably and in time. If you believe that you have your cybersecurity well under control, you probably simply don’t have full visibility into every corner of your IT… Unsurprisingly, the idea of replacing overworked (and increasingly scarce) humans with some kind of automation both for daily administrative routine and for responding to security incidents looks universally appealing to everyone in IT. Or does it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210929005067/en/ThreatQuotient-Publishes-Research-Report-State-of-Cyber-Security-Automation-Adoption-in-2021">recent market study</a>, the majority of organizations have experienced problems implementing security automation for a variety of reasons, ranging from a lack of skills and budgets (obviously) to a much more bizarre claim of not trusting the outcomes of automation. In fact, many companies already having automation capabilities in place (such as SIEM or EDR products) do not trust them to perform any operations more advanced than sending out an alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, we have <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/getting-a-grip-on-operational-technology">blamed industrial security experts</a> for sticking to their old ways and putting safety and process continuity above security. Meanwhile, AI and machine learning technologies have been making great strides and entire new market segments for intelligent and highly automated security solutions have emerged. And yet, even people not involved in OT security are still afraid of them. But why?&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding security automation&nbsp; 
<p>Before diving into technical details of implementing security automation, it can perhaps be useful to address a couple of common misconceptions about it. First, the goal of automating cybersecurity is not to eliminate humans from the decision-making process or drive security analysts to unemployment. On the contrary, the whole idea is to automate the least interesting but most tedious parts of the repetitive manual activities we have to face daily – from separating meaningful security events from false positives to making disjointed legacy tools work together efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless this unqualified menial labor is the only thing you do as a security analyst, there is really nothing to be worried about – automation will actually allow you to spend your time on more challenging and rewarding tasks. You will also always have the final say in every potentially disruptive decision (and a good automation tool will not just help you make the right one, but also to evaluate its potential risks beforehand). Unless, of course, you’ll decide to block any future attacks of the same kind automatically…&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, it is also important to stress that investigating and responding to security incidents is definitely not the only area of cybersecurity that needs to be automated. Proactive measures such as identifying vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure or application code, as well as regulatory compliance, can greatly benefit from intelligent automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And speaking of intelligence: contrary to many people’s beliefs, artificial intelligence and machine learning should not be the primary focus of any automation strategy. While AI/ML provide a multitude of opportunities to automate specific narrow tasks, on a strategic scale, automating processes, workflows and collaboration between people is much more important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar">Security Orchestration, Automation and Response</a> (SOAR) products are perhaps the most promising class of solutions that helps, well, orchestrate the processes between other tools and products that do not support this integration natively. However, this market is still evolving rapidly, and most currently available tools tend to focus on automating forensic investigations and incident response. Designing a universal platform that could automate all security-related processes in an organization is thus still a challenge that every company must address individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a sense, security automation as a concept can be compared to another popular buzzword – Zero Trust. Both do not refer to specific technologies or products, but rather deal with architectures and guiding principles. However, whereas you still “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022/blog/you-cannot-buy-zero-trust-but-thats-actually-ok">cannot buy Zero Trust</a>”, the situation with security automation tools nowadays is a complete opposite. There are so many various products that promise to solve all your automation needs that finding the right combination of tools becomes a problem that might need a bit of automation itself…&nbsp;</p>
 Would you like to know more?&nbsp; 
<p>Security automation will be one of the key topics at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> in Berlin this November. Whether you are looking for strategic advice from industry analysts or are more interested in technical implementation details, you will surely find the right people and relevant presentations at the event. For example, check out “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/1">Sustainable vulnerability management: Case Study by KuppingerCole</a>” by Christopher Schütze, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/2">Security Automation Strategies to Succeed or Fail: You Choose</a>” by Dr. Donnie Wendt of Mastercard, or a panel discussion on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5205/3">Implementing Enterprise Security Automation for Threat Detection and Intelligence</a>”.&nbsp;</p>

				  Trust registries are relics of centralized thinking that undo many of the benefits of decentralized identity. But there is a better way to implementing governance in a verifiable credential ecosystem—and Decentralized Ecosystem Governance is on its way to becoming an open standard thanks to work at the Decentralized Identity Foundation  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technologies are about making important data immediately actionable because that data can be trusted. The combination of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), credential schemas and definitions, cryptographic calculation, and tamper-proof distributed ledgers manages to add the missing verification layer to the internet and deliver the privacy and security features that are now essential in the marketplace.</p>
<p>But all these components do not fully negate the need for humans to make decisions about who can be trusted as an issuer of data—and how those decisions are implemented in the workflow of a decentralized, verifiable credential ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many have invoked the idea of a Trust Registry as a service to solve this problem. At Indicio, and now at the Decentralized Identity Foundation, we are turning this idea into a file — a serialized, downloadable collection of all the information relevant to an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The idea of a Trust Registry as a service raises many problems, both technical and governmental. Examples of the former include adding friction to a system of verification whose value is that it is maximally frictionless: If each verification needs to ping a Trust Registry and then wait for approval, the system slows down.</p>
<p>Then we have the issue of offline functionality due to poor internet speeds or outages — how does that work? And we have governance problems: Who governs the Trust Registry so that we can trust it to be inclusive? And how much will this cost? In sum, Trust Registries as a service create bottlenecks in identity governance and risk becoming toll booths on information flows.</p>
<p>These concerns were not theoretical. In the work Indicio did for SITA and the Government of Aruba, it was clear that organizations and governments want to control their verifiable credential ecosystems; sovereign authorities do not want services to do this that are outside their control.</p>
<p>Indicio developed Machine Readable Governance to manage this issue. In essence, keep the Trust Registry, but make it a file in a machine readable format that’s issued by a governance authority for a particular ecosystem that propagates through the agent software in that ecosystem. No bottleneck. No decrease in speed. Can be rapidly updated. And, because the file is cached, there is&nbsp; offline functionality.</p>
<p>We weren’t the only ones thinking along the same lines. Other developers and organizations were working independently on the same solution, including Gabe Cohen with TBD and Daniel Buchner at Block. It made sense to collaborate and establish a community standard, and provide code in open source repositories.</p>
<p>Led by Indicio’s Mike Ebert, this is what is now happening in the Claims and Credentials working group at DIF. It’s called Decentralized Ecosystem Governance—and progress is rapid. As part of this work, we have developed functioning systems that use all the elements below and are involved in efforts to standardize this approach with other interested companies in the space.</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary of the work and status:</p>
<p>Participant Lists (nearly done): This is the portion of governance that designates the participants of an ecosystem — the Issuers and Verifiers involved in credential flows.</p>
<p>Delegated Participants (next under discussion): This allows the involvement of parties who are not explicitly listed as a participant, but rather presenting a credential issued by a listed participant. This enables credential chain support and allows a variety of dynamic and large ecosystems to benefit from this technology.</p>
<p>Action / Workflows (not yet discussed): Enables specific interactions for smooth UX and confident interaction with credentials. Will work with Presentation Definitions and Credential Manifests.</p>
<p>Presentation Definitions -(published): Enables the specification of schemas and other details of credential interactions.</p>
<p>Credential Manifest (published): Enables the specification of workflows related to credential issuance.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Summary: Decentralized Ecosystem Governance does five powerful things:</p>
 
 It provides a low cost, efficient and error-free way to choreograph the rules for interaction in a jurisdiction. 
 It makes a governance framework portable, instead of a centralized trust registry service to verify issuers in real time, a governance authority publishes a governance file that propagates to all the agents in an ecosystem. 
 It enables the appropriate governance authority&nbsp;—&nbsp;such as a government or health authority — to directly implement and easily update the applicable rules for how individual data is used. 
 It can manage interactions within and across jurisdictions and systems, allowing each governance authority to enact the rule they decide on as important. 
 It’s easily updated. 
 
<p>Decentralized Ecosystem Governance makes verifying data an easy-to-play game of red light/green light. And, importantly, it decentralizes governance to the appropriate authorities.</p>

<p>Spruce’s continued mission is to let users control their data across the web, whether it’s web2, web3, or beyond. This also applies to credentials issued by existing entities, such as the Mobile Driver License (mDL) issued by motor vehicle authorities across the world.</p><p>There is now a global standard called <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> that describes how we can represent a digital driver’s license on someone’s smartphone, and the whole end-to-end process on how to present it in-person. However, the methods to provision them, refresh them, or send them online are still under active discussion within ISO working groups. In the US, TSA and other organizations have already committed to using this standard, so it impacts DMVs who want their mobile driver’s licenses to also be useful for travel at the airport. In other countries, there is beginning to be adopted as well.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/2021-07-29-aclu-eff-epic-comments-re-dhss-mdl">EFF, ACLU, and EPIC</a> recently have called out several concerns regarding implementations of the mDLs in their comments to a Department of Homeland Security request for comments, and as implementers of open source digital identity software, we have additional concerns in the mix that we felt it necessary to call out too:</p>  User choice for identity wallets may be restricted to just a few companies due to anti-competitive policies for device API access. Hardware manufacturers and operating system vendors use internal APIs that third-party developers cannot access, meaning wallets by app developers will not be able to create a competitive user experience or security model on a level playing field. Practically, this could funnel users to just the operating system-provided identity wallets and extinguish the possibility of increased user choice when handling their most critical data.  Is a large tech company the right decision maker for how state-issued digital identities can be used on billions of devices, especially in light of many recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/apple-sued-over-apple-pay-accused-of-antitrust-violations">antitrust allegations</a>? For example, gatekeeping of verifiers occurs with Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/wallet/verifying_wallet_identity_requests">PassKit restricting the verifier set</a> to Apple’s approved list of developers. In the physical world, we don’t have to ask Apple to inspect a driver’s license. This seems a lot like a policy decision for users who have mobile driver’s licenses. When was the last time your leather wallet told you that you couldn’t use something how you wanted?  <p>The EFF further has recommended W3C Verifiable Credentials due to their history of being developed in the public, and being an open standard. We agree with this. Vendors such as Microsoft, Ping Identity, Workday, and Spruce have already adopted these in pilots and production use cases. Furthermore, Underwriter Labs, an author of ISO 18013-5, has described how to <a href="https://www.ul.com/insights/verifiable-credentials-and-isoiec-18013-5-based-credentials">interoperate Verifiable Credentials with the ISO described data model</a> and protocols. We look forward to continuing our collaborations here such as demonstrating interoperability with TBD:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-and-tbd-demonstrate-decentralized-identity-interoperability/">  Spruce and TBD Demonstrate Decentralized Identity Interoperability  We have heard a lot about Decentralized Identity in the last few years. For both Spruce and TBD, Decentralized Identity and user control are at the center of both our missions, and we are excited to announce that we achieved another milestone towards interoperability.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We think that this can culminate in an Identity Wallet Bill of Rights that describes how a third party wallet provider can participate on an even playing field, allowing for an entire ecosystem instead of 2-3 vendors thereby increasing user choice. This way, users can enjoy increased wallet selection built on open protocols and standards, ensuring that a market can form to tailor to specific use cases. Identity is far too important and critical of a component to leave to two or three companies to dominate. </p><p>When was the last time you had to ask a tech company for permission to use your passport, with the implication that they could lock you out entirely? If things continue without an open ecosystem for identity wallets, this could be the unfortunate reality. Digital identity is still in its infancy, and it’s not too late to start now.</p><p>In our efforts to help lead this charge, we are sponsoring a community project <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">led by Kaliya Young</a>, a longstanding member of the identity ecosystem, to lead this and help create a level playing field for identity wallets without compromising on security. At Spruce, we believe that users should have a choice in which wallet manages their most critical data, and that two or three companies should not dictate the most meaningful and high-stakes digital interactions for billions of people.</p><p>Towards this, we are working on a set of requirements that we believe would enable wallet providers to achieve the same levels of user experience, functionality, and security that are enjoyed by wallets with privileged, internal APIs not currently available to third-party developers. We want to invite you to do the same through this community effort so that together we can ensure that wallets have a level playing field and that users have true choice. If we can get this right, we have a real opportunity to get it right for users across identity, payments, and beyond in the digital era.</p><p>We will continue to pursue our efforts in the decentralized identity ecosystem, and always champion architectures that put users first.</p><p>Check out this link for the full community project announcement:</p><a href="https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/where-the-w3c-verifiable-credentials-meets-the-iso-18013-5-mobile-driving-license-2b0a6c992920">  Where the W3C Verifiable Credentials meets the ISO 18013–5 Mobile Driving License  New Community Project Sponsored by Spruce  MediumIdentity Woman in Business    </a> <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

 Ocean Protocol and Dimitra announce Phase 2 of the Data Challenge: Algorithms, Analytics, Narratives &amp;&nbsp;Reports <p>The strategic phase will incentivise data analysis and the building of algorithms to harness the power of agricultural data for global&nbsp;change.</p><p>Singapore, September 12th: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the Web3 platform to unlock data services for AI and business innovation, has launched the second phase of the Ocean and <a href="https://dimitra.io/">Dimitra</a> Data Challenge — an initiative guided by the mission to gather data-driven insights and encourage algorithm building to solve complex challenges in agriculture. From a prize pool of $10,000, the rewards for this phase are: 1st place: $4,000, 2nd place: $3,000, 3rd place: $2,000, Community Award: $1,000 (payable in OCEAN +&nbsp;DMTR).</p><p>The Phase 2 <a href="https://bit.ly/dimitra-p2">datasets</a> are live on the Ocean Market and the entry submission deadline is September 30 at midnight UTC. To enter the competition and access complete bounty details, go to the dedicated Questbook <a href="https://bit.ly/3RViD6N">page</a>.</p><p>The participants must at least perform the graphical methods outlined in the challenge <a href="https://bit.ly/3RViD6N">description</a> in order to be considered for the competition. They are free to augment the challenge dataset with any open-source real-data dataset of their choice. Bonus points will be awarded for publishing the referenced data on the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.</p><p>The partnership between Dimitra’s agricultural software and Ocean’s Web3 data sharing and monetization capabilities is focused on driving the next generation of agricultural solutions using data and accelerating the adoption of Web3. In line with this vision, the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</a> was launched in July 2022 with the aim to maximize yields and mitigate operational losses for farmers across the globe with relevant, valuable data-driven insights and algorithms.</p><p>Ocean Founder Bruce Pon&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“The global agriculture industry is facing its biggest changes and data-driven productivity improvements are the need of the hour. With our data challenge, we have all the tools in place to build relevant context around farming data, build models to improve outcomes and influence the direction of the agriculture sector for the&nbsp;better.”</blockquote><p>Jon Trask, CEO of Dimitra, commented:</p><blockquote>“As we enter Phase Two of our data science challenge we are looking forward to testing the data scientists’ use of a variety of techniques which may reveal important insights into the growth of soybeans based on ten years of historical data. I’m interested to understand the trends and changes that are affecting performance and possible insights into the nature or impact of recent climatic events that may influence crop performance. Hidden knowledge is disguised in the data and I hope to see how this group of data scientists reveal the opportunities hidden behind the&nbsp;mask.”</blockquote><p>As part of the Ocean-Dimitra Data challenge Phase 2: Algorithms, Analytics, Narratives &amp; Reports, participants will be presented with a dataset containing the crop yield data for soybeans in the 46 districts of Madhya Pradesh state, India and the MODIS satellite data on normalized difference vegetation, leaf area, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature and rainfall. The challenge is to study the target soybean yields satellite data, rank the factors that affect yields and accordingly build a simple model to predict yields based on the features. The participants will also identify and explain any trends in the yield data over a 10-year period. The goal of this phase is to gain insights into the nature and impact of recent climatic events that may have influenced crop performance.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean and Dimitra will independently review and rank submission entries selecting 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners. The selection will be announced publicly and the community will be invited to vote for the Community Choice award winner. All valid entries submitted will receive an award of 250 $OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>About Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</a> is part of the broader <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Data Bounty program</a> — a strategic initiative incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms to solve complex business challenges.</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ideation phase</a> focused on garnering valuable ideas on how agricultural datasets in the Ocean Market could be utilized to maximize yields and crop quality while minimizing risks for farmers in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.

  To remain competitive, businesses are embracing digital transformation, adopting cloud services and agile software development. But this is creating opportunities for attackers because most organizations lack the skills, knowledge, and expertise to match attackers’ ability to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p> </p>
<p>Is the security sector served well by the standards, regulations, and frameworks we have?</p>
<p>The security industry has been around for a good few years and we've understood the importance of standards. If you look at the way that standards, frameworks, and regulations work, it does take quite some time for them to come into place. In the early days, we had standards, which may have been around specific technologies, but they were quite general. So for example, we had the standards around wireless encryption. So, there are those sorts of standards. We have standards around technologies. We have standards around products. We have standards around organizations. So for example, the BS 5577, a long time ago, was what eventually became known as the ISO 27,001 series or the starting of it.</p>
<p>The standards came first, then as time went on, we had more frameworks coming into play. For example, the Cloud Security Alliance is having some frameworks, ISACA itself has got a great framework, couple of frameworks. And also you find that over some time, different regulatory bodies have created their regulations. So the finance sector has often had its own. Now, the challenge with all of these things is that because they are trying to cover so many things and be all and everything to many, many people, especially those people that sit on these committees, it takes a long time to negotiate them. And because it takes a long time to negotiate them, it also takes a long time to greet them and get them out there. There are a lot of standards out there and it doesn't mean we've covered all the things that we need to cover in security. So they are evolving as time goes on. And again, this 27,000 series has shown because you've got different components of that now. We are beginning to get to the point where some of the technologies are converging in a direction that's quite useful. You're beginning to see some of the convergence aspects that are fit as well. And IoT is a very good example of that.</p>
<p>I'd say, yes, those are a lot of standards. There are regulations and frameworks, plenty of them, plenty to choose from and definitely, the security industry is well covered. But that doesn't mean that we've got everything covered. It's well covered in that we've got a good set of standards already at the moment that we can build on to meet the changing needs that we may have.</p>
<p>What role do standards and frameworks have in a world where threats and risks are forever changing?</p>
<p>We're in an environment where technology is changing so fast and responses to technology are a little bit slow because we can only really work in retrospect in many respects, looking at where the threats are, where the risks are. We tend to think backward rather than forwards quite often in many of these things, partly because we're in a position where we've got limited budgets, we can't go round trying to cover every risk, we have to cover those that are the biggest risks. And we have to look at the likelihood that things are going to happen, and the impacts those things are going to have. Because there are so many variations that we need to look at and the threats that are out there, we start to figure out where we want to spend our money and we start to think about the changes that are out there in terms of the threats that we need to respond to. Our budgets need to be forward-thinking. Yet at the same time, we've got technologies that are always backward thinking. We're trying to think about what's happened, where it's happened, why it's happened, and what we need to be doing next. So in terms of the standards, we're in a position where many of these things came about some time ago, and although they came about some time ago, they were almost ready for yesteryear's threats that were out there. My session thinks about that and I'll be covering what it is, and why they were good for their times at some point. And the fact that today we're in a much, much faster-changing world, that our standards if they're not changing just as fast as the threats are changing, they act, they're beginning to feel more like checklists. And if you've got checklists, as good as a checklist may well be, it's nothing more than a checkbox exercise. And that's one of the things that many security professionals are often saying about standards, there are many organizations out there that have been breached and they've been breached even though they comply with certain standards, frameworks, and regulations that comply with them. But even though they're complying, they are still being breached. And that's partly because they're complying with these things that were written five, six, seven, eight years ago in many cases. What we need to be looking at is how can we update them in shorter periods to reflect some of the threats that are emerging out there.</p>
<p>What will you be covering in your session?</p>
<p>In that keynote session, I'll be looking at giving a couple of examples of standards and frameworks that were out there, and I'll be looking at how they meet today's environment and pulling them to pieces intentionally. I know some of the ones that I've chosen are due to be changed or in the process of being changed, but effectively, the fact remains that standards do take a long time to change. We need to figure out how we can make the best use of them in a way that they're more than just a checkbox exercise. And in many respects, some organizations that may not have any security, they're a brilliant starting point. Having a good starting point is great. But if that starting point isn't going to take you anywhere more than a starting point, you need to think about the sort of threats that you're likely to get as an organization that you need to be doing. And I know that many organizations out there do have to comply in some respects with PCI DSS or HIPAA or with 27,001 and so on. So I've been looking at those as examples of saying what they were created for and how quickly they came out of date.</p>

				  Premature Standardization &amp; Interoperability  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>TL;DR: While I applaud the efforts to create “interoperability” in the SSI, decentralized identity, authentic data, and whatever else you want to call this domain, it’s premature to think we have real “standards.” We have, instead, premature standardization and tiny pockets of very focused interoperability.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is an early document that will likely evolve – in that more and more depth may be provided. The content may be re-factored enough that what this document looks like in mid-2022 could look wildly different in a short period.</p>
<p>Here’s my premise – we don’t have standards nor interoperability – at least not as people really need. We have been through a process that is powerful and good – but what we have is what I call “premature standardization.” It’s a great start but nowhere near where things will be.</p>
<p>There are many reasons we haven’t reached “interoperability,” and I believe we are far away from deep interop.</p>
<p>First, we have attempted an immaculate conception approach to achieve interoperability. We think we could define what the baby will be and not do the hard and messy work of really creating something.</p>
<p>You can’t jump the steps required to generate real Interoperability. The reasons are deeper than I will go into right now, but interoperability is born out of the desire for systems to interact. Sure we have that notionally in the various groups attacking this problem – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/working-group-activity/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>, and other places – are working to create multiple things that will be needed in the complex symphony of interoperability that we require.</p>
<p>Here’s the starting point for my premise – you can’t skip steps.</p>
<p>It would help if you got your industry understanding things at a very, very deep and intimate depth. What is really needed as opposed to proposing ideas that haven’t been used in earnest for long enough?</p>
<p>There are two key dimensions that you need to understand.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 Industry/Ecosystems – Are you talking about a single ecosystem or moving between wildly different ecosystems? 
 Technical Stacks – Are you talking about interoperability between systems using the same stack or different stacks? 
 
<p>These two dimensions need to be handled separately.</p>
<p>Each dimension – the Ecosystems and the Stacks have different needs.</p>
<p>Different ecosystems will have competing requirements. Let’s use SSI as an example. Let’s compare two different industries to see their different needs.</p>



Industry One
Industry Two



<p>– credentials need to be small, and the devices providing them have a severe limit on power draw</p>
<p>– the credentials used are used in total (i.e. their full data payload is always at play)</p>
<p>– the credentials must work when major parts of the system are disconnected or offline for extended periods</p>


<p>– High-value credentials that contain very private information are key</p>
<p>– Verifiers of the information are legally required to ask only what is necessary for their query</p>
<p>– Offline is essential and, in some cases, critical, but not expected to be running offline for weeks on end</p>




<p>This is a somewhat artificial but not unreal scenario. Compare the IoT industry with the travel industry; you will see that they are pretty distinct. There certainly are similar patterns, though.</p>
<p>Let’s similarly look at different stacks.</p>



Stack One
Stack Two



<p>– used across various integration cases – data from databases, sensors, governments, etc.</p>
<p>– the system is message-centric</p>
<p>– the system is meant to run on mobile and low-power devices</p>


<p>– Broadly created to meet integration needs with IAM systems (e.g. OIDC).</p>
<p>– Used for data sharing in an API web-centric context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Both stacks above are valid and meet a particular set of needs.</p>
<p>How can these Ecosystems and Stacks be interoperable?</p>
<p>They do this in stages – and IN ORDER.</p>
<p>They all start in a Single Ecosystem and Single Stack. We’ve seen many of these.</p>
<p>THEN they start crossing into the Multiple sides – but they really only add one of the dimensions at a time. A Single Stack &amp; Single Ecosystem approach can do one of the following at a time:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 Add Mulltiple Ecosystems (Path 1) – given various business reasons, using the same stack and applying the approaches to multiple industries expands the breadth and significantly: the depth of knowledge of where the Stacks meets/falls short. 
 Add Multiple Stack (Path 2) – in the same ecosystem adding other stacks into play begins to learn where different approaches work better and where there is no need to duplicate capabilities. 
 
<p>The following two paths are more about pressure from outside, and both get pulled into the broader Multiple Ecosystem + Multiple Stack world.</p>
<p>The critical thing to understand here is that an Interoperability Compliance Suite is required for either of the following paths to be viable. This compliance suite sets the conditions by which competitors can point to a reference as their definition of interoperability.</p>
<p>Depending on which path (1 or 2) was taken, we have two courses:</p>
 
 A Multiple Stack + Single Ecosystem adds support for Multiple Ecosystems (Path 3) &nbsp;– the compliance suites here help more about context, ecosystem-specific semantics, and syntax. 
 A Single Stack + Multiple Ecosystem adds support for Multiple Stacks (Path 4) – this path required Interoperability Compliance Suites to prove that the competing stacks are not finger-pointing. 
 
<p>I am unaware of any real interoperable solutions that circumvented these paths. Further, each transition is expensive in terms of resources (people, time and funds), so the market pulls it. This is a “you can’t push a rope” scenario.</p>

<p>Synthetic identities can easily be mistaken for real identities and can wreak havoc on companies that fall victim. So how can you differentiate between the two?</p>
<p>What is synthetic identity theft? Synthetic identity theft, or synthetic identity fraud, happens when a social security number is stolen and combined with fake personal information. The number is then used to open accounts, make purchases and steal money.</p>
 How Does Synthetic Identity Fraud Work? 
<p>Synthetic identity fraud (SIF) is a new form of identity theft that leverages modern technology and the realities of a data-driven society to take advantage of individuals and organizations unprepared to address the complex problems of data security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primarily, synthetic identity theft strikes us when we least expect it. While they won’t harm individual consumers, they can significantly impact organizations that hackers fool.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Synthetic Identity? 
<p>In modern cybersecurity, “digital identity” refers to the collective information used to represent an individual in online systems. Depending on the organization, service, and applications, this individual identity might include many different pieces of information–account numbers, phone numbers, address information, unique identification numbers, payment or credit information, Social Security Numbers, etc.</p>
<p>A synthetic identity, as the name suggests, is “artificial.” A hacker uses a piece of legitimate and fake data to construct a synthetic identity that can be used for nefarious purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While traditional forms of identity theft rely on hackers stealing partial or whole sets of information representing a real identity connected to a real person, synthetic identities are fake credentials anchored with a piece of accurate information to help bypass security. <br>
<br>
These synthetic identities are unique in that they seem like real identities, and they may fool financial or other institutions who see the legitimate information and assume that the identity is legitimate.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two approaches hackers take in making synthetic identities:</p>
 
 Manipulated Synthetics: A hacker will take real information, most often a social security number, and build a synthetic identity around it with natural or altered elements that include phone numbers, addresses, fake names, and so on. They may even make small changes to the SSN if there is any potential for reusing it elsewhere.  
 Manufactured Synthetics: If a hacker can get some information on fake or non-existent SSNs (for example, from a range of numbers used for randomly assigning new numbers), they can essentially create a fully-faked identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The challenge of synthetic identities is that, for the most part, they are tough to track. Hackers using synthetic tactics may sign up for services (a credit card, a buyer’s account) and use them normally for years, building reputation and available credit. Then, once enough credit is available, they will spend the money, burn the account, and vanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike traditional fraud, where consumers are victims, financial institutions are usually the biggest targets for synthetic fraud. The institutions that find themselves victims of synthetic identity fraud may have little or no recourse. Unless the hackers left a paper trail of their activities, the synthetic identity is just a hollow figure in their system that was never real.</p>
 Why Are Synthetic Identity Threats More Common? 
<p>The invention of synthetic identity threats isn’t a new and random phenomenon… instead, it is a natural attack vector that has come about due to how we approach digital information and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some factors that have played a role in the rise of synthetic identity hacks include:</p>
 
 Credit Card Security Improvements: It’s simply not as easy as it once was to hack credit card information. New developments in a card protection, compliance requirements, and the ability to track and reverse fraudulent transactions have made credit card theft… not impossible but trickier than it once was. This is due, in part, because many security measures have lined up to protect digital identities.  
 Increased Online Activity for Payments and Benefits: The reason that credit security has gotten so advanced is due, in part, to the drastic expansion in online eCommerce and digital storefronts. Customers increasingly rely on digital-only or hybrid shopping experiences for goods and services, and these storefronts are almost exclusively Card Not Present (CNP) transactions–which means that they are ripe for fraud.<br>
 
 
 How Can You Recognize Synthetic Identity Theft? 
<p>Synthetic identity theft is a long game–-hackers will often wait years, building up identities to steal tens of thousands of dollars and leaving businesses and financial institutions holding the bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses and consumers/employees must stay vigilant in looking for potential synthetic fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some tell-tale signs include:</p>
 
 Abnormal Credit Reports: If you work with an organization that checks consumer credit reports (or are a consumer looking at a credit report), you can see if any unusual activity has occurred related to your SSN. <br>
<br>
More importantly, fraudsters can steal SSNs for children who technically do not have credit, which means that a report could be tied to a synthetic account using an existing SSN connected to a minor. Coordinating credit checks for these numbers can help you see if something strange is going on tied to those numbers.  
 Social Security Statements: Social Security Statements report when payments are made into the Social Security fund as part of withholding taxes. If a business or user notices discrepancies in payments to Social Security, it could mean a fraudster has used false credentials to gain employment. 
 Strange Bills and Multiple Addresses: If you check any official documentation, online bills with lenders and credit companies, or other organizations, you may find new, strange addresses included in those statements. You may even start receiving strange bills in the mail. These signs could mean someone using some of your information to build a synthetic identity.&nbsp; 
 
 How Can You Prevent Synthetic Identity Threats? 
<p>The best defense against threats from synthetic identity fraud is, for the most part, tied to proactive cybersecurity approaches related to protecting user identity information during and after authentication and authorization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these approaches include:</p>
 
 Strong Identity Management: Your organization should have tough identity management and authentication security. This includes using MFA for all authentication purposes, having superior security for stored authentication credentials and identity data, and avoiding the pitfalls of centralized identity management like honeypot databases or lack of proper data obfuscation. 
 Behavioral Biometrics: Agencies that manage identities can utilize behavioral biometrics to connect the dots between different pieces of those identities to determine potentially fraudulent activity. <br>
<br>
As their name suggests, behavioral biometrics are a way to identify patterns of behavior between pieces of information and tie them together with assurance measures like advanced biometrics for added, preventative security. 
 Holistic Cybersecurity: Identity management and data protection must extend across your organization. This means having a comprehensive understanding of data, identity management, authentication and access management across all relevant systems across customer and employee identity journeys.

				<p>The Hyperledger Indy + Aries bundle of technologies, complete with Anoncreds verifiable credential format, was the first production-ready suite of SSI technologies to hit the market. Trinsic’s founding team were key contributors in the <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">beginnings of the Aries project</a>. Shortly thereafter, Trinsic <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id/status/1232289435317784582">launched the world’s first full-stack SSI platform</a> based on these technologies. Subsequently, that Aries-powered platform has been used in hundreds of proofs-of-concept, pilot projects, and production deployments. Those experiences produced mountains of learnings critical for application developers, infrastructure vendors such as ourselves, and the open source community in our shared goal of self-sovereign identity.<br><br></p><p>As more customers went into production, we gathered their feedback and heard them loud and clear. We made improvements to our platform to address their concerns where it was possible. However, when we realized our customers were facing critical limitations caused by the underlying tech stack, we began developing an updated version of our platform that would reduce our dependency on these technologies and enable a better platform for our customers.</p>

				<p>Trinsic’s goal is to be the infrastructure of choice for developers who are building identity wallets and ecosystems to provide more people access to re-usable and self-sovereign identity. We make complex technology easy to use through turnkey APIs and understandable documentation.<br><br></p><p>As an infrastructure provider, it is critical we build on modular technologies that are scalable and extensible so we can:<br><br></p>  Support a variety of standards as they evolve, including verifiable credential formats like W3C VC Data Model, BBS Signature w/ VCs, KERI ACDCs, and ISO 18013-5 mDLs; communication protocols such as OIDC and DIDComm; and roots of trust such as ION, Ethereum, and traditional DNS infrastructure.  Scale to the volumes and metrics needed by our customers, in terms of throughput, response time, and reliability.  Build developer tools that fit our customers’ workflows, including wallets that are accessible using any device, available in multiple programming languages, and support built-in governance.  <p><br>These are the main motivations behind our development of Trinsic Ecosystems, the next iteration of our platform. Trinsic Ecosystems is built with the lessons learned from production deployments with over 100,000 live, end-users across the world. In addition, Trinsic Ecosystems already has customers using it in production with extremely positive results.<br><br></p><p>While we are investing all our efforts into making Trinsic Ecosystems the best it can be, we will continue to support our existing platform for the foreseeable future. We have many customers whose projects are built on the Indy/Aries stack, and we have every intention of making each of them successful. Moving forward:<br><br></p>  We will eventually sunset our existing platform based on Aries, although we do not have a specific date set for that. When we make that decision we’ll communicate it publicly and work with each team with production deployment on a migration plan.  Other than a few edge cases, Trinsic Ecosystems is far superior to Trinsic’s existing platform, and we will work closely with any of our customers who wish to migrate to ensure a smooth transition.  We are targeting for Trinsic Ecosystems to become the exclusive platform we provide to new customers by the end of the calendar year.  <p><br>For more information about Trinsic Ecosystems and the specific technical differences relative to our existing platform, please see our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/">Migration Guide</a> in our documentation.</p>

												<a>How do I get started with Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>Trinsic Ecosystems is being used in production, and we (and our customers!) couldn’t be happier with the results. We’re working closely with an exclusive set of customers to ensure their feedback makes it into the product rapidly. If you’re interested in building on Trinsic Ecosystems, <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">please </a><a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">reach out</a>.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What about interoperability with Aries moving forward?</a>
					 

					 <p>Interoperability is a keystone of SSI and something our customers almost universally need eventually. Today, Trinsic Ecosystems supports the W3C verifiable credential standard and OIDC-based verifications, which are interoperable in their respective domains, but Trinsic Ecosystems is not interoperable with Aries yet.</p><p><br>We intend on bringing support for Aries interoperability to Trinsic Ecosystems over time. One of the most challenging issues with the Hyperledger Indy/Aries tech is how bundled the current implementations are. Trinsic Ecosystems is built in such a way where we can easily add support for components of the stack separately—and some of these components are on the roadmap already:<br><br></p>  Indy: a legitimate option for anchoring public DIDs  Aries: messaging protocols and interoperability profiles for exchanging data between wallets  Anoncreds: a variant of verifiable credential which is now beginning to be documented and standardized   
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What should I do if I’m currently using Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>Of course the answer is “it depends”. If you’re experimenting with a proof-of-concept, then you probably don’t have much to worry about. We wrote a document outlining who should migrate, and how, in our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/#motivations-to-build-the-new-platform">documentation</a>. If you’re intending on scaling to users in production or have questions about migration, we suggest you <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">get in touch with us</a> to discuss your situation.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not fix Trinsic’s existing platform instead of build Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>We invested months of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars on improving Trinsic’s existing platform. But we found some of the challenges with the underlying tech caused scaling and performance problems that couldn’t be feasibly overcome. The best option ahead of us was to develop something built from the ground-up with the requirements of real-world, production usage in mind.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not wait for the community to fix the problems with Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>We’re focused on building the best products, period. We don’t have a <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/not-invented-here-syndrome/">“not built here” complex</a> with regard to developments in the SSI the space. Our customers and partners put their trust in us to be objective in our pursuit of the best possible platform. This is our only incentive—we don’t have consulting revenue or other forms of income to sustain us, so if we don’t create the best platform on earth, our business will be at risk.<br><br></p><p>So while we welcome developments of the open source ecosystem, we can’t sit around and wait for improvements like Anoncreds 2.0, which has been discussed for ~4 years, to be completed. If there are solutions that better solve our problems, we have a fiduciary duty to opt for those solutions.</p>

				<p>We are all in this space because we envision a future where users have more control of their identity. At Trinsic, we’ll continue to support technologies that usher in that future as quickly as possible by helping developers build fantastic products that will be adopted. We encourage everyone to share their opinions and experiences using our technology. We hope Kaliya’s analysis will spur constructive dialog in the community that will drive improvements and innovation in SSI.<br><br></p><p>We are happy to engage with specific questions you have on our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ">Community Slack channel</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">Twitter</a> and look forward to the discourse.</p>

   Passwords have been around since the invention of computers and are still the primary way of protecting a large percentage of our infrastructure today. However, despite being the go-to method for security, digital passwords are inherently problematic and will continue to be problematic as technology becomes more advanced.

<p>Passwords have been around since the invention of computers and are still the primary way of protecting a large percentage of our infrastructure today. However, despite being the go-to method for security, digital passwords are inherently problematic and will continue to be problematic as technology becomes more advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwords are knowledge-based, meaning they can easily be guessed or stolen. They’re also a source of user frustration, which can negatively impact employee productivity, customer satisfaction, and ultimately revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that considered, how do you reconcile this when passwords—despite their shortcomings—are really the only digital security solution society has ever known?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question. The answer is going passwordless, which several leading enterprises across the industry are pursuing via FIDO passkeys.&nbsp;</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN Insights, by our Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick&nbsp;Pinos. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article written by Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology.</p><p>Web3 is an interconnected set of technologies, protocols, concepts, and frameworks that represent the next stage of a more decentralized Internet. These past few years, we saw glimpses of a Web3 enabled future through Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Both of these technologies enabled new kinds of online peer-to-peer interactions. DeFi allowed users access to financial instruments without meddling middlemen, and NFTs enabled provable ownership of virtual goods such as in-game assets, digital art, or intellectual property.</p><p>However, DeFi and NFTs are just two verticals of Web3. Other important verticals include Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for decentralized coordination in the creation of Web3 infrastructure, and Decentralized Identity (DID) for the self-sovereignty of one’s own data while interacting with Web3 services. We can predict what it will take for these remaining Web3 pillars to see similar adoption by studying the history of how the more well-known pillars saw rapid adoption.</p><p>DeFi</p><p>While DeFi became the most popular blockchain use case in late 2020, many of the most popular DeFi projects existed for years before. MakerDAO launched in 2017. Uniswap, Compound, and Aave launched in 2018. 1inch launched in 2019, and so on. You could use these services for their intended purposes, but it wasn’t until yield farming programs were put into place that usage took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Indeed, yield farming took the crypto world by storm in 2020. The prospect of earning tokens with your assets made many a millionaire and captured the attention of many new DeFi projects looking to grow a user base very quickly. As a result, a slew of projects launched in a short amount of time and aimed at capitalizing on this phenomenon. From decentralized exchanges and liquidity aggregators to decentralized lending and derivatives, almost any DeFi project could receive a massive boost in users and total value locked from offering token incentives to provide liquidity to their platform.</p><p>It’s no surprise that offering financial incentives will draw in a large user base, but what about retention? Unfortunately, many DeFi projects implemented yield farming unsustainably, issuing massive rewards through inflation of their own governance tokens, resulting in high but short-lived APYs at the expense of their project’s token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>NFTs</p><p>As the DeFi hype died down in 2021, attention moved to NFTs. It was possible to mint NFTs back in 2017, but it was technically challenging to do so. Even after no-code NFT minting tools became easier to use in 2020, pioneered by NFT marketplaces such as Rarible, it wasn’t until 2021 when prominent artists like Beeple repeatedly sold NFT art for tens of millions of dollars a piece that content creators from all over rushed to mint their art as NFTs in the hopes of earning an income through this new medium. PFP projects pushed the NFT hype forward even more. Why sell one or a few NFT art pieces when you can sell 10,000 programmatically generated variations of the same&nbsp;image?</p><p>For better or for worse, the financialization of a Web3 technology accelerates its adoption.</p><p>That leaves us with DAOs and DID. There are many Web3 projects that use these technologies today. But unlike DeFi and NFTs, DAOs and DID have yet to see adoption on a similar scale, and I believe it is mainly due to the lack of financialization of these technologies. Once it becomes straightforward as to how users can make money with this tech, we’ll see similar hype cycles and corresponding corrections on the likes of DeFi and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Lets see some examples of what such financialization would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>DAOs</p><p>There are many no-code tools that allow for communities to spin up their own DAOs, such as Snapshot for decentralized proposal-making and voting, and Gnosis for multi-sig management of a group’s treasury. In today’s DAOs, community members vote on governance decisions, elect committees, serve as signers on its multisig, etc. But how are they compensated for their time and contributions? Making participating in a DAO financially sustainable for participants is key for mass adoption.</p><p>One such way is through the standardization and automation of bounty programs. Manual bounty programs are cumbersome, with bounty creators needing to write out assignments and claim forms to manually review and disburse payments. If DeFi projects had to onboard liquidity providers one at a time, then manually sit down and disburse yield farming payments to each one, they would have never grown as big as they did as quickly as they&nbsp;did.</p><p>Similarly, bounty programs need to be re-invented like an assembly line. Bounties need to become standardized and easy to post, find, take, review, and integrate back into the main project. We also need to expand the idea of what constitutes a bounty to include tasks and micro-tasks. Designing a logo, voting in a proposal, reposting a tweet, and serving on a committee all should be valid bounties with different scopes and rewards. Once bounties become standardized and processes become automated, there could be as many bounty hunters as there were yield&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Decentralized Identity</p><p>Currently, data brokers make billions of dollars off of peoples’ data collected via countless terms of service agreements and privacy policies signed every day. You see none of that revenue, and in some cases you can’t even opt out of having your data sold by these data&nbsp;brokers.</p><p>DID is a system that attaches decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for people, entities, and objects with verifiable credentials (VCs) that store properties about those identities. This new structure allows for users to hide their data, selectively reveal it only when necessary, and even charge to access it. This opens up a host of new monetization strategies for users. If you owned your own data, you could benefit from directly selling it. Examples are earning revenue for consensually selling your own data for surveys, targeted advertising, studies, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Scalability comes through the automation of these opportunities and programmatic access to such trusted and verifiable data, with streaming payments sent to the provider on a per-use basis. Such a process is not possible without a solid Web3 foundational infrastructure. It needs to become easier for projects to buy datasets directly from the community directly than from buying datasets from data brokers. And, on the user side, it needs to become easy for users to record and sell their data repeatedly easily to as many buyers as they would&nbsp;like.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There are a plethora of Web3 technologies and even more projects implementing them. Financialization of these technologies isn’t all that matters to drive mass adoption, but it is a powerful driving force. We must take great care in implementing it sustainably and with properly aligned incentives in place to ensure Web3 develops optimally.</p><p>We are in the early stages and are just beginning to see glimpses of what a Web3 enabled future looks like. But, using the recent past as an example, we can predict what it will look like and what we need to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-06-the-financialization-of-daos-and-did-370d959f620d">OWN Insights 07: The Financialization of DAOs and DID</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 In a world where we rely increasingly on digital information, we need to know that the credentials we share are accurate. <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> (or Trust Hubs) will help us verify the authenticity of the information we share by storing digital certificates that can verify the identity of individuals and organizations. These certificates can authenticate online transactions, access sensitive information, or sign documents electronically.&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>Trust Registries will help to reduce fraud and ensure that only accurate information is shared. They will also help build back confidence in the digital economy and enable new types of interactions that are impossible with traditional paper-based systems.</p>
<p>As we continue <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-task-force/">highlighting the importance</a> of Trust Registries over the coming months, the following real-world example from the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets-series/">State of Digital Wallet Series</a> “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/further-research-and-effort-digitalwallet-part-10-16/">Further Research &amp; Effort</a>” gives us a great picture of how critical Trust Registries are within digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
 A Home Renovation. 
<p>Let’s imagine a home renovation project with three main groups to think about:</p>
 
 Homeowner 
 Contractor 
 City Inspector 
 
<p>Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are accurate. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is honest. Their Digital Wallet needs to prove a few things:</p>
 
 The Contractor was the entity to which the Insurer (the Issuer) gave the Credential. Done inside the Contractor’s Digital Wallet – it uses cryptography to prove that they still control the insurance Credential. 
 That the Insurer cryptographically signed the Credential – letting the Homeowner know that the information hasn’t been tampered with. 
 That the Insurer is a bona fide insurance company, there will need to be a Trust Hub that lists insurers for a particular area for this to happen. 
 
<p>Digital Wallets can do all of the above in just a few seconds while doing other checks. Each party involved has pieces of information that they need to verify.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Homeowner wants to know that they have the proper permits and licences for the job and that their Contractor and employees are fully licensed, insured, and up to scratch.&nbsp; 
 The Contractor wants to know that the Homeowner has the proper permits, licence, inspections and insurance.&nbsp; 
 The City Inspector wants to know that the Homeowner and Contractor have the required licenses, training, and other paperwork. 
 
<p>The paper-based verification process takes so long that few homeowners ever do the checks they should. With digital wallets and the ecosystems behind them, verifications can get done in seconds—while we greet each other in person.</p>
 A critical tool for re-establishing trust 
<p>Trust Registries will be a critical tool for re-establishing trust online. They will help users identify trustworthy websites and online services and help businesses build trust with their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it’s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the confidence we need in our systems.</p>

<blockquote>The International Monetary Fund pitched for a globally coordinated, consistent, and comprehensive approach to crypto regulation through its recent publication.</blockquote><blockquote>The IMF noted that the divided approach to crypto regulations among countries (ban outright or accept with open arms) is resulting in a fragmented global response.</blockquote><blockquote>Although the IMF sees a global consensus on crypto regulation is forming, albeit slowly, the agency is concerned that “the longer this takes, the more national authorities will get locked into differing regulatory frameworks.”</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. Having touched a whopping $3 trillion in 2021 from a market cap of a couple of billion dollars in 2013, when there were just seven cryptocurrencies in existence, tells a&nbsp;story.</p><p>Although phenomenal, this incredible growth hasn’t been without its share of problems. For instance, with rising demand for crypto-related products, the failed projects, hacks, high volatility, rug pull, and pump and dump schemes have increased, too.</p><p>Besides, such massive traction has attracted the attention of many traditional financial institutions, which has led to fears of the increasing intertwining of the crypto market and the traditional financial ecosystem. The experts believe that any drastic fall in the crypto market can spill over to the broader financial industry.</p><blockquote>Thus, crypto regulations must ensure consumer protection and keep a check on the industry without stifling innovation.</blockquote><p>Easier said than done. Without global consensus, crypto regulations will just be an equivalent of a toothless tiger!</p><blockquote>The International Monetary Fund, too, pitched for an internationally coordinated, consistent, and comprehensive approach to crypto regulations in its <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Regulating-crypto-Narain-Moretti">latest publication</a>, noting that “the right rules could provide a safe space for innovation.”</blockquote><p>The IMF also pointed out that “applying existing regulatory frameworks to crypto assets, or developing new ones, is challenging for several reasons.”</p> So, what makes Crypto Regulation Complex? <p>There are several reasons: the rapidly evolving crypto market, lack of resources among regulators, patchy data, and an ever-growing number of cryptocurrencies. Thus, global coordination is a&nbsp;must.</p><p>Interestingly, we are also seeing coordination between various actors within the crypto market to make crypto compliance as smooth as possible. Recently, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/partnerships/2022/fis-partners-shyft-network-for-improved-crypto-reg-compliance/">FIS Global joined hands with Shyft Network</a> to enable companies to participate in the crypto landscape while complying with the complex and ever-changing world of crypto regulations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FISGlobal/status/1499089662744449029?t=7lcSIVxe7OZ6XMjKD0ChAw&amp;s=19">Image Source</a>) No Unison&nbsp;Approach <p>Although the call for crypto regulations has gained momentum pretty recently, not all regulators and authorities have been sitting ducks. The United States, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/travel-rule-will-be-mandatory-in-the-uk-by-23-september-2023">the United Kingdom</a>, Switzerland, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024">the European Union</a> had introduced or amended legislation to reign in the crypto industry even before the crypto assets attracted mainstream attention. Besides, international agencies, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), too, have published guidelines for the crypto industry.</p><p>How effective all the previous guidelines and regulations have been is a matter of discussion, given that a critical piece was missing: global coordination. For instance, the FATF Travel Rule has been adopted by only a handful of countries, which has compelled the FATF to urge governments to expedite Travel Rule adoption.</p><blockquote>The recent IMF publication also highlighted two vastly different approaches among countries when it comes to crypto regulation. On the one hand, some countries, like China, came down heavily against crypto assets by banning them outright. On the other hand, some countries welcome crypto companies with open arms, such as El Salvador. This results in a fragmented global response that defeats the purpose of regulating digital&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It is not to say that a global consensus is out of the question, as countries are discussing ways to regulate crypto assets in international forums, such as G20, as proposed by a G20 watchdog.

 KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot&nbsp;Project <p>Introduction by Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>The project on machine identities led by dena, the German federal energy agency, was finished successfully. KILT served as a core partner in this project by supplying the machine identities and demonstrating the utility of a blockchain protocol in a highly regulated environment like the energy sector. This was an important milestone for us: DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and KILT in general are ready for large scale, institutional use cases that fulfil requirements from regulators. Blockchain technology is finding its way into industry!</p><p>Also of note: During the project we deployed a complete KILT node on a Raspberry Pi-based smart meter, demonstrating the efficiency of Parity Substrate-based blockchains.</p><p>Blog Post by Majella Horan, Lead Writer for KILT Protocol<br><a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a> has released a report on its pilot project on digital machine identities as the basic building block for an automated energy system. KILT was part of the project, providing decentralized machine identities registered on the KILT blockchain and showing how blockchain technology can be used inside a highly-regulated environment.</p><p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> collaborated on this initiative with industry leaders from the energy sector, the digital economy and science including <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.enbw.com/">EnBW</a>, <a href="https://www.eon.com/en.html">e-on</a>, <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.my-oli.com/en/">Oli-Systems</a>, and <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50&nbsp;Hertz</a>.</p> dena Project: Background <p>Government agencies and industry are increasingly looking to blockchain solutions to help achieve effective and compliant digitalization. The modern energy industry faces challenges in coordinating an increasing number of energy-producing and energy-consuming devices in the grid infrastructure, from energy plants to electric vehicles, heat pumps and storage&nbsp;systems.</p><p>dena launched the Future Energy Lab pilot project in 2019 to explore these issues. The goal was to create a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralized digital registry that aimed to coordinate and connect devices and energy plants across the German energy&nbsp;system.</p><p>The project incorporated the current smart meter gateway technology, and required creating uniform digital identities for energy systems. It was designed as a three-pronged pilot project to demonstrate the technical, economic and regulatory feasibility of three variants:</p>  Storing the identity characteristics directly at the smart meter&nbsp;gateway  Storing the identity characteristics directly on the&nbsp;device  Storing the identity characteristics in the&nbsp;cloud  <p>All variants needed to meet governmental standards of data security and protection, scalability and privacy in a cost-effective way.</p><p>KILT Protocol was integrated for the first two variants, with the identities to be generated and stored directly on the&nbsp;devices.</p> Digital Machine Identities with&nbsp;KILT <p>As context for the KILT integration with dena, it’s important to understand KILT’s identity framework, which has two key components:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device (as a fingerprint does for humans),&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“Attesters”).  <p>In this way, a digital identity can be built for people, machines, services and anything that identities can be built&nbsp;on.</p><p>Standardized digital identities for machines form the basic building block for an automated and reliable energy system. For this pilot project with dena, the machine identities each contained:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identified the device,&nbsp;and  The characteristics, attributes or properties that made this machine different from others. These were attached to the DID in the form of digital certificates, or verifiable credentials (VCs). These credentials show the static and dynamic properties of the&nbsp;device.  <p>KILT is pleased to be part of the dena Future Energy Lab project, making a practical and effective contribution to current energy challenges and showing how blockchain technology can be used in a highly regulated, real-world environment.</p><p>The following is a technical description of the project including the technical integration of KILT. The full report is <a href="https://www.dena.de/fileadmin/dena/Publikationen/PDFs/2022/Digitale_Maschinen-Identitaeten_als_Grundbaustein_fuer_ein_automatisiertes_Energiesystem.pdf">published here</a> in German; dena will publish an English version&nbsp;shortly.</p> dena Project:&nbsp;Summary <p>The BMIL pilot project aimed to close an important gap that is currently a barrier to implementing a real-time energy economy using the smart meter gateway and blockchain technology: the lack of digital identities for energy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One of the key elements was to agree on and test uniform digital identity standards, namely DIDs and verifiable credentials.</p><p>The DID enables end-to-end encryption between digital agents, allowing data to be exchanged between participants and systems without the need for a centralized data silo by establishing a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL) that allows assets to register their identity (their unique DID and verifiable credentials).</p><p>These digital, self-sovereign and decentralized device identities were set up and either stored and anchored on the device itself, or via a digital twin in the cloud, depending on the&nbsp;variant.</p><p>Transmission of the digital identity was implemented in regular operation via the smart gateway infrastructure and could be linked to the BMIL through the installation of a BMIL-compatible smart&nbsp;meter.</p> dena Project: KILT Integration <p>The integration of the KILT Protocol into the BMIL project is summarized here, using the example of the device-centric identity management in conjunction with a dedicated Controllable Local System (CLS) device, the OLI Box. The integration was the same for both variants.</p><p>As the goal was to achieve a high degree of decentralization, the identities were stored directly on the respective devices and anchored on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>In the first step, the private/public key pair is generated on the box. The OLI box’s crypto chip provides the random input for generating the key pair to establish the necessary security and connect the keypair to the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Then the identifier or DID is generated on the device and anchored on the blockchain. The DID document is signed by the box in order to link it to the DID, and is then stored in the DID&nbsp;store.</p><p>Through the claimer application, the credential workflow is implemented on the OLI box. It implements the claiming of properties, the requesting of a credential, the storing of an issued credential on the box, and the sharing of credentials with the verifiers. It can either share the whole credential, or only single attributes via selective disclosure, if the verifier does not need to know the whole credential.</p><p>To ensure privacy, the credentials are not stored on the blockchain. Credentials remain with the device (the OLI box) and are only anchored on the blockchain as a hash representing the data by the issuer of the credential. The anchored credential on the blockchain does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the content and owner of the credential. Via the hash, only verifiers to which the credentials were disclosed can check the validity of that credential on the blockchain.</p><p>The different actors, e.g., the application of the Energy Web Foundation to prequalify device identities for different use cases through VC-based role assignment and others, communicate with each other via the KILT messaging service using encrypted messages.</p> dena Project: Conclusions <p>Digital identities built around DIDs and verifiable credentials provide the new standards needed for identity for governmental projects going forward. This standardization ensures uniformity, contributes to efficiency and security, and allows system services to be provided and called up fully automatically.</p><p>Future research will build on these findings and create services and applications to increase energy efficiency.</p><p>KILT is a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and DIDs, providing practical, secure identity solutions for enterprises and consumers.</p><p>Discover more on the KILT <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> to keep up with the latest&nbsp;news.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-in-action-the-dena-blockchain-pilot-project-a384cb2629a7">KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <br>
Can Digital Notarization Solve Digital ID’s Chicken-and-egg Problem? 
<p></p>
<p>Which came first, the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional, linear startup, a platform doesn’t need to acquire just one group of customers. At a minimum it needs two, its consumers and its producers.</p>
<p>But new platforms don’t initially create enough value to attract new users. It’s not economical for consumers to join the platform when there are no producers, and vice versa. This is called the chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
<p>This same problem exists in digital identity. Just switch out producers for issuers, consumers for verifiers, and platforms for ecosystems. And we have ourselves a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
<p>The business value of credential exchange happens at verifications (e.g., lowered costs, lowered risk/fraud, lowered friction). And for this business value to be created, more credentials are needed in holders’ wallets.</p>
<p>Does the digital ID chicken-and-egg problem get solved by governments issuing ID credentials to their citizens? Must we wait on governments to become issuers to solve it?</p>
<p>What if organizations that currently conduct examinations (e.g., a financial institution does KYC during account opening) can extend their processes into the issuance of credentials?</p>
<p>Or what if digital trust providers (e.g., document authentication) extend their offering into the issuance of machine readable credentials?</p>
<p>Do issuers need to have access to source data (and uniqueness) to become attesters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, notaries exist to attest to the validity of documents. And this practice is very much trusted by verifiers.</p>
<p>Can Digital Notarization solve Digital ID’s chicken-and-egg problem?</p>
 <br>
About Podcast Episode 
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Dan are:</p>
 
 How does the Chicken-and-egg Problem relate to digital identity? 
 Is there a dependency on Government IDs to seed the marketplace? 
 Are unique identifier databases required to become a credential issuer? 
 What is Transitive Trust? And how does it differ from how trust gets established otherwise (e.g., through backend API calls)? 
 The missing role in the trust triangle: The Examiner. 
 Can Examiners become Digital Notaries? 
 Rethinking Authentication and Authorization – using attestations from multiple issuers helps to create more trust. 
 How issuance can become a business model for many trusted service providers. 
 Some Challenges with the mDL (ISO/IEC 18013) Standard. 
 The benefits of using a Microcredential approach in Issuance. 
 Misconceptions about becoming credential issuers (e.g., assuming liability, data minimization).

<p>SEVENmile now issues digital graduation certificates that are fraud-proof and instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.</p><p>Zug, Switzerland – 8 September, 2022 – <a href="https://www.sevenmile.org.au/">SEVENmile</a>, an experiential learning program in Australia, that helps high-school students learn real-world skills, today announced a strategic collaboration with <a href="https://dock.io/">Dock Labs</a> to issue digital graduation certificates that are instantly and permanently verifiable using blockchain technology. SEVENmile now issues fraud-proof certificates, allowing students to prove their skills throughout their lives and ensure immediate trust with employers.</p><p>SEVENmile’s entrepreneurial training program pairs high school students with business owners to teach students problem-solving techniques and help them gain an understanding of real-life business issues. SEVENmile believes that in 2022, a graduation certificate in a paper format has no real-world value to a student. Printed certificates are difficult to verify and, because of that, do not help students prove their skills. Dock Labs’ verifiable credentials platform, Dock Certs, is now enabling SEVENmile to issue hundreds of fraud-proof digital certificates and credentials that students can store on a mobile phone. By scanning the QR Code on the certificate, a hiring company will have immediate certainty and trust that the certificate is authentic.</p><p>Degree and certificate fraud is a billion-dollar industry and a growing problem worldwide. Dock Labs uses innovative <a href="https://dock.io/verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and blockchain technology to ensure that digital certificates and credentials cannot be forged and remain verifiable forever. SEVENmile’s graduates will now have a future-proof digital credential that will allow them to create a lifelong record of the skills they learnt and ensure they can always prove it. SEVENmile is collaborating with the New South Wales Education State Agency to expand the program to 1500 high schools by 2024.</p><p>“The evolution of Web1 to Web3 has occurred over a couple of decades. From viewing static HTML text content (Web1) to the democratization of personal data (Web3), it has been a wild ride at times. At SEVENmile Ltd, we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data is a vital platform that will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock Labs to secure the credentials of students we train.” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.</p><p>“Working with Greg and SEVENmile has not only opened our eyes to the incredible work they are doing, it’s also shown us the power of verifiable credentials in an educational setting, providing students with tamper proof digital certificates that are completely under their control, respect their privacy, and can be verified instantly” said Nick Lambert, Dock Labs’ CEO.<br></p><p>About SEVENmile</p><p>SEVENmile Ltd prepares students to become workforce-ready graduates or next-generation innovators. Student’s skillful, confident mindset exposes opportunities, ignites ambition, and fosters the attitudes and skills that are the pathway to success. The SEVENmile programs are designed for 15-18 year old high school students, and culminates in an event where students present their proposed solutions to the real-world problems of local business owners.<br>For more information, visit <a href="https://www.sevenmile.org.au/">https://www.sevenmile.org.au</a></p><p>About Dock Labs</p><p>Dock Labs’ Verifiable Credentials Platform, Dock Certs, provides a highly secure and scalable solution for businesses to issue and verify digital credentials and certificates that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos CMO, Michael Cichon, and 1Kosmos COO, Huzefa Olia, discuss best practices for fixing multifactor authentication.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, hello everybody, and welcome again to the 1Kosmos blog. My name is Michael Cichon, I’m the Chief Marketing Officer, here at 1Kosmos. I’m here to welcome Huzefa Olia, our Chief Operating Officer, to the blog for a discussion on multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>How are you today, Huzefa?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>I am good, I’m just getting roasted in this summer heat. I’ve been hoping the temperatures drop, that’s not happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That tends to happen here during the dog days of August. So we are recording this, August of 2022, just for the record. This will be available on demand. Well, thanks for joining today, Huzefa. I just want to start off with a baseline. What is multifactor authentication and why do we have it? What’s the need for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So multifactor authentication, if we have to explain it, if we had to explain why it was put in place first, and it essentially goes back, let’s rewind the clock and let’s look at the first stages of how a digital identity, or a digital user, would use to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>So we created a proxy, because in the real world, we can essentially walk anywhere, and you know, Michael Cichon is Michael Cichon, but in your digital identity, you needed to prove who you are, and you created a proxy in the form of a user name or a password. And over time, people realize that that alone is not enough, because they cannot trust your user name and a password, a proxy of you, because that can be compromised. And that led to, let me ask you something else, or let me ask you something else or challenge you in a way to prove who you are. And that’s where the advent of multifactor authentication, and subset of it, which is a two factor authentication came into existence as well. So, that’s about where the history goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Okay. So most of us are familiar with this. It’s the SMS code we get on our text on our cell phone to respond to, to prove we are who we are. So, what we’ve done is we had a proxy and a password, we kind of added another proxy, which is another factor. Is this what’s broken about MFA? Well, let me just ask the question, is MFA broken then? I mean, what’s wrong with this approach?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Essentially, what is wrong in any kind of an authentication flow today, is there is no identity in the mix. Today, authentication relies on two aspects, knowledge, you remembering the password or you remembering a pin that you set, or the second is trusting the device. Essentially, if I’m sending you an OTP and it’s coming to your certain device, or if you have a TOTP, which is part of a device. And both of these, in my opinion, are band aids to a very, very big problem. And that problem being that identity is nowhere in the equation of your authentication journey.</p>
<p>The whole concept of you relying on a user’s knowledge, which can be compromised very easily, and there are so many different methods, some of them not even sophisticated to get the information from you to compromise what your particular credential is. And then the second is, you talk about any kind of a multifactor authentication, or sending an OTP. It’s phishable, as well as at the same time, you’re authenticating the device, but not the user who’s actually using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, well, I’ve also heard the, talking to a few analysts, that users are generally not too thrilled with MFA. So is there a user experience issue, I would imagine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think there’s this joke on YouTube, and I found it hilarious, the history of password. And the comedians essentially said that you had a six character, or an eight character password, and then that wasn’t enough. And then you wanted a capital letter in it, that wasn’t enough. Then you put a symbol in it, and then it went on. And now those have become 12 characters and 16 characters, and you don’t trust that as well, and you essentially added a multi-factored layer on top of it.</p>
<p>So through this entire journey of security, the one piece that has never been considered or never been brought to the equation, is the user experience. We will keep cramming more and more friction to the user, because it cannot compromise the security. I’m not saying that security should be compromised per user experience, but going back to your earlier question, why are users so irritated with this method of authentication, especially with multifactor and everything that is involved? You’re adding more and more complex layers in a simple authentication flow for a particular user, which does not need to be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right. All right, well, historically this has all made sense. I mean, technology was what it was 20, 30, 40 years ago, and we’ve used what we could, we’ve added layers on top of it, but we have these two problems now. We have an identity problem, we’ve got a user experience problem. So how is it that what we can go about resolving to solve these two problems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Let’s look at, take ourselves out of the digital world. And today, if you have to prove who you are when you walk into a bank, or somebody says, are you Michael Cichon? How would you do it? There would be a certain ID, and that’s about it. It’s as easy as that. So, somebody looking at your face or some form of a biometrics committed picture. And with more technology enhancements, with devices now that can take biometrics into consideration, it is time to move away from the band aids and look at a different way of authenticating the user. Biometrics is central in this entire flow to replace what the authentication flow needs to be. And then if you talk about the user experience side of it, instead of burdening the user and remembering what your 16 character password is, and now wait for that OTP that I’m going to send you, just essentially make it very, very simple for them.</p>
<p>Let them just swipe their fingerprint or authenticate using their face to log in. That consistently, when industry experts have rated this from a user experience standpoint and as well as from a security standpoint, is extremely rated higher, compared to the legacy methods which are out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So again, now a lot of us are familiar with this. We’ve had the iPhones for a while, we’ve got the face ID, the thumb ID. Is that the 1Kosmos approach? Or what is the 1Kosmos approach then, to solving this MFA problems with biometrics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>So, number one, to begin with, what we recommend 1Kosmos is, move away from traditional MFA which is there. Your SMS base codes are a TOTP that has been sent to you, and move towards a biometrics based method of logging in. Now, the device to authenticate can be your face ID and touch ID, and it’s absolutely the first step in authenticating that particular user. But essentially we also preach that that should not be the only method what the user has to use.</p>
<p>Because again, they’re having studies, when it comes to face ID, there are multiple different users who can register. In fact, I have a personal story when it comes to face ID, my dad was visiting and I looked at his phone and it recognized me. I had not enrolled myself onto the face ID. And it made me realize, do I look really that old, now that my dad looked that old. So again, those are technologies, or devices, where they have been proven, where there are certain gaps. And we recommend essentially looking at the user live, or what we call as a live ID. And that can be used either for authenticating into, let’s say a crown jewels, or any kind of authentication as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So, I use a password that doesn’t verify identity, I use an SMS code, that maybe gets me closer, still doesn’t do identity. Now I do my fingerprint on the phone, and that still doesn’t give me identity. I do my face on the phone, that doesn’t give me identity. But you’re saying we do the live ID, which gives us identity. How does that give us identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Because, very simple. When you register a user, you can essentially say, at first time I’m registering you I need to know who you are. And we’ve taken a look at the whole digital identity registration process and authentication and trying to bridge both of them. There is this beautiful standard of missed 863 dash three. Essentially it lays out that how can I trust a user’s identity, but assigning an assurance level to it.</p>
<p>So the first time when the user walks in through the gate, we go through this identity proofing journey and assign an identity assurance level to them. And as part of that particular process, essentially what we are asking the user to do is, today, similar to what you would do in the physical world, take your ID, your government issued ID, scan it, and we ask the user to enroll then their live selfie and compare both of them together. And that essentially creates that fingerprint that we establish onto the system.</p>
<p>Next time when you’re logging in, just use your face. We compare it with that particular fingerprint I know that is actually tied to Michael Cichon, and then we let the user in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right, so that makes sense. It’s passionless, multifactor authentication backed by a verified identity. So for the very first time, whether it’s a worker or contractor, or a customer, or even a citizen logging on to a government website for the very first time with a verified identity, you can have a high level of assurance that that person is who they claim to be, that goes way past a knowledge base factor, like you happen to know a password, or you happen to have an SMS code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And you use knowledge factors or knowledge base authentication, God no. We definitely want to move away from those. Yes. But when, in our authentication flows, what we tell our customers is that along with passing in the factor, which can be your face ID, touch ID, or even your live ID, we can essentially give you a flag on what that assurance level of that specific user is. And in certain scenarios, specifically with respect to customers, the more I trust the user, the more I can open up my services as well. And that becomes extremely interesting for any kind of a service provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, that’s interesting, because I would imagine that has tentacles into this zero trust notion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And also when it comes to the user experience side of it, when it comes to zero trust, which not a lot of people discuss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, this is exactly what I wanted you to talk about, so I very much appreciate your time today. We do have an upcoming webinar on this. It’s called MFA, Tried to Fix Passwords, now how do we fix MFA? Now this particular webinar is coming up on September 22nd, 10:00 AM West Coast time, 1:00 PM East Coast time. If you’re viewing this blog after that date, of course, that webinar will be available on the 1Kosmos website on demand.</p>
<p>Huzefa, I really appreciate your time this morning. Thank you very much. You have a great rest of your day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Always a pleasure. Thank you.</p>

   Blockchain games are blurring the line between gaming and finance. While video game providers did not previously need to consider AML and KYC responsibilities, games that offer the chance to buy, earn, trade and sell in-game tokens need to comply with global AML regulations and reporting standards.&nbsp;Automated KYC is an efficient and effective approach to meeting these responsibilities and buil

<p>Global tech company IDENTOS focuses on the developer experience with core security upgrades, new features, user guides and more as part of its FPX Junction release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc.</a>, a leader in digital identity and access management, today, launched the latest Federated Privacy Exchange (FPX) version of its identity and authorization software API offering. This release incorporates a number of core updates (including APIs to hold World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) compatible Verifiable Credentials), enabling greater scalability, usability, and security, as well as important user guides geared towards helping developers understand how to use the software.</p>
<p>FPX Junction is a cloud-based set of software products which provide fine-grained API authorization and user centric identity management capabilities. The <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/uma/overview">user-managed access (UMA) 2.0</a> authorization server works in tandem with the digital wallet service to enable single sign-on (SSO) federation with fine-grained resource and user consent management. FPX Junction includes an optional digital wallet UI SDK with native support for mobile and web.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are thrilled to announce this next major milestone in our FPX product suite.&nbsp; As an organization that is focused on user-centricity and interoperability, accessibility is of key importance to us. IDENTOS’ user centric APIs securely enable fine-grain consented data sharing at scale. Whether cloud, hybrid, or on-premise, with FPX Junction, our customers get value now and position themselves securely for the future.” – Anik Chawla, VP New Markets, IDENTOS</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of this launch, the company has branded its product releases by naming them after communities and neighborhoods that have been part of their history and growth – starting with the Junction neighborhood, a community that Alec Laws, CTO of the company calls home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Celebrating the communities that have made us who we are is a core part of our DNA as a company.&nbsp; We’ve always put culture and people ahead of everything we do. Branding our product releases this way is an opportunity to recognize the communities that have shaped our people, and by extension shaped IDENTOS.”-&nbsp; Azadeh Mahinpou, VP Marketing, IDENTOS.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>FPX Junction core updates</p>
<p>Enhanced Usability FPX Junction includes powerful administrative capabilities enabling customers to configure the system with speed and efficiency. Complementing the administrative APIs is updated user documentation including templated examples for administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards Optimization FPX Junction is developed on open standards and supports the following:<br>
–Optimized UMA 2.0 compliance<br>
–Onboarding of network partners including identity providers and service providers via OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML, and LDAP</p>
<p>Resource Server Adapter (RSA) Enhancements – an optional software module, the Resource Server Adapter minimizes data source onboarding effort through pre-integration to other FPX components, and configurable extension points for data and API integrations, including non-FHIR consented data imports into a FHIR database. The RSA can capitalize on other features of FPX required to allow this import, including consent capture and identity brokering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FPX Junction feature updates</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Support – Evolving to support Verifiable Credentials, FPX Junction includes an updated digital wallet API which enables the holding, receiving and presentation of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> using W3C Decentralized Identifiers. FPX Junction meets requirements for <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interop Profile 2.0</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> based credential exchanges. This capability positions FPX Junction as a flexible and future ready authorization platform that can transact access and sharing requests across technology with governed control.</p>
<p>Shared Resource Management / Authorized Representative – This capability allows for multiple users to manage the same resources, as determined by the resource server. This feature has many uses, from simply allowing several people to control sharing of a document, to caregivers securely managing personal data records of dependents. For example, enabling parents, guardians or other designated individuals to manage a health record on behalf of a patient.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>IDENTOS’ FPX Junction updates are all available today to new and existing customers.</p>

 – ADR approval confirms the group’s leading position in the European digital identity market 



 – The company is the first to offer two ADR compliant identity verification solutions in Romania 



 – ARIADNEXT merged with IDnow in June 2021, integrating the IDcheck.io solution into the IDnow group portfolio 



<p></p>



<p>Bucharest, September 7th, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a European leader in identity proofing and digital identity, announced today that it has obtained the approval of the Authority for the Digitalization of Romania (ADR) for its second identity verification solution in a row. The group’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idcheck.io/">IDcheck.io</a>&nbsp;KYC (Know Your Customer) solution has been approved as compliant with Article&nbsp;4 of the ADR Remote Identification Standard that came into force on July 22, 2022. The decision comes just weeks after the ADR conformity for IDnow group’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent+QES</a>&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two compliant identity verification solutions for different customer needs&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDnow group solution AutoIdent+QES, already eIDAS certified by TÜV Austria in Italy, was approved by the ADR in May 2022. The 100% automated solution IDCheck.io had already been certified under ETSI TS 119 461, the European Standard for remote identity proofing services. IDCheck.io has successfully finished the audit for the ADR and given its existing certification, has been declared compliant with Article 4 of ADR law, thus enabling IDnow group to position this identification method on the regulated market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two ADR approved services, a first for any identity proofing provider in Europe, allow the company to address different customer needs – both for full customer journeys that include identification and digital signatures, and identification-only requirements. With these two solutions, financial institutions and banks in Romania can fulfill all their KYC requirements by offering their customers a fully secure digital onboarding experience that is AML-compliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Broad portfolio via a single platform&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The acceleration of advanced digital business models across Romania and Europe has led to a shift in demand, from single-product identity verification towards more comprehensive identity proofing and document signing platforms. By offering one of the broadest portfolios in Europe via a single platform, IDnow group is at the forefront of these market trends and can offer reliable, secure and convenient KYC processes for its customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oliver Obitayo, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, says: “By combining IDnow, ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM, IDnow group has emerged as one of the strongest identity verification players in Europe as we offer customers a range of solutions for various use cases and jurisdictions – all from a single source. As a group, we believe in a strategy that moves far beyond offering a single identity verification method. The second ADR approval for our products within a few weeks is proof of this. We are proud to be able to address the entire range of customer needs in Romania when it comes to a fully digital and secure onboarding.”</p>

 With the ever-changing mobility industry, ID verification can help to create a faster, safer, and more equal way to travel. 



 



<p>Everyone knows the age-old saying “Sharing is caring”, and with the latest trend in public transport—so-called shared mobility—this saying could not be more true. Shared mobility offers millions of people the opportunity to get where they need to be without the hassle of owning a vehicle.</p>



<p>Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecasts that by 2030, more than <a href="https://www.pwc.at/de/publikationen/branchen-und-wirtschaftsstudien/eascy-five-trends-transforming-the-automotive-industry_2018.pdf">one in three</a> kilometers driven could already involve sharing concepts. But, in order for this to happen, one thing must be available: quick and easy, on-the-go identity verification. Identity verification solutions provide the much-needed safety and security that is paramount for companies and consumers, all while connecting and leveling the social world.</p>



 Moving society by leveling the playing field 



<p>We all want to get to our destination, but not everyone has their own personal vehicle, nor can they afford one. In enters shared mobility and its connections to ride sharing, car rentals, car financing and all transport services, including micro-mobility (lightweight transportation for individual use).</p>



<p>With all these choices available at the touch of a button, through various apps and online sites, shared mobility allows everyone to get to their destinations quickly, cheaper, and in a much greener way. Of course, there are plenty of people who still use personal vehicles, but the shared mobility market is anything but small. Accounting for nearly <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">$130-140 billion in global consumer spending in 2019</a>, the popularity of shared mobility continues to increase and impact society, despite the obstacles the pandemic posed.</p>



<p>The primary reason for an interest in services such as ride hailing include convenience, with safety, price, and reliability the topmost important features <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, McKinsey’s 2020 ACES Consumer Survey, found that more than 60% of people would share their ride with a stranger if doing so would add less than 15% to their travel time while reducing their cost.</p>



<p>With shared mobility, individuals come together from all walks of life, illustrating how social hierarchy in mobility is barrier-free and can drive mobility into the future. But in order to get to this utopia of social and shared mobility, affordable and accessible identity verification solutions must get the green light to drive these movements forward.</p>



 How ID verification assists social and shared mobility 



<p>As more people turn to services such as e-hailing (hailing a vehicle through electronic devices), there’s one major component that can be both an opportunity and a challenge for mobility services: identity verification.</p>



<p>With the e-hailing market accounting for more than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">90% of consumer spending</a> in shared mobility globally, companies need to know who they are doing business with. Safety is paramount when it comes to transportation, especially when individuals drive or hail vehicles they don’t own. Companies need to know they can trust whoever is using their service, and consumers need to be able to trust the companies they use.</p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can provide that trust and level of assurance that both parties are looking for. All that is needed is a government ID and a selfie. Users simply need to download a mobility service app, upload a photo of their driver’s license and submit a selfie. Verification takes minutes and users can be on their way to their final destination.</p>



<p>By having such a process in place, mobility companies empower people at every stage of life to get where they need to be, while maintaining a level of security. Products such as IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> enable businesses to offer a smooth verification process for their costumers, while preventing ID fraud or underage driving. Both fraud and underage driving are dangerous to businesses and consumers alike because lives are literally on the line. A simple <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a> has the potential to save lives.</p>



<p>But despite the obstacles that fraud and underage drivers pose, shared mobility, with the use of identity verification, can help more people get to where they need to be, while reducing risk. Accessibility and inclusivity are attained by knocking down prejudices such as age, race, gender, socioeconomic status and physical ability, and in the end leveling out social mobility and providing transportation to everyone in a safe and secure way.</p>



 







 A line-up of choices 



<p>Solutions across the shared mobility ecosystem include car-sharing, car hailing, car rental, car financing as well as the beloved and growing micro-mobility option. According to a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/the-future-of-urban-mobility">survey from BCG</a>, the top reason for consumers to use micro-mobility over personal vehicles is flexibility.</p>



<p>For many, personal vehicles are losing their allure due to their inflexibility, parking, maintenance, and of course price. And with the rising cost of gas prices, we’re likely to see shared mobility increase even more—specifically e-hailing and micro-mobility options. Even Uber saw a spike in usage with <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-statistics/">118 million users in 2021, which was a 26% increase from 2020 and a 6% increase from 2019</a>.</p>



<p>But whatever a person’s preferred mode of transport, shared mobility service providers will be there to ensure they get on the road faster, while mobility providers can operate safe in the knowledge that their customers are who they say they are through the use of identity verification solutions.</p>



<p>Because when it comes to social and shared mobility, the beauty lies in the fact that there is no social hierarchy; we are all equal by having access to a service that everyone can use, from anywhere, and at any time. And all of this is achieved through identity verification.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (29th August — 4th September) <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! A lot of exciting news this week, from California’s new digital asset-focused law to the FBI’s warning over DeFi protocols. There’s also an update on several significant changes to Veriscope. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Firms may Soon Require a License to Operate in California <p>A newly passed law titled “Digital Financial Assets Law” seeks to make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, to seek a license to operate in California.</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/messyroshko/status/1565699960326299655?s=21&amp;t=m5-nm3F6MCb8oEQuVTQXpw">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The ball is in California Governor Gavin Newsom’s court now. He has two options, either sign it or veto&nbsp;it.</p><p>In case Governor Newsom decides to green-light the proposed law, it will become operative in January&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Key Takeaway</p><blockquote>Once the bill is enacted, digital asset issuers will have to comply with many variables, including liquid reserves against tokens issued, risk exposure, leverage ratios, and&nbsp;more.</blockquote><blockquote>No California-licensed businesses will be allowed to offer stablecoins unless the stablecoin-issuing entity is a DFPI-licensed firm or the stablecoin has been issued by an authorized bank.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/california-may-soon-join-other-us-states-to-require-license-for-crypto-firms-02543946">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Bank of Korea to Codify ICOs in New Cryptocurrency Regulation <blockquote>According to South Korea’s Central Bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), the country will have to institutionalize initial coin offerings (ICO) while drafting its new cryptocurrency law, which is now known as the Digital Asset Basic Act&nbsp;(BOK).</blockquote><p>This is a significant move, considering the ban on ICOs in the country. However, the Central Bank noted that the ban didn’t prove effective.</p><p>After all, many South Korean projects, including Paycoin and Terra-LUNA, issued new coins abroad and listed them on domestic exchanges to get around the restrictions.</p><p>Thus, the BOK <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/portal/bbs/P0000559/view.do?nttId=10072479&amp;menuNo=200690&amp;pageIndex=1">insists</a> that South Korea institutionalize ICOs like the EU, where tokens issued abroad are also required to establish a local presence and adhere to local regulations to be traded domestically.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/30/south-korea-must-reverse-ineffective-ban-on-crypto-icos-central-bank-says/">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Georgia may Legalize Cryptocurrencies Soon <p>The Georgian government has established a legal framework to regulate crypto firms on similar lines to the European Union (EU) framework standards.</p><p>Levan Davitashvili, Georgia’s Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, stated that the bill is now with the Parliament and is likely to be adopted during the autumn session, according to the news report published by the local news portal Business&nbsp;Media.</p><p>How Will This Framework Affect&nbsp;VASPs?</p><blockquote>With the help of the new regulatory framework, it will be possible to clearly define the legal status, rights, and obligations of&nbsp;VASPs.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/30/south-korea-must-reverse-ineffective-ban-on-crypto-icos-central-bank-says/">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> FBI Warns Investors Against Cyber Attack Risks Targeting DeFi Platforms <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned investors of security flaws in DeFi systems in a public statement on&nbsp;Monday.</p><p>The FBI urged people to contact them via the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or their local FBI office if they believe their investments in DeFi protocols have been affected.</p><p>Why is this Warning Significant?</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The FBI noted, “Between January and March 2022, cybercriminals stole $1.3 billion in cryptocurrencies, almost 97 percent of which was stolen from Defi platforms, according to the US blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.”</p><blockquote>The FBI also noted that attackers exploit flaws in flash loans, signature validation, and cryptocurrency price pairs to attack DeFi protocols.</blockquote><p>The security agency also red-flagged code errors in crowdsourced and decentralized platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/991388/fbi-warns-investors-of-increasing-crypto-theft-on-defi-991388.html">Read more&nbsp;here.</a></p> Latest Veriscope Releases <p>In this week’s Regulatory Recap, we are also adding updates on latest Veriscope releases.</p>  Veriscope now Supports Sandbox Environment AKA Robot&nbsp;VASPs  <p>With the launch of Sandbox Environment, VASPs can now conduct end-to-end as Originator VASP or Beneficiary VASP without coordinating with another&nbsp;node.</p><p>Thanks to this latest update, <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/restful-api/introduction.html">Veriscope API</a> and <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/webhook/introduction.html">webhook events</a> backend server integration will become much faster, saving developers a significant amount of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/implementation/testing/sandbox.html">Sandbox Environment section</a> of docs for more information.</p>  A Couple of UI Views &amp; Functions Have Been Removed From Veriscope  <p>The “Managers Users and Attestation Admin “section was removed from the Veriscope dashboard.

<p>DWeb Camp finished last Sunday, and it was a rich and productive experience. A number of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/preparing-for-dweb-camp/">folks from the Holochain community</a> gathered with others who are trying to build a <a href="https://getdweb.net/principles/">more human web</a>. I’ll probably write more about it later [edit: <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">I did!</a>], but in summary I think it was good for the Holochain folks — we got to connect with other DWeb builders and dreamers, meet friends and colleagues that we’ve only seen online, and share Holochain with our peers.</p>This is what it looks like to fix bugs and deploy a new Holochain launcher en route to DWeb Camp.<p>Of course, while some of us were at camp, the rest of us were still busy building and deploying. (And, as you can see from the picture above, some of us were building and deploying on the way to DWeb Camp!) Here’s what’s happened recently.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.156: WASM metering disabled <p>Release date: 23 August 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.20<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.147</p><p>In the previous release, we fixed a bug in execution limiting, or WASM metering, which terminated all of a cell’s function calls after a certain number of operations, rendering the cell inoperable even though it was still active. However, during testing in preparation for DWeb Camp, we discovered that the limit we gave, 10 billion operations, was still causing even simple hApps to terminate functions too early. For now, we’ve disabled this feature and will revisit it later. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1535">#1535</a>)</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220823103320">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.157: No changes <p>This release was issued on the same day as 0.0.156, and was simply a test of some bug fixes in our release process.</p> Holochain 0.0.158: must_get_agent_activity <p>Release date: 31 August 2022<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.158</p><p>This is a small release with a big feature that breaks compatibility with both the host API and the network protocol. <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.148/hdk/chain/fn.must_get_agent_activity.html">`must_get_agent_activity`</a> lets you use deterministic agent activity queries in your validation functions. There’ll be updated documentation in the next Holochain release, but here’s what you need to know.</p><p>When you’re validating an operation, you sometimes want access to an agent’s history to calculate running balances, previous game state, and so on. But you don’t normally have access to the source chain in a validation function. `query` only works for the local agent, not the agent whose operation is being validated. `get_agent_activity` is non-deterministic, because it can reveal evidence of a source chain fork that may be visible to some validators but not others. And because validation functions only test for validity of existing data, they can’t have anything non-deterministic in them.</p><p>The newly introduced `must_get_agent_activity` lets you query the source chain of a particular agent, but ignores source chain forks and only focuses on the data within one linear history. Like the other two querying functions, you start at a certain point in the chain and walk backwards in history until you’ve got enough info using a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.20/hdi/prelude/struct.ChainFilter.html">chain filter</a>. There’s a number of options in the chain filter besides the desired starting point; you can choose to retrieve the entire chain, stop at a certain hash or sequence ID (or whichever happens first), and retrieve the corresponding entries.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220831015922">changelog</a>.</p> Known issues <p>We’ve identified a performance problem in Holochain’s gossip implementation. Some operations, especially large ones 10 MB or more, take a long time to propagate through the network. This can make it look like the data doesn’t exist yet. We’re tracking down the causes of this issue.</p> Holochain Launcher release notes  Launcher 0.5.0: Holochain and DevHub version bumps <p>Release date: 24 August 2022</p><p>This release adds support for Holochain 0.0.156 (HDK 0.0.147) and upgrades to the newest DevHub version, which supports publishing of hApps that were written after the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordination split</a> (Holochain 0.0.144 / HDI 0.0.9 / HDK 0.0.137 and newer).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Download the Launcher</a>.</p> Launcher 0.5.1: Backward compatibility fix <p>Release date: 24 August 2022</p><p>This release, published on the same day as 0.5.0, fixes an issue with hApps that run on Holochain 0.0.150 and earlier. After this version, `uid` was changed to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00151-network-seed-deterministic-dna-bundling-validation-ergonomics">`network_seed`</a>, breaking admin API compatibility. Now the correct field name is used for the corresponding Holochain version.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.5.1">Download the Launcher</a>.</p> JavaScript client 0.8.0: Admin API update <p>Release date: 24 August 2022<br>Holochain versions: 0.0.151 and up</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript Client library</a> now supports the admin API of newer Holochain versions which rename `uid` to `network_seed`.</p><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">Get the JavaScript client from NPM</a>.</p> Acorn 1.1.0-alpha release <p>Acorn is a beautiful project management app based on the idea of desired outcomes rather than tasks and goals. If you haven’t heard about it, you can read about it in a hApp spotlight that I’ll publish next week.</p><p>As of 1.0.2-alpha, Acorn has reached a public alpha and is ready for people to download and use — not just testers. If it’s been a while since you’ve tried Acorn, it’s gained a lot more polish and features which make it ready for serious use. The 1.1.0-alpha release improves further on an already very functional and user-friendly app.</p><p>Acorn also has a new website, as beautiful as the app itself. Go to <a href="https://acorn.software">https://acorn.software</a> to find out how its approach to project management is different.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha">Read the release notes and download Acorn</a>.</p> Until next time… <p>I want to leave you with this piece of music from <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/">Del Sol Quartet</a>, who performed at DWeb Camp. There’s something fascinating about watching a string quartet play; the subtle glances among musicians, the real-time giving and taking and calibrating, all result in a beautiful shared creation that’s more than one person (or four) could create by themselves. (Pardon the jerky filming; I’m still trying to figure out my equipment.)</p>

 Regulation Bill, Citing Energy-intensive Nature of Crypto&nbsp;Mining <p>Key takeaways</p><blockquote>The Paraguayan president vetoed the crypto bill, which was already opposed by the National Electricity Administration (ANDE), the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), and the Paraguayan central&nbsp;bank.</blockquote><blockquote>The President’s decree cites the high electricity consumption of the crypto mining industry as a significant factor behind his decision to veto the bill, as that would impede the sustainable growth of the national industry.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite the president’s veto, the bill can still be enacted if both chambers give it the green light after it goes back to the National Congress.</blockquote><p>Mario Abdo Benítez, the president of Paraguay, has vetoed a bill that sought to legalize crypto trading and recognize crypto mining as an industrial activity.</p><p>This move comes after recommendations were made against the bill by the National Electricity Administration (ANDE), Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), and the Paraguayan central&nbsp;bank.</p> What now? <p>All is not over yet as the bill will be sent back to the National Congress now, where if both chambers approve it with the majority, it can still be&nbsp;enacted.</p> The Proposal <p>The bill was approved in the Senate a few months back, establishing that miners would have to apply for a license and request authorization for industrial energy consumption.</p><p>This is not an outlier requirement. In fact, it is a pretty standard practice among major crypto mining centres. For instance, Texas has made it <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2022/03/30/texas-now-requiring-crypto-miners-to-seek-approval-to-energize-before-plugging-into-grid/">mandatory for crypto miners</a> to get permits before plugging into the electric&nbsp;grid.</p><blockquote>The proposed law also called for establishing the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as the primary law enforcement authority and the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money or Asset Laundering to supervise mining investments carried out by companies. Meanwhile, the National Securities Commission would oversee how companies would manage the digital assets produced by&nbsp;mining.</blockquote> The Senate vs The President <p>While the Senate-approved bill cites low-energy costs boosting mining activities in the South American country, the President reasoned this week that crypto mining’s high electricity consumption could hinder the expansion of a sustainable national industry.</p> Considering how <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/bitcoin-mining-how-much-electricity-it-takes-and-why-people-are-worried/">1449 KWh</a> energy is required to mine one Bitcoin, the President’s nod of disapproval seems on point, especially for a country that plans to prioritize sustainable development of the national industrial activity. <p>We also came across an interesting chart that puts Bitcoin’s annual global energy consumption into perspective by pitting it against the annual energy consumption of a few countries and multinational corporations:</p><p>(Image Source)</p><p>Besides, cryptocurrency mining utilizes intensive capital with low manpower usage. As such, it would not generate added value on par with other industrial activities. Prioritizing any industrial activity that doesn’t lead to considerable employment opportunities for citizens isn’t something that will amuse the President, especially when Paraguay is among the countries with <a href="https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-business/paraguay-among-countries-with-highest-unemployment-rate/">the highest unemployment rate</a>.</p> Putting National Industry&nbsp;First <p>When the Senate approved the bill in July after the Chamber of Deputies did the same a couple of months before, the Paraguayan Senate also established a 15% tax on economic activities related to crypto&nbsp;mining.‍</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1548236740401385472">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The decree, however, saw it as an “indirect industrial incentive” to crypto because the rate applicable to crypto miners is just a small percentage above the current industrial rate.</p><p>This is a deal-breaker in the President’s eyes, especially when the industrial investment in the country went up by 220% to $319&nbsp;million.</p> Besides, the President believes incentivizing the crypto mining industry on a large scale would wreak havoc on the country’s growing industrial activity by turning the country into a net electricity importer within the next four&nbsp;years. <p>All in all, the Paraguayan President vetoed the proposed bill over concerns that legalizing crypto mining will hamper the country’s industrial activity through excessive electricity consumption. But all is not over yet, as the ball is now in the National Congress’s court. If both chambers approve the proposed bill, it can still become law.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Operational Technology (OT) systems encompass Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). OT environments face threats similar to those that traditional enterprise IT systems do, as well as threats unique to each type and implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICS environments are those found in manufacturing facilities and warehouses, and may involve dedicated Human-to-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors, valves, actuators, etc. Critical Infrastructure includes regional and municipal power plants and distribution grids, water treatment plants, traffic and navigation systems, etc. IIoT devices include various sensor types, cameras, and other IP-enabled devices. Though the settings in which these systems operate and the equipment types comprising OT environments are diverse, the consequences of cyber-attacks can often be more severe than attacks against isolated corporate targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Real-life examples&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/transform/hackers-hit-norsk-hydro-ransomware-company-responded-transparency/">Ransomware attacks against manufacturing plants</a> have set back production not only in their facilities but throughout other members of their supply chains. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">Ransomware incidents have halted overland and overseas shipments</a> for weeks while IT teams scramble to eliminate the malware and restore from backups so that businesses can get back up and running. <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/analysis/the-five-worst-cyberattacks-against-the-power-industry-since2014/">Cyber-attacks against power generation facilities</a> have turned out the lights temporarily in some cases. <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/hospital-ransomware-health-care-data/">Ransomware attacks on hospitals</a> and other medical facilities threaten not only patient data but lives. Even <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/colonial-pipeline-cyber-incident">compromises of enterprise IT systems at companies running OT</a> can have severe impacts for those companies and national economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Key components for securing industrial environments&nbsp; 
<p>It is clear that the risks of OT compromise extend far beyond the organizations that are initially impacted. KuppingerCole recently published a Market Compass on Industrial Controls Security. We identify several key components for securing these environments:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Asset discovery – you can’t protect it if you don’t know it’s there. Asset discovery can involve active and passive methods. ICS security solutions need knowledge of a wide range of device types, identifiers, addressing schemes, and communications protocols.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>IAM – Some ICS systems leverage LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory for user, group, permissions, and administrative management. Others have rudimentary or proprietary IAM and need integration work to properly lock down access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Event monitoring – SIEM systems have been the foundation for enterprise IT event logging and correlation. The same principle and often same solutions work in the OT world as well. Ensuring that security analysts have maximum visibility of security information in OT and ICS is crucial.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Facilities management – Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) aligned with enterprise IAM can make it easier to control access by employees and contractors to sensitive equipment and remote facilities.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Threat detection – Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools can identify malicious activities at the network layer that may be otherwise go undetected in ICS and OT environments. Not all assets in OT can run endpoint security agents, thus NDR may be the only solution set for uncovering malicious activities. Distributed Deception Platform tools can emulate specific types of ICS gear with an intent to lure would-be attackers away from real assets and to study their TTPs. Both NDR and DDP tools require device and protocol level understanding of ICS equipment to be effective. NDR and DDP are increasingly being packaged in eXtended Detection &amp; Response (XDR) solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Disaster recovery – comprehensive backup and restore functions and processes must be in place to more quickly get back up and running after cyberattacks. Backups need to be performed regularly, and though testing restoring from backup isn’t fun, it’s something that needs to be done as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>At the KuppingerCole Cybersecurity Leadership Summit, we’ll address topics pertinent to OT security. We’ll have a track on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/904">Building Resilience</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/1">a session on Zero Trust for OT</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5213/2">security in the energy sector</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5212/1">endpoint security for ransomware prevention and mitigation</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5212/2">securing data in IoT realms</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5216/2">strategic approaches to securing ICS environments</a>.</p>

				  We take a look at a few of the best articles on why strong digital identity will be critical as we continue to build on the internet.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2022/08/09/solution-looking-for-a-problem-digital-id-solves-a-million-of-them/?sh=4d1d6bb4fd7f&nbsp;">A Solution Looking for a Problem? Digital ID Solves a Million of&nbsp; Them</a></p>
<p>I particularly liked this article because it talks about how many products look for edge use cases to try to stay relevant or increase market share, then pivots to show how this is completely unnecessary for digital identity. David G.W. Birch, a contributor to Forbes, focuses in this article on the importance of verifying specific aspects or traits that people can claim to have, saying that for most people it’s “not about proving who you are but about proving what you are,” offering, by way of an example, a pilot who <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/british-airways-pilot-jailed-for-lying-about-his-flying-experience-on-cv-to-get-job-12578731">lied on their resume</a> and wasn’t caught until they had been flying for two years. Birch points out that while we are trying to implement effective digital identification, criminal gangs are now <a href="https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/trends/miami-gangs-identity-theft/">competing to control identity theft</a>. The answer, he says, is verifiable credentials. To make confirming identity useful to the average person, we need to build a system using verifiable credentials to show that you are a board certified doctor, or a pilot, or a police officer.Until this system is in place,most other forms of online identity are susceptible to fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/goodbye-physical-identities-how-organizations-can-prepare-for-digital-identity-challenges&nbsp;">Goodbye, physical identities: How organizations can prepare for digital identity challenges</a></p>
<p>Philipp Pointner, Chief of Digital Identity at Jumio, looks at the growing&nbsp; importance of digital identity and the implications for data privacy. He raises some interesting points about the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-21-govt-tech-trends-2022-press-release">increasing number of digital identity wallets</a> being offered by states and national governments, and how, with the rise in digitalization, there are more opportunities for bad actors to acquire and misuse your information. He leaves us with a few key attributes to look for in a secure digital identity system. These align with what Indicio has been advising our clients:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decentralized system is crucial: Centralized storage systems have a history of being breached in one way or another, while decentralization removes these honeypots and allows the data to reside on a secure device the end user is in control of.</p>
<p>Make sure the end user has full control over their data: The person the information is about should have the option to share as much or as little as they choose depending on the situation.</p>
<p>The system should have robust verification tools: There must be a system in place to check and know with as much certainty as possible that the end user actually is who they are claiming to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=bd1f30b584a3">Digital Identities Will Change The Nature Of Online Reputation</a></p>
<p>Alastair Johnson, a contributor to&nbsp; Fobes, does a great job of explaining the difference between Web2 and Web3, as well as how identification is currently handled online and how it will need to adapt as we move forward. The biggest changes he calls out are the reduction in the reliance of third parties. Currently much of your data is stored by third parties because the internet was built without an identity layer. This article highlights how these centralized repositories&nbsp; will become redundant as verifiable credentials put control of data into the hands of the person or entity it belongs to.. Examples cited include medical information or your credit score, both of which are difficult to access, and require validation from&nbsp; a third party. Johnson concludes with a section on why giving the power back to the individual is so important: It will reduce the impact of data leaks and protect people from scammers and the malicious activity that plagues Web2 users.</p>

<p>Brute force attacks are systematic attacks that continue to attack your logins until they find the correct login information. How can you protect against this?</p>
<p>What is a brute force attack? A brute force attack is when a bot attempts to hack into your account by using trial and error in an attempt to crack your password and encryption key.</p>
 What Is a Brute Force Attack? 
<p>As the name suggests, a brute-force attack involves using computers to attempt to breach authentication systems with rapid and overwhelming trial-and-error login attempts. This approach takes advantage of relatively simple attack vectors and the general understanding that many users don’t practice good cyber hygiene. It also involves a bit of luck–attempting to attack multiple accounts can pay off if the numbers are on the side of the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account takeovers via brute force methods can not only threaten that account or user but an expanded horizon of interconnected systems. Some of the expected results of a brute-force attack include:</p>
 
 Site or App Takeover: At a minimum, the breach of user credentials can result in the loss of an administrator account or some account that can provide the hacker with the ability to take over a web application or website for purposes of harvesting data or defacing the site for political or personal reasons. 
 Data Theft: If the hacker attempts to break authentication on a local file (usually encrypted), they essentially walk away with that data.&nbsp; 
 Lateral System Movement: One of the more troubling results of an account breach is that the hacker can use the credentials and access privileges of the account to attack other systems. For example, the hacker can use a compromised account to launch a malware attack on a connected cloud system. 
 Phishing: Depending on the account, the hacker can launch more compelling and dangerous phishing attacks through email, video chat, or SMS. Since the account is a legitimate account for the organization, no one would be the wiser until it was too late.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The truth is that brute force attacks aren’t widespread, if for no other reason than security experts have mitigated their attack surfaces relatively well. However, they serve as a low-level kind of hack that can catch even the most sophisticated enterprise off guard if they aren’t paying attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that a brute force attack can unveil different types of data–login names, passwords, or data hidden in password-protected files using encryption.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Brute Force Attacks? 
<p>While the tactics of a brute force attack are relatively straightforward, there are always different approaches that hackers may take to make them more effective. These different approaches can improve the win rate of their attacks in general or against specific targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples of brute force attacks include:</p>
 
 Simple Attacks: In the vanilla version of a brute force attack, the hacker throws an algorithm attempting password combinations as quickly as possible. These are typically ineffective if even basic security measures and practices are in place. They can fail on any login interface where slowdown occurs (i.e., web pages that reload after every attempt). These could have more effect on local encrypted files.&nbsp; 
 Dictionary Attacks: Similar to a vanilla attack, with refinement: rather than attempting to throw combinations at the login interface, this uses a dictionary of common words, phrases, and default or used passwords. So, this attack might lead to a narrower set of words that include common dictionary words or passwords like “password” or “123456”. 
 Hybrid Attacks: The hacker uses a base dictionary to begin their attack and then builds on permutations of phrases in that dictionary with expanded brute force methods.&nbsp; 
 Reverse Brute Force Attacks: Also known in some applications as password spraying, the attack attempts to use a standard set of password permutations (either on a web login or local file authentication) across multiple files or systems. 
 Credential Stuffing: This method takes advantage of the fact that many people reuse credentials on multiple sites and files. The hacker, one having hacked one account or file, will then attempt to “stuff” those credentials across multiple eCommerce, banking, and social networking sites to gain access to other accounts.&nbsp; 
 
<p>This form of attack is older than more modern attacks, but it still has purchase in the field of hacking and security because there are always people that do not follow good cybersecurity practices.&nbsp;</p>
 Can Brute Force Attacks Break Encryption? 
<p>The short answer is that no system currently exists that can reliably break advanced encryption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the top encryption standards is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) published and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The two reliable encryption methods under AES are AES-128 and AES-256, which use a 128-bit encryption key and 256-bit encryption key, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that, in either case, it would take the most powerful computers we have longer than the universe’s age to brute force through AES-encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it’s very possible that a hacker can brute force attack an authentication method attached to an encrypted file with dictionary attacks, depending on the practices of the user who created the password for that file.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Best Practices to Prevent Brute Force Attacks? 
<p>The reason brute force attacks still have some longevity is that people still use good cyber hygiene for simplicity and ease. With some attention paid to best practices, many of the pitfalls of these hacks can be avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some best practices include:</p>
 
 Use Multi-Factor Authentication: Deploying <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">MFA</a> to include biometrics or SMS/email tokens and one-time passwords can effectively eliminate the threat of a brute force attack. Even if the hacker guesses the password, they cannot access the system itself.&nbsp; 
 Force Increased Password Length and Complexity: An organization can require users to employ long, complex passwords to avoid dictionary attacks. This means longer than 8-10 characters, using some minimum of letters, numbers, and special characters, and disallowing the use of common words and phrases.&nbsp; 
 Limit Login Attempts: Brute force attacks rely on systems that allow unlimited access attempts. By limiting attempts to a small number and either locking the system or requiring a cool-down period, your organization can avoid some significant issues of brute force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Require Regular Password Updates: Users should change their passwords at least once or twice a year. Furthermore, they would be disallowed from reusing the same password when updating their credentials. This can help mitigate credential stuffing and, if a hacker has gained access to an account, stop them from using it.&nbsp; 
 Use Captcha: Requiring Captcha verification using image matching or user interaction can effectively end brute force attacks against vanilla passwords.&nbsp; 
 
 Leverage Tomorrow’s Authentication Today and Avoid Brute Force Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>With modern systems, brute force threats aren’t as dangerous as they used to be. However, many companies still, to this day, don’t restrict password behaviors, don’t implement MFA, and don’t modernize their authentication infrastructure for new mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos combines MFA, secure blockchain, and identity proofing to provide a strong, decentralized authentication and identity management platform. With <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> and advanced biometrics, your company doesn’t have to worry about the threat of direct attacks against users or their passwords.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta, formerly Facebook, has just&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/meta-posts-its-first-ever-quarterly-revenue-decline/">posted</a>&nbsp;a year over year decline in quarterly revenue for the first time since the company went public in 2007, plus an unexpected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">36% drop in profits</a>.</p>



<p>Its second quarter financial results show a 1% decline over its results for the same time in 2021, down from&nbsp;US $29.07 billion&nbsp;to $28.82 billion.</p>



<p>This result comes hot on the heels of Facebook’s loss of daily active users in the&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/default.aspx">last quarter of 2021</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;another first for the social media giant. While those numbers are going back up, it does raise eyebrows.</p>



<p>Outgoing COO Sheryl Sandberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">blamed</a>&nbsp;the profit decline on the decreasing value of the Euro and the&nbsp;“weaker demand for digital advertising and the broader economic uncertainty.” Google, Twitter and Snapchat have all reported less demand for advertising because of the slowing global economy, the effects of the war in Ukraine, and the strength of the US dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fair enough, but we wonder&nbsp;whether Meta’s lackluster showing proves the wind has changed direction on businesses that profit from personal data?</p>



<p>We’ve been saying for a long time that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers</a>&nbsp;are sick of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">trading their privacy</a>&nbsp;for access to online services, and certainly Big Tech is facing a tougher regulatory environment. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">New York Times</a>&nbsp;suggests that Meta’s recent results are due to “increased regulatory scrutiny and a turbulent economy while trying to build a new frontier of digital communication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a raft of new rules and laws to rein in — even break up — Big Tech and give consumers more control over their data. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/us-bill-to-rein-in-big-tech-backed-by-dozens-of-companies.html">United States</a>, two major bills could significantly alter how Big Tech does business and both have bipartisan support. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">bill</a>&nbsp;we reported on in June — the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>— has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass. The second major bill — the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-tech-antitrust-bill/">American Innovation and Choice Online Act</a>&nbsp;or “Anti-Trust Bill” — could prevent Big Tech from favoring its own businesses and give smaller companies greater market participation. This bill is reportedly making Big Tech nervous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61342576">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;is also tackling anti-trust and greater consumer control with new rules that would see large tech companies like Facebook and Google copping huge fines of up to 10% of their global turnover if they engage in “predatory practices”. The new Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will have new compliance powers.</p>



<p>On top of this, consumer sentiment has been changing for Big Tech for some time. Facebook advertising revenue suffered from Apple’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/we-told-you-so-apples-new-privacy-changes-validate-what-weve-done-for-years/">privacy changes</a>&nbsp;designed to give users “deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2020, respondents in the annual Business Insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/resources/digital-trust-benchmark-report-preview-2021/">US Digital Trust Survey</a>&nbsp;ranked Facebook last for digital trust in protecting users’ personal information and providing a safe online environment.&nbsp;The survey evaluates how US social media users feel about the big social media platforms — Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube — and assesses the extent to which trust affects usage and attitudes towards advertising. After Facebook, Tik Tok and Twitter ranked second and third lowest for trust. LinkedIn ranked highest.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-consumers-least-trusted-social-media-platform-2020-9">Business Insider</a>&nbsp;said about the results: “Digital trust is important for brands and advertisers to consider because US social users say it impacts whether they will interact with the ads they see on social platforms. Even if security scandals don’t drive users to stop using social platforms, our data indicates that the trust users have—or don’t have—in social platforms could impact their interactions with ads or sponsored content. In fact, 79% of respondents said whether a platform protects their privacy and data was either extremely or very impactful when it comes to their decision to engage with ads.”</p>



<p>We’d say that sounds like the winds have definitely changed.</p>

				 <p>You’ll be hearing much about <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> from us over the next few months. In particular, two things are driving this activity – the kickoff of work that<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/"> Darrell O’Donnell</a> is leading at the<a href="https://trustoverip.org/"> Trust Over IP Foundation</a> (ToIP) and the growing understanding that Trust Registries play a massive role in our future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations worldwide are waking up to the need for Trust Registries throughout their operations. Whether the need is industry-specific (e.g. healthcare, education, and finance) or internal, a new urgency is forming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As we prepare for this push, we will share a few things to help ground your team with some solid basics.</p>
 This week we’re highlighting the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a>. 
<p>The Task Force is made up of several international experts who are developing a set of standards that organizations can use to integrate Trust Registries into their decentralized ecosystems.&nbsp; These standards will cover multiple issues, including how to add and remove entities, verify the Registry’s information, and keep the Registry up to date. Trust Registries will amplify trust and collaboration in the digital world by enabling individuals and organizations to verify digital assets and transactions securely.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation is an independent non-profit organization dedicated to improving the security and trustworthiness of the Internet. The Foundation comprises representatives from various organizations, including MasterCard, IBM, Accenture, and dozens of other digital trust experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcome individuals with various backgrounds to join us and share their knowledge and expertise. If this interests you or your organization, we hope you consider joining the working group!</p>
<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it’s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the trust we need in our systems.&nbsp;</p>

Ontology cooperated with <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1557659547908521984?s=20">Multichain</a>, a well-known cross-chain router protocol, and will soon integrate the Multichain cross-chain bridge service to provide Web3 users with efficient, safe cross-chain services.  Huobi Research released the latest survey report “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”. It mentioned how Web3 middleware, including decentralized identity (DID), reputation systems, node services, databases, and Oracles, will solve the problems related to the inability of blockchains to be implemented, and become the “protagonists” of the next round of ecological explosion. It introduced ONT ID, ONTO Wallet, OScore, and believed that these products can promote the prosperity and development of the Web3 ecosystem.  VentureBeat, a well-known technology media, published “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/decentralized-identity-may-be-critical-for-the-success-of-web3/">Decentralized identity may be critical for the success of Web3</a>” written by Li Jun, analyzing the reasons why DID has become the key to Web3’s&nbsp;success.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6EEMswsxwg">Benzinga Crypto</a>, a well-known YouTube channel, talking about self-sovereign identity, its opportunities and potential pitfalls, and sharing the suite of decentralized identity products that Ontology has developed.  Ontology Harbinger Geoff Richards was invited to participate in a market discussion by Huobi Research, discussing “Web3 infrastructure” and “decentralized identity components” with experts and researchers on “Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3”.  W3C published “<a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560223446620991488?s=20&amp;t=VU7LwqSAdgPTeytaf8ZXlg">With FIDO2, is a passwordless future on the horizon?</a>” related news, pointing out that the era of Web3 passwordless login has begun. The ONT Login component in Ontology ONT ID has already been built, and continues to provide a mature passwordless login mode for platforms and applications.  The Verifiable Credentials WG of W3C has published a First Public Working Draft for “<a href="https://twitter.com/w3c/status/1561704492789370880?s=20&amp;t=siQTY7W35vMLJEf4wYaa6w">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0.</a>”, The verifiable credentials used in Ontology ONT ID are also constructed based on the v1.0 version, and are currently open sourced to Web3 developers in Java and GO around the&nbsp;world.

<p>Up to $50,000 in $OCEAN are earmarked for interoperable data storage integrations with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a>, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs building open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, launches the Data Storage Initiative. The program will support teams interested in working on decentralized data storage integrations for Ocean Protocol. With data storage features highly requested by the Ocean user community, the goal of this project is to have up to 3 new data storage technologies integrated with Ocean in production by the end of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem and Partnerships at Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</p><p>“Multiple interoperable decentralized data storage solutions will greatly enhance the overall user experience and allow for exciting new options for orchestrating and managing complex compute jobs using&nbsp;Ocean.”</p><p>Data storage grants will be issued using a request for work/feature approach where project requirements will be defined by the Ocean engineering team. A total of four individual grants with varying amounts will be awarded including a grant for building a decentralised data storage backend for Ocean as well as grants for the integration of specific data storage microservices including Filecoin, Arweave and&nbsp;StorJ.</p><p>Successful grant recipients will receive tech support and guidance from the Ocean engineering team. The grant payments will be awarded upon the successful completion and delivery of each project grant milestone. Following the successful completion of all data storage grants, feedback will be collected from project members as well as the Ocean community at large to define a versatile plugin architecture for new backend components.</p><p>Interested projects can submit their proposals for single or multiple integration(s) by completing a dedicated Shipyard application <a href="https://forms.gle/Cjd148ejK6qKAQfL9">form</a> and they can apply for one or multiple grants by September 17, 2022 at 4 AM UTC. Submissions will be reviewed by the Ocean engineering team and successful grant recipients will be announced by September 22nd.

Now, let’s move our focus to the investment that Singapore-based blockchain companies attracted.</p><blockquote>According to KPMG, investment in Singapore’s digital asset companies surged to $1.48 billion in 2021, which is ten times the previous year and almost half the Asia pacific total for the year. These figures show Singapore’s position in the Asia Pacific and global crypto assets&nbsp;market.</blockquote><p>These figures show why more regulators may follow the Singaporean financial authority’s footsteps sooner or later, as the country is a trendsetter as far as the financial industry is concerned.</p><p>Thus, VASPs may soon have to answer a pretty detailed questionnaire about their business operations and financial resilience before granting any licenses in more countries sooner or later. Thus, VASPs must stay prepared.</p> The Questionnaire <p>Recently, MAS sent a detailed questionnaire to some applicants and holders of its Digital Payment Token Licenses. The questionnaire asks for “highly granular information” about their business activity and holdings.</p><p>The questions focus on gauging the firms’ financial soundness and their interconnectedness. MAS has further asked the firms to respond to the questionnaire promptly.</p> Working on New Regulations <p>Much like the rest of the world, Singapore is intensifying its scrutiny of crypto-related firms in the city-state ahead of planned regulatory changes.</p><p>As previously mentioned by the managing director of MAS, the financial watchdog has been working on a regulatory framework, which is expected to help address consumer protection, market conduct, and reserve backing for stablecoins.</p><p>Speaking of the country’s current crypto regulations, they are among the strongest when it comes to AML &amp; CFT, but the central bank feels that certain areas within the existing crypto regulations in Singapore require specific amendments.</p> Is Singapore Indeed as Crypto-friendly as it is Made out to&nbsp;be? <p>Well, the answer to this question can be summed up by the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2022/yes-to-digital-asset-innovation-no-to-cryptocurrency-speculation">recent statement</a> of Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore:</p><blockquote>“Yes to Digital Asset Innovation,</blockquote><blockquote>No to Cryptocurrency Speculation”</blockquote><p>This also reflects on digital payment licensing, as only a handful of approvals have been granted so far. On top of that, several crypto businesses have already either shut down or moved out after the country’s licensing regime got implemented, such as&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 In the first of a brand-new series of interviews with fintech industry insiders and thought leaders, IDnow sits down with David Gyori, CEO of Banking Reports. We discuss upcoming trends in fintech, the importance of&nbsp;multi-jurisdictional solutions, and why the current state of crypto reminds him of the 17th century tulip mania crisis. 



 As a fintech consultant and thought leader, what first attracted you to the industry, and how have you seen the world of fintech change since you first became involved?&nbsp; 



<p>So, the most beautiful thing about financial technology is that bankers and experts around the world underestimate the complexity of it. Fintech is about payments technology; new channels like augmented reality, virtual reality; all the regulatory issues, including eKYC, AML, onboarding; wealth tech, wealth management, including open banking, access to account, asset tokenization, decentralized currencies, roboadvisors, personal financial dashboards, data tech, big data, AI, machine learning, neo banks, core banking technology, and even quantum finance, which is an upcoming new arena within financial technology. So, from POS innovation to central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from video banking to virtual reality, and metaverse, it’s more diverse, more complex [than people think].&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this complexity attracted me.</p>



 You are the CEO of Banking Reports London, which provides fintech training for retail and investment banks; what types of subjects and themes are covered in the course?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>My training programs deal with strategy and tactics of digital transformation, financial technology, and emerging innovation in banking all around the world. I provide training programs to bankers in well over 50 countries face to face and online. I am always learning things myself.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What are some of the major UK and European fintech trends that we can expect in the coming few years?&nbsp; 



<p>So, the major trends will revolve around two things: one, Profitability, two, Regulatory environment. These two components will determine the next five years of financial technology. Following the 2008 crisis, there was abundant funding, there was a lot of liquidity, interest rates were low, and investors were in a growth mindset as opposed to a value-investing mindset and investors wanted companies with great growth potential. Now, with a higher interest rate and more inflationary environment, investors want prompt profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, profit is king. Looking at the 50,000 small, nimble, flexible creative, intellectually inspiring fintech startups, we will have to be selective to find the ones that can become profitable or at least offer a potential roadmap to profitability in the short run or maximum midterm. Probably, of the 50,000 candidates, there will be around 5,000 – 15,000, the rest will go down or be acquired, or merge into potentially profitable ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the second trend, Regulation will be equally as important. Regulators are waking up, incumbent credit institutions (ie banks) are waking up and learning the name of the game. As they want to go ahead in a fully compliant, well organized, regulated, supervised way, regulators will have to up their game and create a safe and crystal-clear environment for emerging digital innovations, and this is very exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good regulators now have a chance to create a global best practice environment. Some of the emerging countries now have the chance to jump ahead; to leapfrog, and to produce an environment that attracts the best companies. Others will fall behind or fall further behind. So, this is a regulatory point of division, and more than ever in the past 30 years, we need smart and visionary regulators.</p>



 How about challenges? With increasing importance placed on fintech [partly due to pandemic-induced acceleration], what are some of the dangers and challenges associated with banks and financial institutions rapidly implementing fintech and regtech solutions?&nbsp; 



<p>Regulators should focus on the areas that are valuable, that have real potential, such as CBDC, Fiat currency, as well as blockchain. Blockchain as a technology, as a distributed ledger technology is making banking safer, if applied well. So, blockchain technology has great potential for trade finance, through securities clearing, to interbank clearing, from smart contracts to registering derivatives, and even KYC-related activities. Blockchain has great potential if it is compliant and applied well, and can make banking better, more transparent, more professional, more trustworthy, safer, and more compliant, and that’s good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning from some of the key innovations in the crypto world is also a great opportunity. But, cryptocurrencies, as decentralized, haphazard, no intrinsic value, no Fiat, no sovereign-appointed value in the background are dangerous, and probably the greatest bubble ever in history. I like to compare it to the tulip seed crisis in 17th century Amsterdam, when the price of tulip seeds went up to the price of residential real estate, and then it all crashed. A reason why cryptocurrencies in their current format are non-viable is a lack of material compliance; a lack of nominal price stability by design, which is a core characteristic of money as per money in terms of payments; a lack of sovereign control over monetary supply, which is very important in certain points in history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we are battling inflation, but there is only one thing worse than inflation – deflation. Look at the energy crisis and look at how Bitcoin is eating up countries’ energy. Look at environmental considerations and try to put it together with servers running to the fullest across the world. Material costs, real cost of transactions, not illusory, imaginary costs, but real-life costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at all the fraud cases intended, unintended, deeply criminal, somewhat criminal, gray area, black area, full of fraud, and there is something very important, which is hidden and very important – a lack of interest rate content and lack of intrinsic value. An asset lacking interest rate content can be valuable, for example, gold is an asset lacking intrinsic value that can be valuable. Think about modern currency, it has very fractional reserves in the background, basically it lacks classic intrinsic value, but throughout history, throughout monetary history, assets without any of these two – interest rate content as well as intrinsic value – have been doomed to fail. </p>



<blockquote><p>Current decentralized cryptocurrencies can be characterized by a dual lack of characteristics: interest rate content and intrinsic value. Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are perfectly right about cryptocurrencies.</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>However, regulators still have a great chance to focus on the good areas from blockchain to CBDC, from meaningful asset tokenization to certain synthetic units of corporate settlement. So, there are still great opportunities, but in this arena, regulators themselves must be selective, and selective in a conscious, premeditated yet strategic, tactical, and programmatic way.&nbsp;</p>



 Are there any countries that could be considered more advanced in the regulation of cryptocurrency?&nbsp; 



<p>This is a difficult question because we are in the process, and regulators are now trying to work out their positions. What we do see is that in terms of certain sub areas like CBDCs, certain countries are one or two steps ahead. For example, China has done some amazing research on CBDCs, the Bank of England is doing amazing research, also the Federal Reserve, some of the South Asian countries, such as Singapore. So, in terms of CBDCs, we are already seeing some interesting and meaningful attempts, but these are baby steps. We are in the nascent stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of judging regulators, we must be very careful. In fact, one of the regulatory environments I’m expecting a bright future from is the UK regulatory environment, but I am also expecting some good things to come from Brussels, from the European union. PSD 3 (Payments Services Directive) is already in the making, and the UK is going ahead on its own path. I see some very good and smart signs that they’re supporting a vivid and valuable market structure in the future.</p>



 Customer onboarding processes remain a much fought-over area of a service provider’s customer experience. How can banks balance their customers’ desire to be onboarded in the automated and digital-only manner that they have become accustomed to, with local regulatory and KYC + AML requirements?&nbsp; 



<p>So, digital onboarding is paramount. Young people want simple, straightforward, easy to understand fun, one click, instant, digital, global best practice-level onboarding experience, and when they get it, they extend this experience to the product or service. So, they will think your product and service is amazing if your onboarding process is amazing. However, when your onboarding process has friction, when your onboarding process is slow, when your onboarding process is not digital, when your onboarding process is complex, when your onboarding process is nerve-breaking, when your onboarding process is not intuitive, you know what happens? According to research, millennials extend this to your product or service, in terms of perceived quality and content. </p>



<blockquote><p>We call it the digital halo effect: extending one characteristic of a person or a group or a company or an entity or a product or service to the entire entity.&nbsp;</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>If the onboarding experience is positive your clients will become active users of your products and services and produce a positive lifetime value – they will be your profit drivers. If your onboarding experience is negative, clients, especially the young ones under the age of 35, will turn away from your products and services no matter what the quality is. Their lifetime value will be negative, and they will drive losses. So, [digital customer onboarding] is a tactical element of excellence with a strategic importance.&nbsp;</p>



 How important is it for banks to invest in multi-jurisdictional fintech and regtech solutions?&nbsp; 



<p>So, this is a unique time in terms of the relationship between regulators and regulated entities in the arena of financial services. Why? Because things are changing in such a complex, such a dynamic way. Can you remember what I said about the complexity of fintech? It’s so complex and so dynamic that regulators are actually open to discussion with mature, trustworthy, wise market players.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>You can engage with the regulators now, and hand-in-hand, the market and regulators can forge safely ahead. For this reason, we are always searching for solutions that have been proven to be safe, trustworthy, compliant, and customer and regulator-friendly in other jurisdictions, [in order] to implement them in our jurisdictions.</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>Multi-jurisdictional solutions are more important than ever. Regulators are learning from each other. Market players are learning from each other. We need solutions that can be used in different countries at the same time. So, there are vertical and there are horizontal arguments for multi-jurisdictional, trustworthy, stable, safe, and customer friendly, intuitive, seamless, and well-designed solutions.&nbsp;</p>



 What are some of the major issues with current KYC processes?&nbsp; 



<p>This question is very important and it’s a very smart question, because there is a shift in the paradigm of KYC processes. There is the old school, and there is the new school. The old school was face to face physical processes are safe, and digital processes are dangerous. Be very careful with digital onboarding, put additional guards there. Regulators would try to slow it down, try to tame it, try to moderate it, but there is a change in guard. There is a change in paradigm, and there is the new paradigm: eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) digital-only onboarding. The more people you include in an end-to-end digital financial services onboarding, the more transparent and safer your entire financial ecosystem will become.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, onboard, onboard, onboard, onboard, of course do it as well, and as professionally as you can. Document everything, keep GDPR, be privacy compliant, but store everything that is legal and ethical to store, make it as safe as possible, and do it 24/7/365.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do it as much as you can because the more people, the more young people, the more unbanked people, the more underbanked merchants involved in the end-to-end digital financial services, the more transparent, safer, more compliant, more professional your entire financial ecosystem will become.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This 180-degree shift in the paradigm of KYC, particularly eKYC, is very important.</p>



 What have you heard of IDnow?&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow is put together in a very smart way, and designed in a very safe, business-friendly, yet compliant and secure way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must recognize that a well-designed eKYC digital onboarding solution provides a safer identity environment than traditional channels; this is a 180-degree paradigm shift from digital being dangerous, to digital being best practice when done well. But, to do it well, you need a world class partner, and in my opinion, IDnow is one of those world class players and partners.</p>

<p>CEO fraud attacks can destroy a company’s financial and reputational future but are there any ways to protect against these attacks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is CEO fraud? CEO fraud, also called executive or whale phishing, is a type of phishing attack where a cybercriminal pretends to be a high-level executive and emails an employee requesting sensitive information, a wire transfer or login credentials.</p>
 What Is Social Engineering and Phishing? 
<p>Social engineering is using social interaction (phone calls, emails, conversations, messages) to fool individuals into parting with confidential information, including account access credentials, financial account information, and even money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest attacks known to cybersecurity were considered social engineering, and currently, social engineering attacks like phishing are some of the most common forms of cyber threats in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing is the act of using some messaging service to pretend to be another person or organization with the notion of triggering an individual to provide information. More specifically, phishing often refers to a limited set of approaches to social engineering that include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/email-phishing/">Email Phishing</a>: The most common form of attack involves attackers simply sending malicious emails to individuals. These attackers will pretend to be a prominent business, a bank’s support or fraud division, or even someone interested in working with the recipient for financial or employment purposes.<br>
<br>
These emails will most often include a call to action that involves clicking a malicious link or calling the number of a fraudulent call center.&nbsp; 
 Video and Productivity Software Phishing: As more workers rely on collaboration software and video conferencing solutions, hackers are turning to these platforms to fool their targets. Some examples of fraud have been launched using messaging capabilities on software like Microsoft Teams, Skype, or Zoom. 
 
<p>An additional aspect of this attack is the use of Voice phishing through voice or video calls… However, these are much harder to pull off and are not typical.</p>
 
 SMS Phishing: While email is almost completely ubiquitous in modern computing, another prevalent technology is SMS text messaging. Many scam outfits are turning to SMS scams to send links or phone numbers directly to users’ phones, making these messages look authentically like they come from businesses or financial institutions.&nbsp; 
 
 What Are the Prime Forms of CEO Fraud? 
<p>Many enterprise businesses make the mistake that phishing, or social engineering in general, is only successful against under-prepared employees. The understanding that executives have some purchase on avoiding social engineering attacks is demonstrably false, as we have seen with the rise of CEO fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO fraud, simply put, is a fraudulent social engineering attack against a CEO (or other C-level executives) to get them to provide access to company resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s digital world, there are a few forms of attack that serve as the foundation of CEO fraud:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a form by which the attacker, rather than spray low-effort messages across an organization, researches higher-grade targets in management or with security access. These attacks are more likely to succeed because they will come with the convincing language, convincing the target of the legitimacy of the attack.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bec-attack/">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</a>: Another way to easily navigate a company’s messaging system is to compromise a user’s account and masquerade as a company member. This allows the hacker to bypass email screening systems and present more convincing phishing messages to employees and executives who, upon seeing an email from the company domain, will immediately trust it.<br>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/executive-phishing/">Executive Whaling</a>: The evolved form of spear phishing,<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/"> executive whaling</a> is the process of researching the top-level executives of an organization to gather information on their habits, corporate structure, employee structure, interests, and daily routines.<br>
<br>
The hackers can use this knowledge to launch messaging attacks posing as, for example, internal financial managers who request wire transfers for thousands of dollars.  
 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">Executive whaling</a> isn’t limited to email and often comes through advanced platforms where an executive may not expect an attack (such as video conferencing or productivity software).&nbsp;</p>
 How Can I Prevent CEO Fraud? 
<p>While no organization has airtight security, it’s still possible to slow down or eliminate CEO fraud by addressing the issues that lead to organization access. Some ways to address fraud include:</p>
 
 Use Strict Authentication Controls: You must have strong authentication to prevent attacks. Biometrics, liveness testing, and identity proofing can all go a very long way towards cutting out low-level breaches that often lead to larger instances of CEO fraud. 
 Educate Executives About Fraud: We’ve already stressed that executives aren’t above falling for phishing attacks. Therefore, your security and compliance teams must put forward training and awareness materials for the C-suite to better understand how vulnerable they are if they ignore potential instances of fraud.&nbsp; 
 Run Phishing Simulations: Security experts regularly run penetration tests and vulnerability scans to ascertain the strength of a system’s defense measures. A good test to run is to throw out phishing simulations, organized and operated by your internal IT team, to help expose weaknesses in the organization and raise awareness about solid cyber hygiene. 
 Use Inbound Email Security: Simple and easy, IT managers can deploy software that filters out a blocklist of external domains or only allows a safelist of emails to enter employees’ inboxes. Furthermore, email systems can be set up to raise visual alerts on emails coming from external sources–-while this doesn’t eliminate the problem but can raise warning bells for employees.&nbsp;

<p>a new plural economic&nbsp;system</p><p>Economy is a form of human interaction; a process where debts are moved between two or more people that emerged from a simple gift and barter system around the Bronze Age (4000–2500 BCE). Societies developed notation systems using markings on clay tablets, papyrus, and other materials to account for crops, livestock, and land in order to keep administrative track of objects ready for&nbsp;use.</p><p>In 1758 the French economist François Quesnay wrote “Tableau économique” (Economic Table), regarded as one of the first works attempting to describe the economy in an analytical way. Quesnay was a great inspiration for Adam Smith, often known as “The Father of Economics”, whose ideas of free markets and ‘the invisible hand’ created the foundation for the modern economy. The system was based on a few key principles; trust among actors individually and across the system as a whole, fairness and common measurements of cost, risk and&nbsp;value.</p><p>Over time, further distinctions within the field of economics have been established: positive economics (what is), normative economics (what ought to be), economic theory, applied economics, rational economics, behavioural economics, mainstream economics, heterodox economics. Today we have a market economy, an accumulation of specific assumptions generated through history, often based on patriarchy and&nbsp;power.</p><p>But somewhere in the creation of the economic infrastructure, something went wrong. We reduced a complex system to one simple measurement — price. Our environment, ancestry, memories and relationships are all deeply valuable, live at the heart of our existence, and shape our daily decisions — yet our mechanisms of understanding and operationalising such value are extremely reductive. We need to recognise entanglement and diverse values beyond the abstraction of&nbsp;price.</p><p>It’s hard to identify trust, care, generosity, fairness or collaboration within today’s global economy. Humans evolved as fundamentally social creatures, unable to survive, nevermind thrive, without the collective support of our fellow humans. Imagining any alternative economy needs to consider interdependencies as a starting point, not as an afterthought.</p><p>We need to reinvigorate stagnated ways of looking, thinking and talking about the economy. The economy is based on growth, and is often explored through the lens of monetary structures, or through a lens of individuality, based on possessions and egocentricity, but there’s a much larger system, way beyond our notion of ownership, and we want to start radically new dialogues about this shared&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Could we establish an alternative market economy, one that is structured around a distinct set of principles centred on care, trust, generosity, the importance of collective intelligence and deep sets of relationships; what would fall away and what would remain in&nbsp;place?</p><p>Would growth matter? And if so, what kinds of growth could we differentiate from simple linear, “more is better”&nbsp;growth?</p><p>Would money be essential? If not, what alternative forms of value could we imagine might make more sense to build&nbsp;around?</p><p>How can we more clearly see our entanglement of all natural life and find our purpose within&nbsp;it?</p><p>Current features</p><p>We see failures manifest in the world because of the way capital is distributed, structured, governed and deployed. While delving into current economic structures and existing markets, we can identify a few key problematic features;</p><p>Central control — Capital is structured to be centrally controlled; all decisions around capital are thus disconnected from the needs of communities and the world. For example, in Switzerland, <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ch/pdf/clarity-on-performance-of-swiss-private-banks-2021.pdf">95% of new money</a> is generated through private banks, individuals and organisations with close proximity to this capital creation are hugely privileged, both in terms of decision-making power and in reaping its extractive rewards. More widely, actors across countries in the global north exert their proximity to power when assigning value to supply chains to generate financial profits and growth, often causing ecological and societal&nbsp;damage.</p><p>Exclusion — Various intersectional communities are being systematically excluded from all forms of capital, from VC to impact to debt to equity. How could all individuals participate in alternative forms of capital? Do the terms of access need to change or does the structure of capital itself have to undergo a transformation in order to meet the core requirements of these communities?</p><p>Mistrust — Markets are based on the concept of mistrust: thus embedded silos between market actors, extensive legal agreements and the presence of intermediaries that control the flow of information. Banks are an example of this market failure: starting as a place of safekeeping of money, they have quickly evolved their business models to take advantage of siloed information that allows them to profit from the difference between established risk (based on the information they are privy to) and value (based on the information they are provided by their clients). However, there is a larger discussion to have about trust, genuine trust versus a forced trust. A genuine trust is created with deep personal connections while the forced trust we tend to see today is one where citizens via technology and institutions are forced to trust due to a lack of alternatives.</p><p>Prices &amp; values — Markets are structured around one single variable — price, and measured around one output — economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The consequences for human dynamics and relationships due to these features are seriously harming life. We see an acute, global and growing inequality. We see climate breakdown all over a planet whose biosphere is suffering. We see wars and political traumas. We see health and mental health issues and a younger generation with severe climate&nbsp;anxiety.</p><p>Instead of trusting, we have developed a need to control. All interactions are based on a power dynamic instead of deep care and a desire to be generous. We have further developed a need to feel superior as a way of feeling worthy. This basic and natural need for recognition from others is deeply embedded in the economic system and our place within it. Finally, we have developed a need for efficiency to reach fullness. In most economic models monetary growth is inserted as the goal, often on a compressed time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>What would happen if money was spread more equitably in&nbsp;society?</p><p>Why are we so focused on perpetual monetary expansion?</p><p>What if growth was not the ultimate&nbsp;outcome?</p><p>What if capital would be structured and governed from a place of vulnerability and&nbsp;care?</p><p>What would terms of trust look like in an updated&nbsp;economy?</p><p>What are the notions a gift economy can bring to an updated&nbsp;system?</p><p>Who decides the exchange values between resources and how are they operating?</p><p>Coralus — A story of radical generosity</p><p>In 2015, hundreds of women in Canada helped co-design SheEO (now called <a href="https://coralus.sheeo.world/">Coralus</a>) — an organisation designed to radically disrupt a capital system for women-led innovative impact companies to thrive. At the time only 3% of venture capital and 4% of bank loans went to women and non-binary individuals. Over the past 7 years their collective purpose has also grown — from funding women entrepreneurs to shifting mindsets, decolonizing communities, rooting in Indigenous wisdom and racial justice, and using their power to build equitable systems. How have some of the questions we raised above been answered and explored in Coralus’s cosmos?</p><p>In summer 2021 a team from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> started to explore new types of economic systems with a core group from Coralus. The main purpose was to more deeply understand an organisation that was testing and implementing new economic ideas. Together, we dived into what it means to be part of a new economic system, interviewing with community members who were gifting their capital as well as loan recipients. From there, we synthesised the learnings by mapping and creating illustrations, as well as <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z4jPY9-QbpJNCyEZ3hyNrK6fJZNQ72QtulBWgh9q23M/edit">writing and analysing</a> all learnings and experiences. The focus was to understand Coralus core values (radical generosity, abundance, co-creation and transformation) in relation to global societal economic systems and to imagine the outlines of what a much needed change could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Coralus is founded on a few key principles;</p><p>Paradigm — through radical generosity where power and resources are more equitably shared, and the interests of stakeholders are aligned, not in competition. This is explored through practices embodied across all the organisational operations through learning circles on mindset, systems, finance and ventures, workshops, mindset blogs and the cornerstone practice of Ask/Give. The structure and feeling of a caring and strong community has been what many within the organisation values the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Purpose of capital — Venture funding is directed to businesses that serve the world’s greatest needs and addressing the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals by creating a life sustaining planet. All activators contribute with capital as a gift and expect no capital return. This gift is placed in a perpetual flow, a fund, that organically exists as a parallel system to the social&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Capital distribution — Equitable allocation changes both where capital goes and the funding terms of how it is deployed: women-identifying entrepreneurs are funded through non-extractive capital, globally. The funded ventures are selected through a democratised voting process and the capital is lent through a non-extractive 0% interest loan. All ventures meet together to create a strong shared feeling of purpose and goal as a group. Activators participate in alternative economies through two pathways: they mentor an enterprise and/or they fund&nbsp;it.</p><p>Access to network — Each woman activates the change agent inside themselves through a diverse community. These networks are built on trust and are committed to sharing power, not accumulating it. Via regular community calls and gatherings anyone can practice asking and get help if needed. The online community and the Ask-Give platform is a crucial node where challenges and opportunities are solved collaboratively. There is a focus made on deep relationship building with communities normally put at the margins. Through learning programs, indigenous wisdom and racial justice are given a place at the centre stage. The vital reciprocity between activators and ventures is showing a way to a new economy fully based on caring relationships.</p><p>Coralus seems to truly shift ideas on funding capital through their approach to gifts. They have mutually understood the importance of unlearning the power notions attached to money investment and keep their full focus on the outcomes and measurements of the impacts created. By participating in a community like Coralus both activators and ventures seem to be immensely aligned; the enormous value of the caring network is what makes Coralus stand out. Many mention the inner transformation they have undertaken since joining the community as a powerful learning, a transformation that hasn’t only changed themselves but that has laid the foundation for important relationships being created. They have also had a large concrete impact on the environment; according to their 2021 report, ventures have reported impacting 16 of the 17 UN <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. A venture like <a href="https://www.loliware.com/technology">Loliware</a> has for example created a solution and a new technology to create plastic-like materials from seaweed for straws, cups, plates, etc. In addition ventures averaged 432% revenue growth since starting with Coralus for a combined reported approximately $52M in&nbsp;revenue.</p>The Shell image of Coralus (formerly SheEO) — its organisation, flow and community cosmos made by Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.<p>Inspiring pathways</p><p>If we discuss and look into an alternative economy, there are a few approaches that could unlock the current system and there are organisations who have looked into the key problematic features in our current economic system mentioned above.</p>  We see intermediaries that are decentralised; capital is structured at community level through collective intelligence, skills and knowledge. As an alternative, local currencies decentralise power and encourage financial circulation within a localised environment. For example, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf875d9a-5be6-11e5-a28b-50226830d644">Sardex</a>, Sardinia’s first local money in a form of credit which is not subject to speculative bubbles and is sustainable as it doesn’t allow the members of the credit circuit to go too much into debt, to buy products, and generate an auction effect. This makes the local economy more resilient against shocks of future financial crises. They can also foster broader, more democratic, contextualised understandings of&nbsp;value.  Value of capital and economy has moved away from being fully monetary focused, to being based on the value of humans and communities with equal gifting for everyone at its epicentre. Coralus’s venture <a href="https://thealinker.ca/products/the-alinker-rent-to-own">ALinker</a> is a Canadian example where an LGBTQ founder and a fierce advocate for transforming the sick care system creatively constructs democratic ‘rent to own’&nbsp;methods.  All information is open source; there are no artificial or private barriers keeping citizens away from trust and empathy. For example, the start-up <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf">Everledger</a>, based on blockchain technology, which establishes a digital ‘passport’ for each diamond to combat criminal activities within the industry. It provides transparency that builds trust between sellers and buyers as well as clamping down on the trade in illegal diamonds through a record of provenance, travel, and transactions of each diamond with a unique cryptographic ‘fingerprint’.  The economic realm of markets, industry and technology is ultimately inseparable from ethics with the deliberation and application of our ideals of what is right, good, desirable and beautiful. In short, the economic and the ethical meet in an intricate question of value. <a href="https://www.stockholm50.report/">Replacing GDP as the single metric</a> to measure progress and instead focus on indicators that take “inclusive wealth” and the caring economy into account. For example, <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> (a global community and platform focused on ecological monitoring and regeneration) aims to catalyse the regeneration of ecosystems through pricing ecosystem services and spillover values (such as clean water, Co2 sequestration, and biodiversity) produced by regenerative farmers. The price of potatoes should never be their “use price” but the broader social and environmental values they bring through regenerative practices. Even though pricing ecosystem services could potentially respond to environmental degradation, there is also a need to move beyond&nbsp;pricing.  Coralus’s structure.<p>Next steps</p><p>If we aim at discussing the economy more broadly, we need to incorporate the “invisible” or “non-monetary” economy; the system of economies embedded within a monetary economy that undertakes tasks that benefit society by means that the monetary economy does not value including household labour, caregiving, civic activity or even friends helping for each&nbsp;other.</p><p>We need to establish the true cost of items, not the fabricated prices we meet as consumers. Our current prices rarely include negative externalities (costs that are suffered by a third party as a consequence of an economic transaction, like pollution, stress, climate change). And even if we do charge negative externalities, pricing an externality doesn’t mean that it goes away. It is only beneficial from a utility standpoint.</p><p>For a long term sustainable society we need to rethink costs in relation to human suffering. But just like discussing post-growth economic systems, degrowth or decoupling, we enter a vulnerable, emotional space where economists, politicians, researchers and designers often get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>Emotions are in symbiosis with the economy. Emotions seem to decide what we buy, how we spend our money and where we see capital to be needed. But equally, economies can rule our emotions through constructed identifications, by calming existential questions and creating frameworks for everyday lives. We are left questioning the ways our economies are linked to stress, fear of being lonely or muting internal lack of satisfaction.</p><p>Can organisations like Coralus be concrete and powerful inspirations that impact an outside world? How can they keep the influential, small and caring community feeling they’ve established when growing? How do they sit in a larger societal system that still is heavily based on continuous monetary growth? These questions are not raised here to be fully answered, but rather to be discussed and to create economic hope for future generations. There is a clear formula of regenerative capital and collective intelligence within the Coralus organisation that needs to be further studied, tested and explored. The radical generosity that is spread among the activators and ventures could be seen in relation to our shared social dialogues about deep care and a different future. We need to unveil a new plural economic system where a beautiful growth within humans, around humans and for all living things, is the&nbsp;core.</p><p>Research and blog by Jenny Grettve — jenny@darkmatterlabs.org, Fang-Jui Chang — fang@darkmatterlabs.org, Anastasia Mourogova — anastasia@darkmatterlabs.org, Danielle Cadhit — danielle@coralus.world among&nbsp;others.</p><p>Link to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yckfxum2">cases of alternative economies</a> made by DML for the deeper research mentioned in the&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/radical-generosity-8063d9edc3aa">Radical generosity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us. Today, we are going to hear from an expert in identity about – how from the perspective of, let’s say regular people, most of the people, who are not involved in the identity industry, how much they understand the identity, the methods, the technology and everything that we in this industry are building. So, we’re going to talk about how we can make identity easy for everyone.</p>
<p>For that, our guest is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting, and Choreographer for Identity Flash Mob. She comes from a position that the Internet is led by people powered by words and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the internet, including <a href="https://idpro.org/">IDPro</a> as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer just to name a few. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you.</p>
<p>Heather: Thank you. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. This is going to be super fun talking about how to make identity easy for everyone. Let’s see how our conversation goes. So yeah, let’s get started, let’s talk about digital identity. First, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, please tell us your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, you know, very few people actually decide that “You know, digital identity, that’s going to be my career.” In my case, I have a liberal arts degree as a history major, and a library science degree for my master’s degree. I mean, I was supposed to be a librarian when I grew up. But as is often the case, once the person falls into tech, everything ends up touching on digital identity.</p>
<p>So immediately after university, I ended up working for the public research division of a newspaper that was just starting up an ISP. So, this was the mid ’90s, there weren’t a lot of experienced tech people to hire. And that ISP started hiring people who, you know, are you smart? Are you logical? Can you learn from a book? And there, as a sysadmin, I had to worry about creating user accounts and making sure that those users were able to access what they were allowed to on a system and only what they were allowed to on a system.</p>
<p>When I left the ISP, I went to work for a large software company where again, the fundamental reason for even having an infrastructure IT team was to make sure that people could access what they needed to across all the different computers. And this kind of pattern of you come in, you’re working on the infrastructure for an organisation, and it all boils down to do people have access to what they need? Is their identity set up properly so that it can do what it has to do online? That pattern just kept repeating for as long as I had any job that included operational responsibilities.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you were supposed to be a librarian, you said. And then you are– in the mid ’90s, the beginning of the commercial internet, helping these ISPs, right? Internet Service Providers, so actually it’s a term that not many people use these days, you know, it’s like ISP is taken for granted, right? It used to be a big thing at that time.</p>
<p>Heather: It was. It was. The ’90s was a heck of a time. There were so few people who actually had computer science degrees. I think in the team I worked with, there was me as the librarian. I had Political Science majors, French majors, English majors, Math majors, I think we might have had one Computer Science person and he left early on because he could. And yet the diversity of that team was outstanding.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow! Sounds very nice. And it looked like you just continued that path, making more step and you never came back. Yeah, fantastic, fantastic, the projects you’re working nowadays, and I know that at least in Identity Flash Mob we work a lot. Yeah, trying to make identity and other tech concepts understandable, easy to understand for everyone. So, I’d like to jump in and ask you how do you explain what digital identity is for a young person, someone who just entered, a college let’s say.</p>
<p>Heather: So, actually wrote a blog post on that topic on the Identity Flash Mob website called <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/2021/09/27/wait-you-mean-digital-identity-is-an-entire-industry/">What is digital identity (and why should you care)?</a> It’s interesting if you think about explaining this to a freshman in college, versus say how you would explain it to your mom. Because one of them is born digital, right? They’ve never lived in a world that didn’t have an aspect of them online.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t think I would explain it too differently to either them if they actually asked. I mean, on the one hand, digital identity is the representation of you online. It’s your online access to your banks and your credit cards. It’s your account to your email provider. It’s your presence on social media. It’s your electronic information with your government. It’s your browsing history. It’s the details of your smartphone. It’s where your computing devices are in physical relation to others.</p>
<p>Just like different things make up your personal human identity, brown hair, blue eyes, a lot of different things make up your digital identity. And not everyone has the same characteristics. You may not have a smartphone, or you may not have a social media account, but you almost certainly have some other things that come together to make up what a digital identity is. So, it’s, I think, that kind of explanation, hopefully, bridges all different kinds of demographics, in terms of how techy someone is or isn’t, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what have been the faces after you give that answer?</p>
<p>Heather: Usually, minds start to explode a little bit because it’s a lot. There’s a field of psychology to try and understand the human mind and that field has been around for a while and it’s really complicated, and people get doctorates in it. Digital identity is actually also really complicated. As soon as you start pulling it apart to try and understand it, you realise that there’s a lot there to unpack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’re still in early days, and unlike the field of psychology, we don’t have quite the massive of knowledge and understanding and research that has gone into it yet to make it something that you can study. There’s very few schools out there that actually have courses on understanding digital identity or managing digital identity or being careful with digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And yeah, you know what, it doesn’t happen often to me, at least, that someone, someone who is not in the industry asked me, “OK, what is digital identity?” It’s not that common. But the ones who, for instance, when I give an answer, you have given this answer, it was a really good answer, simple answer, that’s pretty good. So, some people get an idea of that. But beyond that, it’s good to understand what are the consequences, right, of having this reasonable understanding about digital identity for an– yeah, regular person. So, what could be the worst consequences of not really understanding enough the identity for regular people?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, that’s a good question. And then I’m glad you qualified it with understanding enough because no one’s going to understand everything, you just have to understand enough. Because computers are absolutely everywhere in governments, in banks, in schools, in businesses, everybody has a digital identity. And if you don’t understand that, you don’t even know that you have to protect it. And if you don’t protect it, then people can impersonate you, to do all sorts of things. That’s something that we call identity theft.</p>
<p>There’s a big insurance company in the US called Allstate Insurance. They did a study a few years back and found it took over six months to recover from identity theft. Experian, which is a great big credit agency said that it can even take years, you know, six months might be optimistic. So, if you don’t understand that you have a digital identity, that just because you may not have a smartphone or you don’t have a Facebook account, you still do have a presence that you need to take into account and need to think about how to protect.</p>
<p>For me, that’s like the biggest single consequence. It’s the lack of awareness that it’s something that you need to protect just like you need to protect your birth certificate or your passport, or the keys to your house.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, exactly. Yeah. As you put it in concrete and visual examples, yeah, people the key, or the key for your passport, something that you would have it on your pocket very close to you. And if you would lose that, you definitely would feel like “Oh, I’m in big trouble, or I will be in big trouble if that happens.” So, the same way everybody should feel if there is a chance of losing the identity, well, not losing but someone takes over, there is identity theft.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, it’s hard to get back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly six months in some cases, or you say that’s, that’s a lot. What can you do in six months without a digital identity, at least for the most relevant identities that you have, such as the government identity, for instance. Also going into the worst scenario, the worst consequences of not understanding well digital identity, but now the perspective of people who are directly and indirectly building digital services and this can be people, for instance, working in start-ups, in the government, in the health care. They are not necessarily the developers, the technical people but they are working, they are part of the extended team that are building these services. So, what can be the worst consequences of, again, these extended on to people who are working if they don’t understand well?</p>
<p>Heather: So, we just said that people suffer when their digital identity is stolen. But you know, businesses do, too. I was moderating a webinar just yesterday, where the speaker, Tim Cappalli from Microsoft said, “Attackers don’t break in, they log in.” That means, like the majority attacks against businesses come through attackers just logging in, using stolen account information.</p>
<p>If a business doesn’t have a handle on their identity and access management services, and the best practices for the security in that space, they’re going to lose so much money to fraud, just even more money to cyber-attacks. I mean, businesses often think of their IT infrastructure as being this cost centre, because it’s not what’s directly making the money. But wow, messing up that infrastructure can put a company right out of business, or at least put a serious dent into their net worth.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, as you said, data breaches or just fix something, it can have a huge impact not only financial, but also in, well, reputation, et cetera, et cetera. And how do you see if, again, I ask you the extended people who work building these services, how much do you feel that an average project manager, an average designer is aware about digital identity?</p>
<p>Heather: Usually not very. I mean, this comes back to it’s not like digital identity is as taught as a separate thing, right? In a way, it’s almost when you’re working with computers, it’s almost like air, because it’s just there. Of course, you have to log in, of course, you have to have an account. You hear about having to have strong passwords and all these other things. And so actually understanding that it is more complicated than that, and that there are good reasons for it to be, it’s not as common as it should be. Certainly, otherwise, we wouldn’t be losing all this money to fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, indeed. So, there’s a lot of work for us, the ones who are working in the industry to keep educating, right? Making it easy also to understand that’s super important, and I know you work very hard into that.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the identity industry isn’t making it easy, necessarily. So, there is always that to consider too.</p>
<p>Oscar: If– so where the– if you see the identity industry where the identity industries is failing to make itself understood?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list. So, let’s start with like one of the questions you asked earlier about, OK, how would you define digital identity? I gave you, my definition. But if you get 10 identity professionals in a room and ask them, you’re probably going to get at least 15 different answers. I mean, that’s among professionals already in this space. So now, imagine how hard it is for people, not in the space to get a handle on what their digital identity is and how to manage it. The terminology used in the industry is imprecise. The standards that we’re developing are incomplete. They’re inconsistently used. And it’s just how we communicate with the rest of the world’s big problem.</p>
<p>I’ll give you another example. Passwords. Let’s just talk about passwords. If you talk to any identity professional, they will agree that passwords are one of the biggest, possibly the biggest challenge facing the industry. So how are we solving it? There’s password complexity rules, password reuse rules, passphrase suggestions, password manager guidance, passwordless guidance, multifactor authentication using authenticator apps, multifactor authentication using biometric data, multifactor authentication using SMS codes, all of these options, all these different guidance, how’s the user suppose to understand all that? When they’re going from one site to the next to the next and they’re just being mentally pummelled with all these different options? How are they supposed to know what the best practice is? What are they supposed to be doing to protect their identity if they’re getting such an inconsistent story, just on the most basic aspect of logging in?</p>
<p>Every site is implementing things differently. A regular user doesn’t know if that’s the current best practice or not. And to be fair, practitioners can barely keep up with it themselves because the identity industry at this point, it’s not just sending mixed messages. We’re just sending white noise and static to our users, because it’s just all over the place. That’s a huge failing on our part.</p>
<p>Oscar: Ah, yeah, yeah. That’s cool in many people’s ear, I believe. Yes, it’s true. So, the way you say it, so if 15 different identity professionals answer the same questions, all of them understand very well the concept, the problems, but yeah, the answer will be different. So that already tells a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would like to hear if there are, there must be, there must be good examples of projects or initiatives that have – well, intentionally or unintentionally have been making identity much more understandable for everyone. So, if you can share some success stories about how projects initially have educated about digital identity.</p>
<p>Heather: So yeah, I definitely have some favourites here. Though I want to preface that educating people about digital identity is hard, because often people don’t want it to be hard, so they don’t want to know about how complicated it is. And that, that makes it a bit challenging to offer education. But that said, I love what I see coming out of the <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/about-us/">Internet Safety Labs</a>, that was previously known as the Me2B Alliance, they’ve turned into an independent software product testing organisation. And that focuses on online safety standards that company can actually quantitatively measure their software against to see if they’re really offering a safe online experience.</p>
<p>I’m also a huge fan of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>. And the work they’re doing to finally move the world away from passwords in a way that’s very easy for the end user to understand and respond to. But that said, I see those as success stories that influence the business side of things, on behalf of users, but still, it’s very business oriented, which is great.</p>
<p>But I also want to highlight those groups that are actually– they’re actually getting out there on Instagram, and TikTok to get useful information about digital identity in front of regular people where they hang out every day. So, I mean, that’s something I’m trying to do through Identity Flash Mob, which is a passion project for me. But another one that I’d point to is the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecybersecurityhub/">Cyber Security Hub</a>. I find their posts on Instagram hilarious and absolutely spot on. And they’re reaching over 343,000 people on Instagram with those posts.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, so definitely have to check it out. Was it Cyber Security Hub?</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: And of course, your project Identity Flash Mob. So, you’re already on TikTok?</p>
<p>Heather: I tried to do TikTok, I’m not very good at it. I’m much better at Instagram.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right. Each one of course has their own strengths. Yeah, yeah. I’m not in TikTok either. I have to definitely keep following the work you are doing. But tell me a bit more what you’re doing in Identity Flash Mob now that we are in this point?</p>
<p>Heather: So what I’m trying to do there is, as you say, make the information about identity and security and standards, basically how technology works a bit more consumable to people like my mother, or my friend, Laura, Laura Paglione, who’s partnering with me on this, you know, make it something that her daughter would find interesting enough to actually stop and read. And that means getting the information into accurate and consumable, almost sound bites, you know, very, very short pieces and in front of them where it goes.</p>
<p>We do write blog posts, because blog posts helped me organise my thoughts as to how I want to present an idea to the users. And a lot of the posts offer what can you do in five minutes, in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes to learn more about the space? And also, the regular posting on Instagram just to get ideas and thoughts out there to people?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I checked your website and definitely it’s super interesting. I read a few of your articles, and excellent job that you are doing there. And yeah, I’ll keep following. Yeah, that’s super interesting for me I was– every time I have the well, the responsibility to give a talk or some, yeah, writing blog, for instance, writing blog posts, I also like, to the best possible effort to make it very easy to understand and to connect with something that people are familiar. So, it is super important, as we are seeing after how this conversation is going really, it’s – that’s a lot to do, yeah, on that aspect.</p>
<p>And now, I’d like to hear more about your work in those standard organisations. And you have been working as a technical writer, editor, et cetera, also leading projects there. Yeah. Tell me about this, this work you’ve been doing writing the standards.</p>
<p>Heather: So, standards development is one of my favourite things. So, a bit about standards, right, is that standards exist to make it so things can actually interoperate. The fact that you can send an email from your mail app, and have it received across the world to someone in India, with a completely different mail app is actually a miracle of standards, you know, that that functions all the way through. I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to get people involved in those kinds of efforts. And it needs all different kinds of people.</p>
<p>I don’t write standards. I’m not that kind of technical. But I’m really good at reading them and offering feedback or helping with the process or helping facilitate the calls. Whatever is needed to help the engineers write what they need to write is how I participate. So, there’s rooms for lots of different kinds of smart, a lot of different kinds of technical, it’s not just system engineers and what they can do.</p>
<p>So, I was the Publisher the Executive Oversight for Publishing Internet Standards for eight years through the Internet Engineering Task Force, and I got to watch a lot of that work being done and help the groups actually get their words out and published to the world. It was very exciting. And it’s also very hard, because one of the biggest challenges that the whole standards development process has, is that to actually achieve interoperable standards, you have to get people from different backgrounds to help write review, test the proposed standards to see if they meet the needs that they are written to address.</p>
<p>I mean, as it stands today, even though there’s companies that sort of donate their people’s time, nobody actually has a full-time job saying, I am a standard writer, right? They work for a company, they have other things they have to do, their “day job”. So, it’s always the best effort really, in terms of are the right people in the room? Or is there enough diversity in the room? And so far, they’re just huge diversity gaps there.</p>
<p>I think most standards or organisations have some kind of diversity effort on the books. But it’s hard to attract new people, when you already have a strong culture in place that itself isn’t attractive to diverse participants. It can be done, but it’s pretty slow going. I think I’ve had it easier, in a way because I embrace the fact that I’m really good at organising people and organising processes. And that was a space that the specification writers themselves didn’t want to do. And so, it was easy to just slot in and say I can help you with this stuff that you don’t want to do. And it made for very good give and take to get things out the door.</p>
<p>But I think other folks may find it a little bit more challenging, because the thing I hear constantly is I’m not technical enough to do that. You use a computer, you can turn it on, you can offer what’s your experience? What did you find easy? What did you find hard? That right there is useful information for spec writers to know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I understand the challenge of as you said, most of the people who are writing these standards, well are squeezing their time, right, to work on those projects. Yeah, it’s one, among other tasks of their day job for most of these people. That is correct. And it’s already challenging. So, you have mentioned the challenging in finding diversity, if you can explain a bit more in what about geographically, what about which aspect of diversity are not so well right now, let’s say.</p>
<p>Heather: All of them. There’s the geographic diversity. I mean, if you look at the demographics of who’s attending something like an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> meeting, it’s mostly US and Europe, and then China and India, but it quickly drops off, right? They try and address this by moving the meeting around. So, you’ll have North America, then you’ll have Europe, then you’ll have Asia, right, to try and get it at least proximate to the geography of who will actually attend. But that’s just one thing.</p>
<p>There’s also gender, tech is notoriously driven by a male dominated field. There’s also age, one of the bigger concerns is the fact that people who write standards are usually more at the tail end of their career, as opposed to the beginning of their career. And so, it’s a group that’s aging out. And not a lot of young folks come into it at all. Often, their company says, “Well, you’re too junior to participate in that.” which is unfortunate. So really, pretty much every dimension has a lack when it comes to diversity.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you would encourage as you just said now, for instance, one person who is relatively young, and so the boss or someone the company says, “You don’t have enough experience to do that.” So, we need to challenge that, right?</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: We do. I think of it this way. I mean, the argument I would make is, by the time someone is at the end of their career and coming in and everything that you know, they have very strong opinions, and that’s great, but we’re leaving the junior staff to relearn all our mistakes. Because they’re going to go through this learning process, and they won’t understand the history of why did something develop the way it did. And because they don’t understand it, they’re going to reinvent the same problems. And maybe they’ll solve them slightly differently.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be better if we could jumpstart them and say, “OK, this is what we did. This is why we did it. This is you know, how we did it.” But condense that so that earlier on in their career they can say, “OK, I understand what was tried before and why it didn’t work. Now let’s really think new things.” That would be a wonderful thing to see happen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Yeah, I hope people who are listening to this episode are – have some curiosity to… so what happened in someone who is right now listening to this podcast say, “OK, maybe I can try it.” So, whom they should contact to, in order to try participating one of these organisations, what are the best way to – whom to contact or how to get started?</p>
<p>Heather: So, the first thing to do, I guess, is to narrow down into at least a little bit into well, what kind of thing, what are you most interested in? Right? And you could actually just post on Twitter or post on LinkedIn or something like that and just do an outreach saying, “I want to help with the standards process, how do I do it?” And see what kind of answer you get, see what’s open.</p>
<p>For organisations like the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, they have… oh, goodness, I don’t know how many working groups, we’ll easily say at least 100, possibly more. And you can just look through them and say, “OK, this sounds interesting.” And its public knowledge, well, who’s… you know, what kind of documents is that group working on? Read them, and you’ll know who their authors are. You’ll have their contact information. You’ll have the contact information of the working group Chairs, and you can reach out to them and say, “I’m interested in helping, what can I do?” And sure, that they will be so happy. So happy to hear that there’s interest in that space.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s great, definitely. I have only once for a couple of years, I participated in Kantara Initiative, definitely, a colleague suggested me to join for a while and it was super nice, definitely. So yeah, actually, anyone who has not participated in any of these standard organisations, yeah, please follow Heather’s advice. Just find something that’s interesting for you and contact them. Because it’s very important, it’s very important for all of us not only to ship the standards, but that process of making everything more and more understandable.</p>
<p>So super interesting conversation with you, Heather. Now, a final question is for all business leaders who are listening now in this conversation, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, I knew you’re going to ask this, and I gave it some thought. And what I would love to see happen, and I think would actually be fun. You need to strengthen your identity and access management, you need to strengthen that function in your organisation to the point that your marketing team, your finance team, your management team, your dev teams, all understand what digital identity means in your company, and why it’s so important to protect.</p>
<p>And I’m talking about getting creative about it. Not like having an online training course that says, “Make sure that your passwords are 16 characters long, it contains the following.” No, no, that’s not what I mean. I want you to encourage study groups. I want you to create a game day, where you have teams that include representatives from every department acting out a response to an incident involving an identity related security issue.</p>
<p>So, the marketing person would– they would be tagged to figure out what is the communication message that you have to send. The finance person would have to figure out what would the cost of this be? The development person would have to figure out how to research and close whatever vulnerability was used in the system. And that’s not just going to help your company. It’ll actually help your people protect themselves everyday online. So, and I think it could kind of be fun to do.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like it. It sounds definitely fun. So yeah, digital identity can be fun. So, it’s a great idea that you are suggesting to organise a game. So, well, thanks a lot for that. It was super interesting. And again, I commend you for all the work you are doing in <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/">Identity Flash Mob</a> and all the standard organisations. So, for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, Heather, or find more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you?</p>
<p>Heather: So, you can always find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hlflanagan/">LinkedIn</a>, I’m fairly active there. You can do me a huge favour and follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/identityflashmob/">Identity Flash Mob on Instagram</a>, which is always great. Or, you can go to the <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/">identityflashmob.com</a> website and just read about what we’re doing and it will give you a few ways to contact us there too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Heather. And all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Historically, there has been a disconnect between what security engineers see as risks or threats and how these risks are perceived by business leaders. FAIR STRIDE is a novel approach to driving strategic initiatives with business-relevant application threat models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikko Hyppönen pointed this out concisely during his keynote at RMISC 2019 by stating: “In security, when we do our jobs right, nothing happens.” In reality, this is not the case, but we have to observe the situation through a lens that can bring a security program’s value to light. In the scope of application security, the disconnect happens when security engineers express the impact of vulnerabilities on systems and applications, rather than their impact on the business itself.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>On the one hand, an application security team enables the business to sell trustworthy products, usually by fulfilling compliance frameworks like SOC2 or ISO 27001. On the other hand, when security teams do their jobs right they prevent monetary losses from being inflicted on the company without slowing down the business.</p>

				  A must-attend interoperability event for anyone developing decentralized identity solutions using Hyperledger Aries.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Join us on August 31, 2022, when Hyperledger Aries will host its first virtual, interactive interoperability event. The Hyperledger Aries Interopathon will give teams across the verifiable credentials community the opportunity to test how well their products and solutions interoperate. As previous <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-cardea-interop-a-thon-returns-and-heres-why-you-should-participate/">interopathons</a> have shown, this is an invaluable opportunity to find out if you need to fix anything.</p>
<p>The maintainers of Hyperledger Aries will provide a test environment that&nbsp; includes Issuer, Mobile, Mediator, and Verifier Agents for participants to test against.</p>
<p>Participants will also be able to use the Test Harness — an automated way to connect two agents — and learn more about it, as well as offer feedback to improve the system.</p>
<p>If you would like to bring your own Hyperledger Indy network you are also welcome to do so.</p>
<p>The goal is to discover what needs to be done to ensure that all Aries projects are interoperable. Anyone interested in simply observing is also encouraged to attend!</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Interoperability drives adoption. The more verifiable credentials can be used across multiple projects and ecosystems, the more they will be valued and the more they will be used. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>This event will help developers&nbsp; remove obstacles to interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Who is this event for?</p>
<p>This event is aimed at developers, but anyone interested in decentralized identity is welcome to join.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in actively participating will need to be able to make a connection between agents using DIDComm connection V1 or Out of Band.</p>
<p>What will I take away from it?</p>
<p>Participants will leave with an understanding of where the gaps are in their interoperability, and hopefully an idea of where to begin fixing these gaps.</p>
<p>For anyone in attendance this will be an excellent opportunity to make connections, learn more about what it takes to achieve interoperability, and see some of the interesting projects that are in the works!</p>
<p>Where can I register?</p>

You can even log in with your Google and Apple accounts as&nbsp;well.</p><p>This concept is called Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI or BYO Identity):</p>  A form of digital authentication in which an end user’s username and password is managed by a third&nbsp;party.  The approach leverages Single-Sign On (SSO) technology to make authentication more simple and convenient for&nbsp;users.  <p>It’s also beneficial for companies since it allows visitors to quickly register using their existing credentials. An improved sign-on experience can result in as much as a <a href="https://medium.com/@XTOPOLY/user-experience-ux-is-more-than-just-a-trending-topic-for-all-brands-b3ef1b2f591b">45% increase in customer registrations.</a></p><p>The simplicity of BYO Identity means businesses convert more of their website visitors into customers instead of losing them when they’re asked to create a new&nbsp;account.</p><p>But there are drawbacks as&nbsp;well:</p>  Many users worry they’re trading convenience for privacy. Every time you log in to a third-party website using Facebook or Google, they gain access to your data and leverage it to sell&nbsp;ads.  It’s not the most secure authentication method. Anybody can create a social media account, but these companies don’t verify your attributes. So, using social identities to log in to third-parties means companies can’t be 100% certain about the identity of their customers.  <p>Even with these concerns, BYO Identity is a step in the right direction towards a future where interoperable and portable identities are commonplace.</p><p>There is a real opportunity to combine technology that is being developed with the concept of BYO Identity that will create a new identity framework where you own and control your&nbsp;data.</p>  By creating an account with an identity service provider who leverages verifiable credentials technology, you will confirm your attributes are real, and companies will rest easy knowing you’re identifying yourself truthfully.  Your identity will be decentralized, not federated. Identity service providers like GlobaliD don’t have access to your data, so they can’t store it. You’ll be able to browse, log in and transact without your data being leveraged by Big&nbsp;Tech.  This makes the process of identity convenient, and portable. In the future, many identity companies will be built on this decentralized approach using verifiable credentials. Rather than being stuck with a certain provider or platform, you’ll be able to easily transfer your identity from one service provider to&nbsp;another.  <p>If you’d like to learn more about our current BYO identity tools for individuals and businesses, like our Digital ID Wallet or Global Onboarding, visit our website or contact our sales&nbsp;team.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.

<p>Today, when one of your products or services catches a customer’s attention, their first thought is, “Where can I buy this online?” Your digital channels have become the primary touchpoint for establishing new customer relationships, and it’s crucial to make a good first impression if you want those relationships to flourish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, it’s all too easy to stumble at that first hurdle. If you force customers to go through a multi-step process to register and log in before they complete their purchase, then every step will sap their energy and give them an opportunity to reconsider their purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t do enough due diligence to confirm your customer’s identity, you’re making it easy for fraudsters to take advantage of your business—and potentially putting genuine customers at risk of account takeover and identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like a catch-22 for customer experience—a lose-lose choice between friction and fraud. However, there is another way. The right customer identity and access management (CIAM) strategy can help you steer a safe course to secure, stress-free customer experiences.</p>

  <p>For years the Okta OIDC SDK was the primary tool mobile developers used to integrate their apps with Okta, but as with all things in life, entropy takes its toll. Over time, as platforms and languages change, or new features become available, a refactor is required. Today we’re proud to announce that the Okta Mobile SDKs for Swift and Kotlin are now available!</p>

<p>Recent advances at Okta, such as support for Device Single Sign On (SSO), the Device Authorization Grant (used in most streaming smart TV apps, or devices without a browser), and most especially the Okta Identity Engine (OIE), have proved difficult to integrate into the aging OIDC SDK. We realized it was time for something new. As a result, for the past few months, we’ve been hard at work developing our next-generation SDK targeting native and mobile environments across Apple and Android platforms.</p>

<p>These SDKs take a whole new approach to authentication that goes beyond simple browser-based sign in (also known as the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow). We took a modular approach to assembling the SDK; you choose to include only the components needed to build your applications. This architecture enables leaner builds and puts more power and flexibility into your hands. It also opens the doors to integration with other SDKs, such as the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) using the Okta Identity Experience (IDX) SDK.</p>

 Why replace our current SDKs? 

<p>First, I’d like to explain why we chose to replace our current mobile SDKs. We didn’t make this decision lightly, but several reasons made it the best choice:</p>

 
   Okta OIDC for iOS and Android is built upon an aging code base, which was difficult to maintain, and didn’t follow modern mobile best practices. 
   The OIDC libraries are focused on web-based authentication, which introduces overhead when native sign-in is used. 
   Targeting mobile and desktop applications limits the possibility of extending to other platforms, such as smart watches, TVs, or app extensions. 
   The OIDC libraries assume that only one set of tokens will be used at a time. This assumption prevents developers from supporting multiple users within an app, or multiple tokens for different app extensions or security scopes. 
 

<p>These are some of the key reasons why we chose to make a fresh start, focusing on convenience and ease of use. Our goal is to unblock advanced use cases that were previously impossible.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve seen our rationale for refactoring, let’s take a look at the architecture and philosophy behind the new Okta Mobile SDK.</p>

 Welcome to the new Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>We had several goals when designing the new SDK:</p>

 
   Improve the developer experience and streamline the developer onboarding process 
   Eliminate technical debt 
   Move from a monolithic architecture to a modular one 
   Unlock advanced features and scenarios with flexible extension points 
   Support new Okta platform features 
 

<p>These goals helped shape the architecture for our SDKs, from the high-level capabilities down to the naming of individual functions.</p>

<p>Note: Since I’m predominately a Swift engineer I’ll be using examples from the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift">Okta Mobile SDK for Swift</a>, though everything discussed here also works within our <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-kotlin">Okta Mobile SDK for Kotlin</a>.</p>

 A walk through the new developer experience 

<blockquote>
  <p>“Make the easy things easy, and the hard things possible” – Larry Wall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main feature of this SDK is a streamlined developer experience, above and beyond all else. We focused on the ergonomics of the APIs a developer would use, making sure they make sense, and are consistent with other similar types.</p>

<p>We set ourselves a “1-line-to-integrate” goal for all of our primary scenarios. This means that you should be able to sign in or out with a single line of code. Additionally, the code you write shouldn’t be throw-away. Simple solutions should be able to grow into more complex ones, without requiring a completely different approach.</p>

<p>This is further improved by modularizing the SDK into smaller libraries that complement one another. Simple high-level APIs make certain features easy to use, yet still expose lower-level details that let you customize or control the SDK’s behavior.</p>

 Modularized architecture 

<p>Many of the original problems we faced with maintaining the OIDC SDKs stemmed from their monolithic architecture. This also prevented us from properly being able to integrate Okta IDX into applications, since there was no convenient way to store tokens created from IDX within the OIDC SDK.</p>

<p>As a result, we broke the new SDK into three libraries, each building upon one another: AuthFoundation, OktaOAuth2, and WebAuthenticationUI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This structure gives us several advantages:</p>

 
   By having clear lines of separation, it forces us to establish clean API contracts between dependent classes. 
   Applications only need to import the libraries necessary to get their job done, keeping runtime app sizes leaner. 
   Additional SDKs (such as Okta IDX) now have a foundation to build upon, and can enable different tools to work together. 
 

<p>Each library has its own areas of responsibility:</p>

 AuthFoundation 

<p>This library is the lowest-level and provides common features required for all authentication-related operations.</p>

 
   Generic OAuth 2 API client interface 
   Token storage &amp; validation 
   JWT parsing &amp; validation 
   Keychain/Keystore support 
   Conveniences and utilities needed by other SDKs 
 

 OktaOAuth2 

<p>This library implements all the primary OAuth 2 flows supported by Okta, including:</p>

 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#request-for-tokens">Authorization Code Flow</a> (used by web-based OIDC) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/#about-the-resource-owner-password-grant">Resource Owner Password Flow</a> (simple username/password) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Token Exchange Flow</a> (used to implement Device SSO) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/">Device Authorization Flow</a> (used for devices without a browser and/or keyboard) 
   Session Token Flow (used to integrate with Okta’s classic Native Authentication SDK) 
 

<p>In addition to these flows, the OktaOAuth2 library includes all the utilities and delegate protocols/interfaces necessary to customize each flow’s behavior.</p>

 WebAuthenticationUI 

<p>When your app uses web-based OIDC authentication, this library coordinates with the system’s browser to ensure a safe and secure embedded authentication experience. Since it is built upon the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/authorizationcodeflow">AuthorizationCodeFlow</a> class from OktaOAuth2, those lower-level classes are exposed to you, allowing extensive customization of the process if your application has specific requirements.</p>

<p>By separating this logic into its own library, your app can choose not to include this library if you use a non-web authentication process, removing unnecessary overhead.</p>

 OktaIdx 

<p>When your app uses the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) to natively authenticate your users, the IDX SDK (included separately in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift">okta-idx-swift</a> and <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-android">okta-idx-android</a> repositories) now properly integrates within this SDK using AuthFoundation. The Okta IDX SDK also follows similar patterns as OktaOAuth2, by providing the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-idx-swift/development/oktaidx/documentation/oktaidx/interactioncodeflow">InteractionCodeFlow</a> class.</p>

 Flexible extension points 

<p>The customizations and low-level capabilities described above are examples of the extension points we proactively built into the SDK. For many key decisions within the SDK, these steps are customizable either through the use of delegation, or via wholesale replacement of the SDK defaults.</p>

<p>You can override everything, from the way ID token validation occurs to how tokens are securely stored, or your app can accept the out-of-the-box defaults.</p>

 Support for new Okta features 

<p>As Okta continues to innovate, introducing new features and capabilities, our mobile SDKs need to update to take advantage of them. By refactoring these SDKs, we aim to make it as easy as possible for you to adopt new features, which has been our primary motivation. Let’s take a look at a few of the more exciting features we now support.</p>

<p>Many platform features center around support for new authentication flows. Classic web-based sign-in, through OIDC, is implemented using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow. Instead of locking this functionality away, we’ve exposed it, along with our new flows. We tried our best to follow similar patterns for all <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/introductiontoauthenticationflows">authentication flows</a>, to reduce a lot of the guesswork necessary to get a feature to work.</p>

 Benefits of the new Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>As mentioned above, our aim has been to do more than build parity functionality with the legacy OIDC SDKs. We wanted to unlock amazing new capabilities while simultaneously simplifying your developer experience. So let’s take a look at a few of the improvements we’ve made.</p>

 Simplified web-based authentication 

<p>Signing in with a web browser using OIDC should be a straightforward process, and it is the easiest way to get started using Okta in a mobile application. And yet, we felt we could make it even easier.</p>

<p>Just like within Okta OIDC, the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui">WebAuthenticationUI</a> library is capable of using a configuration file named <code>Okta.plist</code> to define your client settings. From there, you can sign into your application using a single line of code.</p>

   <code>// Sign in using the default configuration
let token = try await WebAuthentication.shared?.signIn(from: view.window)

// Save the user's token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>The <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/webauthentication/shared">shared property</a> simplifies how to create a <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/webauthentication">WebAuthentication</a> instance, but if you want direct control of the configuration, you can simply create one in code.</p>

   <code>let auth = WebAuthentication(
    issuer: URL(string: "https://dev-133337.okta.com"),
    clientId: "0oa1234567890abcdefg",
    scopes: "openid profile email offline_access",
    redirectUri: URL(string: "myapp://login"),
    logoutRedirectUri: URL(string: "myapp://logout"),
    additionalParameters: ["idp": idpName])

// Sign in using the above configuration
let token = try await auth.signIn(from: view.window)

// Save the user's tokens
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>Depending on your application’s needs, there are many ways to configure your client. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/configuringyourclient">documentation on Configuring Your Client</a> for more information.</p>

 Device Authorization Grant 

<p>This is an OAuth 2.0 flow meant for use with headless devices, kiosks, or for clients that have limited text input. The prime example for this is a tvOS application running on the Apple TV. In this flow, a user is presented with a code they enter on a different device (a mobile phone, laptop computer, etc.) and finish logging in on the second device.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The above screenshot comes directly from the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift/tree/master/Samples/DeviceAuthSignIn">DeviceAuthSignIn sample</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift">okta-mobile-swift GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>To implement this in your own application, simply use the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/deviceauthorizationflow">DeviceAuthorizationFlow</a> from the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/">OktaOAuth2 library</a>, and try the following code:</p>

   <code>// Uses the client configuration in an Okta.plist
// configuration file
let flow = DeviceAuthorizationFlow()

// Get the code to display to the user
let context = try await flow.start()
showCodeToUser(context)

// Poll the server, waiting for a successful login
let token = try await flow.resume(with: context)

// Save the user's tokens
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>All the details for how authentication occurs, including the polling process, error handling, and other considerations, are handled for you.</p>

 Device SSO (aka Token Exchange Flow) 

<p>We’re excited about the ability to perform single sign-on across a suite of apps on the same device, or across separate app extensions within the same app. We’ve <a>discussed this feature before on the Okta developer blog</a>, but the amount of code necessary to implement device SSO had been prohibitive to developers who wanted to try this feature.</p>

<p>So with the new <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/tokenexchangeflow">TokenExchangeFlow</a> we’ve drastically simplified the process, reducing it to just a single line of code.</p>

   <code>// Create the flow, using the Okta.plist configuration
let flow = TokenExchangeFlow()

// Exchange the ID and Device tokens for access tokens.
let token = try await flow.start(with: [
    .actor(type: .deviceSecret, value: deviceToken),
    .subject(type: .idToken, value: idToken)
])

// Save the user's token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve authenticated a user with the <code>device_sso</code> scope, Okta will return both an ID Token and Device Secret in the token response. If you save this in a secure location accessible to all your apps (for example, in a Keychain within a shared App Group), you can supply those strings to the TokenExchangeFlow class.</p>

 Improved token storage and biometric support 

<p>Like the Okta OIDC SDK, the new Swift SDK uses the Apple Keychain to securely store tokens. With the new <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/store(_:tags:security:)">Credential.store</a> function however, more options are available to you at the time you store a token. Security settings or developer-assigned tags can optionally be supplied to customize how those tokens will be stored.</p>

   <code>// Accept defaults
try Credential.store(token)

// Assign tags to later retrieve specific tokens
try Credential.store(token, tags: ["tag": "value"])

// Share the token between an app's extensions
try Credential.store(token, security: [
    .accessGroup("com.myapp.access-group")
])

// Secure the token with biometrics, and require
// the device to be unlocked
try Credential.store(token, security: [
    .accessibility(.unlocked),
    .accessControl(.biometryAny)
])
</code>   

<p>The tags option can be used to help manage the tokens stored in the keychain, which helps when your app works with multiple tokens or accounts. This is a feature I’m very excited about, due to the advanced use cases it unlocks. Let’s dig into that in the next section.</p>

 Supporting multiple tokens / users 

<p>We now support storing multiple tokens or user accounts in a single application. This is a big improvement over the legacy Okta OIDC SDK, which made the assumption that an app would only ever have a single user at a time. Storing multiple tokens helps you create more sophisticated apps, such as:</p>

 
   Multi-user applications that allow users to quickly switch between profiles 
   Applications that utilize app extensions, or widgets that wish to use separate tokens for each extension, for security reasons 
   Apps that use separate tokens with different scopes for escalated access 
 

<p>For a host of reasons, the AuthFoundation library now supports the storage and use of multiple tokens simultaneously, while still supporting traditional single-user applications via the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/default"><code>Credential.default</code></a> property.</p>

   <code>// Retrieve the credential created when storing a token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)

// Load the default credential
let credential = Credential.default

// Load a credential with a unique ID
let credential = try Credential.with(id: savedTokenId)

// Find all credentials matching a given tag
let credentials = try Credential.find(where: { metadata in
    metadata.tags["purpose"] == "background"
})

// Find all credentials containing ID token claims
let credentials = try Credential.find(where: { metadata in
    metadata.subject == userId
})
</code>   

 Simplified Keychain handling 

<p>Since secure token storage makes extensive use of the Apple Keychain, the AuthFoundation library provides a convenient <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/keychain">Keychain helper</a> to simplify keychain operations. We made it public to simplify the way shared secrets can be stored and still remain accessible to your other apps or extensions. For example, when saving the device secret necessary to implement TokenExchangeFlow, you can use the Keychain utility to save these secrets in a way that’s accessible to your other applications.</p>

   <code>if let deviceSecret = credential.token.deviceSecret,
   let idToken = credential.token.idToken
{
    try Keychain.Item(account: "ssoSecret",
                      accessGroup: "com.myapp.shared",
                      value: deviceSecret).save()
    try Keychain.Item(account: "ssoToken",
                      accessGroup: "com.myapp.shared",
                      value: idToken).save()
}
</code>   

<p>Later, retrieving these values can be an equally straightforward operation.</p>

   <code>if let secretData = try? Keychain.Search(account: "ssoSecret").get(),
   let secretToken = try? Keychain.Search(account: "ssoToken").get(),
   let ssoSecret = String(data: secretData, encoding: .utf8),
   let ssoToken = String(data: secretData, encoding: .utf8)
{
    // Exchange the tokens using TokenExchangeFlow
}
</code>   

 Outgoing request authorization 

<p>Ultimately, developers use the Okta Mobile SDK in order to securely access resources on a server somewhere. Your users authenticate using their credentials, and your application can use the resulting tokens to perform network requests on their behalf.</p>

<p>Since this is such a common operation, we decided to improve the developer experience by streamlining the process.</p>

   <code>let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/notes")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.httpBody = jsonBody

// Add appropriate HTTP authorization headers,
// automatically refreshing the token if needed.
await credential.authorize(&amp;request)

let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared
    .data(for: request)
</code>   

<p>When using the Swift Concurrency <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/authorize(_:)"><code>Credential.authorize()</code></a> async function, this will automatically refresh the credential’s access token if it’s expired, and add the appropriate HTTP authorization header to the request object. If you’re not using Swift Concurrency, the same thing can be accomplished with the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/refreshifneeded(graceinterval:completion:)"><code>refreshIfNeeded(graceInterval:completion:)</code></a> and <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/authorize(request:)"><code>authorize(request:)</code></a> functions.</p>

 Get started using the Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>The goal of these updates is to make it easier to build safer apps, while using native platform features to their fullest. To help you get started, here are a few suggestions of how you can take advantage of the new features in this SDK.</p>

 
   Support multiple users in your application, with fast switching between accounts. 
   Add app extensions to your app, using Device SSO to create unique tokens for each extension. 
   Use Device SSO to sign your user in across a suite of apps. 
   Create different tokens for your user with different scopes, one of which is stored behind biometrics, to support escalated permissions within your app (e.g. requiring Face ID to perform a bank transaction). 
   Build Apple TV or command-line applications that can use the Device Authorization grant to support convenient MFA sign-in securely. 
   Streamline your workflow to simplify authorizing network requests to your own server APIs, while keeping your tokens refreshed. 
 

<p>Check out the repositories on GitHub to get started. These repos have several <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift/tree/master/Samples">sample applications</a> that demonstrate the features outlined in this article. The README and API documentation referenced from the repositories is a great way to learn more about these new features.</p>

             Scheltema, Marktsteeg 1 Leiden, THE NETHERLANDS 
      
             <p>Despite legislation such as GDPR, people have lost the right to use and control their data, which is leading to growing resistance to data being collected and stored in central silos. At the same time, there is a paradigm shift from the centralised handling of data to a decentralised approach.</p>

<p>Together with the highly popular De Nieuwe Wereld YouTube channel, we will be recording a talk show called 'High time for a new data economy: from centralised to decentralised' on 5 October. Philosopher Ad Verbrugge will be discussing this topic with experts including Ruben Verborgh (professor of decentralised web technology), Mladen Sancanin (director of innovation, data services and research at PGGM), and Robert Reinder Nederhoed (blockchain entrepreneur).</p>

<p>The talk show will be recorded at Scheltema, Marktsteeg 1 in Leiden, the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This is your chance to be in the audience for the live recording session. Places are limited, however, so if you are interested in attending please let us know by email by latest 28 September:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.innopay.com/aanmelden">www.innopay.com/aanmelden.</a></p>

<p>Please note: The talk show will be held in Dutch.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Recap — 22nd August to 28th&nbsp;August <p>In this issue, we cover the latest crypto regulatory steps from the Australian and the Philippines governments, the position of the International Monetary Fund on the rise of crypto assets and their regulation, and&nbsp;more…</p><p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly regulatory recap.

   Schrems II und seine Bedeutung für den Schutz von Kundendaten und den internationalen Datentransfer 

<p>Kundinnen und Kunden interessieren sich vermehrt dafür, wie genau ihre Daten verwaltet, geschützt und verwendet werden. Beim Thema Sicherheit und Datenschutz geht es nicht mehr nur darum, gesetzliche Vorgaben einzuhalten, sondern darum, das Vertrauen der Kund*innen zu gewinnen und sie so langfristig zu binden. Dieses steigende Bewusstsein war auch einer der Gründe für die Datenschutz-Bewegung unter der Führung von Maximilian Schrems, der 2015 und 2020 die Rechtmäßigkeit der Weitergabe seiner in Irland von Facebook gespeicherten persönlichen Daten an die Firmenzentrale in den USA infrage stellte.</p>

<p>Schrems argumentierte, dass bei Datenübermittlungen zwischen den beiden Ländern seine persönlichen Daten nicht adäquat geschützt seien und demnach das Risiko bestünde, dass seine Daten abgefangen und die Bestimmungen der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) sowie des Privacy Shield Frameworks verletzt würden. Das aus seiner Klage entstandene Urteil Schrems II schreibt nun vor, dass Unternehmen und Serviceanbieter mithilfe angemessener Kontrollen die Sicherheit und den Schutz von Kundendaten gewährleisten müssen.</p>

 Internationaler Datentransfer als wichtiger Faktor für das Unternehmenswachstum 

<p>In einer Zeit, in der über 65&nbsp;% der Unternehmen Daten außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR) übermitteln, wird diese Thematik sehr schnell zu einem weltweiten Problem, das Unternehmen in verschiedensten Regionen betrifft. Wenn Unternehmen Daten lokalisieren müssen, werden sie in ihrem Unternehmenswachstum ausgebremst. Außerdem haben sie Probleme beim Einsatz von globalen Drittanbieter-Technologien, die ihnen einen Wettbewerbsvorteil verschaffen sollen. Doch es gibt auch gute Nachrichten: Die USA und die EU haben kürzlich bekanntgegeben, dass sie an einer Vereinbarung für ein Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework arbeiten. Was aber können Unternehmen schon heute tun, um die Daten ihrer Kund*innen besser zu schützen und auch für künftige Datenschutzvorschriften gewappnet zu sein&nbsp;– natürlich ohne negative Auswirkungen auf ihr Geschäft?</p>

 Für die Zukunft gerüstet: Höhere Kundensicherheit dank moderner CIAM-Funktionen 

<p>Die Identität Ihres Unternehmens ist seine Visitenkarte: Sie formt den ersten Eindruck, den Kund*innen von Ihrem Unternehmen gewinnen. Wie schützen wir unsere Daten und wo speichern wir sie? Hier die richtigen Entscheidungen zu treffen, ist heute wichtiger denn je. Gerade in Anbetracht eines Ökosystems, das sich immer mehr in Richtung Cloud und hybride IT entwickelt, stellt sich unweigerlich die Frage, wo Identitätsdaten gespeichert werden sollen.</p>

<p>Um persönliche Daten ausreichend zu schützen, müssen Unternehmen einen mehrschichtigen Sicherheitsansatz verfolgen. Dieser beginnt mit einer robusten Customer Identity and Access Management-Plattform (CIAM), die es ihnen ermöglicht Daten in der Region ihrer Wahl zu verwalten, zu speichern und zu schützen. Der Markt bietet aktuell verschiedene CIAM-Lösungen, doch die meisten bringen nicht das erforderliche Design und die nötige Architektur mit, um auch auf künftige Datenschutzvorschriften reagieren zu können.</p>

<p>Wie also kann eine moderne CIAM-Architektur Sie bei der Einhaltung von Datenschutzvorschriften unterstützen?</p>

  Sicherheit und Datenschutz von Grund auf mitgedacht: Moderne CIAM-Lösungen, die als SaaS bereitgestellt werden, werden von Anfang an für Sicherheit, Datenschutz und Datensouveränität konzipiert. Die sorgen dafür, dass in der Cloud gespeicherte Daten geschützt werden, jederzeit verfügbar sind und von andern Kundendaten (oder Tenants) getrennt sind. So minimieren Sie das Risiko einer Datenschutzverletzung und bieten Schutz vor unberechtigtem Zugriff. Außerdem können Sie mithilfe moderner CIAM-Lösungen Zugriffskonfigurationen und Berechtigungen bereitstellen, die minimale Zugriffsrechte für Ihre Identitätsdaten durchsetzen. 
	 Regionale Datenisolierung: Moderne CIAM-Lösungen bieten Ihnen eine Auswahl weltweit verteilter Rechenzentren und überzeugen mit der für Ihr Unternehmenswachstum so wichtigen Zuverlässigkeit, Performance und Skalierbarkeit. Sie ermöglichen außerdem die Isolation der Datenresidenz innerhalb der von Ihnen gewünschten Region(en), damit Sie die vor Ort geltenden Datenschutz- und Datenresidenzbestimmungen einhalten und zugleich Ihr Unternehmenswachstum voranbringen können. 
	 Datenschutz während der Speicherung und des Transfers: Die Verschlüsselung Ihrer Kundendaten innerhalb Ihrer On-Premise-Infrastruktur ist heute Standard. Doch sobald Sie in die Cloud wechseln, müssen Sie sicherstellen, dass die Daten sowohl während der Speicherung als auch während der Übermittlung mit kryptografischen Standard-Technologien verschlüsselt sind. Moderne CIAM-Lösungen, die Identitätsdaten in der Cloud isolieren, minimieren den sogenannten „Nosy-Neighbor-Effekt” und das Risiko, dass andere Kund*innen und Dritte sich böswillig Zugriff auf Ihre Identitätsdaten verschaffen. Damit werden auch Kontoübernahme-Angriffe unwahrscheinlicher. 
 <p>Die ForgeRock Identity Cloud bietet von Grund auf Sicherheit und Datenschutz dank vollständiger Tenant-Isolation, Datensouveränität mit regionaler Isolation und einer zuverlässigen Datenverschlüsselung, die sicherstellt, dass Ihre Daten sowohl während der Speicherung als auch während des internationalen Datentransfers gemäß den Vorgaben des Schrems-II-Urteils geschützt sind. So können Sie regulatorische Risiken sowie Kosten für die Nichteinhaltung von Vorschriften minimieren, die Daten Ihrer Kund*innen optimal schützen und so ihr Vertrauen gewinnen. Ihre Kund*innen verdienen höchste Sicherheit. Erfahren Sie noch heute, wie ForgeRock Sie dabei unterstützen kann.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Zero Trust is undoubtedly one of the hottest buzzwords in the IT industry. The idea that just by following a set of simple principles an organization can dramatically reduce the complexity of its IT infrastructure and significantly improve its security posture and resilience to cyberattacks is, of course, extremely appealing to everyone. Unfortunately, even the companies highly motivated to adopt Zero Trust as their new strategy are often struggling even with the initial steps.</p>
<p>If KuppingerCole analysts got a dollar every time we had to tell someone: “sorry, but you cannot buy Zero Trust”, we could probably all have retired early, but alas, most customers are not content with that response and would rather look for more practical recommendations. This is especially true in times when Zero Trust is sometimes presented as the only way to solve massive business-relevant problems, like quickly enabling your entire workforce to work from home because of a lockdown or protecting your business from destructive ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>The beauty of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/zero-trust" title="Zero Trust Principles">Zero Trust principles</a> is in their simplicity and universality: after all, it’s just a set of several basic rules that an organization has to follow, which don’t go into technical details and are thus understandable even for non-technical stakeholders. “Never trust, always verify”, “only allow as much access as necessary”, and “monitor all activities” – that’s basically the whole of Zero Trust in a nutshell. But how do you translate them into specific technical solutions?</p>
 Prerequisites for Zero Trust 
<p>Well, first of all, there is no single solution that can implement it across your entire IT environment, from devices and data stores to network infrastructure and cloud platforms to applications and SaaS services. Vendors can help you with the right building blocks and general guidance, but all the critical strategic decisions have to be made by you because nobody else knows your risks, challenges, and priorities. There are however certain prerequisites that you must have in place before even starting to invest into Zero Trust products.</p>
<p>Start by applying Zero Trust to Zero Trust itself! Do not trust product labels and vendor claims – make sure that you always verify that their solutions actually deliver the promised capabilities and don’t have hidden limitations. You should also have an inventory of the security and other tools you already have to ensure that you do not invest into unnecessary duplication of existing functionality. And, of course, you should define your long-term strategy but make sure you can deliver regular quick wins, or your management will inevitably turn Zero Trust into Zero Budget…</p>
<p>At an even more basic level, the magic formula for every Zero Trust architecture is</p>
<p>Zero Trust = Strong Identity + Full Visibility + Policy Enforcement</p>
<p>The latter component is the trickiest one to implement consistently and with full coverage, but the former two you should already have in place. A robust, modern and extensible IAM system is a basic foundation not just for Zero Trust, but for any digital enterprise, and trying to implement Zero Trust without reliable identities for all users, devices and services will inevitably fail. However, for quite a few of short-term use cases, a cloud-based Identity-as-a-Service platform will work just fine, and many Zero Trust platforms actually support those (Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, etc.) out of the box.</p>
<p>Full visibility is also one of the basic cybersecurity hygiene principles: you can only protect what you know exists, and to protect it efficiently, you have to know what’s happening in your IT environments at any moment. At the very least, you need to collect security telemetry from endpoint devices and feed it into Zero Trust policy engines to ensure that every access decision is based on their up-to-date security posture. And again, most organizations already have tools that do exactly this – endpoint detection and response (EDR), security information and event management (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR). All you need is to make sure they can exchange information with your future Zero Trust solutions.</p>
 Quick Wins of the Way 
<p>As soon as you face the challenge of actually implementing policy-based access management to any kind of sensitive resource, you’ll quickly realize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Securing access to web applications and, say, relational databases relies on entirely different technologies, standards, and protocols. It is up to you to decide which one you need to implement first and to find the right balance between long-term strategic projects and quick wins to please your users and management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of those quick wins are literally quick and painless. The best example is undoubtedly <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80474/zero-trust-network-access">Zero Trust Network Access</a> (ZTNA). Two years of working from home have led to an explosive growth of this market, and nowadays you can find a solution for an organization of any size and industry. Some cloud-native fully managed ZTNA platforms can be deployed in minutes, and the only prerequisite is a connector to an existing identity provider. These solutions then can be seamlessly extended with cloud-delivered security capabilities to form another popular buzzword – Secure Access Service Edge (SASE).</p>
<p>Expanding Zero Trust to other aspects of your IT, such as cloud infrastructure and workloads, sensitive data, APIs and so on might not be as trivial, but again, the actual implementation details depend largely on your existing applications and services. Some might already ship with ZT-enabled access controls that only need to be integrated with your existing policy engine. Others might require installing third-party plugins or connectors.</p>
 Would You Like to Know More? 
<p>If you are looking for more specific and comprehensive guidance or want to meet the real experts in the fields of identity and cybersecurity, you should definitely not miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> that will take place in Berlin this November. Zero Trust is one of the key topics of the summit, and we are already looking forward to interesting sessions covering anything from strategic approaches at large enterprises like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/1">Siemens</a> or <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5213/1">Mercedes-Benz</a> to real-life stories of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/2">Zero Trust journeys</a>.

   There are a myriad of state management options available for React. React provides the option of using the built-in Context for when you have a nested tree of components that share a state. There is also a built-in useState hook that will allow you to set local state for a component. 

 For more complex scenarios where you need a single source of truth that changes frequently and is shared across

  <p>There are a myriad of state management options available for React. React provides the option of using the built-in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">Context</a> for when you have a nested tree of components that share a state. There is also a built-in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate">useState hook</a> that will allow you to set local state for a component.</p>

<p>For more complex scenarios where you need a single source of truth that changes frequently and is shared across large sections of your application, consider using a more robust state management library.</p>

<p>This walkthrough will get you started with a basic setup using Okta’s redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. It provides examples on when to use <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> versus local state using React’s <code>useState</code> hook versus React Context.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>As of the time of this publication, Create React App requires Node &gt;= 14.0.0 and npm &gt;= 5.6. You can check for the latest required versions at <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Redux also recommends you install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en">React Developer Tools Chrome extension</a>.</p>

 Create the React app using TypeScript 

<p>We’ll get started with the built-in React template for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a> that uses Redux and TypeScript. This includes the recommended Redux Toolkit and Redux’s integration with React components. You can also <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-typescript-redux-example">clone the GitHub repo</a> and follow the instructions there to configure it instead of building the project.</p>

 
   First, run:
       <code>npx create-react-app okta-react-redux --template redux-typescript
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Our demo repository uses React <code>^18.2.0</code> and React Scripts <code>5.0.1</code>.</p>

 
   Then we’ll add the Redux core by running:
       <code>npm add redux@4.2
</code>       
   
   Redux provides its own types, but we’ll want to add our <code>react-redux</code> types since we’re using TypeScript:
       <code>npm add -D @types/react-redux@7.1
</code>       
   
   We’ll also need routing (and routing types) for our app:
       <code>npm install react-router-dom@5
npm add -D @types/react-router-dom@5.3
</code>       
   
   To start your app, run:
       <code>npm start
</code>       
   
 

 How Redux works 

<p>To update state using Redux, an action is dispatched. Then the store uses the root reducer to calculate a new state as compared to the old state, which notifies the proper subscribers of the update, so that the UI can be updated properly.</p>

<p>A typical Redux workflow goes like this. First, the UI for your application is rendered using an initial global Redux store, created with the root reducer:</p>

 
   An event occurs in the UI of your app, such as a user button interaction, which triggers an action. 
   The action is then dispatched to the store and an event handler that handles the needed logic makes the changes to your global state. 
   The store notifies subscribed parts in the UI that there has been an update. 
   Those subscribed parts then check to see if a re-render is necessary to update the UI as needed. 
 

<p>NOTE: The built-in Redux template we used includes a great counter example of how Redux works. You can take a closer look at <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples/">Redux’s explanation of the counter example</a>.</p>

 Useful terms for working with Redux 

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers">Action</a></p>

<p>An action is a JS object with a type and a payload. It describes an actionable interaction within your app, and typically is named something like <code>createUser</code> or <code>addToDo</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#action-creators">Action Creators</a></p>

<p>Action creators can be used to dynamically create actions. Our demo does not use action creators, but you can read more about it at the link above.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers">Reducers</a></p>

<p>When passed a new state, a reducer returns the proper current state by comparing it with the previous state, and making the applicable changes. Reducers work similarly to the <code>Array.reduce</code> method.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#redux-store">Redux store</a></p>

<p>The current live state for your app lives in the Redux store.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#selectors">Selectors</a></p>

<p>A selector returns a piece of the live Redux state as stored in the live Redux store.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#dispatch">Dispatch</a></p>

<p>Dispatch is a method that triggers an action, which in turn updates the Redux store.</p>

 Add authentication using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>For this demo app, we’ll be using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/">Okta’s SPA redirect model</a> to authenticate and fetch user info.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



 
   Add the Okta SDKs to your project by running:
       <code>npm install @okta/okta-react@6.4 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0
</code>       
   
 

 TypeScript React application setup with Redux state management 

 
   Create a <code>.env</code> file to your root directory and add the following:
       <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Remember to not include your <code>.env</code> file in any version control for security reasons.</p>

 Add authentication and create routes 

<p>Modify the existing <code>App.tsx</code> file:</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { LoginCallback, Security } from "@okta/okta-react";
import Home from "./components/home";
import { useCallback } from "react";

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI + "/login/callback",
});

function App() {
  const restoreOriginalUri = useCallback(
    async (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    },
    []
  );

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/" exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
      &lt;/Security&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

 Add initial state, create Redux slice, and create selector 

 
   Create a <code>src/redux-state</code> directory:
       <code>mkdir src/redux-state
</code>       
   
   Add a <code>userProfileSlice.tsx</code> file in the created <code>redux-state</code> directory with the following: 
 

   <code>import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { RootState } from "../app/store";

export interface IUserProfile {
  email: string;
  given_name: string;
  family_name: string;
}

const initialState: IUserProfile = {
  email: "",
  given_name: "",
  family_name: "",
};

export const userProfileSlice = createSlice({
  name: "userProfile",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUserProfile: (state, action) =&gt; {
      return {
        email: action.payload.payload.email,
        given_name: action.payload.payload.given_name,
        family_name: action.payload.payload.family_name,
      };
    },
  },
});

export const selectUserProfile = (state: RootState): IUserProfile =&gt;
  state.userProfile;

export const { setUserProfile } = userProfileSlice.actions;
export default userProfileSlice.reducer;
</code>   

 
   In the <code>src/app/store.ts</code> file, add the created Redux slice to the Redux store: 
 

   <code>import { configureStore, ThunkAction, Action } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";
import userProfileReducer from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    userProfile: userProfileReducer,
  },
});

export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType&lt;typeof store.getState&gt;;
export type AppThunk&lt;ReturnType = void&gt; = ThunkAction&lt;
  ReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action&lt;string&gt;
&gt;;
</code>   

 Show user profile information with state management 

 
   Create a <code>src/components</code> directory:
       <code>mkdir src/components
</code>       
   
   In the <code>src/components</code> directory, add the following files:
     home.tsx 
   
 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { createContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { setUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import Dashboard from "./dashboard";
import { UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

type UserProfileExtra = Pick&lt;UserClaims, "locale" | "preferred_username"&gt;;

const emptyUserContext = {
  preferred_username: "",
  locale: "",
} as UserProfileExtra;

export const UserContext = createContext(emptyUserContext);

export default function Home() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [userProfileExtra, setUserProfileExtra] = useState&lt;UserProfileExtra&gt;();

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      oktaAuth
        .getUser()
        .then((userInfo: UserProfileExtra) =&gt; {

          dispatch(
            setUserProfile({
              type: "userProfile/userProfileSet",
              payload: userInfo,
            })
          );

          setUserProfileExtra({
            locale: userInfo.locale,
            preferred_username: userInfo.preferred_username,
          });
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          console.error(err);
        });
    }
  }, [authState?.isAuthenticated, dispatch, oktaAuth]);

  return (authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp; userProfileExtra) ? (
    &lt;UserContext.Provider value={userProfileExtra}&gt;
      &lt;Dashboard /&gt;
    &lt;/UserContext.Provider&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;div className="section-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div className="title"&gt;Use Redux to Manage Authenticated State in a React App&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button className="button" onClick={login}&gt;
        Login
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here we use React’s <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html"><code>useEffect</code> hook</a> to set the global user state we set up earlier with <code>setUserProfile</code> and the local user state we set up in this file with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html"><code>useState</code></a>.</p>

<p>Once the user is authenticated, we rely on the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#getuser"><code>getUser</code> method</a> that is built into <code>oktaAuth</code> to fetch the user profile information. If the user is not yet authenticated, we render the login page instead.</p>

 dashboard.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import { useState } from "react";
import UserProfile from "./userProfile";
import UserProfileExtra from "./userProfileExtra";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut();

  return (
    &lt;div className="section-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div className="title"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="profile-greeting"&gt;{`Hi ${userProfile.given_name}!`}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="profile-more-wrapper"&gt;
        {isExpanded &amp;&amp; (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;UserProfile /&gt;
            &lt;UserProfileExtra /&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {
        &lt;div
          className="profile-toggle"
          onClick={() =&gt; setIsExpanded(!isExpanded)}
        &gt;
          {isExpanded ? "Show less" : "Show more"}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      }
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;button className="button" onClick={logout}&gt;
          Logout
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>In this file, we use a Redux selector to get the current state for <code>userProfile</code> to then render those values in our component.</p>

<p>We also set an <code>isExpandable</code> property that toggles whether or not additional user profile information is hidden or shown. This is another example of how to use local state with the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>

 userProfile.tsx 

   <code>import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";

export default function UserProfile() {
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Email: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfile.email}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Last name: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfile.family_name}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>In this file, we use the Redux selector created earlier to get the current state for the state slice. This includes the user profile information we set earlier.</p>

 userProfileExtra.tsx 

   <code>import "../App.css";
import { useContext } from "react";
import { UserContext } from "./home";

export default function UserProfileExtra() {
  const userProfileExtra = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Username: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfileExtra.preferred_username}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Locale: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfileExtra.locale}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here, we demonstrate another way to manage state. This time, React’s built-in <code>useContext</code> hook is used to get what we set earlier in the <code>UserContext</code> we created with React’s <code>createContext</code> method.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following custom styling has also been added to <code>src/App.css</code> in the demo repository.</p>

   <code>.section-wrapper &gt; div {
  padding: 24px;
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
}

.section-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  align-items: center;
  height: calc(100vh - 100vh * 0.33);
  margin-top: 56px;
}

.button {

.profile-more-wrapper &gt; div {
  padding: 16px;
}

.profile-more-wrapper span {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
</code>   

<p>Our app is now complete! Next we’ll run it to log a user in and render our applicable states.</p>

 Running the app 

<p>To start the app, run <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<p>After your app starts and you’ve clicked <code>login</code> on the home screen, you’ll be redirected to the Okta-hosted sign-in page. Here, enter your user credentials. Once your user is authenticated, the dashboard component we created will render.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you recall, the value for the user’s <code>given_name</code> is part of the Redux slice from our created selector <code>selectUserProfile</code>. Clicking <code>Show more</code> or <code>Show less</code> toggles our local state for <code>isExpanded</code> in the dashboard component. This allows us to show or hide additional user profile info, which is a mix of values from the <code>userProfileSlice</code> and additional values from the <code>UserContext</code> we created.</p>

 Learn more about authentication, React, and Redux 

<p>In this post, we used Okta’s redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. We also looked at examples for when to use Redux, local state using React’s <code>useState</code> hook, or React context. As you scale your apps, you might find that a mix of all three solutions is the right choice.</p>

<p>As we discover new ways to let users control their data across the web, we face plenty of hard problems to solve on the way there. We keep encountering the challenge of managing data schemas, especially when you add digital signing to them as in the case of W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>  How can you have a handle on your data when you don’t know how to describe them?   How do you go from machine-readable JSON to human-friendly understanding?   Which fields are required, and what do they mean? Is that <code>bankId</code> referring to a financial institution or a river bank?  <p>Fortunately, a crop of solutions have emerged for the problem of JSON data schema management over the years, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb">Semantic Web</a> technologies (<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> and <a href="https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-sparql">SPARQL</a>), <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/ddocs/views/index.html">CouchDB views</a>, and <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>. The downside is that there are many categories of ways to manage data, primarily semantic meaning and validation, and combining them into a complete data schema management system is full of pitfalls and unpaved paths. For example,</p>  JSON-LD will add semantic meaning to what a “LeaseAgreement” is in a specific context, but has no straightforward way to enforce that the “startDate” is an ISO 8601 datetime like “2022-08-16”.  JSON Schema can be used to require that “age” is greater than or equal to 21, but cannot explain who or what is being described by the age field in a way understandable by both humans and machines.  There is no agreed-upon way to perform wholesale migrations from one schema to the next one, or to rollback changes. There are some low-level protocols such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902">JSON patches</a> that can serve as building blocks, but how would one automatically transform an OpenBadges V2 credential into an OpenBadges V3 one by configuring a managed migration instead of writing custom software that needs its own deployment pipeline?  How would you describe a JSON credential schema that must have been issued (digitally signed) by specific Ethereum or Solana accounts? What if this list of issuers needs to change, or networks need to be added based on different cryptography?  <p>We like emergence, and therefore oppose solutions that assume a single entity can efficiently propose, define, and evolve data schemas for all conceivable use cases across disparate verticals. We believe this to be technically infeasible, politically difficult, and also against the tenets of decentralization. </p><p>Instead, we much prefer approaches where developers are empowered to self-serve, leveraging their specific domain knowledge to create data schemas that suit their use cases well–and when they need to, easily collaborate with other developers to reach a rough consensus on what would work for even more implementers.</p> Introducing TreeLDR (Tree Linked Data Representation)  <p>That’s why we’re happy to introduce <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr">TreeLDR</a>, which is an open-source developer tool with a DSL that makes managing data schemas as easy as defining data structures in your favorite (sane) statically-typed language.</p><p>TreeLDR provides a single language to define common concepts (types) and shared data representations (layouts) that can then be compiled into a concert of data schema artifacts. It can be used to produce JSON Schemas, JSON-LD contexts, migration strategies, and eventually entire SDKs (with credential issuance and verification) in various target programming languages. </p><p>In TreeLDR, not only can you import other TreeLDR definitions but also existing schemas such as JSON-LD contexts or XML XSDs. This way, developers can define data layouts in a familiar way and focus purely on the application they wish to build. Today, it just supports printing out JSON Schema and JSON-LD contexts, but it’s already usable, and more features are on the way. We felt it most important to release and quickly iterate against feedback from implementers as soon as possible, so here it is. We already use it to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/main/examples/rebase/schema/basic_post.tldr">represent credential schemas using W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/rebase-xyz/rebase">Rebase</a> project. </p><p>Here's an example of a TreeLDR file being compiled into both JSON-LD Context and JSON Schema: </p> <code>// Sets the base IRI of the document.
base &lt;https://example.com/&gt;;

// Defines an `xs` prefix for the XML schema datatypes.
use &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; as xs;

// A person.
type Person {
	/// Full name.
        name: required xs:string,
        
        /// Parents.
        parent: multiple Person,
        
        /// Age.
        age: xs:nonNegativeInteger
}</code> <p>After defining the TreeLDR file, we can run the following to define JSON-LD Context:</p> <code>tldrc -i example/xsd.tldr -i example/person.tldr json-ld context https://example.com/Person</code> <p>and the following is the output result: </p> <code>{
	"name": "https://example.com/Person/name",
        "parent": "https://schema.org/Person/parent",
        "age": "https://schema.org/Person/age"
}</code> <p>We can also run the following to generate JSON Schema:</p> <code>tldrc -i example/xsd.tldr -i example/person.tldr json-schema https://example.com/Person</code> <p>and the following is the output result: </p> <code>{ 
	"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
        "$id": "https://example.com/person.schema.json",
        "description": "Person",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
        	"name": {
                	"description": "Full name",

                }
                "parent": {
                	"description": "Parents",
                        "type": "array",
                        "item": {
                        "$ref": "https://example.com/person.schema.json"
                        }
               }
               "age": {
               	        "description": "Age",
                        "type": "integer",
                        "minimum": 0
              }
      },
      "required": [
      	     "name"
      ]

 With every major sports event comes a spike in online betting, and increased chances of fraud and underage gambling. Sports betting operators must be well-prepared to handle the influx of new customers looking to bet on this most unusual of World Cups.  



<p>The World Cup is perhaps the most popular sporting event in the world, watched by billions of people. The 2022 tournament brings some new and unprecedented challenges for betting operators, such as the unique scheduling during the winter holiday season, and increased competition for cash-strapped customers’ funds.   </p>



<p>World Cups are held every four years, in the downtime football period between domestic football seasons ending in May and beginning in August. This is good for football fans as the World Cup tends to bridge the gap before their national football league restarts, and good for betting operators as consumers typically have more time and funds to spend on their favorite games.</p>



<p>This year, however, due to the extreme summer heat in the host nation Qatar, the World Cup will begin on November 21, with the final scheduled for December 18. </p>



 The impact of major sports events on online gambling  



<p>Despite the timing of the World Cup 2022, the huge sporting event is still likely to attract enormous audiences and interest from sport bettors. Football makes up a huge proportion of the international online sports betting market, especially in European nations like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK. In fact, up to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1264768/sports-betting-participation-by-sport-great-britain/">90% of all sports wagers in the UK</a> are placed on football. In Europe, even the most casual football fan will place a bet on the World Cup.</p>



<p>According to Sportradar, bets on the World Cup totaled approximately <a href="https://www.casino.org/news/2018-world-cup-generated-e136-billion-in-bets-worldwide-fifa-says/">€136 billion in 2018</a>. The UK alone experienced <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/world-cup-economic-boost/">a 50% upsurge in gambling activities</a> from the 2014 World Cup to the 2018 World Cup. In fact, each game in 2018 experienced an average betting turnover <a href="https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/2018russia/news/136bn-betting-turnover-and-no-suspicious-betting-behaviour-at-russia-2018">worth €2.1 billion</a>. This year, that number is likely to be absolutely smashed as this is the first opportunity for American football fans to bet online, following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling</a> that legalized sports betting. Plus, with “soccer” now more popular than ever in the States, we could see an all-time record.</p>



 Adapt and optimize onboarding for Qatar 2022 



<p>With the global online gambling market <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recent-trends-in-global-online-gambling--betting-market-size--share-to-exceed-us-114-4-bilion-at-10-9-cagr-rise-by-2028---industry-analysis-trends-forecast-report-by-zmr-301542610.html">estimated to be worth $61.5 billion</a>, gambling platforms need to ensure they offer the best customer experience possible, to differentiate themselves, and stay ahead of the competition in an increasingly congested marketplace.</p>



<p>Gambling operators must also bear in mind that although gambling is strictly illegal in Qatar, there is nothing prohibiting people from outside Qatar placing bets on events that take place inside the country. It is for this reason and more that operators need to choose an ID verification solution that offers solid, robust and intuitive KYC processes, ensuring they follow different <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">region’s regulations</a>, rules and requirements.</p>



 Dealing with the increased chances of fraud 



<p>With the popularity of online gambling continuing to rise, security remains a major concern for players and providers alike. In fact, fraud rates in gambling went up <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/uploads/docs/TransUnion-Q1-2022-Digital-Fraud-Trends-Analysis-Infographic.pdf">50.1% in the first quarter</a> of 2022, compared to the same period last year. To reduce the risk of fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, online gambling platforms need to take every step possible to verify the identities of their players. Gambling platforms can help minimize fraud by having a digital identity verification partner like IDnow that has experience in dealing with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/are-you-prepared-for-the-uefa-euro-championship/">fraudulent activity spikes</a> during major sports events. But in order to prepare in advance, betting sites should incentivize prospective bettors to register early.  </p>



<p>Extensive marketing campaigns can increase consumer awareness during the ongoing Premier League and Champions League to get people registered and verified before the first World Cup match on November 21. In addition, special offers such as free bets and bonuses often capture the attention of bettors and drive sign-ups which allows operators to tailor different promotions in advance to spread out verification processes. </p>



<p>However, bonus abuse (process of signing up to a service multiple times to take advantage of marketing offers normally intended just for new users) is something that operators need to manage in order to keep their books positive. Regulations in Europe nowadays prevent huge bonuses, but if we look over to the States or Brazil, deposit bonuses are very hefty and the reason why operators need to be extra vigilant. </p>



<p>As a result, having a secure identity verification provider such as IDnow proofing customers’ identities can prevent such abuse from occurring.</p>



 







 



 What operators should be aware of  



<p>Since most sports bettors will look to stay indoors and watch the World Cup this winter, gambling sites can anticipate a significant inflow of online players. On the other hand, considering the event will take place so close to Christmas, online gambling operators may also see a drop in visitor numbers, as players’ disposable incomes face stiff competition from festive expectations of gifts, parties, and rising heating costs.</p>



<p>Head of Sportsbook Proposition, Myke Foster believes marketing needs to grab customers before the busy holiday season begins, adding that the tournament starts a week before the year’s most “pressured payday”, especially in the face of inflation and the ongoing economic crisis.</p>



<p>As gambling platforms will be targeting new markets, and a potentially smaller pool of consumers than during regular World Cups, they need to ensure their service is top-notch. New players will not want to go through a long or complicated process to register, so online gambling operators need to make the process as simple, secure and intuitive as possible. A solid product experience and a fast and secure onboarding process are crucial to leave no potential customer behind.  </p>



 A variety of firsts at Qatar’s World Cup 



<p>Although the 2018 World Cup was a massive hit for the online gambling market, much has changed in technology and mobile gambling platforms since France last snatched the coveted title. For the Qatar World Cup, many online gamblers will likely be using their smartphones to register and place their bets and will expect a smooth, secure and easy process throughout. Customers are no longer prepared to fill out lengthy application forms. Operators need to take advantage of the latest biometric verification methods to supercharge the registration process, including selfie sign-ins, and photo verification.</p>



<p>With the winter World Cup, there will be more people than ever watching from the comfort and heat of their homes, meaning there is a unique opportunity to capitalize on those who may decide to try their luck with an online bet for the first time. This new client base must be welcomed and guided accordingly. </p>



<p>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s solutions have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages.</p>



<p>Preparation is key and leveraging IDV and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> will allow gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience for bettors, new and old.</p>

 How we are building an interoperable ecosystem for private markets 
<p>The continued expansion of our ecosystem is transforming Tokeny into the middleware that powers the new financial infrastructure for private markets, and the network effect is starting to take off.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in August 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Our role at Tokeny is to provide a compliance infrastructure for digital assets that enables issuers to build and launch their tokenization projects with a low technology cost in a few weeks. We are currently concentrating on delivering&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3WCwuv6ZmVbY3hD9OEVkbGhCIblpCfONGyb3oOQAEVz_wsT3lT6TQF124pB0W5ZijG7E8">scalable tokenization solutions</a>&nbsp;that are ready to issue thousands of tokens in parallel&nbsp;with no downtime for multi-token issuers and our ecosystem partners.</p>
<p>Now, more and more&nbsp;reputational companies integrated and packaged our API-ready and white-label solutions to provide a ready-to-use tokenization platform&nbsp;for their institutional customers, facilitating the adoption of tokenization by the mainstream.</p>
<p>These partners include consulting companies, law firms (e.g. CMS), custody providers (e.g. Fireblocks), valuation-as-a-service providers (e.g. Inveniam), and liquidity providers including alternative trading systems (ATS), decentralized exchanges, regulated exchanges, and others.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 The value chain of tokenized assets is gradually being completed. It paves the way to bring liquidity for tokenized assets&nbsp;in three steps: 

		 
	 
            Tokenize assets  <p>By integrating our solutions through APIs or providing the white-label platform, ecosystem players can offer a turnkey tokenization solution so that issuers can easily deploy and manage digital securities or stablecoins without requiring any blockchain knowledge.</p>
              Enrich token data  <p>Investors can access accurate, reliable and real-time token data, such as price references, provided by valuation service providers like Inveniam.</p>
              Connect to distribution networks  <p>After the tokenized assets are priced, investors can find a counterparty and compliantly trade tokenized assets via liquidity provider partners’ distribution networks, leading to increased liquidity.</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>As our solutions are based on the&nbsp;open source market standard ERC3643, which supports Ethereum and any EVM public blockchains such as Polygon, we&nbsp;ensure the interoperability and cross-chain capability of the tokens, thereby enabling improved liquidity, while enforcing compliance&nbsp;as the smart contract only allows transactions between eligible investors who have passed identity-based compliance validation.</p>
<p>The continued expansion of our ecosystem is transforming Tokeny into&nbsp;the middleware that powers the new financial infrastructure for private markets.&nbsp;And we’re excited to see the network effects begin to take off, bringing the industry as a whole closer to unlocking the full potential of tokenization by&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenization-is-the-first-step-for-real-world-assets-in-defi/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3WCwuv6ZmVbY3hD9OEVkbGhCIblpCfONGyb3oOQAEVz_wsT3lT6TQF124pB0W5ZijG7E8">bringing tokenized assets to DeFi</a>.</p>

<p>By the KILT&nbsp;Devs</p><p>As promised in last week’s announcement <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-moves-to-polkadot-b5d4b56f8040">KILT Moves to Polkadot</a>, here are additional technical details about the migration plan. We’ll publish full documentation after the move to Polkadot is complete in late September, which should be helpful to other projects considering this&nbsp;path.</p> Solo-to-parachain pallet <p>In order to provide the safest and most seamless move from Kusama to Polkadot, the “solo-to-parachain” pallet provided by Parity Technologies will be used. This also allows us to keep the full block history, and it will not be necessary to temporarily restore the Sudo key to the KILT&nbsp;network.</p><p>This process requires adding two more abilities to the KILT&nbsp;Council:</p>  Execute XCM call to swap parachain lease  Remove the requirement that the Relay Chain block should strictly increase between two parachain blocks (Polkadot has lower block numbers than&nbsp;Kusama).  <p>Also the “solo-to-parachain” pallet needs to be added to the KILT&nbsp;runtime.</p> Governance by KILT community <p>Of course this requires a governance decision by the KILT community. The proposal will be posted by mid-September and the referendum will start approximately 7 days later. The governance phases will be announced on KILT channels (<a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a> and <a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT.io</a>). We encourage the KILT community to vote on the referendum.</p><p>After the referendum has passed, the Council would execute the move to Polkadot. This should take a little more than three hours.&nbsp;Then:</p>  In the first two hours of this period, the KILT network will work normally.  In the third hour KILT will not produce any new&nbsp;blocks.  After this last hour, block production will pick up with Polkadot as the new Relay Chain. The KILT chain will remain unchanged and produce the next&nbsp;block.  <p>The KILT Council, now on Polkadot, would then remove its two new rights. At this point the move is done. We anticipate that KILT will be live on Polkadot by the end of September, a bit sooner than expected.</p> FAQs  Who in the KILT community can relax and have a beer/wine/seltzer?   KILT Coin&nbsp;holders  KILT credential holders, DID holders, web3name&nbsp;holders  Sporran users  Staking delegators  Anyone who developed software using KILT (SDK, Extrinsics, RPC)   Who in the KILT community needs to do something? <p>Any node operator:</p>  Collators  Full nodes (Exchanges, RPC- Providers)   What does a node operator need to&nbsp;do? <p>Please be sure to be synchronized with the Polkadot relay chain in advance, either&nbsp;by:</p>  Taking a snapshot from <a href="https://dot.polkashots.io/">Polkashots’ Database Snapshots</a>, or  Preparing a node with the –-chain=polkadot instead of the –-chain=kusama  <p>“When do I need to be&nbsp;ready?”</p>  We will let you know in advance! You will have at least 8 days of advance warning, after we open the proposal on the KILT&nbsp;network.  <p>“How do I know the migration from Kusama to Polkadot is happening?”</p>  We will let you know when the migration happens.

  <p>Java has had good multi-threading and concurrency capabilities from early on in its evolution and can effectively utilize multi-threaded and multi-core CPUs. Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 had basic support for platform threads (or Operating System (OS) threads), and JDK 1.5 had more utilities and updates to improve concurrency and multi-threading. JDK 8 brought asynchronous programming support and more concurrency improvements. While things have continued to improve over multiple versions, there has been nothing groundbreaking in Java for the last three decades, apart from support for concurrency and multi-threading using OS threads.</p>

<p>Though the concurrency model in Java is powerful and flexible as a feature, it was not the easiest to use, and the developer experience hasn’t been great. This is primarily due to the shared state concurrency model used by default. One has to resort to synchronizing threads to avoid issues like data races and thread blocking. I wrote more about Java concurrency in my <a href="https://deepu.tech/concurrency-in-modern-languages-java/">Concurrency in modern programming languages: Java</a> post.</p>

 What is Project Loom? 

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Loom aims to drastically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications that make the best use of available hardware.</p>

  <p>— Ron Pressler (Tech lead, Project Loom)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OS threads are at the core of Java’s concurrency model and have a very mature ecosystem around them, but they also come with some drawbacks and are expensive computationally. Let’s look at the two most common use cases for concurrency and the drawbacks of the current Java concurrency model in these cases.</p>

<p>One of the most common concurrency use cases is serving requests over the wire using a server. For this, the preferred approach is the thread-per-request model, where a separate thread handles each request. Throughput of such systems can be explained using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little’s law</a>, which states that in a stable system, the average concurrency (number of requests concurrently processed by the server), L, is equal to the throughput (average rate of requests), λ, times the latency (average duration of processing each request), W. With this, you can derive that throughput equals average concurrency divided by latency (λ = L/W).</p>

<p>So in a thread-per-request model, the throughput will be limited by the number of OS threads available, which depends on the number of physical cores/threads available on the hardware. To work around this, you have to use shared thread pools or asynchronous concurrency, both of which have their drawbacks. Thread pools have many limitations, like thread leaking, deadlocks, resource thrashing, etc. Asynchronous concurrency means you must adapt to a more complex programming style and handle data races carefully. There are also chances for memory leaks, thread locking, etc.</p>

<p>Another common use case is parallel processing or multi-threading, where you might split a task into subtasks across multiple threads. Here you have to write solutions to avoid data corruption and data races. In some cases, you must also ensure thread synchronization when executing a parallel task distributed over multiple threads. The implementation becomes even more fragile and puts a lot more responsibility on the developer to ensure there are no issues like thread leaks and cancellation delays.</p>

<p>Project Loom aims to fix these issues in the current concurrency model by introducing two new features: virtual threads and structured concurrency.</p>

 Virtual threads 

<blockquote>
  <p>Java 19 is scheduled to be released in September 2022, and Virtual threads will be a preview feature. Yayyy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/425">Virtual threads</a> are lightweight threads that are not tied to OS threads but are managed by the JVM. They are suitable for thread-per-request programming styles without having the limitations of OS threads. You can create millions of virtual threads without affecting throughput. This is quite similar to coroutines, like <a href="https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1">goroutines</a>, made famous by the Go programming language (Golang).</p>

<p>The new virtual threads in Java 19 will be pretty easy to use. Compare the below with Golang’s goroutines or Kotlin’s coroutines.</p>

<p>Virtual thread</p>

   <code>Thread.startVirtualThread(() -&gt; {
    System.out.println("Hello, Project Loom!");
});
</code>   

<p>Goroutine</p>

   <code>go func() {
    println("Hello, Goroutines!")
}()
</code>   

<p>Kotlin coroutine</p>

   <code>runBlocking {
    launch {
        println("Hello, Kotlin coroutines!")
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Fun fact: before JDK 1.1, Java had support for green threads (aka virtual threads), but the feature was removed in JDK 1.1 as that implementation was not any better than platform threads.</p>

<p>The new implementation of virtual threads is done in the JVM, where it maps multiple virtual threads to one or more OS threads, and the developer can use virtual threads or platform threads as per their needs. A few other important aspects of this implementation of virtual threads:</p>

 
   It is a <code>Thread</code> in code, runtime, debugger, and profiler 
   It’s a Java entity and not a wrapper around a native thread 
   Creating and blocking them are cheap operations 
   They should not be pooled 
   Virtual threads use a work-stealing <code>ForkJoinPool</code> scheduler 
   Pluggable schedulers can be used for asynchronous programming 
   A virtual thread will have its own stack memory 
   The virtual threads API is very similar to platform threads and hence easier to adopt/migrate 
 

<p>Let’s look at some examples that show the power of virtual threads.</p>

 Total number of threads 

<p>First, let’s see how many platform threads vs. virtual threads we can create on a machine. My machine is Intel Core i9-11900H with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 64GB RAM running Fedora 36.</p>

<p>Platform threads</p>

   <code>var counter = new AtomicInteger();
while (true) {
    new Thread(() -&gt; {
        int count = counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Thread count = " + count);
        LockSupport.park();
    }).start();
}
</code>   

<p>On my machine, the code crashed after 32_539 platform threads.</p>

<p>Virtual threads</p>

   <code>var counter = new AtomicInteger();
while (true) {
    Thread.startVirtualThread(() -&gt; {
        int count = counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Thread count = " + count);
        LockSupport.park();
    });
}
</code>   

<p>On my machine, the process hung after 14_625_956 virtual threads but didn’t crash, and as memory became available, it kept going slowly. You may be wondering why this behavior exists! It’s due to the parked virtual threads being garbage collected, and the JVM is able to create more virtual threads and assign them to the underlying platform thread.</p>

 Task throughput 

<p>Let’s try to run 100,000 tasks using platform threads.</p>

   <code>try (var executor = Executors.newThreadPerTaskExecutor(Executors.defaultThreadFactory())) {
    IntStream.range(0, 100_000).forEach(i -&gt; executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
        System.out.println(i);
        return i;
    }));
}
</code>   

<p>This uses the <code>newThreadPerTaskExecutor</code> with the default thread factory and thus uses a thread group. When I ran this code and timed it, I got the numbers shown here. I get better performance when I use a thread pool with <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code>.</p>

   <code># 'newThreadPerTaskExecutor' with 'defaultThreadFactory'
0:18.77 real,   18.15 s user,   7.19 s sys,     135% 3891pu,    0 amem,         743584 mmem
# 'newCachedThreadPool' with 'defaultThreadFactory'
0:11.52 real,   13.21 s user,   4.91 s sys,     157% 6019pu,    0 amem,         2215972 mmem
</code>   

<p>Not so bad. Now, let’s do the same using virtual threads.</p>

   <code>try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    IntStream.range(0, 100_000).forEach(i -&gt; executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
        System.out.println(i);
        return i;
    }));
}
</code>   

<p>If I run and time it, I get the following numbers.</p>

   <code>0:02.62 real,   6.83 s user,    1.46 s sys,     316% 14840pu,   0 amem,         350268 mmem
</code>   

<p>This is far more performant than using platform threads with thread pools. Of course, these are simple use cases; both thread pools and virtual thread implementations can be further optimized for better performance, but that’s not the point of this post.</p>

<p>Running Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) with the same code gives the following results, and you can see that virtual threads outperform platform threads by a huge margin.</p>

   <code># Throughput

 Structured concurrency 

<blockquote>
  <p>Structured concurrency will be an incubator feature in Java 19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/428">Structured concurrency</a> aims to simplify multi-threaded and parallel programming. It treats multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work, streamlining error handling and cancellation while improving reliability and observability. This helps to avoid issues like thread leaking and cancellation delays. Being an incubator feature, this might go through further changes during stabilization.</p>

<p>Consider the following example using <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code>.</p>

   <code>void handleOrder() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    try (var esvc = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(8)) {
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; inventory = esvc.submit(() -&gt; updateInventory());
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; order = esvc.submit(() -&gt; updateOrder());

        int theInventory = inventory.get();   // Join updateInventory
        int theOrder = order.get();           // Join updateOrder

        System.out.println("Inventory " + theInventory + " updated for order " + theOrder);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>We want <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> subtasks to be executed concurrently. Each of those can succeed or fail independently. Ideally, the <code>handleOrder()</code> method should fail if any subtask fails. However, if a failure occurs in one subtask, things get messy.</p>

 
   Imagine that <code>updateInventory()</code> fails and throws an exception. Then, the <code>handleOrder()</code> method throws an exception when calling <code>inventory.get()</code>. So far this is fine, but what about <code>updateOrder()</code>? Since it runs on its own thread, it can complete successfully. But now we have an issue with a mismatch in inventory and order. Suppose the <code>updateOrder()</code> is an expensive operation. In that case, we are just wasting the resources for nothing, and we will have to write some sort of guard logic to revert the updates done to order as our overall operation has failed. 
   Imagine that <code>updateInventory()</code> is an expensive long-running operation and <code>updateOrder()</code> throws an error. The <code>handleOrder()</code> task will be blocked on <code>inventory.get()</code> even though <code>updateOrder()</code> threw an error. Ideally, we would like the <code>handleOrder()</code> task to cancel <code>updateInventory()</code> when a failure occurs in <code>updateOrder()</code> so that we are not wasting time. 
   If the thread executing <code>handleOrder()</code> is interrupted, the interruption is not propagated to the subtasks. In this case <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> will leak and continue to run in the background. 
 

<p>For these situations, we would have to carefully write workarounds and failsafe, putting all the burden on the developer.</p>

<p>We can achieve the same functionality with structured concurrency using the code below.</p>

   <code>void handleOrder() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; inventory = scope.fork(() -&gt; updateInventory());
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; order = scope.fork(() -&gt; updateOrder());

        scope.join();           // Join both forks
        scope.throwIfFailed();  // ... and propagate errors

        // Here, both forks have succeeded, so compose their results
        System.out.println("Inventory " + inventory.resultNow() + " updated for order " + order.resultNow());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Unlike the previous sample using <code>ExecutorService</code>, we can now use <code>StructuredTaskScope</code> to achieve the same result while confining the lifetimes of the subtasks to the lexical scope, in this case, the body of the try-with-resources statement. The code is much more readable, and the intent is also clear. <code>StructuredTaskScope</code> also ensures the following behavior automatically.</p>

 
   
    <p>Error handling with short-circuiting — If either the <code>updateInventory()</code> or <code>updateOrder()</code> fails, the other is canceled unless its already completed. This is managed by the cancellation policy implemented by <code>ShutdownOnFailure()</code>; other policies are possible.</p>
   
   
    <p>Cancellation propagation — If the thread running <code>handleOrder()</code> is interrupted before or during the call to <code>join()</code>, both forks are canceled automatically when the thread exits the scope.</p>
   
   
    <p>Observability — A thread dump would clearly display the task hierarchy, with the threads running <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> shown as children of the scope.</p>
   
 

 State of Project Loom 

<p>The Loom project started in 2017 and has undergone many changes and proposals. Virtual threads were initially called fibers, but later on they were renamed to avoid confusion. Today with Java 19 getting closer to release, the project has delivered the two features discussed above. One as a preview and another as an incubator. Hence the path to stabilization of the features should be more precise.</p>

 What does this mean to regular Java developers? 

<p>When these features are production ready, it should not affect regular Java developers much, as these developers may be using libraries for concurrency use cases. But it can be a big deal in those rare scenarios where you are doing a lot of multi-threading without using libraries. Virtual threads could be a no-brainer replacement for all use cases where you use thread pools today. This will increase performance and scalability in most cases based on the benchmarks out there. Structured concurrency can help simplify the multi-threading or parallel processing use cases and make them less fragile and more maintainable.</p>

 What does this mean to Java library developers? 

<p>When these features are production ready, it will be a big deal for libraries and frameworks that use threads or parallelism. Library authors will see huge performance and scalability improvements while simplifying the codebase and making it more maintainable. Most Java projects using thread pools and platform threads will benefit from switching to virtual threads. Candidates include Java server software like Tomcat, Undertow, and Netty; and web frameworks like Spring and Micronaut. I expect most Java web technologies to migrate to virtual threads from thread pools. Java web technologies and trendy reactive programming libraries like RxJava and Akka could also use structured concurrency effectively. This doesn’t mean that virtual threads will be the one solution for all; there will still be use cases and benefits for asynchronous and reactive programming.</p>

<p>Access control is a security measure that can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. But how can mandatory access control help with security?</p>
<p>What is mandatory access control? Mandatory access control (MAC) is a type of access control where the policy administrator, not the user, can grant or restrict access to certain files.</p>
 What Is Access Control? 
<p>As users navigate through physical and digital systems, they tend to brush up against resources and assets that they should or should not have access to. This is particularly true in digital systems where the lateral movement to different storage, application, or processing areas can lead to dangerous security threats that undermine the entire infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To maintain separation of assets and resources, security administrators use what are known as “access controls” that define who can access those resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, once a user is authenticated and authorized to enter a system via a user account or identity, an access control system sets conditions that determine who, when, where, and sometimes how that user can navigate the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this concept seems simple on its surface, there are several different access control schemas that help secure resources against unauthorized access:</p>
 Rule-Based Access Control&nbsp; 
<p>This approach grants permissions to users based on a structured set of rules and policies. These rules create a “context” from which resource access can be derived. These rules are laid out in an Access Control List (ACL) attached to an “object” (the resource, whether it’s processing permissions, data, account access, etc.).</p>
<p>Some common forms of rule-based access include limiting system access to given times of the day, or locations (for example, limiting access to devices at or near an office location).&nbsp;</p>
 Role-Based Access Control&nbsp; 
<p>Role-based access is an approach where user roles within an organization dictate access permissions. The organization will have a defined organizational hierarchy and a clearly set list of permissions based on roles within that hierarchy. Any user designated within a given role will gain the permissions of that role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Role-based access is quite common. The most typical places we find role-based permissions are multi-user systems. For example, a public-facing service provider (like an email or cloud service provider) may have several different types of accounts (users, VIP users, administrators, moderators, etc.), each with their own permissions and access controls. A role-based system would restrict who can access what within that system to allow for a shared space.&nbsp;</p>
 Attribute-Based Access Control 
<p>Attribute-based systems are somewhat more granular than both role- and rule-based systems. Attribute-based systems, rather than looking at a list of rules related to resources (like rule systems) or roles (like a role system) can pull dynamic information from user accounts to field more fluid and responsive access systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, suppose a company works with classified data. In that case, individual users could receive designations for access to SECRET data designations–this would be an attribute of the user, not a role or a resource.</p>
<p>These access control approaches aren’t necessarily exclusive. For example, it’s possible to use both attribute- and role-based systems to fine-tune the system and data security.</p>
 Mandatory Access Control 
<p>No matter what the specifics of the control system, at some point, implementation and maintenance fall onto some sort of authority. In Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems, that authority falls squarely on the shoulders of system administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process of access designation follows a similar path across MAC systems:</p>
 
 Administrators create, configure, and implement access policies. These policies are based on specific pieces of information–but at this point, the admins are creating the categories themselves (roles, user attributes, resource attributes, etc.).&nbsp; 
 These administrators implement these access categories where necessary, either as fields of user information, data object metadata, system information, and so on. 
 During authorization, the system will look at the security attributes of the “subject” of access (user, object, system, etc.) and determine whether permission exists.&nbsp; 
 
 Discretionary Access Control 
<p>Conversely, Discretionary Access Control (DAC) gives customers and business end-users more capabilities in terms of setting their own access controls. While a security administrator may implement roles and permissions throughout the system, the user may override those permissions to grant access to individual users who, based on their business credentials, should actually have access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach can provide some flexibility in terms of how a business gives access to users. However, it also creates potential vulnerabilities when local business administrators fail to update or configure their local permissions. This makes DAC a high-maintenance solution that, while flexible, needs regular attention.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Differences Between Mandatory and Discretionary Access Control? 
<p>MAC and DAC are rather polarized. While some access control schemes can work together in some capacity, it’s relatively difficult (if not impossible) to effectively field both DAC and MAC without stepping over one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, these incompatibilities are partly due to the differences between the two approaches. Mandatory and Discretionary differ in a few key ways:</p>
 
 Protection: Mandatory discretion offers more stable and predictable protection when implemented well. Discretionary access control can provide key flexibility for an organization but also introduce potential conflicts between individual and organization-wide permissions.<br>
 
 User Control: Additionally, mandatory controls aren’t incredibly flexible outside of their schema, and for a good reason–to address security issues related to access from an organizational level. However, there are legitimate instances where individuals in an organization should receive access to specific resources even if their role or user attributes don’t allow it.&nbsp; 
 Maintainability: Mandatory access controls are typically formulated from the top-down and centrally planned. That means that they can support robust authorization throughout a system, with security and regulatory demands implemented in one place.<br>
On the other hand, DAC can get messy if an end-user is implementing local access control haphazardly or without maintaining their permissions list in cases where employees leave the company or are terminated.&nbsp; 
 
 Support Effective Mandatory Access Control with Powerful 1Kosmos Identity Management 
<p>Strong authentication and identity management are the cornerstones of any good access control system. With these controls in place, your organization can ensure that only real and authorized users navigate your systems through sufficient physical and logical access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides a streamlined user experience with biometric, passwordless authentication and liveness-testing measures to ensure that users are who they say they are. Through this, you can build mandatory and other access controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos BlockID, you get the following features:</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock DIDs now support more than one key  Keys can be given different capabilities using Verification Relationships  We support 4 Verification Relationships: Authentication, Assertion, Key Agreement, and Capability Invocation.  DIDs can now be controlled by other DIDs  DIDs can now have service endpoints  Dock now supports off-chain DID Documents  <p>Until now, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on Dock could only have one key at any moment. Though they could be rotated over time, having only one valid key at any moment meant that the DID owner had to use the same key for all purposes. </p><p>As an example, consider the life of an issuer utilising a DID. The issuer could perform several functions like the issuance of credentials, authenticating with some other application, engaging in secure communication using a methodology like <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a>, or revoking its issued credential on the blockchain, which again requires authenticating itself to the chain. Following the principle of separation of concerns, the issuer would ideally like to have separate keys for each of these functions so that when one key is compromised or lost, its other functions are not impacted. Also, the issuer would like to have separate more sensitive keys that can be used to add new or remove existing keys of its DID.</p> Keys and Verification Relationships <p></p><p>With the latest release of our platform (blockchain node and SDK), we enable a DID owner to have a setup like the above. This new release will allow a DID to add multiple keys for its DID and give them different capabilities. These are called Verification relationships in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-relationships">W3C DID spec</a>. A key can have one or more Verification relationships to the DID depending on the kind of functions it's supposed to perform on the DID's behalf. </p><p>We support 4 Verification Relationships:</p><p>1. Authentication - Keys with this relationship are only allowed to be used for authentication, i.e. convincing the other party that it's a key of the DID. Such a key can revoke a credential on the blockchain, add a schema, or act as a holder when sharing a presentation of credential(s).</p><p>2. Assertion - Keys with this relationship are used for signing credentials during issuance.</p><p>3. Key Agreement - These keys are used during secure communication to encrypt some data for the DID.</p><p>4. Capability Invocation - These keys are able to modify the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID Document</a>, i.e. add new or remove existing keys, add/remove service endpoints, controllers (more on this below), etc. If a DID has one or more such keys, we say that the DID "controls" itself, meaning that it can modify its DID Document. We have intentionally decided to allow keys with this relationship to also add schemas, revoke credentials, etc., on the chain. </p><p>While adding a key, it can be specified what verification relationships the key would have with the DID. Each new key gets a unique id (in that DID's context), and using this id, the key can be removed as well.</p> DID Controllers <p></p><p>As mentioned above, only keys with "Capability Invocation" are able to modify the DID Document. A DID with such a key is said to be self-controlled, or it's a controller of itself. But a DID might have other controllers as well, or a DID might not control itself but is only controlled by other DIDs. This capability is essential for guardianship use cases where a DID (the controller) is the custodian of another DID (controlled). </p><p>As an example, consider an organization that wants to onboard its members to our chain and give each member a DID. At the time of onboarding, members might not be capable of managing keys, so the organization will create a DID for each of its members. That member DID won't have a key, and the organization DID will be the controller of the member DID. Now the organization is the guardian of the member. </p><p>When the member becomes capable of managing keys, the member will provide its public key to the organization, which will update the member DID with that public key, make the member the controller of its DID and remove itself from the controller role, thus ending the guardianship. </p><p>In another example, consider an IOT application where each sensor has its own DID. The sensors have keys that they use to sign (Authentication) messages before sending or decrypting (Key Agreement) received messages, but only the owner of the sensors can update their keys. Also, the owner could add new owner(s) to those sensors by adding more controllers to their DID or remove itself as the controller, thus transferring the ownership. </p><p>Similar to sensors, DIDs can be assigned to other objects like batteries where batteries have DIDs, but they don't have any keys, only controllers (the owner of the battery). This helps us in building <a href="https://www.circularise.com/blog/digital-product-passports-dpp-what-how-and-why">Digital Product Passports</a> which are digital twins of physical products to enable a sustainable and circular economy, etc. DIDs can also be assigned to an NFT where the NFT itself has no keys, but the owner of the NFT is the controller of its DID. When the ownership is transferred, the controller of the NFT DID also changes (this will be triggered through a smart contract).</p> Other Features of This Release  Service Endpoints <p>DIDs often need a way to communicate, like a subject DID needs to request a credential from the issuer DID. The issuer thus needs a way to publish its contact information like an HTTPS endpoint it should be reached on or its website. This is achieved by the issuer adding a "service" to its DID Document, which specifies this information. As alluded to before, only controllers of a DID can update the DID Document, thus adding the service endpoint. &nbsp;</p> Off-Chain DID Documents<br> <p>Another feature we have added is off-chain DID Documents. Until now, all things part of the DID document, like keys, controllers, and services, are stored on the chain. The logic to add/remove these is not clearly defined in the DID spec but is what looked like the most reasonable to us. But for users who would like a different set of rules for updating DIDs or adding more functionalities without waiting for us to build them can host their DID documents on another storage like IPFS or anything and only store the reference to the document like <a href="https://docs.filebase.com/storage-networks/ipfs/ipfs-cids">IPFS CID</a> or URL for the DID. &nbsp;</p> Improvements and Changes<br> <p>Lastly, the release contains several refactorings and improvements, which led us to introduce breaking changes, so please upgrade your applications at your earliest convenience.</p><p>For a more technical walkthrough of these features check out the <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_did.html">conceptual explanation</a> and the <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_did.html">hands-on example</a>.

 Enjoy the latest OWN Insights, by our Head of Operations, Cedric&nbsp;Ding. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article written by Cedric Ding, Head of Operations at Ontology.</p> The end of Web2 and&nbsp;Web3 <p>Since the birth of the concept of Web3 (Web3 in this article generally refers to a network form that confirms and empowers everyone’s data and assets through decentralized technology), some people regard it as the terminator of Web2. It’s as if Web2 is the wicked dragon and Web3 is the knight to save them. In their eyes, Web3 will eventually replace Web2. But in my opinion, this cannot and will not happen. Kevin Kelly has put forward a point of view called “candle economy”, that is, as long as it exists, it will not disappear with a high probability. Just like today, when electric lights are so popular, the production of candles is the highest in human history. In my opinion, the final outcome of Web3 and Web2 is coexistence, and the proportion of both is not small. They will probably exist in a state where there is a bit of them in each other, and Web3 may account for 20%, 50% or 80% of them. The process must be a two-way journey between Web2 and Web3. Web3 will be a tool that some people use when dealing with some things and some relationships.</p><p>Why do I have such an opinion? In a big way, all countries are a kind of centralized existence. The country grants people various rights through laws. When people encounter problems, they still need to be solved by the administrative departments and means of the government. Even blockchain-related issues, such as the recent bankruptcy of Three Arrows Capital, end up in legal action. I believe countries will use blockchain technology for efficiency, but I can’t imagine pure Web3 anarchy. Secondly, how many people are willing to suffer the inconvenience brought by Web3? A simple example is, how many people have the ability to keep the private keys of their wallets for a long time? In the world of Web2, you can retrieve your account in various ways, but in Web3, it is all up to&nbsp;you.</p><p>After we have the finale, we will explore how to implement Web3. I will discuss the organizational form, product form, and technology development.</p> Evolution of&nbsp;DAOs <p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are an emerging form of organization under Web3, but autonomous organizations are not. As social animals, human beings have established autonomous organizations from the very beginning, dividing labor for gathering, hunting, and distribution. In modern times, with the increase in human needs, such autonomous organizations have become richer and more subdivided. The establishment of autonomous organizations is bottom-up, and a group of people establishes organizations and divides labor for a common goal. The DAO adds the attributes of anonymity and transparency on the basis of the original autonomous organization and influences the decision-making and strategy of the project through voting on governance tokens. Finally, token holders can directly enjoy the benefits of the project. This sounds similar to a joint-stock company today, the only benefit is that the return of the token is guaranteed by the blockchain and contract, not bound by contract or corporate law.</p><p>One problem with DAOs is the efficiency of decision-making. The decision-making of DAO often requires full discussion and voting in the project community. This can be fatal for a start-up project. A core team may only need a 2-hour meeting to confirm something. In the DAO, it may take days or even weeks of discussions and votes to decide, during which the Team members are also required to expend effort into discussions and explanations. To make things even more troubling, many token holders are short-sighted, wanting to quickly benefit from the project and turn away. Another situation is that the project party itself is the largest holder of tokens, so the entire DAO will be a mere formality. In any case, such a DAO would do more harm than good for the project. In the practice of DAO, a good case may be MakerDAO. In the early stage of the project, the team decisively turned DAO into a centralized decision-making model to speed up the decision-making process to cope with the rapidly changing world. Once the project is more mature, the project will be divided into modules. It is gradually transformed into the form of DAO, and is managed by the community to meet the demands of most people. DAO should serve the project itself, and whether to adopt DAO should be judged by whether it can achieve the project goals more efficiently, and a more appropriate organizational form can be adopted at different stages of the&nbsp;project.</p> Product innovation and iteration <p>We all know that the issuance and circulation of project tokens is not equal to Web3, nor is blockchain technology equal to Web3. What can really realize Web3 is products and applications, and what can really make Web3 widely used is easy-to-use products. With the exception of fundamentalist Web3 geeks, the vast majority of user groups don’t use a product just because it’s labeled Web3. It must be a product that solves the user’s problem and has a better user experience than Web2 to attract a large number of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Coming to what problem Web3 can solve, unfortunately, most of the popular applications are currently only used to help users make money. It is true that products in financial scenarios are also the most widely used solutions at present. Whether it is payment transfer, exchange, loan or liquidity mining without any third-party approval, it greatly improves the efficiency of user assets. Although ironically, when you exchange fiat currency in OTC, you still hope that a third party will help you supervise your transaction partner to ensure the integrity of the transaction. Web3 can also solve the problems of trust, right confirmation, certification and reputation. Using the immutability and traceability of information on the chain, Web3’s products are an excellent solution to the above problems. One of the problems is how to ensure the authenticity of off-chain information when it is on-chain, otherwise credibility can only stay in the narrowest sense of on-chain information. More use of trusted data sources, optimized mechanisms and algorithms can solve this problem to a certain extent, and cooperation with Web2 data owners will also be involved in this process. My suggestion is that if there is an opportunity, cooperate first to form a product, and constantly solve user problems and iterate quickly in the process of cooperation. Increasing the degree of decentralization is only a way to better solve user problems, not an&nbsp;end.</p><p>We have a similar problem when it comes to making Web3 provide a better user experience than Web2, especially with games and social products. After being hot for a while, blockchain games and social products are thinking about what a real product should look like? Are Web3’s gaming and social products really meeting the needs of users before stimulating their use through token economics? The user experience is the same in the world of Web2 and Web3, because users are all human, and human nature is behind all interactions. Web2’s products have matured after 20 to 30 years of development, and Web3’s products should reduce the user’s learning cost as much as possible in the front-end experience and conform to the user’s operating habits. Of course, because of the combination of blockchain technology, Web3 products are extremely challenging in optimizing product experience. Another feasible path is for Web2-based products to move closer to Web3. For example, more and more Web2 products now support the use of wallet connections, and give more rights and interests according to the NFT held by the address. This is positive for Web3. For the Web3 project, this not only has an idea of ​​making products, but it also brings more competitors.</p> Technology and infrastructure support <p>In addition to the lack of “genius” inspiration, the lack of excellent products is also due to the fact that current technology cannot support such products. Blockchain technology is recognized as one of the important and necessary technologies to realize Web3. As the infrastructure and carrier of blockchain solutions, the public chain has always been one of the focuses of development, and the most widely used one is Ethereum. However, Ethereum has also faced a series of problems such as low throughput and high handling fees for a long time; the PoS upgrade has been repeatedly delayed, and the sharding is far away; the contract that has just passed the separation of ownership and usage rights has not yet been practically applied,&nbsp;etc…</p><p>Of course, in addition to the Ethereum chain, other public chains are constantly innovating and iterating, and new public chains are emerging one after another. Side chains, Layer 2, non-EVM, Meta systems, etc. have their own characteristics, so that projects need to choose a public chain. In choosing public chains, there are repeated tradeoffs. Among the many public chains, Ontology provides a complete set of infrastructure OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) to help projects realize the road to Web3 more quickly. The bottom layer of Ontology Chain is a public chain with high throughput (5000 transactions per second) and high compatibility (supporting 4 types of contracts). It is a platform suitable for various projects and developers. In addition, on the protocol layer, Ontology has a lot of protocols that are closely related to Web3, such as DID (ONT ID), data collaboration (POD), reputation (Orange), and trusted credentials, which have been implemented and can be directly used by developers. At the product layer, Ontology also provides a wealth of tools such as ONT Login, ONT TAG, Mercury, browsers, and various APIs/SDKs to help applications land. More importantly, Ontology has been committed to building a trust and collaboration infrastructure since its inception, and its accumulated rich experience can help Ontology go further on this road. It is believed that if developers and project parties use the entire OWN infrastructure to develop projects, they will achieve twice the result with half the effort on the road to realize&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In addition to blockchain technology, the realization of Web3 also relies on technological breakthroughs in privacy computing, 5G networks, zero-knowledge proofs, artificial intelligence, and other fields. Only when these technologies meet the needs of Web3, the corresponding applications will really&nbsp;explode.</p><p>The realization of Web3 is a long road, and we hope we can work together to usher in this&nbsp;day.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-the-realization-of-web3-5fb87980cee">OWN Insights 06: The Realization of Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Google the term ‘metaverse’ and you’ll see it’s a complex concept that people are still trying to pin down and define. It seems in the eight months since Facebook’s parent company rebranded as Meta and staked its claim on the future of social connection on the internet, we’re still a bit fuzzy on what the metaverse is, how we’ll get there, and what we’ll do when we arrive.</p>



<p>But the first thing you should know about the metaverse, even as it’s still emerging and being defined, is that the time to act is now. The metaverse is expected to contribute&nbsp;<a href="https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/insights/publishing/2022-the-potential-global-economic-impact-of-the-metaverse.pdf?fbclid=IwAR02cv2Qm2GDGEPGc-JGaU2TM_FCeOVxflqs-cfjvlHq5jM0XqsV1oKiNoQ">USD 3 trillion</a>&nbsp;to global GDP by 2013 and customers will expect immersive and interactive activities and apps from your brand. So, let’s see what’s possible.</p>



 What is the metaverse? 



<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/meaning-of-metaverse#:~:text=In%20its%20current%20meaning%2C%20metaverse,socialize%2C%20play%2C%20and%20work.">Officially</a>, the metaverse is&nbsp;“the concept of a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play, and work.”&nbsp;Meta means “transcending reality” so metaverse really means “transcending the universe as we know it.” Zuckerberg brought it back down to earth when he called the metaverse “the next chapter for the internet.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2022/07/18/the-ceo-guide-to-the-metaverse/?sh=33c81a4098ea">Forbes</a>&nbsp;defines the metaverse as “a virtual world where people can interact with each other and businesses entirely realistically. This revolutionary technology is made possible by a combination of virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>LeewayHertz CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/metaverse-use-cases-and-benefits/">Akash Takyar</a>&nbsp;goes further: “We must think of a three-dimensional web powered by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The metaverse is persistent, self-sustaining, infinite, interoperable, and in real-time, and these features are its key characteristics. Persistent means it exists regardless of the user’s physical presence. Infinite supports countless contemporary users and VR worlds. Self-sustaining means that users can earn within the metaverse and pay for their utility. Interoperability helps users move their virtual items, including avatars, from one metaverse project to another. Real-time allows users to relish live experiences.”</p>



<p>Entry to this shared virtual world is mostly via VR headsets right now, but smartphone access will be commonplace in future. In fact, some say it will be augmented reality (AR) and not VR that drives the metaverse forward and solves the physical separation and discomfort&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-metaverse-and-what-can-we-do-there-179200">issues</a>&nbsp;of VR headsets. AR&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/augmented-reality-AR">digitally enhances</a>&nbsp;the real world in real time, rather than takes us out of it, and this might appeal to more people.</p>



 The metaverse is a huge opportunity for business 



<p>The metaverse presents a vast profitable frontier for business. It’s where companies and customers can interact completely virtually and harness untold possibilities in immersive customer service, marketing, events and tourism, healthcare, research and training, and more. Geographical borders and physical environments are no barrier. Profits, customer loyalty and trust are massive benefits.</p>



<p>In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic showed us what’s possible for remote interaction and the concept has boomed. The global market for the metaverse is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/08/2458533/0/en/Metaverse-Market-Size-to-Worth-Around-USD-1-607-12-Bn-by-2030.html#:~:text=According%20to%20Precedence%20Research%2C%20the,50.74%25%20from%202022%20to%202030.">projected</a>&nbsp;to be worth around USD 1,607.12 billion by 2030. In the past year, the number of companies working in the space went from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2022/07/18/the-ceo-guide-to-the-metaverse/?sh=33c81a4098ea">200 to 500</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/metaverse-brands/">Visionary brands</a>&nbsp;such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Puma, Nike, Samsung, Hyundai, Coco-Cola, Adidas, Wendy’s, and Accenture are already using the technology for marketing, customer service, and training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re in business, now is the time to develop a metaverse strategy and embrace the new technology.</p>



 The metaverse will rely on decentralized identity and blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>Two new technologies will make widespread uptake of the metaverse possible:&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchain</a>.&nbsp;The metaverse will run its own&nbsp;<a href="https://business-reporter.co.uk/technology/the-metaverse-the-new-digital-economy">digital economy</a>&nbsp;with cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and participants will depend on digital proof of identity for gaining access (<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">verifiable credentials</a>). The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">digital wallet</a>&nbsp;will be essential for user control and seamless transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;recently told a blockchain event that decentralized identity is the most important use case for blockchain, and both are essential to the metaverse and Web3. LeewayHertz’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/metaverse-use-cases-and-benefits/">Askash Takyar</a>says:&nbsp;“With blockchain, enterprises can build decentralized and transparent solutions to provide digital proof of ownership, digital collectability, value transfer, and interoperability.”</p>

We invited Shrey, a well-known Microsoft Web3 researcher, who talked about “DID is striving to achieve four key goals: privacy, censorship resistance, interoperability with smart contracts, and self-management.”  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. He discussed Metaverse and NFTs with community members. The development of NFTs is inseparable from its strong scalability and plasticity. It is foreseeable that the development of Web3 will provide it with a wider range of application scenarios.  Ontology organized an AMA and invited community Harbinger <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560176905177137152?s=20&amp;t=VU7LwqSAdgPTeytaf8ZXlg">Dumont</a> to share his rich experience in Ontology staking and answer the questions encountered by community members.

Retailers that can identify their customers the moment they touch a digital property have the advantage of distinguishing themselves over others that can’t. These brands have the power to make every digital touchpoint personalized, secure, and frictionless and make it impossible for a shopper to stop engaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where customer identity can make a difference. When retailers use customer identity as the foundation for interacting with shoppers online, they are able to outpace their competition, grow their customer base, and boost revenues with tailored end-to-end shopping experiences that are simultaneously seamless and secure.</p>

<p>Digital financial experiences are becoming central to our lives. In a recent Mastercard poll, eight in 10 U.S. consumers reported using technology for financial tasks like paying bills, sending money to friends, checking or improving credit scores or applying for loans.</p>
<p>These are not mere conveniences, but tools that meaningfully impact people’s lives, providing them with more choice in financial services and more opportunities than ever before. Many of these innovations are made possible by open banking — technology that allows consumers and small businesses to permission their financial accounts’ data to the financial apps and services they want to use.</p>
<p>As digital payments continue to increase<a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-291-billion-payments-2021-led-major-gains-b2b-and-same-day-ach"> exponentially</a>, so will the flow of financial data between parties. The massive increase in digital financial experiences is underway, according to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrs2XBhDjARIsAHVymmQlHVjYG1NKP9FeIOCBY3yRGMa8eWw-_S17833WX-3V2PvgHLGRJiQaAk3cEALw_wcB">Rise of Open Banking report</a>, 93% of US consumers currently using technology to manage their money. Security is more important than ever and, to ensure privacy, consumers want transparency and more control.</p>
<p>Mastercard improves security through open banking by driving new technology innovation while meeting governmental regulations and helping to establish industry standards.</p>
<p>Trusted financial data aggregation platforms, such as Mastercard’s open banking, facilitate secure access to consumers’ permissioned data via traditional connections and APIs. However, there are additional technological and regulatory measures at work that add more layers of protection to consumers and small businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Here are some of the ways open banking keeps your customers’ financial data secure: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokenized Access 
<p>The industry is rapidly moving toward “tokenized” access. Also known as “Open Authorization” or “oAuth” connections, “tokenized” access involves providing an open banking platform with a “token” that is used as an access key rather than account credentials to access consumer-permissioned financial data.</p>
 Regulatory Movement 
<p>Across the globe, government regulations of consumer technology have emerged to protect people’s data from leaks, fraud or loss. For example, in the U.K. and Europe payment service providers must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> to provide certain open banking services. Only registered providers can access consumer bank accounts, and they require explicit consent from consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new technological advances are accompanying Open Banking regulations to further protect consumers and provide clear boundaries for innovators. For instance, a crucial component of Europe’s<a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/everything-need-know-psd2/"> PSD2</a> regulation is Strong Customer Authentication (<a href="https://nordigen.com/en/blog/psd2-sca/">SCA</a>), a tool that guarantees user ID verification. As a stronger form of multi-factor authentication, SCA requires that customers share something they know (i.e. password or PIN), something they own (their mobile phone’s unique identity) and a biometric (facial profile or fingerprint). SCA will not authorize a payment without two of these three factors.</p>
<p>There are also regulations being worked on in other regions.</p>
 Industry-Driven Technology Standards 
<p>Establishing common industry standards around security will also help open banking to more clearly define access and sharing of financial data. In North America, a cross-section of banks, fintechs and financial services groups have come together to form<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/FDX/About/FDX/About/About-FDX.aspx?hkey=dffb9a93-fc7d-4f65-840c-f2cfbe7fe8a6"> Financial Data Exchange</a> (FDX), a nonprofit aligned around a single data-sharing standard entitled<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial_Data_Exchange_Releases_FDX_API_5.0.aspx"> FDX API</a>. As an interoperable and royalty-free standard, the FDX API could accelerate the adoption of open banking API frameworks.</p>
<p>FDX adheres to<a href="https://www.finicity.com/the-finicity-perspective-whitepaper/"> five key principles</a> for data sharing – control, access, transparency, traceability and security. Taken together, these five principles prescribe how consumers can be empowered and protected via data sharing by giving them a better view into what is happening with their data, who is accessing their data and what consumers are getting from their data.</p>
 Data Access 
<p>To protect the security of customers’ data, Mastercard, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Finicity, takes additional steps. In the United States, Mastercard has direct bilateral agreements for data access with most of the largest financial institutions. Our open banking platform is guided by our<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/data-responsibility-and-inclusion/"> data responsibility principles</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When choosing an open banking platform for your fintech innovation needs, security is an important consideration.Our focus on building trust, stewarding data and driving choice have and will continue to drive how Mastercard looks to the future.</p>

				  Managing Trust and Reputation via Trust Registries  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>“Who can be trusted to establish, sustain, and approve registry members?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many potential answers to this question, and it’s essential to consider when determining who will be responsible for creating, maintaining, and validating the registry. Managing Trust and Reputation via <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> will be necessary for the future evolution of online ecosystems.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>To create trust between members of an ecosystem, one of the most critical functions is confirming that a particular entity is a member of the ecosystem and therefore bound by its <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/ecosystem-strategy/digital-governance/">governance framework</a>‘s terms and accountability requirements. Trust Registries (or Trust Hubs) fulfill this role. They can be implemented in many ways, from traditional centralized directory services to federated registries to fully decentralized ledgers. All of them can function as credential registries. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> – Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed.</p>
</blockquote> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>An Issuer creates every credential – so knowing how that Issuer’s authority is established is crucial. Otherwise, a crafty teenager will create a DMV that issues driver’s licences that “look real” (i.e. the Credentials validate cryptographically and have data that make sense). Further, they may even create a fake website that fools folks. But with the concept of a Trust Registry, their efforts would fail.</p>
<p>We’ll get to a more detailed description of a Trust Registry. Still, in this case, all a law enforcement officer’s Digital Wallet needs to know is the list of official DIDs from each province/state/federal authority it recognizes.&nbsp; In other words, a concise list that doesn’t change.</p>
<p>To get lists of the Issuers (e.g. the actual DMV), a Wallet will need to be aware of the concept of Trust Registries (aka Trust Hubs).</p>
 
 The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs. 
 
<p>A Wallet will need to know which Registries are to be trusted. Therefore, over time the community will need to have Trust Registries anchored by various means:</p>
 
 Legislative Authority. Many Vital Statistics and other government Issuers. They are authoritative due to their legislative authority. Examples of these include issuers of driver’s licences, hunting permits, building permits, passports, etc. 
 Community Authority. Some Trust Hubs will be created by communities, associations, etc., that exist through either a formal (similar to legislative) or de facto authority. Examples include a registry of licenced doctors; a registry of banks and credit unions; industry associations, local business improvement areas/chambers of commerce; etc. 
 Informal Authority. A Trust Hub should be able to exist with no formal authority. For example, we can imagine consolidated reputations (E.g. Uber &amp; Lyft combined; Yelp and TripAdvisor) that allow someone to aggregate reputation across platforms. It likely derives its authority from the larger community that “lends” its reputation to them. 
 
 Web of Trust 
<p>A Wallet’s Owner(s) needs to know that their Wallet is using the correct list of Trusted Issuers. Therefore a Wallet needs to be able to “explain” how it created the levels of Trust – and what anchored these trust levels. We can imagine the following chain of actions when we, as a homeowner, receive a bid folder from a renovation contractor:</p>
 
 We check our contractor’s business licence, which is anchored back to the province/state corporate registry. 
 We check their insurance certificate against a list of Issuers on a nationally maintained list of insurance companies – a trust registry. That list is anchored back to various province/state/federal registries that are the “source of truth” for insurance company establishment – another trust registry. 
 We check the training status of all of the company’s workers as they arrive to know that they have all the required certificates and training for the jobs that they are doing. 
 We check with the city to ensure our contractor is licensed to operate. The municipality maintains a trust registry of businesses. We back-check the city licence bureau against their master list of Issuer DIDs. The city has a master DID that signed that registry, pointing back to its legislative source of authority and the master list of municipalities for that province/state. 
 



Sovrin Web of Trust Model
The decentralized, non-hierarchical trust model defined by the Sovrin Governance Framework that combines a cryptographic trust layer achieved using the Sovrin Ledger, Agents and Connections with a human trust layer achieved via Credential Exchange. The Sovrin Web of Trust Model does not rely on a single root of trust, but empowers any Sovrin Entity to serve as a root of trust and enables all Sovrin Entities to participate in any number of interwoven Trust Communities, either informally or as defined by Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks. See the Sovrin Web of Trust Model white paper.&nbsp;


Sovrin Glossary



<p>That sounds like a lot of work, doesn’t it? Here’s the thing – we don’t have to do any of this ourselves. Our Digital Wallet should do this for us.</p>



STORY: A Home Renovation…



<p>Let’s imagine a home renovation project with three main groups to think about:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Homeowner 
 Contractor&nbsp; 
 City Inspector 
 
<p>Trust Hubs and Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are real. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is real. Their Digital Wallet needs to prove a few things:</p>
 
 That the Contractor was the entity to which the Insurer (the Issuer) gave the Credential. Done inside the Contractor’s Digital Wallet – it uses cryptography to prove that they still control the insurance Credential.&nbsp; 
 That the Insurer cryptographically signed the Credential. This allows the Homeowner to know that the information wasn’t tampered with. 
 That the Insurer is a bona fide insurance company. There will need to be a Trust Hub that lists insurers for a particular area for this to happen. 
 
<p>All of the above can be done in just a few seconds, and other checks can be made simultaneously. Each party involved has their own pieces of information that they need to verify.</p>
 
 Homeowner wants to know that they have the proper permits and licences for the job and that their contractor and employees are fully licensed, insured, and up to scratch. 
 Contractor wants to know that the Homeowner has the proper permits, licence, inspections and insurance. 
 City Inspector wants to know that the Homeowner and Contractor have the required permits, training, and other paperwork.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Paper-based approaches to verifying the above take long enough that few Homeowners ever do the checks they should. Our Digital Wallets can get all of them done in seconds – even while we are greeting each other.</p>

Because all Holochain apps inherently hold the code underlying SACs, any platform built on Holochain has the ability to follow the principles which we lay out in this article.</p><p>Despite this article's title, SACs would not do away with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) but rather provide a foundation for them to build on. DAO structures allow for action external to the collective of people making up the organization. They use contracts to form into an entity in the same manner as corporations, simply substituting legal contracts with smart contracts. Like other organizations a lot of their day-to-day activities happen outside the sphere of those contracts. In contrast, SACs allow for accountability and action internal to the group, across all platforms. This emphasizes the day-to-day while minimizing the role of contracts, only implementing them when strictly needed. </p><p>This article seeks to describe the main benefits of building decentralized organizations that follow the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.artbrock.com/2016/01/31/the-sovereign-accountable-commons">Sovereign Accountable Commons</a>. Starting with DAOs we consider where decentralized organizations using blockchains fall short of their aspirations, following we propose SACs as a potential solution, and finally we walk through the example use case of a community agreement and its evolution.</p> A Word on DAOs <p>DAO’s promise a way for individuals to collectively own and manage internet-native enterprises. Many speak of collaboration and community. They seek a future where everyone has the ability to access communities of their choosing and to lead lives as free agents, uninhibited by the rule of institutions, governments, and third parties. We applaud this drive for freedom. However, we often see DAOs fall short with their aversion to the messy parts of human organizing and community building. </p><p>The DAO’s external actions function autonomously via smart contracts based on votes, tokenomics, or the community’s other power distribution mechanisms. Internally though we often find a deficit in the community’s ability to manage conflict. Further, the reliance on coded and autonomous action creates an environment where the individual and the collective are estranged. Rather than a community, we find a collection of individuals in competition with each other for support of their ideas and motions. All this is embodied in the explicit trustlessness of on-chain operations. In contrast, the felt community and its day-to-day activities and decisions of many DAOs actually exists in the centralized off-chain world of forums and Discord channels, belying the very premise of these organizations. &nbsp;</p><p>SACs attempt to bridge this gap. Rather than pushing the hard parts of collaboration and organization to deterministic, coded solutions, we seek instead to use code-enhanced spaces and sense-making tools to support individuals in co-creating community and digging into the messy parts of human interaction.</p> What is a Sovereign Accountable Commons <p>Sovereign Accountable Commons are coded spaces following a set of fundamental principles in order to collectivize interaction, forming a space where the interests and actions of the individual and the collective don’t collide, but rather mutually reinforce each other.</p><p>As a structure implemented in a digital medium a SAC requires these fundamental properties: </p>  Mutually consented to rulesets which allow peers to operate in a context of equity and clarity.  Accountability via an uncapturable medium of communication and interaction.  The ability to walkaway (fork), with data held in common.  <p>Note that these three principles require each other in order to provide the desired outcome. Let’s examine these properties in more detail. </p><p>Communities begin simply as collections of individuals, which grow to be more than the sum of their parts because of their interaction patterns. Starting from the common ground of explicitly shared, transparent, mutually consented rulesets lays the groundwork for individual alignment with the group. Historically, the rules of physical social spaces have evolved to distribute power to particular people. They inequitably dictate who can speak when, who will be heard, and who will receive benefit. Breaking this equity failure for digital spaces requires a new capacity that begins with and maintains the ability to be explicit about the rules of engagement. </p><blockquote>Starting from the common ground of explicitly shared, transparent, mutually consented rulesets lays the groundwork for individual alignment with the group.</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Uncapturable mediums of communication</a> create the conditions for transparency. Think of sitting around a campfire. Everyone can speak and no one can snatch another’s words out of the air. To disrupt someone’s speaking you must speak over them; you must act openly in the public sphere. The exercise of power becomes transparent in the medium and thus makes it uncapturable. In contrast, we can see an example of capture with Amazon banning particular words in their warehouse worker’s internal communications in order to disable attempts at unionizing. The company and workers have asymmetric abilities to communicate and control information, and hold asymmetric relationships to the visibility of that control. </p><p>Accountability requires us to be able to tell accurate stories about what has happened, and everyone’s voices matter to attain that accuracy. SACs enforce individual’s accountability to each other and their community by having everyone sign everything they say and do, thus recording it in the public sphere. Similarly, because of the consent, transparency, and common-ground of the communications medium, the community becomes accountable to its individual members. If one member is treated unfairly, the community cannot hide it, not even from other communities. Accountability in SACs comes from:</p>  Provenance: knowing who said and did what. SACs achieve this through the signing of all speech acts similar to how transactions are signed on the blockchain.  Clarity: defining the meanings of particular words, actions, and community norms in order to enable the recording of not only what members say but what they mean.  Membranes: defining the borders of a community (processes of access and removal in the community, transparency of different information, etc.). The group holds both the barriers and affordances to cross between different spaces in common agreement. This provides a context for interaction.   <p>When a context no longer suits part of a community they also have the option of walkaway which helps to maintain consent through the right to disagree. Each member has the ability to fork the community or join another, taking their data and the public data of the community with them. A non-trivial action, we will explore community forking further in the upcoming article Walkaway or Why Forking Matters. </p><p>A SAC that maintains these fundamental properties can take many forms — chat applications or social media platforms come to mind as obvious examples because of the way this description of SACs focuses on social interaction. But a mapping application can benefit from the same principles, as can a film review site or any form of application we might term a “platform”.</p><p>DAOs can also benefit from these fundamentals. In order for these principles to apply across the entirety of the DAO, all digital activities of the organization should be performed on SAC compliant applications. This ensures continuity and keeps members accountable equally to what they post on the community forum as well as their votes on issues of treasury management. As all Holochain applications are inherently SAC compliant, DAO’s built on Holochain have easy access to these benefits.</p>SACs enable new possabilities for the individual (Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@blackodc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Su San Lee</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>) Benefits to the Individual: SACs for a Freer Society <p>We desire a freer society where everybody has the ability to choose their own work and right placement — freedom of action and association. With SACs we aim to create an underlying structure, a set of principles for systems of communication and organization in digital space, intended to allow greater freedom and to increase one’s ability to consent to relationships rather than being forced into them by the power of institutions. DAOs are, however, institutions. They are organizations of people who come together to do something collectively that no one person could do on their own. As we go on to describe, following the principles of SACs would allow for a more consensual environment as the proliferation of social spaces provides participants with alternative organizations.</p><blockquote>This fundamentally challenges the monopoly on the internet by large corporate players that dictate the terms of engagement</blockquote><p>In a SAC the rules of a community become clear, available to any, and mutually created/consented to. Because of this, people gain the ability to choose communities that suit their needs and avoid those that don’t. The capacity to easily create new communities through simple setup protocols and especially walkaway, will greatly increase the variety of communities to join. This fundamentally challenges the monopoly on the internet by large corporate players that dictate the terms of engagement. </p><p>This would lead to right placement: arrangements and relationships where individuals find alignment between their particular skills, desires, and the needs of their community. Sometimes we know more about what we don’t want than what we do want, so SACs can support the discovery process of moving people towards right placement through a combination of engagement and optionality. As communities would not have leverage to force anyone to do what they do not consent to, the pressure to work as a part of the community without the demand then acts to filter people into activities that bring them joy. </p><p>Similarly, to quote James Carse in his book Finite and Infinite Games: “Whoever must play, cannot play.” Thus, choice is a necessary precondition to play. SACs then aim to create room for play through the proliferation of choice and consensual engagement. The ability to collectively rewrite the rules intends to provide infinite spaces and iterations for play, while at the same time building particular contexts for creativity to emerge within. </p><p>Imagine a DAO built out of multiple apps running on these fundamentals. People would self-select into communities rather than out of them. With many options for other communities to select into, community members can actually consent to participate rather than having that participation be a necessity. And through an ease of customization, each person can use the version of the apps that they prefer, editing and augmenting as needed to create their ideal digital environment. Building a social space together as a shared commitment, groups can design an experience of meaningful work and community. Each part of the DAO would enable this because the whole structure constantly realigns towards these principles.</p>SACs help align people's needs and enable communities.

Foremost of these is accountability. The tools of provenance and clarity allow the community to mediate and work through disagreements that participants have with each other by finding shared meaning and intent behind the participant’s actions and statements. This transformative justice based response leads to healing rifts in the community. When membranes become involved it is to limit harm and if necessary remove a community member, but the system first acts to add clarity and create shared contexts.</p><p>Other tools, like those developed with <a href="http://emergingleaderlabs.org/Gameshifting_Overview">Gameshifting</a>, can be used in conjunction with SACs and aim to assist in setting the context of communication, allowing participants to signal their comfort and understanding in a conversation, shift through the different stages of a discussion, and determine the methods used to make decisions. </p><blockquote>Communities form out of active participation and interaction. By building shared meaning, communities define themselves.</blockquote><p>SACs seek to make the processes and context of discussion, decision, and community explicit. As addressed previously, the current DAO space views the technical processes as paramount and sees access to a platform equivalent to participation in a community. We see the inverse as true. Communities form out of active participation and interaction. By building shared meaning, communities define themselves. In a decentralized space, openingly accessible and editable rulesets, combined with the accountability of membranes, provide a path towards this sort of meaning making. Thus, these aspects of the technical system would provide a space for communities to work through the difficult social dynamics of being in relationship to each other. </p><p>We also find the double meaning of accountability important here. Not just accounting for the motion of tokens, but now also the interactions of speech and intent. The metaphor of accountability refers to both bookkeeping and storytelling. Through the development of non-monetary currencies, which tell stories about how resources get used, a DAO can go beyond market based methods for collectively managing resources. </p><p>Take a watershed for example. A DAO set up to manage water use over hundreds of miles will face difficulties if it only concerns itself with the amount of water which gets used, ignoring information about the how, where, and why. Water, a partially rivalrous good, is free to share, but mismanaging it hurts everyone using it. Broader ecological questions would also come into play, as would divisions of power and governance in subject specific matters based, for instance, on Indigenous groups’ ancestral claim to the land and its management. A DAO used for this purpose might need stricter membranes and governance systems; the DAO might also need to develop new ways of accounting, utilizing unique, shifting metrics for understanding water use. Clarity and consent as well as the evolvability of the community’s rules and organization enable all of this, from the development of metacurrencies to contextual distributions of power based not on token ownership but rather deeper social relationships and connections to particular issues.</p><p>Evolution serves as a useful metaphor across SACs. Because SACs utilize DNA-like grammars — code blocks that enmesh themselves to create particular contexts — communities and applications alike can grow and change as their macro-social context does. The coded grammar of the app/platform/DAO does not need to remain the same but can rather be added to, changed, or fractured off to create something new. While our watershed DAO might have more issues forking because of the relationships to power in meatspace, it can still evolve over time, for instance to account for new ways of measuring the ecological impact of a dam. The DAO does not have to bind itself to one currency or system of value because SACs maintain integrity even as they shift their protocols and methods of accounting.</p> Example of a Community Agreement in Flux: <p>Let’s quickly consider how SACs help to mediate and enable the merging of protocols and social processes. <br><br>A community can define any number of governance methods for different processes depending on their needs, but SACs always require a few key stages for the editing of their rulesets in order to maintain consent and clarity. Define: the stage of initial proposal and proposition to the community. Refine: the stage of edits and adaptations, whatever the community input mechanism. Align: final decision making and enactment of the new rules, whether determined by consensus, a representative vote, or otherwise. This outlines a standard that defines the process the community uses to edit standards and forms the base for all other governance in the community. The recursivity embedded in this structure allows the social and the protocolary to coexist and maintain their flexibility. </p><blockquote>In order to collectively remedy the issue, the community does not punish either member for the conflict but rather starts a process to mediate their misunderstanding and to develop greater clarity for the future.</blockquote><p>Take the hypothetical example of a community that set in their initial charter the phrase “we will treat all members with respect”. Sometime later a member accuses another of treating them disrespectfully. Documentation of their interactions is available for all to audit, but there remains a lack of clarity on what respect entails. Perhaps cultural understandings of respect clash, each participant working from different traditions of what constitutes “appropriate manners.” In order to collectively remedy the issue, the community does not punish either member for the conflict but rather starts a process to mediate their misunderstanding and to develop greater clarity for the future. This starts with defining what respect means and what it means to act towards each other with respect. This initial definition would then be refined through community input, perhaps in this case particular input coming from discussions with the members in conflict to rectify the confusion that initiated their dispute. Other input might come from a comment period or a survey managed by predefined parties. Finally the community either accepts or rejects the proposal in the alignment phase. These stages focus on the social, but translate that process to effect code. Whatever the social governance process, the accountability mechanisms of SACs keep the system secure.</p> Conclusion <p>To sum up, we see Sovereign Accountable Commons as a set of principles that ensure clarity and accountability within and across platforms. DAOs, in particular, have the opportunity to benefit from these principles and their corresponding protocols because they allow for interactions and assurances previously only possible with in-person organizing. By allowing DAOs to move beyond protocolary design, we can bring the social contexts of community into digital governance. </p><blockquote>By allowing DAOs to move beyond protocolary design, we can bring the social contexts of community into digital governance.</blockquote><p>We see SACs as an infrastructure that equally benefits the individual and the organization. By working to align the mutual goals of those two parties, SACs minimize the effects of conflict while emphasizing its benefits. By creating a container for mediated conflict, communities can safely engage in productive iteration. As communities evolve, individuals can seek out right placement, doing the work that best benefits the community while also being personally fulfilled. </p><p>While built from a limited set of base principles, SACs open up many new areas of inquiry and design. Stay tuned for upcoming articles on Soft DAOs, the art of forking, uncapturable carriers, and more.</p>

<p>In today’s digital landscape, the people of India contribute significantly to digital transactions and the resultant data generation. However, until now, there is no formal framework for managing this data, and the ownership, privacy, security, and consent that comes with&nbsp;them.</p><p>All that will likely change with the introduction of a new technology standard called ORGANS. In particular, ORGANS enables individuals to give their consent for using their data in a specific way. In addition, it empowers individuals to own their data and selectively share it with just the entities they want, thereby preserving their data’s privacy and security.</p><p>Read on to know all about the ORGANS standard and how it can change the way companies collect data from individuals.</p> What is the ORGANS Framework? <p>ORGANS is an acronym&nbsp;for,</p>  O -&gt; Open Standards  R -&gt; Revocable by individuals  G -&gt;&nbsp;Granular  A -&gt; Auditable  N -&gt; Notice to all parties&nbsp;involved  S -&gt;&nbsp;Secure  <p>Let’s talk a bit about each of these attributes.</p> Open Standards <p>Interoperability is a crucial building block as it enables different systems and organizations to “talk” to each other and better process the information that flows through them. This interoperability is essential in our current Web 2.0 and future Web 3.0 apps because it enables data to be shared easily across systems. When all organizations embrace the open standards envisioned in ORGANS, data flow and usability will be seamless.</p> Revocable <p>Data privacy is all about putting individuals in control of their data. With ORGANS, every user can determine their data usage and, more importantly, enjoy the choice to revoke access to their data&nbsp;anytime.</p> Granular <p>Personal data comes in many forms, from email addresses to employment letters. Users must have the option to selectively share only data that’s pertinent for a specific use case. For example, if a user has to submit proof of age to enter a nightclub, then date of birth alone is enough. The user doesn’t even have to share their first and last&nbsp;name.</p><p>This ability to share just the required data is an essential part of preserving the data privacy of individuals.</p> Auditable <p>The data shared by individuals should be readable by humans and machines for quick, easy, and cost-effective verification. Also, the organization collecting the data can store the confirmations in secure records/logs (machine and human-readable form) for easy reference and auditing.</p> Notice <p>ORGANS advocates transparency and accountability in data sharing and handling. To this end, ORGANS emphasizes sending notices to all concerned parties if data changes, is revoked,&nbsp;etc.</p> Secure <p>Any application built on the ORGANS framework must be secure by design. Though ORGANS doesn’t lay down specific technologies for implementing security, it’s safe to say that many next-gen technologies like verifiable credentials fit this requirement.</p><p>In a nutshell, ORGANS is a framework for creating applications that promote data ownership, privacy, and security.</p> What does ORGANS mean for&nbsp;you? <p>You may wonder how ORGANS can change your data privacy and security as a user. Simply put, you go from accepting the terms and conditions of an online service to determining what data organizations can use, for how long, and for what purpose. As a result, you create and share portable digital identities and credentials while staying in control of your data continuously.</p><p>Source: NITI</p><p>From an organization’s standpoint, building applications based on ORGANS can be a game-changer for your business. These futuristic applications not only put data privacy at the heart of your operations, but can also help you earn the trust of your customers. Not to mention that such applications will meet future compliance standards and can, overall, provide a competitive advantage for your organization.</p> Affinidi’s Consent&nbsp;Manager <p>Affinidi’s Consent Manager follows the ORGANS principles to empower you to create consent policies and handle your customers’ consent for using your services and applications.

  Like many other countries, digitization is a strategic priority in Germany, where there is a concerted effort to digitize public services. German banks and insurance companies are also digitalizing their customer journeys. Other organizations need to do the same, or risk losing competitive advantage in the digital era.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>I am often asked “does using a cloud service alter risk?” I always reply to this question with “well it depends”. Every organization has its own set of circumstances, and the answer needs to take these into account. It is also important to think about how the responsibility for security is shared between the service provider and the customer. This blog outlines the core business risks and what organizations need to consider.</p>
 Business Risks 
<p>While much discussion focusses on the technical risks, at the business level there are three distinct cyber risks, and using cloud services can have an impact on all of these.</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – the more organizations depend upon their IT services, the greater the impact any service outage or cyber incident will have. 
 Data breaches – data is now the most important business asset, and any loss of intellectual property or sensitive and regulated data will have a serious impact. 
 Compliance failure – organizations are now faced with a wide range of obligations coming from a tidal wave of regulation and legislation. Failure to comply with these will lead to sanctions. 
 
 IT Service Infrastructure 
<p>Poorly secured service infrastructure can result in all of the above business risks, and securing that infrastructure against all the potential risks is challenging. The large cloud service providers have the skills and resources to secure their infrastructure to a level beyond that possible for many enterprises. <br>For example, many small businesses run their IT services in environments with poor physical security. They may have little or no control over physical access or protection against fire and floods, and disruptions to the power supply or communications networks. This is described eloquently in a presentation by Mark Evans entitled: The reasons why RLB moved to the cloud. All the major cloud services provide their services from datacentres with strong controls over all of those aspects.&nbsp; <br>However, there is still a residual risk because <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU">some cloud services have been impacted</a> by disruptions, and the customer always needs to consider this.</p>
 Data Confidentiality 
<p>Data is the most important business asset of the modern enterprise and needs to be protected against unauthorized access and changes. Its confidentiality and integrity can be compromised while it is in transit, in storage, and being processed, and using cloud services places all three of these outside of the customer’s direct control. <br>Organizations must evaluate these risks based on the sensitivity of their data and ensure that it is appropriately protected both on premises as well as in the cloud. Organizations using cloud services should protect their sensitive and regulated data using certified strong encryption algorithms and implement strong controls to protect the encryption keys. Cloud services must provide capabilities to help their customers protect their data as well as supporting the various technologies that the customers may adopt.</p>
 Data Resilience 
<p>Loss of access to your business data would have a severe impact. The prevalence of ransomware attacks has emphasized the need for data resilience. In addition, the changes in working patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic have also increased organizational dependency on cloud services.&nbsp; <br>There is a temptation to believe that the use of a cloud service removes the need for the customer to consider the resilience of their data. The responsibility for data held in cloud services is shared between the tenant and the service provider, and there are many situations where the tenant is responsible for the resilience of their data. For example, while many cloud services promise very high levels of data resilience, these do not cover the data being deleted by the customer. <br>Whether or not you use a cloud service you need to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80762/cloud-backup-and-disaster-recovery">back up your data</a> and have a<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/incident-response-management"> tested disaster recovery plan</a>.</p>
 Service Access Management 
<p>Controlling which people and which devices can access your assets is a fundamental security control. It is your responsibility to control access to your business services and data, whether or not, they are held in the cloud. This is an essential part of a Zero Trust approach. <br>Virtualized services such as those delivered from the cloud add a new challenge in this area. The virtual service elements need access to each other and the service infrastructure, and failure to manage this can lead to data breaches. An example of this led to a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/capital-one-to-pay-190m-settlement-in-data-breach-linked-to-seattle-woman/#:~:text=Capital%20One%20Financial%20agreed%20to,and%20stole%20their%20personal%20information.">data breach and a large financial penalty</a>. <br>Many organizations have mature processes and technologies in place to manage access to their on-premises services. However, these may not be well integrated with their use of cloud services. This is especially important in the area of privilege management.</p>
 Privilege Management 
<p>Managing IT services uses <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80636/privileged-access-management">accounts with privileged access</a>, and it is vital to control these. These accounts are the targets of cyber attackers – since they provide a route into the organization’s IT infrastructure. They can be misused by insiders, and even a simple mistake can have a severe impact on the business-critical service. <br>The cloud service provider needs these accounts to manage their service and there are concerns that these could be used to access the cloud customers’ assets. In particular, there are concerns that governments could legally demand that the cloud service provider turn over their customers’ data. This is effectively the risk underlying the Schrems II judgement.&nbsp; <br>In addition, where many departments with a large organization use the same cloud service, there will be many local administrators. The scope of these administrators’ privileges should be limited to prevent malice or mistakes from affecting other parts of the service.</p>
 Complexity 
<p>The more complex the system, the more difficult it may be to protect. One argument for using a cloud service is that it provides a consistent environment and together with application modernization using containers it reduces complexity. Unfortunately, most organizations now have a hybrid environment using multiple clouds as well as on premises delivery of business applications. <br>This hybrid environment is even more complex because each cloud has its own security model and associated tools. According to the <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR">Cloud Migration Stats - 2022 Flexera State of the Cloud Report</a> the top challenges are trustworthiness with security, risk and compliance as well as cost management. These challenges stem from the added complexity from the multiple environments.&nbsp; <br>Organizations need to adopt a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/security-fabric-modernizes-cybersecurity">security fabric</a> paradigm to assist with this complexity.</p>
 Transparency 
<p>For highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals the issue is transparency of cloud service controls. In these industries, it essential to be able to prove the existence and effectiveness of controls to demonstrate compliance. Currently it is not practical for the large CSPs to allow tenants to audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations. This is an inhibitor to the take up of cloud services in these sectors. <br>Cloud service providers will need to provide much greater transparency around their controls. This should be done in a way that allows an organization using the service to map both their own controls and the controls in the service to their compliance obligations. This should ideally be automated, for example through APIs, in a way that allows compliance to be monitored in near real time. Some cloud vendors are moving towards this to meet <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/a-sovereign-cloud-is-about-more-than-just-privacy">cloud sovereignty </a>obligations.</p>
 Summary 
<p>The business risks associated with the use of cloud services depend upon several factors. The cloud is only one service delivery model in today’s complex hybrid, multi cloud IT environment. Organizations should consider at least the aspects described above in their own context. KuppingerCole can provide advisory services to help find the best approach for your organization.

 Keeping abreast of the different EU online gambling rules and requirements can be confusing, time-consuming, and incredibly expensive. Here’s how IDV solutions can help organizations easily follow multiple countries’ compliance regulations. 



<p>The popularity of online gambling continues to rise, despite the introduction of diverse and increasingly complicated regulations, and severe risks surrounding identity fraud.</p>



<p>In the UK, it comprises nearly <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/taking-a-more-in-depth-look-at-online-gambling">40% of the overall gambling market</a>, while in Europe online gambling is growing at <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/behind-the-success-of-the-growing-european-online-gambling-market-301187049.html">around 10% per year</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/resource-post/european-online-gambling-key-figures-2021-edition/">European Betting &amp; Gaming Association (EBGA)</a>, the market value of online gambling is expected to reach more than €29.3 billion by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>The recent increase in online gambling can be explained by a) the Covid effect, increasing the time people spend online, and b) <a href="https://1883magazine.com/biggest-european-casino-trends-for-2022/">technological advancements</a> that enable gamblers to bet anytime, anywhere.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/a-wintertime-world-cup-and-its-impact-on-online-betting/">Qatar World Cup 2022</a> coming up, and hundreds of new online casinos opening every single day, the rapid increase in online gambling shows no signs of slowing.</p>



<p>However, gambling operators have a balancing act to handle when it comes to offering frictionless onboarding processes, maintaining high conversion rates, and meeting all licensing requirements.</p>



 Regulations, risks, and rewards 



<p>As there is no uniform legislation in the EU that governs gambling services, each member state is autonomous and free to regulate how they see fit. For example, some countries allow all types of gambling, while others <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe">restrict certain forms</a> such as only permitting poker or casino games, for example.</p>



<p>Keeping abreast of regulatory differences can be confusing, time-consuming, and expensive. Some of the most common gambling regulations concern age limits, which means verifying the age of players is essential in preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>. There are also specific national and regional laws that gaming operators must follow. Find out more in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">overview of both the EU &amp; UK Online Gambling Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>The rewards for capitalizing on this growing market are extraordinary (an industry expected to be worth over <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460420/0/en/Online-Gambling-Betting-Market-Worth-USD-172-23-Billion-by-2030-Growth-Size-Share-Revenue-Drivers-Trends-Opportunities-Challenges-Top-Players-Regional-Analysis-Types-Applications.html#:~:text=Online%20Gambling%20%26%20Betting%20Market%20Worth%20USD%20172.23%20Billion">US$172 billion by 2030</a>), however, the risks are high as well.</p>



<p>As with many online platforms, online gambling poses an increased risk of fraud and security breaches than traditional gambling as criminals have set their sights on this industry. They have been known to set up fake online casinos or hack the mainline casinos to steal sensitive information.</p>



<p>There are also additional social responsibility concerns with online gambling, as it is considered to be a <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/new-study-shows-online-gambling-more-addictive-casino-gambling">much more addictive</a> form of gambling, due to the increased likelihood of it turning into a habitual part of a consumer’s everyday life, like watching television.</p>



<p>Online gambling can also be used to launder money, with criminal gangs choosing online platforms to transfer money anonymously.</p>



<p>Operators must therefore adhere to online gambling regulations to not only protect their customers, but their organization from being exploited for criminal purposes. If they do not, they run the very real risk of fines, or even being banned from the marketplace.</p>



<p>Commenting on the recent <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/online-operator-leovegas-fined-gbp1-2-million">£1.32 million fine</a> of gambling operator, LeoVegas, Leanne Oxley, Gambling Commission Director of Enforcement and Intelligence, said, “We identified this through focused compliance activity, and we will continue to take action against other operators if they do not learn the lessons our enforcement work is providing.</p>



<p>“This case is a further example of operators failing to protect customers and failing to be alive to money laundering risks within their business.”</p>



<p>LeoVegas was found to have exhibited social responsibility failures, including not setting an enforced 45-minute break following six hours of use, and anti-money laundering failures, such as financial triggers for anti-money laundering reviews being too high.</p>



 







 Need for speed 



<p>With so many regulatory risks associated with online gambling, it is understandable if gambling operators decide to cash in their chips and focus on a different line of business.</p>



<p>Businesses that do enter the online gambling market, and comply with regulations, are also often plagued by sluggish UI, and poor customer experience. In fact, <a href="https://egr.global/compliance/news/report-up-to-30-of-online-gambling-customers-abandon-sign-up-process/">research</a> shows that 30% of online gamblers have abandoned the onboarding process when registering a new account with a gambling website due to its complicated sign-up processes.</p>



<p>The importance of offering a fast and smooth, multi-jurisdictional, and KYC-compliant onboarding experience cannot be overstated. As every potential customer needs to be verified before being allowed to gamble, players will no doubt flock to the website or gambling platform that can verify their information the quickest. This need for speed is becoming increasingly important in both the KYC, and online gambling arenas. If player onboarding is too complicated, or has too many hurdles, organizations run a real risk of <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/online-gambling-authentication-security-digital-identification/">significant drop-off</a>.</p>



 How to leverage IDV and KYC for a better and safer online gambling experience 



<p>Although it may seem overwhelming, implementing a robust KYC procedure should be seen as an opportunity to offer a better and safer customer experience, and the first step in a productive working relationship between an ID verification company and online gambling operator.</p>



<p>This partnership can help operators meet the many challenges associated with verifying customers’ identities, while ensuring their users practice <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gaming</a>. It can also help in perhaps one of the most crucial aims of IDV: fraud prevention.</p>



<p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">the UK saw an increase of 43% in online gambling fraud</a>, and, since fraudulent gambling activity spikes during major sporting events, now is the time to implement a KYC procedure, before the Qatar World Cup 2022.</p>



<p>IDnow offers a seamless onboarding process, reducing verification times and increasing compliance with all major European regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, for example, uses artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents, with a key focus on security.</p>



<p>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s solutions have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages. IDnow can be trusted to deliver security, support, engagement with regulators, and the prospect of global scalability.</p>



<p>Leveraging IDV and KYC will allow gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience, which is a win-win, for the business and the consumer.</p>

<p>The work of Mydex CIC has been recognised by the Community Interest Company Regulator in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-interest-companies-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022/cic-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022">latest Annual&nbsp;Report</a>.</p><p>The report notes how CICs have grown in vision and ambition, demonstrated resilience over the pandemic and branched out into many new and unexpected fields. Some, including Mydex, are now thinking at an international level.</p><p>To highlight these developments the Report also includes case studies that illustrate this expanding vision and ambition. One of them is from Mydex CIC. It&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>Mydex CIC will be turning 15 years old this year. In our time, many people have been surprised to discover we are a CIC as we don’t fit their expectations of what a ‘normal’ CIC looks like, for many&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, our mission revolves around digital technologies and, specifically, personal data. Our goal is to empower citizens with their own data by providing them with personal data stores that enable them to collect, use and share their own data independently of the organisations that traditionally collect data about us. We operate at the cutting edge of new technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, unlike many CICs which operate locally, to fulfil our mission we need to operate at scale — providing personal data stores to every citizen in the country&nbsp;… and, as we grow, across many countries. Our ambitions are both national and international.</blockquote><blockquote>Thirdly, we don’t just provide front line services. We are building data storage and sharing infrastructure that could become a part of how the entire economy works. Our mission is long-term, unfolding over decades, not just&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the way we do good is multifaceted. We don’t only help individuals protect their privacy; we enable social inclusion, use data to tackle social problems such as poverty, and redress the balance of power between citizens and global data behemoths. We are also helping to unleash economy-wide economic benefits — reducing the costs that both citizens and service providers incur in collecting and using personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>So why, given these differences, do we think CIC status is important? One strategically vital reason is that in our field of personal data, demonstrating trustworthiness is essential to achieving our mission. It’s easy for organisations to make high-falutin’ statements about ‘consumer empowerment’ or ‘privacy protection’. Legally embedding such things into everything you do is a different matter.</blockquote><blockquote>A second reason follows. When push comes to shove, our society and economy rests on two main types of enterprise: companies seeking to maximise their profits and organisations that rely on subsidies from one source or another. Huge untapped opportunities lie between these extremes, with viable, sustainable enterprises that cover their costs, are not reliant on handouts and may make a profit — but whose main function and impact is to maximise positive external social and economic benefits. We believe that the CIC model allows us to point to the potential of a new and different economic model, and we are glad to be a part of&nbsp;it.</blockquote> The missing&nbsp;middle <p>In its report, the Regulator notes that over 26,000 CICs are now operating in the UK. They’re beginning to impact the way the economy works. But their potential impact reaches much further than this — into the very way we think about economics itself.</p><p>In Mydex’s view, society’s current understanding of what makes an enterprise economically successful is both wrong and damaging. Stated simply, this understanding is that an enterprise’s economic success is measured by the profits it&nbsp;makes.</p><p>A moment’s thought soon reveals this to be nonsense. Take two insurance companies. One is a Mafia-front for a protection racket. It charges its ‘customers’ an insurance premium, a name given to the extortion people have to pay the Mafia for not burning their houses or workplaces down. The other is a genuine insurance company, working hard with its customers to reduce fire risk and paying out if a fire takes&nbsp;place.</p><p>The Mafia outfit is fabulously profitable but leaves misery and destruction in its wake. The genuine company is far less profitable but helps avoid destruction and alleviates misery. Which entity makes the greatest economic contribution? The Mafia one, because it has highest accounting profit?</p> Real results are always on the&nbsp;outside <p>The particulars of this example are deliberately extreme to make the point. But they illustrate a universal truth: the economic results of an enterprise are always experienced and measured by what happens outside its organisational boundaries.</p><p>To understand the economic contribution that any enterprise makes, we need to assess the degree to which it sustainably improves human lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. The test of an electricity company’s economic success is not how much profits it makes, but how efficient and effective it is at providing sustainable electricity to all who need it. The test of a motor car company’s economic success is how efficient and effective it is at providing its customers with safe mobility. The test of a hospital’s economic contribution is how efficient and effective it is at healing the&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Note two crucial things about&nbsp;this.</p>  None of these external results are measured in terms of money. They are measured in terms of life: access to energy, mobility, health.  How much money profit an enterprise makes — an artefact of invented accounting conventions that focus only on the inside of the organisation — is unrelated to how successful it is at “maximising positive external social and economic benefits”, as we put it in the CIC Regulator’s report.  <p>Our current society seems to be organised around a comprehensive denial of this basic economic fact. It leaves us with a soul-sapping ‘choice’ between profit maximising enterprises whose real economic contribution is often questionable or even negative, and activities that need to be subsidised — but with nothing addressing the missing&nbsp;middle.</p><p>Would we have our current cost of living and climate crisis if energy companies’ purpose was to make energy available safely and affordably, rather than maximising profits for shareholders? In the midst of a drought, UK water companies are wasting a trillion litres of water through leaky pipes while managing to organise 775,704 separate occasions of dumping sewage into England’s rivers — a feat that apparently cost them six million hours of work to organise. In recent years, they have also managed to pay out more than £72bn in dividends to shareholders. Does that make them economic successes or economic failures?</p><p>An enterprise doesn’t have to deliver maximum profits to outside investors to be economically viable and to make a positive economic contribution. If it earns enough to cover its costs, it is financially sustainable. After that, its real economic success is the degree to which it finds a way to improve peoples’ lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. It’s this missing middle where the big opportunities lie.</p><p>Mydex is proud to be a CIC, and proud to be recognised as making a contribution by the CIC Regulator. In our view, the CIC philosophy of earning money in order to make a social and economic contribution is the only positive, sustainable philosophy to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>No matter what its formal legal status happens to be, every company should be a community interest company, and its performance should be judged in this&nbsp;way.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/should-all-companies-by-community-interest-companies-a49fc9f3e9ba">Should all companies be Community Interest Companies?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
