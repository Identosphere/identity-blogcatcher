<p>In another devastating blow to data privacy, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T has disclosed a massive breach involving the personal records of over 73 million current and former customers. The compromised data, spanning names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, and account information, has surfaced on the dark web - a cybercriminal's paradise.</p><p>As AT&amp;T grapples with this crisis, the incident lays bare the vulnerabilities of centralized data storage systems employed by most major corporations. Holding troves of personal data in concentrated databases creates an enticing target for bad actors, jeopardizing the privacy and security of millions.</p><p>This is where decentralized identity solutions pioneered by the Bloom team come into play. By leveraging cryptography, Bloom eliminates the need to centrally store personal data, giving individuals full control over their information through self-sovereign digital identities.</p><p>With Bloom's decentralized approach, there is no honeypot of personal data for hackers to target. Instead, users manage their own encrypted data and share only verifiable credentials when needed, such as proof of identity or credit history. This selective disclosure minimizes the risk of mass data leaks.</p><p>In the wake of AT&amp;T's breach, customers are being advised to vigilantly monitor accounts and credit reports. However, had AT&amp;T utilized Bloom's decentralized model, the compromised data would be severely limited, if exposed at all. Eliminating centralized data storage reduces the attack surface and potential impact of breaches.</p><p>The Bloom ecosystem empowers users to own and fully control access to their personal information through blockchain-based identities and verifiable credentials. This capability could have prevented the indiscriminate exposure of 73 million AT&amp;T customer records.</p><p>As data privacy and security risks escalate, centralized data stores are becoming an outmoded, unacceptable liability. Bloom's decentralized identity solutions represent a paradigm shift - one that severs the reliance on centralized databases and transitions identity ownership to users themselves.</p><p>In today's digital landscape, the question is not if, but when, the next major company will suffer a crippling data breach. Widespread adoption of innovative, user-centric solutions like Bloom's decentralized identity is crucial to halt the onslaught of data privacy crises. The path forward involves empowering people with full ownership and control over their personal data through blockchain-enabled decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Even the best organizations face challenges about the scale and scope of governance and efficient streamlining of their resources across the enterprise. These challenges can lead to a frustrating, fragmented and disjointed developer experience.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, different groups of developers within the organization inevitably bring different views about what one centralized code-base and tooling set should look like. It is crucial to align these different, well-meaning standards, while enabling our developers to cross silos and organizational boundaries to gain efficiencies. A developer portal like Backstage can help.&nbsp;</p>



 <a></a>The power of a developer portal 



<p>The power of Backstage lies in the organization that it can bring to your software development lifecycle. It acts as an abstraction layer to the complexity of provisioning and deploying microservices that are both consistent and&nbsp;compliant. From specifying business units, domains, teams and other information about your developer landscape, Backstage can start associating those resources together. Those associations happen regardless of where the code might live. Different repositories? No problem. Different EMUs? No big deal. If you can express the structure of your organization to Backstage using its easy-to-learn taxonomy, Backstage will help you tame complexity, bringing organization to your developer teams.</p>



<p>Organizational boundaries between developer teams might make dependencies seem opaque, but because Backstage expresses those relationships automatically inside its system, there’s no more worrying about loose ends. Backstage will map out the picture for you in an intuitive way. Infrastructure teams no longer need to lose time to constant custom provisioning requests from disparate groups; the menu is right in front of everyone.</p>



<p>The reasons for adopting a developer portal include:</p>



 
 Centralized tooling by providing one spot to access and use tooling. 



 Improved collaboration with a shared environment for accessing, sharing and managing software components. 



 Enhanced discoverability of components and resources for reuse, reducing duplication of work and creating more consistent practices. 



 Standardization by providing templates and best practices for service creation. 



 Automation and integration&nbsp; for routine tasks through integration with various CI/CD and monitoring tools, including through a growing community of plug-ins. 



 Visibility and governance into the software development lifecycle through insight to project status, dependencies and more. 



 Developer experience through simplification in project management, collaboration with team members and access to tooling that promotes higher productivity and job satisfaction. 
 



 <a></a>GitOps for repo data 



<p>Backstage allows developers and teams to express the metadata about their projects from yaml files. Those yaml files are written to look like Kubernetes resources, so developers can quickly and easily create them. Since the yaml files are versioned(because they’re in Git), this also means they always should express the most current information about your repos. Now, imagine the scenario where a project is consolidated into another project. For Backstage, this is no problem. Because the Backstage yaml files (which have the information about the project) become part of the normal release cycle, as your code is updated, so is Backstage.</p>



<p>By putting our Backstage configuration into the repository and making it a normal part of the release cycle, updates to Backstage happen almost automatically. This automation of &nbsp;updating documentation and advertising &nbsp;gives time back to the developers. This leads to increased developer productivity and seamless organizational communications.</p>



 <a></a>Backstage as a proxy 



<p>Another great feature is how Backstage manages microservices. Instead of consuming existing APIs, Backstage can act as an API proxy .</p>



<p>Backstage’s API functionality helps bridge the gap between microservices. Imagine that an application is made of five different microservices. Backstage can put all those behind an API proxy, which will help present them as a single microservice. This is like APIGEE or APIM, but “in-house.” Rather than paying a cloud to host that proxy for you, you can move that proxy into Backstage and present it as a single product.</p>



<p>This also helps with microservices that are spread across two different clouds. Instead of maintaining two sets of routable endpoints to compose one application, Backstage will help present a “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/single-pane-of-glass">single pane of glass</a>” to people who want to use your services.</p>



<p>The gain here is that Backstage now smooths over the presentation of the proxy. Have you ever sat and waited for a firewall ticket to be opened, or a service account to be created? Or have you had your services broken because one of the many APIs it depends on changed versions? Hosting an API proxy in Backstage will solve these issues for you, letting you focus more on development.</p>



 <a></a>The benefits of templates 



<p>Backstage also offers templates that help accelerate development. Not only do templates advertise best practices and standards that your org has adopted, but Backstage also helps developers get started by creating repositories for them. Templates can also codify workflows.</p>



<p>If your organization has a workflow where developers can create new Kubernetes clusters in the “Dev Project,” Backstage will empower developers to build their environments without having to learn about Terraform. Templates can also be used to interface with workflows because templates are written in Typescript. Complex workflows can be captured in templates, such as requiring a Service Now ticket to be in an approved state before allowing the deployment.</p>



<p>Instead of having a developer perform hours of rework because the project did not meet organizational standards, the template functionality in Backstage can ensure the repository is created correctly. Backstage templates also save developer time by decomposing changes and workflows into easy-to-consume forms.</p>



 <a></a>Why care about developer efficiency? 



<p>While this post discusses just a handful of practical examples of how IBM® can drive efficiency gains in your enterprise through internal developer portals like Backstage, it’s hard to question the impact developers can have on a business:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Developers have the potential to raise <a href="https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/developer-coefficient">global GDP by USD 3 trillion</a> over the next decade. This potential stems from their role as force-multipliers in the technology sector, emphasizing the importance of leveraging <a href="https://waydev.co/software-engineering-efficiency/">existing software engineering</a> talent effectively to spur economic growth and innovation.  
 



 
 Access to skilled developers is increasingly seen as a constraint to company growth, more so than access to capital. <a href="https://adtmag.com/articles/2018/09/10/developer-survey.aspx">Among over 1,000 C-level executives surveyed</a>, 55% cited access to talent as a constraint, with software engineers (53%) mentioned more often than access to capital (52%). 
 



 
 <a href="https://adtmag.com/articles/2018/09/10/developer-survey.aspx">On average</a>, developers spend 13.5 hours of their 41.1-hour work week addressing technical debt and an additional 3.8 hours fixing bad code. This results in a significant productivity loss, with nearly $85 billion wasted annually worldwide due to the time spent on bad code and maintenance issues. 
 



<p>With IBM, you can empower your developers and bring standardization and efficiency to your software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>The rising interest in the calculation and disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions has thrown the spotlight on emissions calculation methods. One of the more common Scope 3 calculation methodologies that organizations use is the spend-based method, which can be time-consuming and resource intensive to implement. This article explores an innovative way to streamline the estimation of Scope 3 GHG emissions leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to help categorize financial transaction data to align with spend-based emissions factors.</p>



 Why are Scope 3 emissions difficult to calculate? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/scope-3-emissions">Scope 3 emissions</a>, also called indirect emissions, encompass greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that occur in an organization’s value chain and as such, are not under its direct operational control or ownership. In simpler terms, these emissions arise from external sources, such as emissions associated with suppliers and customers and are beyond the company’s core operations.</p>



<p>A 2022 CDP <a href="https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/reports/documents/000/006/918/original/CDP-Supply-Chain-Report-2022.pdf?1678870769">study</a> found that for companies that report to CDP, emissions occurring in their supply chain represent an average of 11.4x more emissions than their operational emissions.</p>



<p>The same study showed that 72% of CDP-responding companies reported only their operational emissions (Scope 1 and/or 2). Some companies attempt to estimate Scope 3 emissions by collecting data from suppliers and manually categorizing data, but progress is hindered by challenges such as large supplier base, depth of supply chains, complex data collection processes and substantial resource requirements.</p>



 Using LLMs for Scope 3 emissions estimation to speed time to insight 



<p>One approach to estimating Scope 3 emissions is to leverage financial transaction data (for example, spend) as a proxy for emissions associated with goods and/or services purchased. Converting this financial data into GHG emissions inventory requires information on the GHG emissions impact of the product or service purchased.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models">US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO)</a> is a lifecycle assessment (LCA) framework that traces economic and environmental flows of goods and services within the United States. USEEIO offers a comprehensive dataset and methodology that merges economic IO analysis with environmental data to estimate the environmental consequences associated with economic activities. Within USEEIO, goods and services are categorized into 66 spend categories, referred to as commodity classes, based on their common environmental characteristics. These commodity classes are associated with emission factors used to estimate environmental impacts using expenditure data.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-eora-mrio-multi-region-in">Eora MRIO (Multi-region input-output)</a> dataset is a globally recognized spend-based emission factor set that documents the inter-sectoral transfers amongst 15.909 sectors across 190 countries. The Eora factor set has been modified to align with the USEEIO categorization of 66 summary classifications per country. This involves mapping the 15.909 sectors found across the Eora26 categories and more detailed national sector classifications to the USEEIO 66 spend categories.</p>



<blockquote>However, while spend-based commodity-class level data presents an opportunity to help address the difficulties associates with Scope 3 emissions accounting, manually mapping high volumes of financial ledger entries to commodity classes is an exceptionally time-consuming, error-prone process.</blockquote>



<p>This is where LLMs come into play. In recent years, remarkable strides have been achieved in crafting extensive foundation language models for natural language processing (NLP). These innovations have showcased strong performance in comparison to conventional machine learning (ML) models, particularly in scenarios where labelled data is in short supply. Capitalizing on the capabilities of these large pre-trained NLP models, combined with domain adaptation techniques that make efficient use of limited data, presents significant potential for tackling the challenge associated with accounting for Scope 3 environmental impact.</p>



<p>Our approach involves fine-tuning <a href="https://youtu.be/Beh13Cd_QbY?si=6K4-aX1lVxrIAwri">foundation models</a> to recognize Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EEIO)&nbsp; commodity classes of purchase orders or ledger entries which are written in natural language. Subsequently, we calculate emissions associated with the spend using EEIO emission factors (emissions per $ spent) sourced from <a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-supply-chain-greenhouse-g">Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries</a> for US-centric datasets, and the <a></a><a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-eora-mrio-multi-region-in">Eora MRIO (Multi-region input-output)</a> for global datasets. This framework helps streamline and simplify the process for businesses to calculate Scope 3 emissions.</p>



<p>Figure 1 illustrates the framework for Scope 3 emission estimation employing a large language model. This framework comprises four distinct modules: data preparation, domain adaptation, classification and emission computation.</p>



Figure 1: Framework for estimating Scope3 emissions using large language models



<p>We conducted extensive experiments involving several cutting-edge LLMs including roberta-base, bert-base-uncased, and distilroberta-base-climate-f. Additionally, we explored non-foundation classical models based on TF-IDF and Word2Vec vectorization approaches. Our objective was to assess the potential of foundation models (FM) in estimating Scope 3 emissions using financial transaction records as a proxy for goods and services. The experimental results indicate that fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significant improvements over the zero-shot classification approach. Furthermore, they outperformed classical text mining techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, delivering performance on par with domain-expert classification.</p>



Figure 2: Compared results of different approaches



 Incorporating AI into IBM Envizi ESG Suite to calculate Scope 3 emissions 



<p>Employing LLMs in the process of estimating Scope 3 emissions is a promising new approach.</p>



<blockquote>We embraced this approach and embedded it into IBM® Envizi™ ESG Suite in the form of an AI-driven feature that uses a NLP engine to help identify the commodity category from spend transaction descriptions. </blockquote>



<p>As previously explained, spend data is more readily available in an organization and is a common proxy of quantity of goods/services. However, challenges such as commodity recognition and mapping can seem hard to address. Why?</p>



 
 Firstly, because purchased products and services are described in natural languages in various forms, which is why commodity recognition from purchase orders/ledger entry is extremely hard. 



 Secondly, because there are millions of products and service for which spend based emission factor may not be available. This makes the manual mapping of the commodity/service to product/service category extremely hard, if not impossible. 
 



<p>Here’s where deep learning-based foundation models for NLP can be efficient across a broad range of NLP classification tasks when availability of labelled data is insufficient or limited. Leveraging large pre-trained NLP models with domain adaptation with limited data has potential to support Scope 3 emissions calculation.</p>



 Wrapping Up 



<p>In conclusion, calculating Scope 3 emissions with the support of LLMs represents a significant advancement in data management for sustainability. The promising outcomes from employing advanced LLMs highlight their potential to accelerate GHG footprint assessments. Practical integration into software like the IBM Envizi ESG Suite can simplify the process while increasing the speed to insight.</p>

 Addressing challenges of the energy transition with grid asset management 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/business-operations/sustainably-accelerating-decarbonization/">energy transition</a> is gearing up to full speed as renewable energy sources replace fossil-based systems of energy production. The grid itself must green to operate within the <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/esg-frameworks">environmental, social and governance</a> (ESG) objectives and become carbon neutral by 2050. This shift requires energy utility companies to plan their grid asset management holistically as they find a new balance between strategic objectives.</p>



<p>Sustainable asset performance has become one of the key drivers in decision-making for asset planning and grid modernization business processes. New emerging technology enables AI-powered digital twins to operate the smart grid. However, operators must balance intermittent renewable energy intake to produce a controlled, stable output.</p>



 A balanced transition between old and new systems 



<p>The demand to fulfill existing long-term contracts and an abundance of new demands for industrial electrification pose new challenges to grid management. Finding the right balance requires load forecasting and simulation to prevent net congestion. Economical optimization must factor in new market dynamics and ensure reliable operation.</p>



<p>Existing network assets are aging, and more intelligent asset management strategies must emerge to maintain and replace the grid within tightening budgets. Asset investment planning must find a balance between these systems while minimizing risk and carbon footprint.</p>



<p>To manage the grid of the future, utility companies must shift from traditional asset management to a holistic approach. This shift will broaden insights so these companies can take strategic, tactical steps to optimize operational network development and operation decisions.</p>



 Asset lifecycle management 



<p>Holistic grid asset management adopts a lifecycle view across the whole asset lifespan to obtain a safe, secure, reliable and affordable network. Utility companies must break down the internal departmental walls between the silos of grid planning, construction, operation, maintenance and replacement to allow end-to-end visibility. They must connect underlying technology systems to create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/single-pane-of-glass">single pane of glass</a> for all operations. A shared data model across operating systems serves as the basis for integration, simulation, prediction and optimization by using generative AI models to drive next-level business value.</p>



<p>The goal of asset management is to optimize capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) in a seamless transition between the timescale of the planning horizons. The following figure demonstrates the complex planning and optimization objectives required for a holistic view of the asset management lifecycle:</p>







<p>A top-down strategic approach for whole-life planning of asset investment portfolio matching future ESG goals needs to connect with a bottom-up maintenance and replacement strategy for existing assets. Asset investment planning (AIP) results in project portfolio management and product lifecycle management to plan, prioritize and run asset expansion and replacement projects within the boundaries of available budget and resource capacity.</p>



<p>Real-time operational data provides an asset health view that drives condition-based maintenance and replacement planning. This is the domain of enterprise asset management (EAM) for maintenance execution and asset performance management (APM) for strategy optimization. Traditionally, a disconnect at the tactical level has separated these planning and optimization methodologies. At the same time, operational risk management requires respecting health, safety and environment (HSE) management and process safety management to manage potentially hazardous operations. The maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) spare parts strategy must align with the asset strategy in terms of criticality and optimal stock value.</p>



<p>Acknowledgment of the complexity of planning with multidimensional objectives on different timescales is the starting point for adopting a holistic view of asset management.</p>

  <p>Microsoft Entra is not only the identity system for users; it’s also the identity and access management (IAM) system for Azure-based services, all internal infrastructure services at Microsoft, and our customers’ workload identities. This is why our 99.99% service-level promise extends to workload identity authentication, and why we continue to improve our service’s resilience through a multilayered approach that includes the backup authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we introduced the backup authentication system, as an industry-first innovation that automatically and transparently handles authentications for supported workloads when the primary Microsoft Entra ID service is degraded or unavailable. Through 2022 and 2023, we continued to expand the coverage of the backup service across clouds and application types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’ll build on our <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fadvancing-azure-active-directory-availability%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7Cf42f60520e8241d6f48108dc4d11a2a1%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638469985375289828%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=4E80MYl8uCYinrptGG1ZUiGZpkrpO9zGTiT8PDAWJsQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">resilience blogpost series </a>by going further in sharing how workload identities gain resilience from the regionally isolated authentication endpoints as well as from the backup authentication system. We’ll explore two complementary methods that best fit our regional-global infrastructure. One example of workload identity authentication is when an Azure virtual machine (VM) authenticates its identity to Azure Storage. Another example is when one of our customers’ workloads authenticates to application programming interfaces (APIs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Regionally isolated authentication endpoints&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regionally isolated authentication endpoints provide region-isolated authentication services to an Azure region. All frequently used identities will authenticate successfully without dependencies on other Azure regions. Essentially, they are the primary endpoints for Azure infrastructure services as well as the primary endpoints for managed identities in Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview">Managed identities for Azure resources - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a>). Managed identities help prevent out-of-region failures by consolidating service dependencies, and improving resilience by handling certificate expiry, rotation, and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer of protection and isolation does not need any configuration changes from Azure customers. Key Azure infrastructure services have already adopted it, and it’s integrated with the managed identities service to protect the customer workloads that depend on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How regionally isolated authentication endpoints work&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each Azure region is assigned a unique endpoint for workload identity authentication. The region is served by a regionally collocated, special instance of Microsoft Entra ID. The regional instance relies on caching metadata (for example, directory data that is needed to issue tokens locally) to respond efficiently and resiliently to the workload identity’s authentication requests. This lightweight design reduces dependencies on other services and improves resilience by allowing the entire authentication to be completed within a single region. Data in the local cache is proactively refreshed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regional service depends on Microsoft Entra ID's global service to update and refill caches when it lacks the data it needs (a cache miss) or when it detects a change in the security posture for a supported service. If the regional service experiences an outage, requests are served seamlessly by Microsoft Entra ID’s global service, making the regional service interruption invisible to the customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Performant, resilient, and widely available&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service has proven itself since 2020 and now serves six billion requests per day across the globe.&nbsp; The regional endpoints, working with global services, exceed 99.99% SLA. The resilience of Azure infrastructure is further protected by workload-side caches kept by Azure client SDKs. Together, the regional and global services have managed to make most service degradations undetectable by dependent infrastructure services. Post-incident recovery is handled automatically. Regional isolation is supported by public and all Sovereign Clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure authentication requests are processed by the same Azure datacenter that hosts the workloads along with their co-located dependencies. This means that endpoints that are isolated to a region also benefit from performance advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Backup authentication system to cover workload identities for infrastructure authentication&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For workload identity authentication that does not depend on managed identities, we’ll rely on the backup authentication system to add fault-tolerant resilience.&nbsp; In our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advancing-service-resilience-in-azure-active-directory-with-its-backup-authentication-service/">blogpost</a> from November 2021, we explained the approach for user authentication which has been generally available for some time. The system operates in the Microsoft cloud but on separate and decorrelated systems and network paths from the primary Microsoft Entra ID system. This means that it can continue to operate in case of service, network, or capacity issues across many Microsoft Entra ID and dependent Azure services. We are now applying that successful approach to workload identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup coverage of workload identities is currently rolling out systematically across Microsoft, starting with Microsoft 365’s largest internal infrastructure services in the first half of 2024. Microsoft Entra ID customer workload identities’ coverage will follow in the second half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting your own workloads&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of both regionally isolated endpoints and the backup authentication system are natively built into our platform. To further optimize the benefits of current and future investments in resilience and security, we encourage developers to use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and leverage managed identities whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to assure our customers that our 99.99% uptime guarantee remains in place, along with our ongoing efforts to expand our backup coverage system and increase our automatic backup coverage to include all infrastructure authentication—even for third-party developers—in the next year. We’ll make sure to keep you updated on our progress, including planned improvements to our system capacity, performance, and coverage across all clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At our latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EGK57wwHfs&amp;t=1027s">Microsoft Ignite event</a>, we announced and demonstrated new capabilities within Microsoft Entra Internet Access, an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solution capable of converging all enterprise access governance in one place. These capabilities unify identity and network access controls to help eliminate the security loopholes and manageability created by using multiple security solutions. This helps protect enterprises against malicious internet traffic and other threats from the open internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to all internet resources, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Microsoft 365 apps with an identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we highlight the advantages of Entra Internet Access’ web content filtering capabilities that work across all web-based internet resources and SaaS applications by leveraging the unified policy engine: Entra ID Conditional Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Conditional Access policies to the internet 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access extends the contextual sophistication of Conditional Access policies to enterprise SWG filtering. This enables you to&nbsp;apply granular web filtering for any internet destination based on user, device, location, and risk conditions​.&nbsp;The ability to&nbsp;apply different filtering policies​ (and in the future, threat protection policies, DLP policies, and more)&nbsp;based on various contexts and conditions is critical to address the complex demands of today’s enterprise. Bringing identity and network context together to enforce granular policy through Conditional Access is what makes Microsoft Entra Internet Access the first identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Filter web content to reduce attack surface&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access offers extensive web content filtering to prevent access to unwanted web content for enterprise users, using our client connectivity model, available for both Windows and Android platforms. We’ll soon add support for other OS platforms and branch connectivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">web category filtering</a>, you can create policies using an extensive repository of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/reference-web-content-filtering-categories">web content categorization</a> to easily allow or block internet endpoints across categories. Category examples include liability, high bandwidth, business use, productivity loss, general surfing, and security, which includes malware, compromised sites, spam sites, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide even more granular application layer access control, you can create policies with ​​<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </a><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">filtering</a> to identify specific endpoints to allow or block through standalone policy configuration or add exceptions to web category policies with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra Internet Access, internet filtering policies are more succinct, readable, and comprehensive, helping to reduce the attack surface and simplifying the administrative experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Web content filtering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Proactively set conditional security profiles&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security profiles make it easy to create logical groupings of your web content filtering policies (and in the future, treat protection policies, DLP policies, and more) and assign them to Conditional Access policies. Additionally, security profiles can also be organized with priority ordering, allowing imperative control over which users are affected by web content filtering policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Security profile Conditional Access integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how that works. Let’s say only your finance department should have access to finance applications. You can add a block finance web category policy to your baseline profile (priority 65000) which is applied to all users. For the finance department, you can create a security profile (priority 200) that allows the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to the finance group. Because the security profile for allow finance is a higher priority than the baseline profile, the finance department will have access to finance apps. However, if a finance department user risk is high then their access should be denied. So, we create an additional security profile at a higher priority (priority 100) that blocks the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to users with high user risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Security profile priorities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our 2023 Ignite release reflects Microsoft’s desire to make your job easier by offering you a fully integrated security service edge (SSE) solution, including SWG, ​​Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection, Cloud Firewall, Network ​Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Microsoft Threat Protection capabilities. This is the first of many incremental milestones on our journey to help you protect your enterprise and your people. </p>

<p>The Discord Community Dynamics Challenge, centered around Ocean Protocol’s Discord server, provided a platform for an in-depth analysis of community interactions and their impact on essential ecosystem metrics, including the $OCEAN token price. The challenge, Spanning 1,645 days of data, began with the first server entry from ‘sheridan_oceanprotocol’ on August 20, 2019, and extended to the most recent contribution by ‘wanderclyffex’ on February 20, 2024. The dataset encompassed 84,754 entries, of which 15,696 were from GitHub bot feeds related to Ocean Protocol’s GitHub Page updates, covering various aspects of community engagement.</p><p>Key elements of each entry, such as channel, author ID, author, date, content, attachments, and reactions, were examined, along with daily $OCEAN token price data from May 4, 2019, to March 7, 2024. Participants explored the correlation between community activities and the $OCEAN token’s valuation, providing a comprehensive view of the server’s dynamics.</p><p>The challenge uncovered diverse trends and patterns across different timescales and categories, revealing insights into the community’s behavior and interests. Rankings, leaderboards, and categorization studies provided insights into the dynamics of community groups and interactions. Thematic discussions were analyzed to identify recurring topics and questions, highlighting the community’s interests.</p><p>Notable outcomes of this challenge are the development of a scam alert analysis procedure and a classification model capable of predicting next-day server statistics, utilizing historical data from the past three days or one week. Participants presented critical findings supported by visual narratives and in-depth discussions. They clarified the approaches and techniques, concluding with suggestions for future technological advancements, such as creating specialized Discord bots and AI assistants to enhance community server experiences.</p> Winners Podium <p>The top submissions for this challenge were outstanding. Participants displayed exceptional skills in leveraging AI and ML models to reveal the complexities of digital community interactions and their impact on the crypto market. The top three submissions are distinguished by their analytical depth, innovative approaches, and insightful predictions.</p><p>Dominikus Brian — 1st&nbsp;Place</p><p>Dominikus’ study on the Ocean Protocol Discord Server analyzed 84,754 entries over 1,645 days, integrating this with the daily $OCEAN token price to examine community engagement and market trends. The research involved a detailed temporal analysis of user activities to identify high-engagement periods, correlating these with significant cryptocurrency events. A key component was sentiment analysis, aiming to link the tone of community discussions with fluctuations in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p><p>The study also categorized users based on activity levels, identifying key community influencers. A significant technical achievement was developing a RandomForest classification model for scam detection. Additionally, the team employed machine learning models for predictive analysis, forecasting server statistics, and token prices. This approach showcased the potential of combining community data analysis with advanced AI techniques to gain insights into digital community behavior and its potential impact on market&nbsp;trends.</p><p>Anamaria Loznianu — 2nd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Anamaria conducted a comprehensive analysis, beginning with preprocessing a dataset of 84,754 records. She meticulously cleaned the dataset, removing irrelevant messages and bot interactions and extracting features like word and character counts and user reactions. After processing, she reduced the dataset to 30,883 entries spread across 17 columns, providing a rich source for analysis.</p><p>She first explored the general trends in the community, identifying patterns and outlier periods of high activity. This analysis revealed a significant upward trajectory in message volumes over time, suggesting an active and expanding community. She also conducted correlation studies between the $OCEAN token price and server metrics. However, these correlations showed weak relationships, suggesting that other factors might be more influential in server activity.</p><p>Owais Ahmad — 3rd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Owais’ report provides an in-depth analysis of the Ocean Protocol Discord Community, focusing on how the community’s interactions contribute to the advancement of data economy and Web3 vision. The study begins by examining the fluctuations in message volume from 2021 to 2024, revealing significant spikes in activity during certain months, indicative of the community’s evolving engagement. By analyzing different Discord channels, Ahmad identified the most popular ones and observed variations in their activity levels, reflecting the community’s diverse interests and responses to specific events or campaigns.</p><p>The approach involved looking at raw numbers and considering engagement quality, such as the days of the week when members are most active. The analysis also examined the correlation between the $OCEAN token price and community communication patterns. While noting a mild correlation, relying on message volume as a consistent predictor of token price movements was considered insignificant.</p> Interesting Facts  Scam Reports&nbsp;Analysis <p>The studies showed a somewhat even distribution of scam reports throughout the day, with a peak around 23:00, suggesting that scammers might target users during late-night hours. There was no definitive pattern across days of the week, although there was a slight inclination towards the beginning of the week for scam activities.</p> General Trends and&nbsp;Patterns <p>The Ocean Protocol Discord server saw rapid activity growth from 2019 to 2022, with a peak in the summer of 2022 and a decline in 2023. Data revealed user activities were more prominent from April to August than in other months. Notably, there was a record-breaking surge in user activity in early July 2022, likely due to the launch of Ocean V4 (“Onda”) and the Ocean Data Bounty&nbsp;program.</p> Correlation between $OCEAN Token Price and Server&nbsp;Metrics <p>There was a noticeable correlation between the $OCEAN token price and specific server metrics. Sentiment value and average word count per message were the most correlated metrics, with a positive Pearson correlation of 0.63 and 0.46, respectively. An increase in positive sentiment value often preceded a rise in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p> Technical Inquiries and Sentiment Analysis <p>The community shows a significant interest in technical aspects. This enthusiasm is evident in the many inquiries about blockchain, innovative contract development, and other technical issues. General information and price-related inquiries also showed varying degrees of sentiment.</p> Channel Popularity <p>The ‘General Chat’ and ‘Welcome’ channels were the most active, with more than 11,000 and 5,000 messages sent by 646 and 856 unique users, respectively. It demonstrates that these channels are vital hubs of community interaction.</p> 2024 Championship: <p>Each challenge offers a $10,000 prize pool divided among the top 10 participants.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>This blog is the second part of the vLEI Demystified series. <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series outlines different stakeholders, their roles, and six types of credentials that are involved in the trust chain and the foundational structures of the vLEI ecosystem. This part delves deeper into the qualifications and verification procedures that persons representing these organizations have to go through prior to the issuance of vLEI credentials.</p> Overview of vLEI Identity Verification <p>Before participating in the vLEI ecosystem, including obtaining and issuing vLEI credentials, the representatives of all organization stakeholders must undergo rigorous identity verification processes to confirm their legal identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Legal identity is defined as the basic characteristics of an individual’s identity. e.g. name, sex, place, and date of birth conferred through registration and the issuance of a certificate by an authorized civil registration authority following the occurrence of birth. [Ref: <a href="https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]">https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]</a></blockquote><p>With some exceptions, authorized representatives of each organization stakeholder are responsible for performing identity verification on representatives of organizations downstream within the vLEI trust chain. That is, GLEIF verifies qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), QVIs verify legal entities (LEs), and LEs verify role representatives, as shown&nbsp;below.</p>The vLEI trust&nbsp;chain<blockquote>Note: The authorized representatives are the persons designated by an organization (either GLEIF, a QVI, or a legal entity) to officially represent the organization.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: There are two types of role representatives: official organization role (OOR) and engagement context role&nbsp;(ECR).</blockquote> GLEIF Authorized Representative (GARs) <p>GARs are controllers of the GLEIF Root AID, GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA), and GLEIF External Delegated AID&nbsp;(GEDA).</p><p>As the root of trust of the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF established an internal process to verify their GARs, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-12-16_verifiable-lei-_vlei_-ecosystem-governance-framework-gleif-identifier-governance-framework_v1.0_final.pdf">GLEIF Identifier Governance Framework</a>. This includes:</p>  The policies and processes for the genesis events of the GLEIF Root AID, GIDA, and&nbsp;GEDA  Detailed identity verification process of all GARs where they mutually authenticate each&nbsp;other  Contingency plans such as a designated survivor policy as well as restrictions on joint travel and in-person attendance of meetings.   Designated Authorized Representative (DAR) <p>DARs are representatives authorized to act on behalf of a Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) or an&nbsp;LE.</p>  Identity verification on a QVI’s DAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  Identity verification on an LE’s DAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.   Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs) <p>A QAR is a representative designated by a QVI’s DAR to carry out vLEI operations with GLEIF and&nbsp;LEs.</p>  Identity verification on a QAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-identifier-governance-framework-and-vlei-credential-framework_v1.3_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Identifier Governance Framework and vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs) <p>An LAR is a representative designated by an LE’s DAR to request the issuance and revocation of LE vLEI credentials and Role vLEI credentials.</p>  Identity verification on an LAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Role Representatives (OOR and ECR&nbsp;Persons) <p>A role representative, either an OOR or ECR person, is designated by an LAR to represent an LE in a functional or official organization role, respectively. The identity verification process for a role representative depends on whether an authorization vLEI credential is used, see <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series for more&nbsp;detail.</p>  In the case where an authorization vLEI credential is used, identity verification on a role representative is performed by both a QAR and an&nbsp;LAR.  In a case where an LE issues a role vLEI credential directly without using an ECR authorization vLEI credential, identity verification of an ECR person needs to be performed by only a&nbsp;LAR.  <p>This process is detailed in the following documents:</p>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-authorization-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorization vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-official-organizational-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Official Organizational Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-engagement-context-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Engagement Context Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>   Identity Verification Processes <p>The identity verification process of all representatives in the vLEI ecosystem includes two subprocesses namely:</p>  Identity Assurance Process, which verifies the veracity and existence of a legal identity, as well as binding the legal identity to a representative  Identity Authentication Process, which binds the representative to an autonomic identifier (AID)  <p>Once the identity verification process is completed, a vLEI credential may be subsequently issued to the AID that has been bound to the representative.</p>Illustration of the identity verification process Identity Assurance <p>The first stage of identity verification for the vLEI ecosystem is called identity assurance. This step involves an identity proofing process to verify the legal identities of all individuals prior to obtaining vLEI credentials. The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) requires that Identity Assurance is performed according to Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) as defined in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A</a>.</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized the identity proofing process in their Special Publication (SP) 800–63A. Although originating in the United States, SP 800–63A is one of the most influential standards for identity proofing and is widely referenced by various industries and governments worldwide.</p> Identity Assurance Level <p>NIST SP 800–63A has categorized the degrees of assurance in one’s identity into 3&nbsp;levels:</p>  Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1): The service provider is not required to validate or link the applicant’s self-asserted attributes to their real-life identity.  Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): Either remote or physical identity proofing is required at this level. The applicant’s submitted evidence supports the real-world their real-world identity and verifies that the applicant is accurately linked to this identity.  Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): Physical presence is required for the identity proofing process at this level. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained service provider representative.  <p>Only IAL2 is relevant in the context of the vLEI&nbsp;EGF.</p> Identity Resolution, Validation, and Verification <p>Identity proofing in NIST SP 800–63A consists of three main components, namely:</p>  Identity Resolution: a process for uniquely distinguishing an individual within a given&nbsp;context.  Identity Validation: a process for determining the authenticity, validity, and accuracy of the identity&nbsp;evidence  Identity Verification: a process for establishing a linkage between the claimed identity and the person presenting the identity evidence.  <p>For example, an applicant for a vLEI credential could present a verifier with a set of required identity evidence. The verifier must resolve the applicant’s legal identity and validate that the presented information on the collected evidence is legitimate. Validation may involve confirming the information with an authoritative source and determining that there is no alteration to the images and data of the presented evidence. Subsequently, the verifier may verify the applicant by comparing the applicant’s live image with the one displayed on the provided identity evidence.</p> Identity Evidence Collection <p>During identity resolution and validation, the collection of “identity evidence” is required to establish the uniqueness of the individual’s identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Identity evidence is defined as information or documentation provided by the applicant to support the claimed identity. Identity evidence may be physical (e.g. a driver’s license) or&nbsp;digital.</blockquote><p>To comply with IAL2, one of the following sets of identity evidence must be collected:</p>  a piece of STRONG or SUPERIOR evidence if the evidence’s issuing source confirmed the claimed identity by collecting at least two forms of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence before and the service provider validates the evidence with the source directly; OR  two pieces of STRONG evidence; OR  one piece of STRONG evidence plus two pieces of FAIR&nbsp;evidence  <p>NIST SP 800–63A defines five tiers of identity evidence’s strength: UNACCEPTABLE, WEAK, FAIR, STRONG, and SUPERIOR. While the strength of specific identity evidence, e.g., a driver’s license, may vary across jurisdictions, NIST provides <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/resolution/">examples of common evidence</a> and their estimated strength, based on their general quality characteristics, for instance:</p>  SUPERIOR: passports and permanent resident&nbsp;cards  STRONG: driver’s licenses and U.S. military ID&nbsp;cards  FAIR: school ID cards and credit/debit cards  <p>Further details on the ​​strengths of identity evidence can be found in Section 5.2.1 on the NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A.</p> Identity Authentication <p>After completing identity assurance, an organization representative who applies for a vLEI credential may proceed to identity authentication, which establishes a connection between the representative — whose legal identity has been assured to meet IAL2 — to an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>.</p><p>Once such a connection has been established, a vLEI credential could be issued to the AID with confidence that the representative is the sole controller of the AID. Subsequently, the representative may cryptographically prove their control over the AID and the issued vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: An autonomic identifier (AID) is a persistent self-certifying identifier (SCID) that is derived and managed by cryptographic means without reliance on any centralized entity or distributed ledger technology.</blockquote> Credential Wallet&nbsp;Setup <p>Before identity authentication can begin, a credential wallet must be set up for the organization representative. The primary role of a credential wallet includes:</p>  Creation, storage, and management of key&nbsp;pairs  Creation, storage, and management of&nbsp;AIDs.  Digital signature creation and verification  <p>The specification for a credential wallet is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-technical-requirements-part-1-keri-infrastructure_v1.2_final.pdf">Technical Requirements Part 1: KERI Infrastructure</a>. The credential wallet must also be used during the live Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) session to complete the identity authentication process.</p><blockquote>Note: A credential wallet for vLEI credentials is essentially a KERI-compatible identity wallet. It must be compliant with three specifications currently being developed under the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation, namely, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/#go.draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC</a>, and <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> specifications.</blockquote> Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI)&nbsp;Protocol <p>The identity authentication process is implemented using the Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol, which is a protocol defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#out-of-band-introduction-oobi">ToIP Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>. The OOBI protocol provides a discovery mechanism for verifiable information related to an AID — including its key event log (KEL) and its service endpoint — by associating the AID with a&nbsp;URL.</p><p>For example, an AID EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM may provide a service endpoint at <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> with an OOBI URL&nbsp;of</p> http://www.example.com/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM <p>The OOBI protocol is “out-of-band” as it enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an “out-of-band” infrastructure to discover information that is verified using the “in-band” KERI protocol. The OOBI protocol leverages the existing IP and DNS infrastructure for discovery so that a dedicated discovery network is not&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>Note: The OOBI by itself is insecure, and the information discovered by the OOBI must be verified using the KERI protocol.</blockquote><p>This OOBI URL may be used to discover the AID’s KEL as well as send messages to the AID, including sending a challenge message in a challenge-response protocol and sending a vLEI credential.</p> Challenge-Response Protocol <p>To establish a connection between a representative and an AID, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication">challenge-response protocol</a> is implemented to ensure that the representative holds the private key that controls the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>With the OOBI protocol, the verifier uses the OOBI URL as a service endpoint to deliver the challenge message to the AID controller. The verifier of an AID then generates a random number as a challenge message and sends it to the AID controller. The AID controller then uses the private key associated with the AID to sign a digital signature on the challenge. The signature is the response to the challenge message and is returned to the verifier. Finally, the verifier verifies the response using the public key of the&nbsp;AID.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session Man-In-the-Middle Attack <p>However, there is a risk that an attacker could intercept the communication between the representative and the verifier in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Here, the attacker obtains the authentic OOBI URL, which contains the representative’s AID, and sends a false OOBI URL, which instead contains the attacker’s AID, to the verifier.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session that is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle (MITM)&nbsp;attack. Real-time OOBI&nbsp;Session <p>To mitigate the risk of an MITM attack, the vLEI EGF specifies an authentication process that is called a real-time OOBI session that a representative and their verifier must complete before issuance of a vLEI credential.</p>An illustration of an OOBI&nbsp;session<p>During a real-time OOBI session, the representative and the verifier must organize a real-time in-person or a virtual face-to-face meeting, e.g., using a Zoom call. For a virtual face-to-face meeting, there are extra requirements as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The meeting must be continuous and uninterrupted throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  Both audio and video feeds of all participants must be active throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  <p>The OOBI session consists of the following steps:</p><p>1) The identity verifier performs manual verification of the representative’s legal identity, which has been verified during the identity assurance process. For example, if the representative had provided a passport as their identity evidence during identity assurance, they may present the passport to the verifier once again during their live&nbsp;session.</p><p>2) After the verifier confirms that the evidence is accurately associated with the representative present in the meeting, they must exchange their AIDs through an out-of-band channel. For example, OOBI URLs can be shared in the live chat of a Zoom call or shared via QR codes via video&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>3) The verifier sends a unique challenge message to cryptographically authenticate the representative’s AID.</p><p>4) The representative uses their private key that is associated with the AID to sign and respond to the challenge.</p><p>5) The verifier verifies the response using the public key obtained from the AID’s key event log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>6) The challenge-response protocol is repeated where the representative is now the challenger and the verifier the responder.</p> Group Real-time OOBI Session for QARs and&nbsp;LARs <p>For issuance of QVI and LE vLEI credentials, all QARs and all LARs of the candidate QVI and LE, respectively, must be present in the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.</p>  For the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, 2 External GARs and at least 3 QARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  For the issuance of a LE vLEI credential, 1 QAR and at least 3 LARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  An example authentication process of LARs by&nbsp;QARs<p>Once the Authentication steps are completed, the identity verifier can now sign the vLEI credential to the representatives of the vLEI candidate organizations. However, the vLEI credential issuance process cannot be completed by a single representative. To meet the required weight threshold of the multi-signature scheme stated in the vLEI EGF, another representative in control of the issuer’s AID must combine the authority and approve the vLEI issuance. For instance, a QAR may perform the required verification processes on all LARs of an LE and initiate the issuance of an LE vLEI credential. At least one other QAR must review and approve the issuance.</p> Conclusion <p>While the verification processes that applicants seeking vLEI credentials have to complete before the issuance might appear rather involved, these thorough steps to verify the identity of individuals representing organizations are crucial to safeguarding against identity theft, impersonation, and other fraudulent activities across various industries. After the identity assurance process validates the legal identities of representatives, and the identity authentication process cryptographically associates the representatives to AIDs. After identity verification, vLEI credentials may be issued with confidence, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the vLEI ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-2-identity-verification-519102614b8e">vLEI Demystified Part 2: Identity Verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We have since moved the content here, because it is more practically useful.)</p><p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program. If you’ve locked OCEAN for veOCEAN, to participate in Passive DF or Active DF, we’ve got you&nbsp;covered.</p><p>The Fetch and SingularityNET communities have token governance requiring approval of the token-merger action.

To be ready for either outcome, we will pause giving rewards for Passive DF and Volume DF as soon as the DF82 payout of Thu Mar 28 has completed. Also in preparation, we have taken a snapshot of OCEAN locked &amp; veOCEAN balances as of 00:00 am UTC Wed Mar 27 (Ethereum block 19522003); we need this information in the event of a&nbsp;“yes”.</p><p>Predictoor DF will continue regardless of voting&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>Once the votes are complete, then the next actions depend on “yes” vs&nbsp;“no”.</p> Actions if&nbsp;“no” <p>If a “no” happens, then we will resume Passive DF &amp; Volume DF&nbsp;as-is.</p><p>The first Passive DF &amp; Volume payout will be within a week after we resume, and weekly after that as per usual DF schedule.

In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY.

<p>As the conduits through which software components interact and data flows across the internet, APIs are the lifeblood of contemporary web services. API technologies like SOAP (a web services messaging protocol), REST (an architectural style) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/graphql">GraphQL</a> (a programming language and tool) simplify software development by enabling third-party data and services integration. APIs also enable companies to offer secure service functions and data exchange to employees, business partners, and users.</p>



<p>Despite the many types of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a>, debates about two major paradigms have dominated the conversation in recent years: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis">REST</a> (representational state transfer) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/graphql">GraphQL</a>. Both offer a range of benefits and thus are deployed for networking projects across the globe. However, they differ significantly in how they manage data traffic. Here, we dissect those differences and discuss how businesses can use REST and GraphQL APIs to optimize their networks.</p>



 What are REST and GraphQL APIs? 



<p>An understanding of REST and GraphQL APIs individually is necessary for a comparison of the two.</p>



 REST 



<p>Developed in the early 2000s, REST is a structured architectural style for networked hypermedia applications, which is designed to use a stateless, client/server, cacheable communication protocol. REST APIs, also called RESTful APIs, are the drivers of REST architectures.</p>



<p>REST APIs use unique resource identifiers (URIs) to address resources. REST APIs work by having different endpoints perform CRUD (“create,” “read,” “update” and “delete”) operations for network resources. They rely on a predefined data format—called a media type or MIME type—to determine the shape and size of resources they provide to clients. The most common formats are JSON and XML (and sometimes HTML or plain text).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the client requests a resource, the server processes the query and returns all the data that is associated with that resource. The response includes HTTP response codes like “200 OK” (for successful REST requests) and “404 Not Found” (for resources that don’t exist).</p>



 GraphQL 



<p>GraphQL is a query language and API runtime that Facebook developed internally in 2012 before it became <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open source</a> in 2015.</p>



<p>GraphQL is defined by API schema written in the GraphQL schema definition language. Each schema specifies the types of data the user can query or modify, and the relationships between the types. A resolver backs each field in a schema. The resolver provides instructions for turning GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions into data, and retrieves data from databases, cloud services, and other sources. Resolvers also provide data format specifications and enable the system to stitch together data from various sources.</p>



<p>Unlike REST, which typically uses multiple endpoints to fetch data and perform network operations, GraphQL exposes data models by using a single endpoint through which clients send GraphQL requests, regardless of what they’re asking for. The API then accesses resource properties—and follows the references between resources—to get the client all the data they need from a single query to the GraphQL server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both GraphQL and REST APIs are resource-based data interchanges that use HTTP methods (like PUT and GET requests) that dictate which operations a client can perform. However, key differences exist between them that explain not only the proliferation of GraphQL but also why RESTful systems have such staying power.</p>



 Differences between GraphQL and REST APIs 



<p>GraphQL offers an efficient, more flexible addition to REST; GraphQL APIs are often viewed as an upgrade from RESTful environments, especially given their ability to facilitate collaboration between front-end and back-end teams. GraphQL provides a logical next step in an organization’s API journey, helping fix issues that are often encountered with REST.</p>



<p>However, REST was long the standard for API architectures, and many developers and architects still rely on RESTful configurations to manage their IT networks. As such, understanding the distinctions between the two is integral to any organization’s IT management strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>REST and GraphQL APIs differ in how they manage:</p>



 Data retrieval  



<p>Because REST relies on multiple endpoints and stateless interactions—where every API request is processed as a new query, independent of any others—clients receive every piece of data that is associated with a resource. If a client needs only a subset of the data, it still receives all the data (over-fetching). And if the client needs data that spans multiple resources, a RESTful system often makes the client query each resource separately to compensate for inadequate data retrieval from the initial request (under-fetching). GraphQL APIs use a single GraphQL endpoint to give clients a precise, comprehensive data response in a one round trip from a single request, eliminating over- and under-fetching issues.</p>



 Versioning 



<p>In a REST architecture, teams must version APIs to modify data structures, and prevent system errors and service disruptions for the end user. In other words, developers must create a new endpoint every time they make changes, creating multiple API versions and potentially complicating maintenance. GraphQL reduces the need for versioning because clients can specify their data requirements in the query. The addition of new fields to the server does not affect clients without a need for those fields. Conversely, if fields are deprecated, clients can continue to request them until queries are updated.</p>



 Error handling 



<p>REST APIs should use HTTP status codes to indicate the status or success of a request, and each status code has a specific meaning. A successful HTTP request returns a 200 status code, while a client error might return a 400 status code and a server error might return a 500 status code.</p>



<p>At first glance, this approach to status reporting seems more straightforward, but HTTP status codes are often more useful to web users than to the APIs themselves, especially in the case of errors. REST does not have a specification for errors, so API errors can appear as transport errors or don’t appear with the status code at all. This dynamic can force personnel to read through the status documentation to understand what errors mean or even how errors are communicated within the infrastructure.</p>



<p>With GraphQL APIs, every request—regardless of whether it resulted in an error—returns a 200 OK status code because errors aren’t communicated by using HTTP status codes (except for transport errors). Instead, the system communicates errors in the response body along with the data, so clients must parse through the data payload to determine if the request was successful.</p>



<p>That said, GraphQL does have a specification for errors, so API errors are more easily distinguishable from transport errors. The exact nature of errors appears in the “errors” entry in the response body, which can make GraphQL APIs preferable to build against.</p>



 Real-time data 



<p>REST doesn’t have built-in support for real-time updates. If an app needs real-time functionality, developers usually must implement techniques like long-polling (where the client repeatedly polls the server for new data) and server-sent events, which can add complexity to the application.</p>



<p>However, GraphQL includes built-in support for real-time updates through subscriptions. Subscriptions maintain a steady connection to the server, allowing the server to push updates to the client whenever specific events happen.</p>



 Tools and environment 



<p>The REST environment is well established, with a wide range of tools, libraries, and frameworks available to developers. Working with REST APIs nonetheless requires teams to navigate several endpoints and understand the unique conventions and patterns of each API.</p>



<p>GraphQL APIs are relatively new, but the GraphQL environment has grown tremendously since its introduction, with various tools and libraries available for both server and client development. Tools like GraphiQL and GraphQL Playground provide powerful, in-browser, integrated development environments (IDEs) for exploring and testing GraphQL APIs. Furthermore, GraphQL has strong support for code generation, which can simplify client-side development.</p>



 Caching 



<p>REST APIs rely on mechanisms like eTags and last-modified headers to cache API calls. While effective, these caching strategies can be complex to implement and might not be suitable for all use cases.</p>



<p>GraphQL APIs can be more challenging to cache due to the dynamic nature of the queries. However, deploying persisted queries, response caching, and server-side caching can mitigate these challenges and streamline broader caching efforts in GraphQL architectures.</p>



 When to use GraphQL and REST APIs 



<p>Neither REST nor GraphQL APIs are inherently superior; they’re different tools that are suited to different tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>REST is generally easier to implement and can be a good choice when a straightforward, cacheable communication protocol with stringent access controls is a preferred (for public-facing e-commerce sites like Shopify and GitHub, as one example). Given the under- and over-fetching risks, REST APIs are best for:</p>



 
 Businesses that use smaller apps with simpler data profiles 



 Businesses with no complex data querying requirements 



 Businesses where most of the client base uses data and operations in similar ways 
 



<p>GraphQL APIs enable more flexible, efficient data fetching, which can improve system performance and ease-of-use for developers. These features make GraphQL especially useful for building APIs in complex environments with rapidly changing front-end requirements. This includes:</p>



 
 Businesses with limited bandwidth, looking to limit calls and responses 



 Businesses that want to combine data points at a one endpoint 



 Businesses whose client requests vary significantly 
 



<p>Though they use different approaches, both GraphQL and REST APIs have the potential to greatly enhance network scalability and server performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monitoring and optimizing application performance is important for software developers and enterprises at large. The more applications that an enterprise deploys, the more data that exists for collecting and analyzing. Yet, this data isn’t worth much without the right tools for monitoring, optimizing, storing and—crucially—putting the data into context.</p>



<p>Organizations can make the most of application data by deploying monitoring and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> solutions that help improve application health by identifying issues before they arise, flagging bottlenecks, distributing network traffic and more. These features help reduce application downtime, provide more reliable application performance and improve user experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/opentelemetry">OpenTelemetry</a> and Prometheus are both open-source projects under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that offer observability tools for application monitoring. Different types of data and operations require distinct solutions that depend on an organization’s goals and application specifications. Understanding the key differences between platforms like OpenTelemetry and Prometheus and what each solution offers, is important before you choose one for implementation.<br><br>It is also valuable to note that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus integrate and can work together as a powerful duo for monitoring applications. OpenTelemetry and Prometheus enable the collection and transformation of metrics, which allows DevOps and IT teams to generate and act on performance insights.</p>



 What is OpenTelemetry? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/opentelemetry">OpenTelemetry</a> or OTel, is a platform that is designed to create a centralized location for generating, collecting, exporting and managing telemetry data, including logs, metrics and traces. OTel was born from the merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing with the goal of providing APIs, SDKs, libraries and integrations that standardize the collection of disparate data. With OTel, the wanted monitoring outputs can be built into your code to simplify data processing and make sure that data is exported to the appropriate back end.</p>



<p>Analyzing telemetry data is key in understanding system performance and health. This type of optimized observability allows organizations to troubleshoot faster, increase system reliability, address latency issues and reduce application downtime.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick break down the key aspects of the OpenTelemetry ecosystem:</p>



<p>APIs: OpenTelemetry APIs (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces</a>) universally translate programming languages. This capability enables the APIs to collect telemetry data. These APIs play a key role in standardizing the collection of OpenTelemetry metrics.</p>



<p>SDKs: Software development kits are tools for building software. They include the framework, code libraries and debuggers that are the building blocks of software development. OTel SDKs implement OpenTelemetry APIs and offer the tools that are needed to generate and collect telemetry data.</p>



<p>OpenTelemetry collector: The OTel collector receives, processes and exports, telemetry data. OTel collectors can be configured to filter specific data types to the designated back end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instrumentation library: OTel provides an instrumentation model that runs on all platforms. The instrumentation libraries make it possible for OTel to integrate with any programming language.</p>



 Benefits of OpenTelemetry 



<p>The OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) simplifies observability by collecting telemetry data, like metrics, logs and traces, without changing code or metadata.</p>



<p>Metrics: Metrics define a high-level overview of system performance and health. Developers, IT and business management teams determine what metrics are most useful to track to maintain a level of application performance that meets business objectives. Metrics vary depending on the data that a team deems important and can include network traffic, latency and CPU storage. Metrics can also be used to track patterns and trends in application performance.</p>



<p>Logs: Logs are a record of events that occur within a software or application component. Logs can be created around specific aspects of a component that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> teams want to monitor. They serve as historical data that can present general performance information, show when set thresholds are surpassed, or display errors. Logs help monitor the overall health of an application ecosystem.</p>



<p>Traces: Traces offer a more zoomed out view of application performance than logs and help with optimization. They are also more focused than logs and follow the end-to-end journey of a single request as it moves through the application stack. Traces allow developers to find the exact moment errors or bottlenecks occur, how long they last and how they affect the user journey. This information helps manage microservices and improve overall application performance.</p>



<p>OTel can take these three different types of telemetry data and export them to various back ends, including Prometheus. This capability prevents vendor or back-end lock-in and allows developers to choose their preferred analysis tools. OpenTelemetry supports a range of integrations with other platforms, including Prometheus, which provide greater opportunities for observability. OTel supports Java, Python, JavaScript and Go, making it an increasingly flexible solution. It also allows developers and IT teams to monitor performance from any web browser or location.</p>



<p>The greatest strengths of OpenTelemetry come from its ability to consistently collect and export data across many applications and its standardization of the collection process. OTel is a powerful tool for observability into distributed systems and microservices.</p>



 What is Prometheus? 



<p>Prometheus is a toolkit for monitoring and alerting that was created to collect and organize application metrics. The Prometheus server was originally developed at SoundCloud before it became an open-source tool.</p>



<p>Prometheus is a time-series database for end-to-end monitoring of time-series data. Time-series metrics are a collection of data that is taken at regular intervals such as monthly sales data, or daily application traffic. Clear visibility into this type of data offers insights into patterns, trends and predictions for business planning. Once integrated with a host, Prometheus gathers application metrics that are related to dedicated functions that DevOps teams want to monitor.</p>



<p>Prometheus metrics provide data points that consist of the metric name, label, timestamp and value by using a query language called PromQL. PromQL allows developers and IT departments to aggregate data metrics and turn them into histograms–graphs and dashboards for greater visualization. Prometheus can access data from enterprise databases or from exporters. Exporters are software that is related to applications that work to pull metrics from various apps and endpoints.</p>



 Prometheus collects four types of metrics: 



<p>Counters: Countersmeasure cumulative numerical values that only increase. Counters are used to measure completed tasks, the number of errors that occurred during a defined period, or the number of running processes or microservices.</p>



<p>Gauges: Gauges monitor numerical values that rise and fall depending on external factors. They can monitor CPU and memory usage, temperature, or the size of a queue.</p>



<p>Histograms: Histograms measure the duration of specified events such as request duration or response size. They then divide the range of these measurements into intervals that are called buckets and determine how many of these measurements fall into each respective bucket.</p>



<p>Summaries: Like histograms, summaries also measure request durations and response size, but also provide a total count of all observations and a total of all observed values.</p>



<p>Another valuable aspect of Prometheus is that it can create accessible dashboards and graphs based on the collected data.</p>



 Benefits of Prometheus 



<p>Prometheus enables real-time application monitoring that gives you accurate insights and facilitates quick troubleshooting. It also allows for the creation of thresholds that are related to specific functions. When these thresholds are met or surpassed, it triggers alerts that can reduce the time that it takes to resolve issues. Prometheus can handle and store large volumes of metrics data and make the data available for analytics teams as needed. It is not intended to be a long-term storage solution but a tool for storing data that is needed for immediate analysis. The standard window for data storage with Prometheus is between two hours and fifteen days.</p>



<p>Prometheus seamlessly integrates with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, an open-source container orchestration platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. Kubernetes allows enterprises to build complex hybrid and multicloud environments that deploy a range of services and microservices. Integrating Prometheus with Kubernetes brings full-stack observability and oversight into these complex systems.</p>



<p>Prometheus is also compatible with Grafana, a powerful visualization tool that helps transform data into dashboards, charts, graphs and alerts. When paired with Prometheus, Grafana can take metrics and create clear visualizations. The compatibility between these two platforms makes complex data more accessible and sharable among different teams.&nbsp;</p>



 Key differences between OpenTelemetry and Prometheus 



<p>Prometheus offers tools for metrics monitoring, storage and visualization, but does not track logs or support traces, which are used for root cause analysis. Overall, Prometheus has more limited use cases than OpenTelemetry.<br><br>OpenTelemetry can process and trace more complex metrics than Prometheus through programming language-agnostic integrations. OTel is highly scalable and has greater extensibility than Prometheus by offering automated instrumentation models. Unlike Prometheus, OpenTelemetry does not offer a storage solution and must be paired with a separate back-end system.</p>



 A quick breakdown: 



 
 Prometheus can measure cumulative metrics, giving you a sum, while OpenTelemetry can represent metrics as deltas. 



 Prometheus provides short-term data and metrics storage while OTel does not natively support storage but can be paired with a separate storage solution. 



 OpenTelemetry collects metrics, logs and traces by using a consolidated API via push or pull, and translates them into a common language, which Prometheus cannot achieve. Prometheus gathers metrics by pulling data from hosts and is primarily concerned with collecting and storing time-series metrics. 



 OTel is language agonistic and can translate metrics, giving developers more flexibility. Prometheus uses PromQL to aggregate data and metrics. 



 Prometheus provides web visualization for monitoring metrics coupled with customizable alerts. OpenTelemetry must be integrated with separate tools for visualization. 



 OTel allows metric values to be expressed as integers rather than floating-point numbers, which provide more accurate value representations and are easier to understand. Prometheus cannot express metrics as integers. 
 



<p>Your organization’s needs will dictate which of these solutions is right for you. If you need a more holistic understanding of your data, are working in complex environments with distributed systems, and want more flexibility, OpenTelemetry might be a more appropriate solution. This is also the case if you need to monitor logs and traces.</p>



<p>If you need to monitor individual systems or operations, and are looking for alerting, storage and visualization models, Prometheus might be the right option.</p>



 OpenTelemetry and Prometheus integration 



<p>The good news is that you don’t necessarily have to choose one or the other; OpenTelemetry and Prometheus are compatible platforms. OTel SDKs can collect metrics from Prometheus data models and Prometheus supports OpenTelemetry metrics. Using these platforms together gives you the best of both worlds and advanced monitoring options. For example:</p>



 
 When coupled, OTel and Prometheus provide monitoring into complex systems with real-time insights into your application environments. 



 You can pair OTel’s tracing and monitoring tools with Prometheus’ alerting capabilities. 



 Prometheus can handle large volumes of data. This feature coupled with OTel’s ability to consolidate metrics, traces and logs into a single interface creates greater efficiency when scaling systems and applications. 



 PromQL can analyze the data that is collected from OpenTelemetry’s data captures and use it to create visualization models. 
 



<p>In addition, OpenTelemetry and Prometheus integrate with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/opentelemetry">IBM® Instana</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/integrations/prometheus">IBM® Turbonomic</a> to offer additional monitoring tools. With Instana’s powerful dependency map, upstream/downstream service correlation and full-stack visibility, OTel’s capabilities are optimized to make sure that all services are instrumented. Instana delivers the same great experience with OTel data as it provides for every other data source, giving you the context that you need to quickly find and fix application issues. With Turbonomic, you can use Prometheus’ data monitoring tools to automate resourcing decisions based on real-time data collection. These integrations are optimized ways to promote the health of your application ecosystem and improve overall performance.</p>

<p>Imagine a future where artificial intelligence (AI) seamlessly collaborates with existing supply chain solutions, redefining how organizations manage their assets. If you’re currently using traditional AI, advanced analytics, and intelligent automation, aren’t you already getting deep insights into asset performance?</p>



<p>Undoubtedly. But what if you could optimize even further? That’s the transformative promise of generative AI, which is beginning to revolutionize business operations in game-changing ways. It may be the solution that finally breaks through dysfunctional silos of business units, applications, data and people, and moves beyond the constraints that have cost companies dearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, as with any emerging technology, early adopters will incur learning costs, and there are challenges to preparing and integrating existing applications and data into newer technologies that enable these emerging technologies. Let’s look at some of those challenges to generative AI for asset performance management.</p>



 Challenge 1: Orchestrate relevant data 



<p>The journey to generative AI begins with data management. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagates-rethink-data-report-reveals-that-68-percent-of-data-available-to-businesses-goes-unleveraged-pr-master/">the Rethink Data Report</a>, 68% of data available to businesses goes unleveraged. Here’s your opportunity to take that abundant information you’re collecting in and around your assets and put it to good use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enterprise applications serve as repositories for extensive data models, encompassing historical and operational data in diverse databases. Generative AI foundational models train on massive amounts of unstructured and structured data, but the orchestration is critical to success. You need mature data governance plans, incorporation of legacy systems into current strategies, and cooperation across business units. &nbsp;</p>



 Challenge 2: Prepare data for AI models 



<p>AI is only as trusted as the data that fuels it. Data preparation for any analytical model is a skill- and resource-intensive endeavor, requiring the meticulous attention of (often) large teams with both technology and business-unit knowledge. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical issues to resolve include operational asset hierarchy, reliability standards, meter and sensor data, and maintenance standards. It takes a collaborative effort to lay the foundation for effective AI integration in APM and a deep understanding of the intricate relationships within your organization’s data landscape.</p>



 Challenge 3: Design and deploy intelligent workflows 



<p>Integrating generative AI into existing processes requires a paradigm shift in how many organizations operate. This shift includes embedding AI advisors and digital workers—fundamentally different from chatbots or robots—to help you scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across your business and your applications. And it’s not just a technology change.</p>



<p>Your AI workflows should support responsibility, transparency, and “explainability.”</p>



<p>To fully leverage the potential of AI in APM requires a cultural and organizational shift. Fusing human expertise with AI capabilities becomes the cornerstone of intelligent workflows, promising increased efficiency and effectiveness.</p>



 Challenge 4: Build sustainment and resiliency 



<p>The initial deployment of AI in APM isn’t the last stop on the road. A holistic approach helps you build sustainment and resiliency into the new enterprise AI ecosystem. Increasing managed services contracts across the enterprise becomes a proactive measure, ensuring continuous support for evolving systems.</p>



<p>With their wealth of knowledge, the transition of the aging asset reliability workforce presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Maintaining the effective deployment of embedded technologies may require your organization to “think outside the box” when managing new talent models.</p>



<p>As generative AI evolves, you’ll want to stay vigilant to changing regulatory guidelines and stay in tune with local and global ethical, data privacy and sustainability standards.</p>



 Prepared for the journey 



<p>Generative AI will impact your organization across most of your business capabilities and imperatives. So, consider these challenges as interconnected milestones, each harnessing capabilities to streamline processes, enhance decision-making, and drive APM efficiencies. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">Customer retention</a> must be a top priority for leaders of any company wanting to remain competitive. An effective customer retention strategy should support the company to maintain a healthy stable of loyal customers and bring in new customers. Generating repeat business is critical: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/email/rethink/2023/08/2023-08-16c.html">McKinsey’s report on customer acquisition states</a> (link resides outside of ibm.com) that companies need to acquire three new customers to make up the business value of losing one existing customer.</p>



 Customer retention has become more difficult in recent years 



<p>Working against this goal is the fact that the customer journey is more complicated today; it’s harder to meet customer expectations and keep current customers. The IBM Institute for Business Value CEO Guide to Generative AI for Customer Service found that the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/ceo-generative-ai">majority of service professionals (60%)</a> (link resides outside of ibm.com) have said that customer expectations have increased since before the pandemic.</p>



<p>Organizations that succeed at customer retention will benefit by encouraging customer loyalty. Those that understand the importance of customer retention will invest in the necessary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>&nbsp;management. Retention is best achieved by overcoming barriers to switching, maximizing the value of products and services, meeting customer expectations and solving customers’ pain points. It is achieved through a mix of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-service">customer service</a>, marketing, customer success and product development.</p>



<p>Customer retention today requires a mix of human operational discipline, human ingenuity, and technological applications, especially <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI).</p>



 Steps to create an effective customer retention strategy 



<p>Effective customer retention strategies begin the moment a first-time customer makes a purchase. It is incumbent upon the company to optimize that customer’s experience to encourage repeat customers and grow a healthy customer base.</p>



<p>Organizations should design initiatives that are either company-led or customer-led to encourage brand loyalty and word-of-mouth. The goal is to activate first-time buyers and then keep customers from switching to a competitor. Some of the steps to building an effective customer retention strategy are:</p>



 1. Make an excellent product 



<p>Ultimately, the initial battle for customer loyalty depends on whether the product or solution they buy directly or from a retailer is worth the money they spent. The calculation is that simple. Companies need a steady mix of existing and new products that meet their customers’ needs or address customer pain points. The listed customer retention components will be less effective if customers immediately regret their purchases.</p>



 2. Perfect an omnichannel marketing strategy 



<p>Companies can reach initial customers through a robust omnichannel marketing strategy, which creates personalized experiences. They need powerful messages and strategic targeting in their marketing to attract new customers in the first place. That way organizations can target existing customers across various channels, reminding them of their solutions and encouraging those customers to upgrade or purchase new ones. AI and other technologies will make omnichannel marketing even more powerful today and in the future.</p>



 3. Enrich the&nbsp;customer experience&nbsp;(CX) 



<p>Effective customer retention programs are only possible if the overall <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a> is firing on all cylinders. They need a great onboarding strategy to drive customer happiness from day one. Next, they need to keep that marketing engine going for existing customers using strong customer engagement initiatives. Having them see marketing messages reinforces their interest in the products.</p>



<p>It is critical to collect customer emails and send them a steady cadence of product news, tips and offers to keep them engaged with their existing products and the latest from the brand. Companies with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> offerings should make it simple for existing customers to purchase these new products, thus continuing the cycle.</p>



 4. Collect customer feedback 



<p>Collect, analyze and distribute customer data through reviews and surveys. It’s also important to track and analyze social media conversations about your brands. Not every customer will contact a company directly. By tracking what people say online, a company can follow up and solve the customers’ issues. By doing so, it demonstrates it hears customer complaints and cares about remediating them.</p>



 5. Prioritize customer support 



<p>Customer support teams are an invaluable part of customer retention. If something goes wrong with a customer’s purchase, the customer support—or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-care">customer care</a>—team must step in to fix the problem. Keeping customers happy and willing to buy a company’s products requires that company to respond to issues immediately. The company should also introduce self-service tools to help customers who prefer to find answers on their own.</p>



 6. Embrace AI 



<p>Companies have a wealth of new technologies that they can use to increase retention. Companies can use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI)-powered tools like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) systems. </p>



<p>For chatbots, they can use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> to provide more powerful answers to users and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a>&nbsp;to decipher customer inquiries and provide automated responses.</p>



<p>For CRMs, they can use AI and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> to automate the retrieval and analysis of customer data they’ve collected. Large Brazilian bank Bradesco turned to IBM Watson® to personalize its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/bradesco">customer service interactions</a>. IBM trained Watson on 62 products and it can now answer 283,000 questions a month with a 95% accuracy rate and only 5% requiring further assistance from a human.</p>



 7. Invest in customer success teams 



<p>This investment is especially important for companies that sell either as-a-service solutions or high-cost goods or services. Customer success works directly and proactively with customers to ensure that there is high customer satisfaction from their products or services. They provide best practices for customers and solicit feedback for product improvements.</p>



<p>If the company sells digital products, they can track customer usage and increase outreach if the customer has decreased usage, which is a sign of dissatisfaction. For products or solutions that are renewed annually, customer success teams can work in tandem with sales teams to secure a commitment before that renewal date.</p>



 8. Communicate mission and values 



<p>Many customers, particularly millennials and Gen Z buyers, are more invested in an organization’s mission and values. Organizations with strong missions or values should spend time and budget on communicating their perspectives through advertising, direct-to-consumer messaging and customer engagement.</p>



<p>This communication is especially important if an organization’s prices are higher than the competition. Knowing they’re supporting an ethical organization that gives back to their communities, for instance, will make it harder for values-driven customers to pick a competitor that does not share those perspectives.</p>



 9. Make it easier to make returns or get refunds 



<p>Customers can request refunds or wan to exchange products for various reasons. Organizations that make this a difficult process may experience short-term benefits (not having to subsidize the cost of that product). However, they will very likely lose that customer’s loyalty and eliminate the possibility of selling them more products in the future. Organizations interested in maintaining long-term customer loyalty should take the temporary hit for long-term success.</p>



 10. Track customer retention metrics 



<p>Customer retention initiatives all produce valuable insights that companies can use to recalibrate their approaches and establish key performance indicators (KPIs). At the top level, they want to know the number of new customers and the number of customers over a period of time. First, they should identify the date range they want to track (for example, one month, six-month, one year). They should track how many customers they have at the beginning and end of the period.</p>



<p>Doing so can produce important metrics like customer retention rate (CRR) and customer churn rate (CCR). While every company is different, Salesforce recommends aiming for a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/customer-service/customer-retention/">CRR rate of 85%</a> (link resides outside of ibm.com). By adding in information about purchasing lifecycle of those customers, they can also identify customer lifetime value (CLV) and net dollar retention (NDR). They should also track net promoter score (NPS).</p>



 11. Use customer loyalty programs 



<p>Encouraging repeat purchases sometimes requires a company to reward people for their patronage. A customer loyalty program can incentivize customers to buy more from a company. Another option is to create a customer referral program where current customers have incentives for introducing new customers to the company.</p>



 Why customer retention strategy matters 



<p>Customer retention is a necessary component to growing a company’s bottom line. Happy customers are prone to make repeat purchases over a longer period of time, driving “80 percent of the value creation achieved by successful growth companies,” <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/email/rethink/2023/08/2023-08-16c.html">according to McKinsey</a> (link resides of ibm.com).</p>



<p>Prioritizing and excelling at customer retention ensures that a company has a healthy revenue foundation and can focus on supercharging growth. They can achieve that through recruiting new customers and up-selling or increasing the volume of products purchased by existing customers.</p>



<p>Happy, repeat customers are also more likely to share their experiences with their social networks. Word-of-mouth recommendations and testimonials can bring in new customers, improve brand recognition and reputation, and increase the efficacy of marketing efforts while decreasing costs. Therefore, customer retention should be a key component of any business strategy.</p>

<p>As cloud computing continues to transform the enterprise workplace, private cloud infrastructure is evolving in lockstep, helping organizations in industries like healthcare, government and finance customize control over their data to meet compliance, privacy, security and other business needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/private-cloud-services-market">report from Future Market Insights</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), the global private cloud services market is forecast to grow to USD 405.30 billion by 2033, up from USD 92.64 billion in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a private cloud? 



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private cloud</a>&nbsp;is a single-tenant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing&nbsp;</a>model in which all of the hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to—and accessible only by—a single organization.</p>



<p>Private cloud combines the primary benefits of cloud computing (e.g., on-demand compute resources, elasticity, scalability) with the access control, security and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure through a self-service portal or interface.</p>



<p>In a private cloud, a single organization is typically responsible for all private infrastructure, whether hosted in-house within a company’s physical location, in an off-site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>&nbsp;on infrastructure owned or rented by a third party, or on a public cloud service provider’s infrastructure. Moreover, while an organization may choose to run and manage a private cloud themselves, they frequently outsource partial or full management to a third-party provider. All the major public cloud providers (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and technology companies like&nbsp;VMware&nbsp;and&nbsp;Red Hat offer private cloud platforms and solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enterprise organizations in industries that need to meet strict regulatory compliance standards or comply with data sovereignty laws (manufacturing, energy, oil and gas)&nbsp;frequently choose private cloud environments when they need to meet strict regulatory standards. A private cloud also provides an ideal setting for companies with workloads that deal with confidential documents, intellectual property,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>, medical records, financial data or other sensitive data.</p>



 Private cloud vs. public cloud vs. hybrid cloud&nbsp; 



<p>Before we delve further into private cloud, it’s worth reviewing the three main types of cloud computing models—private, public and hybrid.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public cloud</a>, a third-party service provides computing resources (e.g., ready-to-use software applications,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a>, enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms) available to users over the public internet on a pay-per-use or subscription-based pricing model. In contrast to the single-tenant architecture of a private cloud, a public cloud adheres to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-tenant">multi-tenant</a>&nbsp;architecture where end-users share a pool of virtual resources that are automatically provisioned for and allocated to individual tenants through a self-service&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api#:">API</a>&nbsp;interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> unifies public cloud, private cloud and traditional on-premises to create a single, flexible and cost-efficient <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">IT infrastructure</a>. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/transformation-index">IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud</a>, more than 77% of business and IT professionals have adopted a hybrid cloud approach, which combines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>&nbsp;and other cutting-edge technologies to centralize control and visibility, creating a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/single-pane-of-glass">single pane of glass</a>&nbsp;that optimizes cost, performance, compliance and security across all environments.</p>



<p>Today, most enterprise organizations combine hybrid cloud with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud#:">multicloud</a>, which refers to using different services from multiple cloud service providers. A multicloud setting helps clients avoid vendor lock-in and allows them to run the most optimal computing environment for each workload.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a deeper dive, check out our blog post, “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/public-cloud-vs-private-cloud-vs-hybrid-cloud/">Public cloud vs. private cloud vs. hybrid cloud: What’s the difference?</a>“</p>



 Private cloud service models 



<p>All three cloud deployment models support the following four primary cloud services:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</a>&nbsp;delivers on-demand compute, network and data storage resources over the internet and on a pay-per-usage basis. IaaS allows organizations to scale and shrink resources as needed, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures associated with traditional&nbsp;IT infrastructure. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a>&nbsp;offers organizations a complete cloud platform (e.g., hardware, software and infrastructure) for developing, running and managing applications—minus the cost, complexity and inflexibility of building and maintaining that platform on-premises (also referred to as “on-prem”). 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a>&nbsp;allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps (e.g., Zoom, Adobe, Salesforce). A SaaS provider operates, manages and maintains the software and the infrastructure running that software. SaaS is the most common public cloud computing service. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless#:">Serverless</a> enables developers to build and run cloud-native applications without having to provision or manage servers or backend infrastructure. Serverless simplifies development and supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a>&nbsp;practices by allowing developers to spend less time defining the infrastructure required to integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production. 
 



 Private cloud architecture 



<p>Private clouds share the same underlying technology as public cloud and hybrid cloud models, including the following:</p>



 
 Virtualization:&nbsp;Foundational to cloud computing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>&nbsp;uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware, enabling the division of a single computer’s hardware components (e.g., processors, memory and storage) into multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it runs on just a portion of the underlying computer hardware. By maximizing the utilization of hardware, virtualization allows hardware to be shared efficiently across multiple users and applications, providing the scalability, agility and elasticity of the cloud.&nbsp; 



 Managed software:&nbsp;Management console software&nbsp;gives administrators full control over the infrastructure and applications running in a private cloud setting, allowing them to optimize security, availability and resource utilization. 



 Automation:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-automation#:">Cloud automation</a>&nbsp;tools run on top of virtual environments and speed tasks (e.g., server provisioning, integrations), reducing the manual work associated with provisioning, configuring or managing cloud environments and making self-service resource delivery possible. Automation also underpins other essential cloud functions, including automatic scaling, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">containerized orchestration</a> with tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker">Docker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, and DevOps&nbsp;workflows. 



 Cloud-native applications:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">Cloud-native</a>&nbsp;refers to a software approach for building and deploying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices (also called microservices architecture)</a>&nbsp;in which a single application comprises many smaller, loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services. These modern tools allow teams to update applications quickly and frequently to meet the demands of modern business by improving customer experiences. 
 



 Private cloud types 



<p>There are four main types of private cloud infrastructure.</p>



 On-premises private cloud 



<p>An on-premises cloud is hosted on-site and managed by an organization’s IT team. While an on-premises cloud provides high control over security, it can be costly to maintain as it requires upfront and recurring capital expenditures.</p>



 Virtual private cloud 



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc">virtual private cloud (VPC)</a>&nbsp;is a public cloud service capability that creates a private cloud-like environment on public cloud infrastructure. All resources (e.g., compute, storage, CPU and networking capacity) are abstracted from the physical hardware and shared among virtual machines (VMs) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers#:">containers</a>. A VPC allows clients to define and control isolated virtual networks and then deploy those cloud resources into those networks.</p>



 Hosted private cloud 



<p>Hosted private clouds are run off-prem on a cloud service provider’s servers. Unlike a VPC, where organizations share servers with other customers, a hosted private cloud uses servers designated for a single organization’s exclusive use or-prem or in a remote data center.</p>



 Managed private cloud 



<p>A&nbsp;managed private cloud is a single-tenant environment where the responsibility for managing and maintaining the cloud’s infrastructure is outsourced to a third-party service provider. Physical hardware (e.g., cooling systems, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a>, storage devices, networking equipment) is often housed in the cloud service provider’s data center, or these infrastructure components can reside an enterprise’s own data center. Beyond hosting and management platforms, CSPs offer many other private tools and solutions, including monitoring and reporting, private cloud storage,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery#:">disaster recovery (DR)</a>&nbsp;and more.</p>



 Benefits of a private cloud 



<p>A private cloud computing environment offers the following distinct benefits:&nbsp;</p>



 
 More control over resources:&nbsp;Private clouds give companies more control over their IT resources with configurations maintained by internal IT team members. Moreover, this level of control enhances the flexibility needed to scale resources up or down as needed.&nbsp; 



 Customization:&nbsp;Private cloud deployment allows organizations to customize servers and software based on security, compliance and performance needs. 



 High security:&nbsp;Certain industries, like insurance, are more prone to data breaches and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a>.&nbsp;A private cloud offers greater visibility and access control by storing sensitive data and applications behind private firewalls. Other customized cloud security measures that help limit the attack surface include virtual private networks (VPNs),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">data encryption</a>&nbsp;and API keys. 



 Predictable costs:&nbsp;While a public cloud is based on a pay-per-use model, unforeseen costs and wasted spending related to unplanned traffic spikes or idle workloads can occur. Private cloud settings can be very cost-effective as they allow organizations to exercise more control over the resources based on their business needs. 



 Low latency:&nbsp;A private cloud offers reduced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a> as resources are all based in an on-premises data center or in a managed private cloud, where resources are utilized only by one customer. 



 Performance optimization:&nbsp;Because it provides enhanced control, a private cloud enables an organization to adjust its infrastructure to ensure high performance and run optimal workloads. 
 



 Top six private cloud use cases&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Here are six ways organizations use a private cloud to support ongoing digital transformation and create business value.</p>



 1. Data privacy and compliance requirements 



<p>Because of their limited access, private clouds are excellent environments for businesses with data protection, compliance or regulatory concerns. For instance, all US healthcare companies must adhere to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the federal law that requires the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed. A private cloud allows healthcare organizations to utilize administrative and physical controls designed to store and safeguard protected health information (PHI).</p>



 2.&nbsp;Private cloud storage 



<p>Private cloud storage enables companies like finance institutions to protect sensitive data and control who has access to that data. &nbsp;For instance, only those administrators or team members who have been granted permission can interact with customer data through a private connection like a virtual private network (VPN).</p>



 3.&nbsp;Application modernization 



<p>Many companies use private clouds to modernize legacy applications as part of their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a>&nbsp;journey. Private clouds can be customized to handle sensitive workloads, creating a smooth and secure transition to the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



 4.&nbsp;Hybrid multicloud strategy 



<p>Private cloud plays a crucial part in a hybrid multicloud environment, which gives organizations the control and agility to choose the best cloud environment for each workload. For instance, with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-strategy/">hybrid cloud strategy</a>, a bank can store sensitive customer information in a private cloud and use a public cloud to develop and test new applications, like a loyalty program for its mobile platform.</p>



 5.&nbsp;Edge computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a>&nbsp;is a decentralized approach that brings storage and computing power closer to where data is created. For instance, healthcare organizations can leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT</a>&nbsp;and other edge devices to conduct remote patient monitoring. Private cloud infrastructure can be deployed at the edge, where sensitive data can then be processed locally. This capability allows healthcare practitioners to make data-driven decisions in real-time while adhering to patient privacy rules.&nbsp;</p>



 6.&nbsp;Generative AI 



<p>Today, companies are beginning to leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a>&nbsp;capabilities across cloud settings, including private cloud. For instance, generative AI models can strengthen security by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns and anomalies in private cloud infrastructure that reveal threats in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



 Private cloud solutions with IBM 



<p>As a leader in hybrid cloud solutions, IBM helps clients customize the best private cloud environment to meet their needs. For instance,&nbsp;IBM Cloud® Virtual Server for VPC offers fast-provisioning compute capacity with the highest network speeds and most secure, software-defined <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking">networking</a> resources available on the IBM Cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> in education allow students to share their data with verifying parties — such as places of employment or universities — without the need to check in with the original source of that information, namely the school or college where they did their coursework or received their diploma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that administrators no longer need to go through the manual process of authenticating documents or contacting the school that an applicant is claiming to have graduated from, saving the administrator time, the university or business money, and the student or graduate both.</p>
<p>Immediate proof of degrees and accreditation&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJdJZftt17s">hosted a Meetup</a> with Jerry Henn, Assistant Executive Director of the United School Administrators of Kansas (USA Kansas). With 35 years of experience in education, Jerry is an expert in how schools run and the pain points administrators want to remove by turning to new technologies. Henn was excited about being able to actually prove skills and achievements; claiming to know something is one thing, but being able to instantly verify that someone is accredited by using cryptography is a huge time and money saver.</p>
<p>Prove specific skills with microcredentials</p>
<p>Henn was joined by Indicio’s VP of Business Development James Schulte to talk about what he learned from attending the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiyPLdxCKsw">1EdTech Digital Credential Summit</a>. And the headline was microcredentials, short, accredited courses that provide specific knowledge and skills, such as competence in a specific programming language, which are particularly relevant to professional development. Open Badges — particularly the verifiable credential version — simplify issuing, collecting, and verifying microcredentials. This makes it easier for an employer to assess a candidate’s qualifications, but it also helps to drive a continuous learning infrastructure.</p>
<p>Eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes</p>
<p>Currently, authenticating a diploma requires contacting the school where it was issued, and having them dig through their records. This is a process that can take days, and can easily be delayed due to school holidays or other interruptions. This costs businesses time as they do their due diligence, makes job applicants wait longer, and requires time and physical effort by the university. Verifiable credentials allow you to trust data as if it were being presented by the original source. No more need to contact the school at all, if you can verify the credential you can move forward.</p>
<p>To learn more about the paperwork involved in school administration and how decentralized identity can help, <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">read Why use decentralized identity and Open Badges in education</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t be left behind</p>
<p>Education administrators are already implementing this technology to save their students and faculty time and effort. Indicio recently <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-serves-verifiable-data-solutions-to-over-2000-school-administrators-with-new-partner-usa-kansas/">partnered with USA Kansas</a> to implement verifiable credentials to over 2,000 administrators; and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4cVQa-4yQc&amp;t=1s">see a demonstration</a> of just a few of the things that this technology can do for your organization today on the Indicio YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss a use case for your organization, or think you might be ready to get started, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a> and we will be in touch promptly.</p>

<p>Is your company using a patchwork approach to employee onboarding and offboarding? Or is everything in one place?&nbsp; Are you relying on a combination of HR tools, IT tools, spreadsheets, checklists, and communication across email and Slack?</p>
<p>YeshID gives you a simple, clean way to manage centralized and distributed Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s centralized (everything in one place) and decentralized (workload doesn’t land on one set of shoulders). YeshID integrates with your existing HR and IT processes, regardless of complexity.</p>
 YeshID Simplifies Onboarding 
<p>When your new hire shows up, bright-eyed and ready to rock, the last thing you want to do is drain that enthusiasm. OK, it’s not the last thing. But never mind. You don’t want it to happen. Good news. You can use YeshID to create a smooth onboarding experience for new hires.</p>
 Scenario 1: No HR or Limited IT Integration 
<p>YeshID acts as your one-stop shop for managing both HR and IT tasks during onboarding. YeshID lets you create playbooks that include manual steps like ordering a laptop, sending company swag, compliance training, along with automated tasks like user provisioning in Google Workspace, assigning them to groups and departments, and coordinating access to other applications.</p>
<p>By centralizing the orchestration process in YeshID, you ensure a streamlined and organized onboarding experience for your new hires. By decentralizing–assigning tasks to people other than your unexpected IT person–you can get the work done faster and better.</p>
 Scenario 2: Existing HR Tool with Partial IT Provisioning 
<p>Maybe you’ve got an HR or IT tool that handles some basic IT provisioning. You probably know that it falls short if you don’t have the fancy enterprise license for all of your applications. And so you are back to a spreadsheet or document to handle the rest of your IT process.</p>
<p>But don’t worry! YeshID will seamlessly integrate with your existing process and will handle provisioning coordination (with the application owners) of the lower license tier applications that don’t have SAML/SCIM support.<br>
</p>
<p>If an HR tool creates a new user in Google Workspace, YeshID will send an alert to ensure that the rest of the onboarding takes place. You can then assign a pre-built playbook to coordinate the remaining tasks on your checklist.&nbsp;</p>
 YeshID: The Advantages 
 
 Simple Setup: Get started with YeshID in minutes, not days or weeks. 
 Flexible Workflows: YeshID adapts to your existing processes, allowing you to handle manual and automated tasks regardless of license type. 
 Effortless Compliance: YeshID simplifies compliance by centralizing access requests and approvals, ensuring a clear audit trail. 
 Enhanced Security: YeshID reduces human error and improves security by tracking identity life cycles and permissions so that offboarding is mistake-free. 
 Happy Teams: YeshID empowers your team with clear processes, reduces busy work, and frees them to focus on strategic tasks.

 Dawn of the DID: Part&nbsp;3  Embracing the Digital Identity Revolution <p>In today’s digital age, our online identities are as integral to our lives as our physical identities. Yet, as we navigate the vast digital landscape, the security and sovereignty of these digital selves often feel just out of reach. Enter blockchain technology, a beacon of hope in the quest for a secure and autonomous digital identity, promising a future where we hold the reins of our online personas.</p><p>Blockchain is not just a technological innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we manage and protect our digital identities. By offering a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain technology introduces a new era of security, privacy, and user control. This marks the beginning of a revolution, one where our digital identities are both safeguarded and truly our&nbsp;own.</p> Understanding Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Our digital identity is an amalgamation of all the digital footprints we leave behind — email addresses, social media profiles, and even our online shopping habits. These bits of data paint a picture of who we are online but are scattered across the vast expanse of the internet, often under the stewardship of various online platforms. The challenge here is twofold: ensuring the security of this scattered identity and reclaiming control over how it’s used and by&nbsp;whom.</p><p>In the traditional setup, our digital identities are not fully in our control. Instead, they’re often managed by central authorities or platforms, making them susceptible to breaches, misuse, and privacy invasions. This centralized approach not only poses significant security risks but also strips individuals of their privacy and control over their own identities. The need for a shift towards a more secure, user-controlled identity system is&nbsp;clear.</p> Blockchain to the&nbsp;Rescue <p>Blockchain technology emerges as the hero in the narrative of digital identity, offering a solution that is as secure as it is revolutionary. With its decentralized nature, blockchain acts as a digital ledger that is distributed across a network, rather than being stored in a single location. This not only makes it nearly impervious to hacking but also ensures that no single entity can claim undue control over the system. The implications for digital identity are profound, promising a future where our online selves are both protected and autonomous.</p><p>The decentralized approach of blockchain brings the power back to the user, offering a level of security and privacy that centralized systems simply cannot match. By storing identity data across a network, blockchain makes unauthorized access and identity fraud exponentially more difficult. Moreover, it gives individuals the ability to manage and control their own digital identities, marking a significant step towards a future where online privacy and user sovereignty are the norms, not the exceptions.</p> The Mechanisms of Blockchain in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain secures digital identities through cutting-edge technologies like public-private key encryption. Imagine sending a locked box through the mail, where the recipient has the only key; this is the essence of public-private key encryption. The public key is widely available, allowing anyone to encrypt information, but the private key is held only by the recipient, ensuring that only they can decrypt and access the information. This mechanism is at the heart of blockchain’s ability to secure digital identities, ensuring that only the rightful owner can access and control their identity.</p><p>Smart contracts further enhance the security and efficiency of digital identities on the blockchain. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts automate and secure transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the potential for fraud. This technology not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies the trust and integrity of digital interactions, making blockchain an indispensable tool in the management of digital identities.</p> Real-World Applications and&nbsp;Benefits <p>The practical applications of blockchain in managing digital identities are as diverse as they are transformative. From securing personal medical records to ensuring the integrity of online voting systems, blockchain technology is already reshaping how we interact with the digital world. These applications not only demonstrate blockchain’s versatility but also highlight its potential to enhance security, privacy, and trust in digital transactions. By providing a secure platform for managing digital identities, blockchain paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and user-centric online services.</p><p>Beyond its practical applications, blockchain offers profound benefits for individual users. It empowers users with greater control over their personal information, ensuring that they decide who has access to their data and how it is used. This shift towards user-centric identity management represents a significant move away from the vulnerability and lack of control that characterize traditional digital identity systems. With blockchain, users enjoy enhanced privacy, reduced risk of identity theft, and a newfound sense of agency over their digital&nbsp;selves.</p> Empowering Users Through Blockchain <p>Blockchain technology doesn’t just protect; it empowers. By enabling the concept of self-sovereign identities, blockchain allows individuals to own and directly control their digital identities without the need for intermediaries. This empowerment extends beyond mere control over personal data; it fosters a digital environment where trust is built into the system, and users can engage in transactions with confidence. The impact of such a shift is profound, offering a blueprint for a digital society where privacy, security, and individual autonomy are paramount.</p><p>The empowerment provided by blockchain is a catalyst for innovation, opening doors to new ways of interacting in the digital realm that were previously unimaginable. From streamlining financial services to revolutionizing how we verify credentials and qualifications, the potential for growth and development is limitless. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of digital identity, promising a future where our online lives are not only secure but also more seamlessly integrated with our physical realities.</p> The Future Is Decentralized <p>As we stand on the cusp of a new era in digital identity management, the role of blockchain technology cannot be overstated. It heralds a future where the security, privacy, and control of digital identities are not just improved but reimagined. The journey toward a decentralized digital world is filled with promise, offering a vision of the internet where trust is inherent, and user empowerment is the standard. The path forward is clear: a future where our digital identities are as secure, sovereign, and uniquely ours as our physical&nbsp;ones.</p> Join the Revolution <p>The blockchain revolution is here, and it’s redefining what it means to own your digital identity. We invite you to dive deeper into the world of blockchain, explore its potential, and become part of the movement towards secure, decentralized digital identities. Whether you’re a seasoned expert in the realm of Web3 or just starting to explore the possibilities, your voice and your actions can help shape this exciting future. Together, we can build a digital world that respects privacy, security, and individual autonomy. Join us in paving the way toward a more secure, decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> A Quote or Thought to&nbsp;Ponder <blockquote>“In the end, it’s not the technology that changes the world; it’s how we use&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>As we embrace the possibilities that blockchain technology brings to digital identity management, let’s remember that technology is a tool — one that, in the right hands, has the power to transform lives, societies, and the world at large. The future of digital identity is not just about securing data; it’s about empowering individuals, fostering trust, and building a digital world that values and protects the identity of every user. As we move forward, let’s use this powerful tool to create a legacy of empowerment, security, and trust — a legacy that future generations will thank us&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/blockchains-role-in-digital-identity-40e8b646a2fc">Blockchain’s Role in Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Written by Fission's <a href="https://github.com/bgins">Brian Ginsburg</a> and <a href="https://zee.town/">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> and published on March 27th, 2024.</p><p>The <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> is a decentralized platform that aims to distribute computational tasks across a vast, open network. This network spans from your personal machine to other devices on your LAN, a cluster of cloud nodes, and even to PoPs (points of presence) located at the edge of the Internet. Processing happens as close to the data source as possible, scheduled on nodes with general capacity or those with specialized capabilities like high-powered GPUs.</p><p>At its core, the Everywhere Computer is built on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM)</a> protocol. It executes workflows containing tasks that are content-addressed—which means they're uniquely identified by their content rather than by their location. This system is powered by nodes running Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar runtime</a>, an engine that runs WebAssembly (Wasm) based workflows composed of <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Wasm components</a> with runnable functions that can be scheduled and executed by any Homestar peer throughout the network.</p><p>Beyond the sandboxing, portability, and predictable performance benefits of Wasm, we're excited about orchestrating workflows and state machines composed of modules compiled from different source languages and bringing them together into workflows where the output of one task feeds into the input of another. Composing components in a workflow lets users focus on component interfaces without considering interactions between multiple languages.</p>Tasks that wrap functions are published by content identifier (CID), and distributed and executed by nodes running Homestar<p>With the Everywhere Computer, we're all in on <a href="https://youtu.be/dhoVlVu2XAw?si=x1YIQk-9Jkg_FphP">"the return of write once, run anywhere"</a> as a motto, but with content-addressing and our focus on caching and replayability of previously computed tasks, we can go a step further and say:</p><blockquote>Write once, run once, and never run again (everywhere!)</blockquote><p>This post will introduce authoring Wasm components and functions for the Everywhere Computer. Wasm components can be written in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-guest-languages">several different programming languages</a>— including C/C++, Java (TeaVM Java), Go (TinyGo), and C#—but we'll focus on Rust, JavaScript, and Python for this post. We'll be writing functions in each of these languages, compiling and packaging them as Wasm components, and bringing them together into a workflow that executes on our compute platform. Along the way, we'll introduce Wasm component tooling, the Homestar runtime, and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a>, which provides a convenient interface for running Homestar with a gateway for preparing and executing workflows.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer is in beta. The <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/">docs</a> are publicly available and open-source licensed. We have a closed beta group to provide high-quality support and to gather feedback. <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up</a> for the beta group. We would love to hear what you are working on and what ideas you have for using the Everywhere Computer!</p><p>This post is a high-level overview that can be used a companion to the code in the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository. We won't cover every detail in this overview, so clone this repository if you would like to follow along.</p> Background: Wasm components, WIT, &amp; WASI logging <p>Evolution within the Wasm ecosystem is happening at a wicked fast pace, particularly now that the <a href="https://youtu.be/phodPLY8zNE">path to Wasm components</a> has been streamlined and standardized, module-to-module interop is trivial.</p><p>In the Everywhere Computer, we decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/CanonicalABI.md">Canonical ABI</a> to convert between the values and functions exposed by components written using the Component Model and those provided by <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/">Core WebAssembly</a> modules instead of imposing a custom ABI upon our users. A component is just a wrapper around a core module that specifies its imports, internal definitions, and exports using interfaces defined with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">Wasm Interface Type (WIT)</a> IDL format.</p><p>Unlike core modules, components may not export Wasm memory, reinforcing Wasm sandboxing and enabling interoperation between languages with different memory assumptions. For example, a component that relies on Wasm-GC (garbage collected) memory compiled from a dynamic language can seamlessly interact with a component compiled from a static language using linear memory.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer strives for <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">simplicity</a>. By adopting the Component model and its tooling (for example, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo-component</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen">wit-bindgen</a>), we can run workflows combining components from different languages without handling arbitrary Wasm modules or introducing custom tooling, bindgens, or SDKs for our ecosystem.</p><p>In addition, while our Homestar runtime utilizes alternate formats as internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate representations</a>, by adopting WIT, we can <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/tree/main/homestar-wasm#interpreting-between-ipld-and-wit">interpret</a> between WIT values and other data models at runtime without exposing these internal formats to function writers.</p> Embedding Wasmtime <p>The Homestar runtime embeds the <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a> runtime to execute Wasm components associated with tasks in a workflow. The Wasmtime runtime is built and maintained by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>. It provides multi-language support and fine-grained configuration for CPU and memory usage.</p><p>Wasmtime is at the forefront of the Wasm ecosystem, which includes their support of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) stack that recently reached <a href="https://blog.sunfishcode.online/wasi-0-2/">WASI Preview 2</a>. WASI gives library developers and implementers like us lower-level primitives for working with files, sockets, and HTTP with a stable set of common interfaces to build on.</p><p>Some of the other platforms and frameworks that have adopted Wasmtime include <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmtime-a-standardized-runtime-for-wasmcloud">wasmCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/compute">Fastly Compute</a>.</p> WIT <p>In the following sections, we will use WIT interfaces to define the types of our functions and a <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#worlds">world</a> to describe the imports and exports associated with each Wasm component. Then, we will implement the interfaces in Rust, JavaScript, and Python.</p><p>WIT provides built-in types, including primitives like signed/unsigned integer types, floats, strings, and more interesting and complex types like results, options, and lists. WIT also provides a way to define custom, user-defined types like records, variants, and enums. Homestar supports all of these WIT types internally (except <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#resources">resources</a>, which we do not permit in guest code) when translating between other formats and data structures.</p> WASI Logging <p>EveryCLI reports logs executed by guest programs running on the Homestar host runtime. To emit log messages, Homestar implements the proposed <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging/tree/main">WASI logging WIT interface</a> which exposes the <code>log</code> method to function writers for integration into their programs. As we'll demonstrate later in this post, when you call <code>log</code> in your guest code, EveryCLI will display logs in a console at a specified level of verbosity and with contextual information.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI provides detailed information that reports workflow events and runtime execution errors.</p> Writing Functions <p>In this post, we will write arithmetic operations in each source language to keep our example code simple. Our Rust program will perform addition and division, the JavaScript one will perform subtraction, and the Python program will perform multiplication. We will use division to show division by zero error reporting.</p><p>Our functions will be compiled into Wasm components using tools from or built upon the excellent work of the Bytecode Alliance. The Wasm component ecosystem is evolving quickly, so keep in mind that the techniques described in this blog post may be out of date. We'll provide links so you can check on the latest developments.</p><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository if you would like to follow along. The repository includes instructions for installing dependencies, tooling, and compiling components for each language. We will use <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a> to run workflows that call the functions in these components.</p> Rust <p>For writing a function in Rust, we will use <code><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo component</a></code> to generate a Wasm component. If you're following along with the code examples, please run the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/tree/main/rust#setup">Rust setup</a> instructions.</p><p><code>cargo component</code> imagines what first-class support for WebAssembly components might look like for Rust. Rust support includes referencing WIT dependencies in the Cargo manifest. We reference WASI logging in our manifest:</p> <code>[package.metadata.component.target.dependencies]
"wasi:logging" = { path = "../wit/deps/logging" }
</code> rust/Cargo.toml<p>We set our target WIT world in the manifest as well:</p> <code>[package.metadata.component.target]

  export divide: func(a: float64, b: float64) -&gt; float64;
}
</code> wit/math.wit<p><code>cargo component</code> generates a set of bindings that produce a <code>Guest</code> trait that requires us to implement the interfaces from our WIT world.

world multiplication {
  import wasi:logging/logging;

  export multiply: func(a: float64, b: float64) -&gt; float64;
}
</code> wit/multiplication.wit<p><code>componentize-py</code> generates a set of bindings to import into our Python source code. Unlike Rust, the bindings do not need to be written to a file and can be generated on the fly.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/python/app.py">Python source code</a> multiplies two numbers and logs the operation:</p> <code>import multiplication

        return a * b
</code> python/app.py<p>We run <code>componentize-py</code> to generate our Wasm component:</p> <code>componentize-py -d ../wit -w multiplication componentize app -o output/multiply.wasm
</code> <p>The <code>-d</code> option tells <code>componentize-py</code> where to look for our WIT interfaces and <code>-w</code> tells it which WIT world to use. The <code>componentize</code> command takes the name of the Python module containing the app to wrap. In our case, we are targeting <code>app.py</code>.</p><p><code>componentize-py</code> bundles <code>CPython</code>, <code>libc</code>, and other dependencies into the Wasm component to interpret and provide a Python environment for our code. Like JavaScript, this comes at a size and performance cost but is necessary to run Python code.</p><p>We recommend reading the <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-componentize-py">Introducing Componentize-Py</a> blog post for more information on writing Python-sourced components. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkAO17lmqsI">Introducing Componentize-Py: A Tool for Packaging Python Apps as Components</a> is an excellent talk that explains how <code>componentize-py</code> works.</p> Workflows <p>We now have a set of Wasm components with arithmetic functions sourced from multiple languages. Let's run these functions together in some workflows!</p><p>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@everywhere-computer/every-cli">EveryCLI</a>, and then we'll write a workflow:</p> <code>npm i -g @everywhere-computer/every-cli
</code> <p>Homestar and the Everywhere Computer currently use <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/">IPFS Kubo</a> as a content-addressed storage layer for Wasm components. In the near future, we'll support other forms of distributed storage.</p><p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that loads Wasm components onto IPFS, prepares workflows, and calls on the Homestar runtime to schedule and execute them.</p><p>EveryCLI provides a simplified workflow syntax that it uses to prepare the underlying workflow. Let's start by using <code>math.wasm</code> in <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/add.json">a workflow</a> to add two numbers:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/add.json<p>A workflow is an array of tasks that we would like to execute. Each task is given a <code>name</code>, which will be used to reference results in subsequent tasks. Our task <code>input</code> includes the name of the function to execute and its arguments.</p><p>Let's run this workflow! Start EveryCLI with <code>math.wasm</code> as an argument:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm
</code> <p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that we can query for a JSON Schema representing the WIT interfaces in <code>math.wasm</code> at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>Post the workflow to the gateway:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/add.json
</code> <p>The response reports the result of adding <code>3.1</code> and <code>5.2</code> as <code>8.3</code>.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI has passed along logs from the Homestar runtime:</p>Logs on running the add workflow<p>The logs report information about workflow execution and include our WASI logs. Our WASI log reports <code>"3.1 + 5.2 = 8.3"</code> with the category <code>guest:rust:add</code>. WASI logs always have the <code>wasm_execution</code> subject.</p><p>We can also see workflow settings, fetching resources (our Wasm components), initializing, starting, and completing the workflow. The "resolving receipts" log shows that Homestar is looking for cached results so it can avoid work where possible. The "computed receipt" log reports the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a>, a content identifier derived from the content's cryptographic hash, of the receipt from the add computation. EveryCLI returns the workflow result, but the computed receipts can be also used to pull results directly from IPFS by CID.</p><p>If we post the workflow to the gateway again, we see a different set of logs:</p>Logs on replaying the add workflow<p>This time we don't need to do any work. Homestar cached the receipts from our last run and reports that it is replaying the workflow and its receipts.</p><p>Notice also that our WASI log does not show up. WASI logging happens only on execution, not replay. We'll see in a moment how we can force re-execution to always see WASI logs.</p><p>Let's try <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/all.json">a workflow</a> that uses all four arithmetic operations from our Rust, JavaScript, and Python-sourced components:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "subtract",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.add.output}}", 4.4],
          "func": "subtract"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "multiply",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.subtract.output}}", 2.3],
          "func": "multiply"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.multiply.output}}", 1.5],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/all.json<p>In this workflow, each task except the first receives input from the previous task. For example, <code>subtract</code> awaits the output of <code>add</code> by using <code>{{needs.add.output}}</code> as a placeholder that will be filled in when <code>add</code> has completed.</p><p>Restart EveryCLI, passing in all of our Wasm components:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm javascript/output/subtract-j54di3rspj2eewjro4.wasm python/output/multiply.wasm --debug
</code> <p>The hash of your subtract Wasm component may be different. Check <code>javascript/output</code> for the appropriate file name.</p><p>We use the <code>--debug</code> flag this time to force re-execution of the tasks in our workflow. The <code>--debug</code> flag lets us see our WASI logs on every run while we are developing our functions, but it should not be used in production because it eliminates the benefits of caching.</p><p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/all.json
</code> <p>The response reports a result of <code>5.98</code> which looks close enough for computer math!</p><p>Our WASI logging reports each operation:</p>Logs on running all operations workflow<p>We can see WASI logs from each component, labeled by category as <code>guest:rust:add</code>, <code>guest:javascript:subtract</code>, <code>guest:python:multiply</code>, and <code>guest:rust:divide</code>.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/division_by_zero.json">a workflow</a> that attempts division by zero to check our error reporting.</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 0.0],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/division_by_zero.json<p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/division_by_zero.json</code> <p>On running this workflow, we see two errors:</p>Logs on running division by zero workflow<p>The first error is our WASI log reporting a "Division by zero error". The second error is an execution error from the Wasm runtime. It's a bit inscrutable, but we can see "not able to run fn divide" which tells us which function failed.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we have introduced the Everywhere Computer and how you can get started writing functions and workflows for it.</p><p>So far, to execute workflows, we've used <code>curl</code> to POST manually constructed JSON workflows to the gateway.

<p>Mydex CIC is one of a group of organisations winning an international award for Technology Enabled Care. The project in Moray, Scotland has been named best Up and Coming TEC innovation at the ITEC (International Technology Care) Awards 2024 this&nbsp;month.</p><p>The project is part of a UK government-funded Rural Centre of Excellence and run under the auspices of the Scotland-based Digital Health &amp; Care Innovation Centre (DHI). It revolves around the generation and collation of holistic data of social determinants of health. Mydex personal data stores lie at the heart of it, enabling individuals to collect and share data about their lives and their health under their&nbsp;control.</p><p>Press reports quote Dr Malcolm Simmons, GP clinical lead for Moray, as&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“The development of the personal data store has the potential to overcome several significant practical difficulties patients, families, GPs, carers, and other professionals face when trying to share information that is used to optimise the care provided to an individual. With the person controlling who has access to their information, the individual can choose to share their information with everyone who is important to them, thereby allowing health and care teams to communicate more effectively, improving care for the individual at the centre of this&nbsp;model.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In the future, everyone could have access to this technology, allowing phone or tablet real-time access to results, health information and advice with up-to-date information about local resources and services that might help deal with health problems or encourage a healthier lifestyle.”</blockquote><p>The collation and analysis of the data in the project is internationally unique and offers the potential for significant impact to both citizens and services through its ability to generate individual and population level insights. This enables enhanced self-management, early intervention and targeted resources, the idea being to relieve pressure on frontline services and deliver more targeted and efficient care.</p><p>This is one of many projects Mydex CIC is currently working on to use its personal data infrastructure to help people and services deliver and experience better health and care outcomes at lower cost, in terms of time, energy and hassle as well as&nbsp;money.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/dhi-mydex-project-wins-international-award-53ce93f5c7be">DHI/Mydex project wins international award</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Here’s the situation: You’re the CIO or similarly empowered representative of an organization. Different voices within your business are calling attention to the awesome scalability and power of hyperscale computing, which you’ve also noticed with increasing interest. Now the word comes down from on high that you’ve been tasked with designing and implementing your company’s hyperscale computing solution—whatever that should be.</p>



<p>Your organization already has an ambitious agenda in mind for whatever<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure"> IT infrastructure</a> you wind up choosing. The company is working with extremely high volumes of data and expects this situation to continue or grow. So, you’ve got a ton of assets earmarked for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data storage</a>, with many more workloads on the way.</p>



<p>Your business isn’t expecting this data to collect dust in a vault, either. Company leadership is already trumpeting new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-management">data processing</a> applications and how smoothly already favored apps will be integrated into the new, high-performance system. Still others are wowed by the promise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> that hyperscale data centers offer.</p>



<p>For these reasons, there’s a lot of positive support for going ahead and building a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale-data-center">hyperscale data center</a>, customized expressly for this business. However, that’s just one set of opinions.</p>



<p>Other leaders remind you that the company’s primary allegiance is to the bottom line and that your solution needs to be cost-effective and “thread the needle” by providing the most return for the least investment possible. These voices forcefully advocate using a colocation solution, where your company will instead rent space in a hyperscale data center, thus saving USD millions or even billions in construction costs and other associated charges.</p>



<p>Both options offer compelling arguments for their adoption. So, hyperscale vs. colocation—which do you choose?</p>



 Big systems, costly decisions 



<p>When deciding between building hyperscale data centers or renting in colocation data centers, there are many variables for hyperscale customers to consider. To effectively weigh the decision, one must consider the total costs of ownership versus renting—plus a range of other, tangentially related issues.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a> options have their advantages and disadvantages. Both options deliver complex <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> solutions. Both are based on complicated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure">digital infrastructures</a> and depend on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>, the underlying concept of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>.</p>



<p>To make the smartest decision possible, it’s important to first focus on each option, and check out their advantages and disadvantages.</p>



 What is a hyperscale data center? 



<p>Hyperscale data centers represent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data s</a>torage on a gigantic scale. According to the Independent Data Council (IDC) definition of a hyperscale database, as reported by <a href="https://www.viavisolutions.com/en-us/what-hyperscale-data-center">VIAVI Solutions</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), to be considered a true hyperscale data center, it must contain at least 5,000 servers and occupy at least 10,000 square feet of physical space. There is no hard-and-fast guideline concerning energy usage, although most hyperscale data centers use somewhere between 100 megawatts (MWs) and 300 MWs.</p>



 Components that go into building a hyperscale data center 



<p>It’s not an overstatement to say that creating an on-premises hyperscale data center from the ground up is a major endeavor—one that will require deep pockets and considerable effort. Even a simple listing of basic components provides a sobering idea of the project’s overall complexity and pricing:</p>



 
 A tract of land that can support a structure of at least 10,000 square feet. 



 Development costs to survey the land, clear the site and prepare it for construction. 



 One structure with at least 10,000 square feet of floor space. It should be built sturdily enough to support normal operations as well as withstand normal building “wear and tear,” plus any relevant local conditions, such as extreme weather situations or even geological occurrences. 



 Fire-safety equipment that is sufficient for protecting the building and its operators, such as sprinkler systems and extra extinguishers, as well as the development and instruction of fire-safety Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 



 A parking lot of sufficient size to support the number of vehicles used by data center operators, as well as ample parking room for any emergency vehicles that might be needed. 



 Cooling system equipment to offset the immense heat generated by 5,000 servers operating 24 hours per day. 



 Specialized water lines and piping to support the cooling system. 



 Dedicated and reinforced power lines and equipment to safely handle massive electrical loads. 



 Back-up power systems in case of mainline outages. 



 At least 5,000 servers. 



 Metal (or wooden) racks for housing 5,000 servers. 



 Associated IT equipment. 



 Reinforced cabling to connect 5,000 servers. 



 Networking equipment to connect 5,000 servers. 



 Telecommunications (telecom) equipment. 



 Specialized firewalls and other protocols for enhancing the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> of data centers. 
 



<p>Keep in mind that this list is in no way comprehensive and doesn’t represent the full costs associated with building a hyperscale data center. For example, it doesn’t include the primary asset needed for such activities: electricity. Nor does it mention the complicated and possibly expensive agreements that will need to be struck with local governments and communities. The list does, however, suggest how complex and multi-faceted this undertaking can be by showing that what’s being constructed is nothing less than a full-scale data factory.</p>



 What is colocation? 



<p>Some organizations are interested in the power and potential of hyperscale computing but have no wish to build their own data center, especially once they see a breakdown of all associated costs.</p>



<p>The concern of such companies is understandable and legitimate; the sums of money required to operate in this space are not small. Depending on the facilities constructed, some use cases will require USD millions or even billions. Businesses building hyperscale data centers do have to maintain deep pockets—both when they construct the facility and then during its entire operation. A hyperscale data center should not be considered a one-time purchase.</p>



<p>Colocation, on the other hand, is simply a situation wherein one company owns a hyperscale data center and rents out its facilities, servers, bandwidth and/or space to interested businesses that presumably do not have their own data center facilities.</p>



<p>The obvious benefit for the company renting space in the off-site data center is that doing so saves it from having to make its own large-scale investment into a hyperscale data center. Viewed another way, what the company is, in fact, purchasing when it rents out data center space is flexibility. By opting for colocation, the company can delay the significant investment in a hyperscale data center until a later time, keeping its cash reserves right where they are.</p>



<p>There’s even a specific term for when smaller companies make a gradual entry into this market— retail colocation, which allows organizations to start slowly. Typically, this plays out like this: The company sets up servers within a colocated environment and starts getting the feel for the process. Then the business begins experimenting with different cloud deployments, trying on different configurations and checking them for fit.</p>



<p>So, colocation (and retail colocation) allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of hyperscale, without the major investment required to make it happen. On the other hand, nobody’s going to let a company use their hyperscale data centers for free, as anyone trying to negotiate such an arrangement soon learns. Further, since you’re renting these facilities, you should probably accept the fact that a colocated data center will not provide the same perfect “fit” as custom-built hyperscale data centers.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose to build a hyperscale data center or rent space through a colocated data center, organizations usually need to designate someone as an integrator to shepherd the project across all possible hurdles and into completion.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this blog post, the integrator is you.</p>



 Hyperscale vs. colocation: Biggest misconceptions 



<p>It’s interesting that at such a “modern” time as this, when whole new vistas of computing are opening up, that some people’s attitudes are still trapped in old ways of thinking. For example, when you see the phrase “buy or rent,” certain longtime assumptions can still come to mind:</p>



 
 Renting options are primarily provided for those who can’t afford to make purchases. 



 Persons or organizations purchasing items can afford such purchases. 



 Renting options are primarily provided for those subject to frequent moving around. 
 



<p>While the first two statements contain some measure of truth, the only statement that’s fully true is the final bullet point. Renting options, it turns out, are indeed perfectly designed for people whose work keeps them in constant motion and relocating to different areas.</p>



<p>So, there’s validity to the third bullet point. The first two contain various levels of validity.</p>



<p>Let’s take the second bullet point first. While it is true that most people and companies can afford the purchases they make, you can’t always bank on it. We’ve seen example after example of companies, families and individuals who were supposedly wealthy—until it was suddenly discovered that they weren’t. Bottom line: Without seeing a verified financial balance sheet, there’s really no way to know what’s going on with a company or a person and who can afford what.</p>



<p>But it’s the first bullet point that can be most misleading because it could definitely be a valid business strategy for a company to avoid building hyperscale data centers and instead rent colocation facilities and services. Businesses have to walk a complicated financial line and part of that is keeping enough cash in reserves. Hyperscale data centers can cost USD millions or even billions to build and operate, quickly turning a thriving company cash-poor because of the massive commitment it has made to this technology.</p>



 Who are colocation’s biggest users? 



<p>Prepare to be surprised, because some of the world’s biggest users of wholesale colocation services are actually Amazon (AWS), Google and Microsoft. Actually, each of the “Big Three” data center providers either currently rent out some of their space from other colocation providers or have done so in the past. For example, members of the “Big Three” have leased significant data center space from a company called Equinix, which owns and runs 260 data centers in 71 markets. Then, these cloud service providers turn around and rent out their newly acquired space to users.</p>



<p>That this practice occurs should surprise no one; most economies function using mid-level distributors that are instrumental in moving goods or services from Point A to Point B. Still, based on their collective clout in this market, it is intriguing that some of the world’s largest providers of data center infrastructure are also some of its biggest customers.</p>



<p>Not that there’s any shortage of external data center customers. The market is sizzling hot right now and has been for a while now. For example, Synergy Research Group reported in April 2023 that the first quarter of that year saw a USD 10 billion jump over Q1 2022 <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/q1-cloud-spending-grows-by-over-10-billion-from-2022-the-big-three-account-for-65-of-the-total">spending on data centers</a> (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Most recently, there has been a perceptible shifting of corporate assets among giant companies to enable their concentration on establishing data centers. As <a href="https://www.costar.com/article/1327223979/microsofts-cloud-computing-income-soars-paving-way-for-more-data-centers">real estate</a> analyst CoStar (link resides outside ibm.com) reported in October 2023, “While Microsoft and other tech giants such as Google, Meta and Amazon have made deep cuts to their once-vast office portfolios, they have increased spending on development of data centers.”</p>



 Things to consider when deciding between hyperscale and colocation 



<p>For companies who are strictly compelled by the bottom line, the matter routinely comes down to the simple comparison: Which is the cheaper alternative? But divining the answer to that rather complicated question usually involves a number of areas of comparison, some involving tangible quantities but others based on various intangibles that usually come into play and which should be considered:</p>



 
 First, assemble all the projected costs you can related to the building of a hyperscale data center to serve your company. 



 Next, try to carefully imagine and gather all the annual costs related to operating the type and size of hyperscale facility you have concepted. Remember to factor in the cost of needed labor, even if it’s just a skeleton crew, as well as any security staff kept on-site. 



 The next part of your due diligence is to repeat the last step, but this time, project the annual operating costs of using a colocated data center. And don’t be surprised to learn that even though this type of solution requires no construction costs, there may still be imposing start-up fees involved with working with this technology. 



 At this point, you should possess enough data to run time-based comparisons for various intervals, so you can answer that original question about which is the cheaper alternative. 
 



 Questions to ask 



<p>However, by this point, you will have surely realized that when it comes to data centers of this magnitude, a bottom-line comparison doesn’t tell the entire story. There are many questions and considerations to entertain. Before any organization selects either of these solutions, it would be wise for it to engage in a bit of serious soul-searching about what kind of company it seeks to be, both now and in the future:</p>



 
 What kind of organization do you have? If you’re part of the IT industry, that may affect your decision-making, because this technology directly targets the IT industry. If you’re at an IT company, it may be in your interest to go ahead and invest in a hyperscale data center. 



 Are you sure you can handle the costs? Hyperscale data centers are currently a “hot item,” and some businesses will base their decision on desire, instead of need. But, because we’re talking about such a sizable and ongoing investment, some extra forethought is warranted. 



 What level of control do you wish to maintain? If your organization has a “hands-on” culture that is apt to making constant tweaks to the system, you may want to build your own hyperscale data center. This will more easily enable any customization your business desires. 



 How concerned are you about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a>? Hyperscale data centers consume huge amounts of power, often more than the villages or towns near them. Although it’s not impossible to hyperscale and avoid leaving a heavy carbon footprint, it may be more difficult. 



 What new technologies do you want to incorporate? It’s essential to envision not only where your company wants to be tomorrow but also down the road. Will the solution you select let you incorporate emerging technologies, such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>? 
 



 The real bottom line 



<p>As you’ve probably already figured out, there are few quick or easy answers when it comes to deciding between building a hyperscale data center or renting space from a colocated data center. There are simply way too many issues at work to make a casual decision one way or the other.</p>



<p>It might even be such a weighty decision that you need more than one person to help make the call. If so, the integrator may need additional staff to help divide up and tackle the different decision areas that require extra study. For example, you may need to assign a staff member to handle any ecological impact statements that will need to be drafted and submitted before a building site can be legally cleared for construction.</p>



<p>As for parting advice, make sure you do your homework in full. The stakes of this decision are very high indeed. Not only are we discussing vast sums of money, we’re also talking about issues that have a direct and perhaps lasting bearing on an organization’s fiscal health. Therefore, when feasible, get the freshest data that exists. Create contingency plans defined according to data-center-performance levels. You must be thorough in your thinking and cover every angle possible. That’s how you’ll draft a blueprint for success—no matter which type of system you choose.</p>

Introduction: Towards Decentralized Artificial Superintelligence <p>Speed of AI. With the release of the latest LLMs, the pace of innovation in AI has noticeably accelerated from its already fast pace. It’s now a torrent of innovation that every single startup, decentralized project and large multinational must come to terms&nbsp;with.</p><p>Decentralized AI. As three of the longest serving OG teams of the decentralized AI world, committed to open and beneficial AI, committed to decentralization and striving to build exit ramps away from centralized monopolies; we aim to give AI researchers, companies and governments an alternative that doesn’t lock them into walled gardens and silos to tilt to a particular bias, or worse, allow the risk of user de-platforming and the loss of their intellectual property, social graph and followers.</p><p>The need for scale. The resources needed to win this competition are immense. We joked internally that we are the “Rebel Alliance” against the large platforms — but it’s actually no joke. The world needs a full, vertically integrated stack of decentralized tools to harness and leverage AI, and give users an alternative in case the monopolies no longer serve the needs of all&nbsp;users.</p> Why NOW? <p>AI is not only moving fast, it’s accelerating. AGI and ASI loom&nbsp;near.</p><p>Artificial General Superintelligence (AGI) — when an AI system can perform all human tasks at least a human level of competence — looms near. The acceleration will continue past AGI, straight to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) when AI systems perform at far-beyond human levels of competence.</p><blockquote>It is imperative for humanity that artificial superintelligence is fundamentally decentralized.</blockquote><p>Not just “don’t be centralized” but can’t be centralized. Artificial superintelligence must be decentralized across the whole technology stack: from the network infrastructure, to AI infrastructure software (agents, data), to AI models &amp; prediction.</p><p>We at Fetch, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET have been leading decentralized AI for the past seven years. In fact, the founders of each have been driving AI for decades before that. We’ve been building towards fundamentally decentralized network infrastructure, decentralized AI infrastructure software (agents, data), and decentralized AI models &amp; prediction. We have long been aligned philosophically, with mutual respect among the teams, and have had several specific project collaborations.</p><blockquote>We have been building and moving quickly. Yet, centralized AI has moved faster and accumulated enormous capital: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><blockquote>If we want AI to be fundamentally decentralized, we must deliver decentralized AI, with scale, stronger and more robust: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><p>Charlie Munger famously said “Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome.” Well, here are the incentives. In this singular move, we have aligned the economic incentives of these teams and their communities.</p> 2. Pillars of&nbsp;Focus <p>Our efforts — as group of three organizations — will follow three&nbsp;pillars:</p>  We’re building decentralized Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) — for humanity and for the&nbsp;future.  On the continuum from today to the future, we balance the ASI future with efforts on decentralized AI tools for present-day applications in business and retail users. These are the world-class tools that all three Foundations have built; we will continue to develop&nbsp;these.  AI, AGI and ASI want compute, specifically the silicon and the energy to power the compute. We intend to use the scale of $ASI to move even more aggressively in securing compute for AI, decentralized-style.   3. Complementary Strengths <p>The Superintelligence Alliance brings together the best of decentralized AI.</p><p>Each team Fetch, Ocean, SingularityNET have strengths that can be leveraged by the Alliance. We’ve all been building different parts of the decentralized stack, with little overlap. SingularityNET has been building a path to AGI &amp; ASI, and is strong in R&amp;D — with seven live projects launched, many with their own tokens. Fetch has an L1 network that we can all leverage, leading edge technology for AI Agents, and recently invested $100 million in GPUs. They also have a top-notch business development and commercialization team. With Ocean, we’ve assembled a lot of building blocks to allow decentralized data sharing, access control and payment. Our Predictoor product has seen over $800 million in volume, just six months since launch, and it has its own exponential path to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Teaming up allows us to leverage a deeper bench of AI &amp; crypto builder talent and evangelists, spanning the globe. The Alliance has some of the leading researchers, developers and commercialization know-how, under one umbrella to push adoption of decentralized technology.</p><p>Finally, the value-flow from deep research, to tools &amp; applications, and finally to large-scale commercialization of data and AI services is now possible — all while giving users full control and&nbsp;choice.</p> 4. How the Alliance Becomes Greater than the&nbsp;Parts <p>The Superintelligence Alliance exists to give people the freedom of choice to own and control their data and AI, to respect each person’s autonomy and sovereignty. This is more important than ever in a world with artificial general intelligence then artificial superintelligence.</p><p>We apply these principles to our own collaboration as well. Even though a common website for the Superintelligence Alliance will be put up, each Foundation — Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET — will remain as independent legal entities, with the existing leadership, teams, communities and token treasury. As a baseline, existing initiatives from each Foundation will continue as planned. Any changes with respect to a given Foundation’s offering will be announced via official channels. Specific for Ocean Protocol: everything will continue as-is for now with the exception of Passive Data Farming and Volume Data Farming; details are&nbsp;below.</p><p>To a large extent, each Foundation already exhibits varying levels of decentralization in the control of the token, governance, the diversity of the community and the number of independent spin-out projects.</p><p>Over time, as the Foundations collaborate and the teams get the chance to work more closely together, we will announce joint projects and collaborations — either internally to strengthen the overall product offering and improve the user experience, or externally to bring stronger go-to-market services for large and enterprise customers.</p><p>Each Foundation is free to do as they like, to bring forward the values and adoption of decentralized AI — without coercion or compulsion to pressure other Alliance members. When cross-team collaborations make compelling and pragmatic sense, we’ll do it. If it doesn’t, two teams could be working on a similar topic with different approaches. Community members are free to join, and free to leave at all&nbsp;times.</p>Figure 1 — Levels of Integration of the Superintelligence Alliance<p>Governing council. To manage this symphony of decentralization, a governing council will be formed with Humayun Sheikh as Chairman, Ben Goertzel as the CEO, and Trent and Bruce will represent Ocean Protocol and we’ll do our part to contribute to a shared Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The text above it is essential, as it forms the core principles of our Alliance, and will guide how we move forward. Enticingly, this flexible framework leaves open the opportunity for other decentralized teams who share our values to join the Alliance in the future, to add even more strengths and capabilities.</p> 4. The New $ASI&nbsp;Token <p>From Day 1, the $ASI token (the renamed $FET token) will have a market capitalization ranking it around #20 on CoinMarketCap. This placement gives the Alliance significantly more exposure to a broader, global audience and puts $ASI as a strong candidate to be included in any index-based AI and crypto-ETF.</p><p>There are 225,000 wallet holders of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, as well as several hundred thousand more holders who leave their tokens on exchanges.</p><p>With the rise in token ranking of $ASI, we can expect our community to grow rapidly, and with it, an increase in trading volumes and attention from sophisticated players.</p> What Happens&nbsp;Next <p>With the announcement live, each Foundation will speak to business partners, answer questions from the community and start to plan the next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The first priority is to execute the token merge. The $FET token will be the reserve token of the Superintelligence Alliance. It will be renamed $ASI — ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’ Holders of $OCEAN and $AGIX need not do anything right now. You can continue to hold your tokens without worry as the exchange rate between $FET/$ASI and $OCEAN is fixed to 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and the 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. Holders can choose to swap their tokens as soon as the token swap tool is available, or 10 years from now if they want to, at their leisure. The exchange rate will remain fixed. There is no&nbsp;rush.</p> Token Exchange Mechanism <p>Starting with $FET as the base token of the Alliance, the $FET token will be renamed $ASI, and an additional 1.48 Billion tokens will be minted, with 867 million $ASI allocated to $AGIX holders and 611 million $ASI allocated to $OCEAN token holders. The total supply of $ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>We took a snapshot on Monday, 25 March 2024. Here is the Max Supply (#) and Fully Diluted Value ($)&nbsp;summary:</p>Figure 2 — Fully Diluted Valuation ($) and Max Token Supply (#) of&nbsp;$ASI<p>Here is the calculation basis for the token minting to give a proportional share of new $ASI tokens to $OCEAN and $AGIX&nbsp;holders:</p>Figure 3 — Token Supply Calculation<p>Token holders will receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. This exchange rate is fixed and will not change. We expect that smart arbitrageurs will notice if a price differential between the tokens arises, and then arb it out to maintain a balance and equilibrium in the exchange&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. Actions for Token&nbsp;Holders <p>$FET Tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $FET tokens on an exchange, they will be automatically relabeled as $ASI tokens. No action is needed from you. We’ll coordinate with the exchanges on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>$OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange.</p><p>One day, you’ll log in and you won’t see your $OCEAN or $AGIX — but don’t panic! The tokens are there — look for the $ASI symbol near the top of the&nbsp;list.</p><p>Don’t Deposit $OCEAN / $AGIX tokens into Exchanges after they’ve Executed a Conversion</p><p>When an exchange has converted all $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, the tickers $OCEAN and $AGIX will be retired from the exchange. If anyone accidentally sends $OCEAN or $AGIX an exchange after the conversion event, we cannot guarantee that the tokens will be available or converted to $ASI. So please keep abreast of notices and announcements from your exchanges.</p><p>If you hold $OCEAN or $AGIX outside of an exchange and want to convert them to $ASI tokens, please see the next paragraph.</p><p>$OCEAN / $AGIX Tokens in Hard Wallets or&nbsp;Offline</p><p>For those of you holding your tokens in hard wallets or offline, a token swap mechanism will be available in the coming weeks to allow holders to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for&nbsp;$ASI.</p><p>Once made available, this swap mechanism will be available indefinitely to allow long-term stakers to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for $ASI tokens when their tokens unlock, without any FX or exchange&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Data Farming &amp;&nbsp;Staking</p><p>Some of you have locked your $OCEAN for up to 4 years in Data Farming. We’ve got you covered. Appendix 2 on Data Farming has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Timing for the Token Swap Mechanism</p><p>The token swap contracts have been tested and audited but given the complexity of the coordination with hundreds of business partners, we’ll complete a more detailed analysis, speak with partners &amp; exchanges, and come back to the community with a firm date to release the token swap tool. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>DEXes and Pool Liquidity</p><p>We encourage liquidity providers to remove any $OCEAN and $AGIX related liquidity from DEXs at your convenience. Users may experience higher slippage in pools with lower liquidity. We recommend that you size your swap according to the available liquidity to minimize slippage.</p><p>Once you have your removed liquidity and have OCEAN in your wallet, wait until token swap contracts are ready to use and exchange OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Once a threshold of 95% of the $OCEAN and $AGIX token supply is converted to $ASI, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Foundations will remove any pool liquidity that we have provisioned.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>We’re excited. You’re&nbsp;excited.</p><p>This Alliance makes sense because the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We can move faster, aggressively deliver more features and have the scale to compete globally and commercialize a decentralized stack of&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Our ambition is nothing less than to accelerate the path to artificial superintelligence, while carving out an essential role for humans and respecting the dignity and sovereignty of each one of&nbsp;us.</p><p>The covenant that we make to you, our community and the Superintelligence Alliance is the same — we will build the tools to help every human have a chance to thrive in a future where AI, AGI and ASI is a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join us. Build with us. Be a part of the movement.</p> About Ocean <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable businesses and individuals to trade tokenized data assets seamlessly to manage data all along the AI model life-cycle. Ocean-powered apps include enterprise-grade data exchanges, data science competitions, and data DAOs. Our Ocean Predictoor product has over $800 million in monthly volume, just six months after launch with a roadmap to scale foundation models globally.</p> Appendix 1: Beware of&nbsp;Scams <blockquote>Most Importantly, We Really Can’t Stress this Enough — BEWARE of SCAMS&nbsp;!!!</blockquote><p>Our number one priority is to protect the community.</p><p>Moments like these are a prime time for scammers to appear with tempting, time-sensitive, “click-now!” links. Don’t fall for it. It breaks our hearts every time someone is scammed because there’s little we can do other than maybe file a police&nbsp;report.</p><p>We cannot stress how important it is to maintain vigilance and remember — there is no time urgency to swap your $OCEAN / $AGIX for $ASI. Do it at your&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>Here are some ways to stay&nbsp;safe:</p>  Cross-verify any call to action to exchange your tokens. Visit Fetch, Ocean Protocol and/or SingularityNET Twitter/X handles and check if our Tweets point to the same url or destination.  Rely only on official sources that you independently type in the destination on your browser and avoid following any links. There are many impersonator websites designed to look authentic, to steal your tokens. For instance, on Twitter — if you see @FetchAI, check the number of followers — it should be 200,000. Most impersonators will have only 50 bot followers — that’s a clear sign of a&nbsp;scammer.  In Telegram, only click on links from the pinned notices posted by Admins. Admins have been explicitly instructed not to post links in the message threads. All official messages will be pinned, not in the deluge of scrolling messages.  For Telegram/Discord, always use public channels or threads and do not engage in private messages promising to&nbsp;help.  Our Admins are instructed NEVER to proactively reach out to users. Be extremely wary of any direct messages from an “Admin” with a call to action. We’ve designed the process so that users can swap their tokens at their leisure with no urgency. The exchange rate is fixed between $OCEAN / $AGIX and $ASI, so regardless of price action — you will get your allocated share of&nbsp;$ASI.  NEVER share your private key or seed (12, 15,18, 24 words) used to generate your wallet with anyone, nor enter them into a&nbsp;website.  If you have a problem, reach out via Twitter/X by writing a DM or posting a public Tweet. One of our admins should see it and respond using the official account from Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET. Nonetheless be very wary and maintain vigilance for any links and rely only on official sources and websites.  If you do fall for a scammer and you post a plea for help on a forum or Telegram, more scammers will come out of the woodwork to offer you to recover your tokens for a fee. Don’t fall for this scam. Send a message via Twitter to either Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET and one of the Admins will get back to&nbsp;you.  <p>Stay safe! People will try to scam you out of your hard-earned tokens. We’ve designed the process so that you can swap your tokens in a relaxed manner with no rush. If you are unsure, Ask and keep asking until you are 100% sure that it is safe to execute the&nbsp;actions.</p> Appendix 2: Data Farming &amp; OCEAN&nbsp;Locking <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program.

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Unite to Create <br>Artificial Superintelligence Alliance  Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized Alternative to Existing AI Projects Controlled by Big Tech<br> <br>Combined value of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX is USD$7.6 Billion as of March 26,&nbsp;2024 <p>Zug and Singapore — March 27, 2024 — SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, have launched the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The creation of the largest open-sourced, decentralized network through a multi-billion token merger is a major step that accelerates the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>The Alliance is the brainchild of three leading minds in decentralized AI. Dr. Ben Goertzel, renowned as the “Father of AGI”, founded SNET as a blockchain-based marketplace and framework for AI services. Deep Mind founding investor Humayun Sheikh built Fetch.ai as a decentralized multi-agent platform to deploy and commercialize AI applications. Trent McConaghy, the architect of the AI-based software that most chip designers use to drive Moore’s Law, formed Ocean Protocol to provide a platform for data exchange and the seamless trade of tokenized data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>As part of the formation of the Alliance, the $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens that fuel the three Alliance member networks will be merged into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and&nbsp;power.</p> Built for Super Intelligence <p>“As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests,” comments Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SNET. “They should be rolled out in an open, democratic and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”</p><p>“In a world of exponential AI innovation, the giants of Big Tech dominate the headlines and conversation,’” remarks Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.ai CEO &amp; Founder. “We are forging a different path. Our mission with this merger is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent AI that facilitates direct interactions between developers and users to bypass the traditional gatekeepers of centralized authorities. This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem and encourages global participants to contribute.”</p> Compelling Strategic Rationale   Capitalizes on Rise of AI and Growth of Three AI Projects: The combination is born of a period of unprecedented growth for the AI projects. The deal provides an unparalleled opportunity for these three influential leaders to create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization.  Creates a Decentralized AI Infrastructure at Scale: Decentralized AI leverages blockchain technology to turn AI systems, whose inner workings are hidden from the public, into open networks for coordinating machine intelligence towards shared objectives. The fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies and products creates a foundation to build a scalable AI infrastructure which ensures ethical and trustworthy practices.  Accelerates Investment into AGI: Goertzel, Sheikh and McConaghy have long been acolytes and early-adopters of Artificial Intelligence — all focused on making AGI a reality. This Superintelligence Alliance facilitates the commercialization of each foundation’s technology, and enables wide scale access to cutting-edge AI platforms and large databases. This groundbreaking move advances the path to AGI on the blockchain.   Transaction Details <p>Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO &amp; Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&amp;D, applications and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified $ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. $ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”</p><p>When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will&nbsp;occur:</p>  $FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens, and a starting price of&nbsp;$2.82  $AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1  $OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1  $ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as at March 26,&nbsp;2024).   Leadership and Governance <p>Upon closing of this token merger, a governing council for the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will monitor and guide operations of the newly merged tokenomic network. The Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. The organizations that guide development of the three merging networks, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation and SNET Foundation, will continue to operate as separate entities, but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and in the operation of the Alliance.</p><p>“Among our many commercial and research goals for this combined network to work is to launch a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system with globally-superior capabilities in key areas like logical and scientific reasoning and artistic creativity,” Goertzel continues. “The impact of such a system may greatly exceed what we’ve seen from significant LLMs and lead the global economy into a new era of beneficial decentralized AGI and&nbsp;ASI.”</p><p>“This alliance is a fantastic step forward for those who are left out of the technologies produced by big tech, which mainly targets the affluent. Billions of people on our planet do not currently have access to advanced AI technologies and tools. The Superintelligence Alliance is here to tear down barriers towards a decentralized, democratic, and ethical AI future, reducing inequalities and making the world a better place for us, for our children and grandchildren and generations to come. Decentralised governance gives everyone a voice and a say in the ethics and oversight of the most powerful tools ever invented.”</p><p>About SingularityNET</p><p>SingularityNET was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). According to Dr. Goertzel, AGI should be independent of any central entity, open to anyone and not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. The core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p><p>For additional information on SNET, visit: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a></p><p>About Fetch.ai</p><p>Fetch.ai, a Cambridge-based AI company, is redefining the possibilities of an intelligent and connected world through its AI agent-based technology.

<p></p> 
<p>Many strictly regulated industries such as banking and finance rely heavily on identity and access management solutions to secure their systems and infrastructure. Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the Okta breach last year, these organizations are attractive targets for hackers due to the nature and quantity of the information they handle. While hackers use sophisticated ransomware once access is gained, they obtain that access through surprisingly low-tech means: for example, by calling the companies’ help desks and, using a simple voice phishing (vishing) tactic to induce IT employees to disable two-factor authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Phishing awareness and resistance play a big role in protecting customer and corporate data, but organizations need a secure solution to safeguard their systems against phishing and credential theft, mitigating these attacks before they can occur. Many companies already manage physical access with ID badges, but integrating digital access control into these badges can offer one comprehensive solution that provides:</p> 
  
  Photo ID for visual verification  
  Access badge for door readers&nbsp;  
  Access token for passwordless digital authentication  
  
 The Value of Security Convergence — Combining Physical Security with Digital Security  
<p>Historically, physical security and digital security have been managed separately, working in parallel. Due to increasingly complex security threats, however, organizations require a more comprehensive approach to securing both physical and digital assets to reduce the risk of breaches.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following the 2023 breach, Okta recommended customers take several steps to better defend themselves against potential attacks by adding:</p> 
  
  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure administrator access  
  “Admin session binding,” requiring administrators to reauthenticate in certain instances  
  “Admin session timeout” defaulted to a 12-hour session duration and 15 minutes of idle time  
  
<p>These settings provide organizations with a more secure layer of roadblocks that limit how much hackers can do once they gain access to any systems. These settings require more frequent re-authentication by users, but a converged credential with FIDO2 authentication makes this a simple and more convenient process.</p> 
<p>The converged approach to identity management not only enables organizations to take a more holistic approach to threat management and have a more prepared security posture for preventing, mitigating, and responding to threats, but it provides users with a more convenient, passwordless solution for authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Converged Credential:  
<p></p> 
 Features of a Strong and Effective Converged Credential  
<p>Organizations in regulated industries need an identity solution that both complies with regulations and safeguards their operations against phishing and fraud. A converged credential streamlines security at both the physical and digital level, and includes the following features to eliminate the threat of phishing attacks:</p> 
  
  Secure, Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication. Requiring more than two authentication factors increases security. Such factors may include something the user has (the card), something the user knows (a PIN), and something the user is (biometric data, like fingerprints) to provide a higher level of confidence in the authenticity of the user’s identity. This means it does not use a password, OTP or other shared secret as a factor.  
  Alignment with Current Security Trends. Using a converged credential that aligns with modern security trends and standards – including FIDO2, Mifare®, and DesFIRE® – enables organizations to be confident that they comply with security regulations.  
  Passwordless Experience. Replacing passwords with local authentication methods enhances the user experience while reducing vulnerabilities associated with password breaches.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>While phishing is a relatively simple tactic, it has the potential to expose organizations to more complex and costly cyberattacks that could result in significant financial consequences, reputational harm, and customer dissatisfaction.</p> 
<p>By implementing a phishing-resistant solution, such as the converged physical and digital access credential solution offered by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/idemia">HYPR and IDEMIA</a>, organizations can be more confident in their ability to safeguard their operational and customer data from cyberattacks.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. Previously, higher security was at odds with creating a member experience, but there is a new approach.</p>



<p>You can create a better member experience AND increase security simultaneously with <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">reusable credentials</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>What are reusable credentials? Using cutting-edge verification technology, your members only verify themselves once during onboarding. After that, they will have credentials that work across all interactions with your credit union. The credentials cut down wait times, eliminate repetitive verification hassles, and create a seamless member experience at every touch point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this matters: This revolutionary approach has the potential to reshape the member journey by creating seamless interactions, increasing efficiency, and providing unparalleled member satisfaction. In addition to these benefits, this method also significantly minimizes fraudulent activities within your identity verification process.</p>



<p>How reusable credentials create a better member experience:</p>







 
 Streamlined Interactions: Reusable credentials eliminate the need for repetitive identity verification, ensuring a smooth and efficient member journey. 
 







 
 Reduced Wait Times: Members no longer need to endure long queues or waiting periods, as the verification process now takes seconds. 
 







 
 Smooth Branch Visits: With credentials persisting across interactions, in-person visits to the branch are quicker and more personalized, enhancing the overall experience. 
 







 
 Effortless Call Center Interactions: Members experience faster and more efficient interactions with call centers, as there is no need for extensive identity verification. 
 







 
 Stress-Free Teller Transactions: Teller interactions become stress-free as the burden of repetitive verification is lifted, allowing staff to focus on delivering a superior member experience. 
 







 
 Enhanced Security: While providing convenience, reusable credentials maintain the highest level of security. With unbreakable encryption, reusable credentials are tamper-proof and make fraud almost impossible. 
 







 
 Consistent Experience: Whether online or through mobile apps, members enjoy a consistent, secure, and frictionless digital experience, fostering trust and loyalty.

 Dive Deeper 



 How do Reusable Credentials Work? 



<p>Reusable credentials are a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>In the end, members can show their encrypted and unique credentials on their phones as irrefutable proof of who they are without disclosing information that can be used maliciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process looks like this:</p>







 
 Initial verification: Once a member is verified using robust authentication methods, the system creates a reusable credential that can be used across various services and applications. 
 







 
 Decentralized identity: Decentralized identity (DI) technology powers reusable credentials. This technology (that utilizes encryption and other cutting-edge tech) ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.&nbsp; 
 







 
 Secure communication: The DI system provides irrefutable and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure identity validation. 
 







 
 User control&nbsp;: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, DI empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>🎧 <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains Decentralized Identity to get the whole picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How Reusable Credentials Make a Better Member Experience for Credit Unions 



<p>Transforming Branch Dynamics for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>The traditional branch experience often involves members waiting in queues for identity verification, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. Not to mention that traditional identity verification methods (IDs, security questions, etc.) can be maliciously reproduced.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials significantly reduce branch wait times. Members breeze through the verification process, allowing them to focus on their financial needs rather than waiting in line. This streamlined experience enhances efficiency and leaves a lasting positive impression on members, contributing to their overall satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consistent Seamless Interactions for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>Reusable credentials create a credit union experience where every member interaction is smooth regardless of the channel. Whether a member interacts in-branch, over the phone, or through digital channels, the authentication experience remains seamless. Repetitive security questions and cumbersome verification processes that differ in every channel are replaced with a unified, efficient system, fostering a sense of trust and reliability.</p>



<p>Remember, in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said that safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. You can give members next-level security with reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Liberating Tellers for Member-Focused Excellence</p>



<p>Tellers are the face of the credit union, influencing member perceptions and experiences. However, the burden of identity verification often diverts their attention from delivering personalized service to preventing fraud.</p>



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller explaining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience on the job.</a></p>



<p>Reusable credentials liberate tellers from the time-consuming and stressful verification process, enabling them to concentrate on building meaningful connections with members. This shift in focus enhances the overall member experience, making each interaction more personalized, efficient, and satisfying.</p>



<p>Reusable Credentials are the New Era of KYC and Identity Verification</p>



<p>Reusable credentials are the perfect opportunity for credit unions to deliver an outstanding member experience. Beyond the technological upgrade, it signifies a commitment to efficiency, trust, and member-centric banking.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will be the future of credit union success by minimizing wait times, ensuring seamless interactions, and empowering tellers to prioritize member experience. Anonyome Labs is here to help you seamlessly add reusable credentials to your credit union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certificate lifespan is getting shorter</p>
<p>Over the years the cybersecurity industry has undergone notable transformations requiring organizations to implement new best-practice standards, often at a short notice.</p>
<p>In 2020, Apple unilaterally opted for shorter TLS certificate durations, reducing them from three years to 398 days, thereby increasing the burden on certificate management. Subsequently, Apple introduced shorter lifespans for S/MIME certificates at the start of 2022. In the past year, both code signing and S/MIME users faced additional alterations, while <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">Google proposed transitioning to 90-day certificates</a>, a subject we have explored in our <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/608200?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=player-page-feed&amp;utm_content=summit-page">latest webinar</a>. Anticipating further changes, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the looming risk of post-quantum (PQ) computing, organizations must enhance their agility.</p>
<p>Today, TLS/SSL certificates are typically valid for about a year, according to the Certification Authority Browser (CA/B) Forum requirements. This yearly renewal cycle is convenient for organizations to manage and schedule. However, transitioning to shorter-lived certificates, like the proposed 90-day validity period, will require more frequent renewal efforts. With 90-day validity, organizations will need to renew certificates four times every 12 months within that timeframe. In practice, due to the need for buffer time, certificates may need to be renewed every 60 days. Ultimately, this change could lead to replacing certificates more than six times every 12 months, depending on the renewal window chosen.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be required to handle both the management of digital certificates within their systems and the reverification of their domains every 90 days. According to Google’s <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a> initiative “more timely domain validation will better protect domain owners while also reducing the potential for a CA to mistakenly rely on stale, outdated, or otherwise invalid information resulting in certificate mis-issuance and potential abuse.”</p>
<p>Shorter certificate lifecycles will drive automation</p>
<p>Shorter-lived certificates offer numerous advantages, with automation being the foremost benefit. Google and other root programs advocate for automation to streamline certificate lifecycle management. Additionally, shorter certificate validity aligns with the upcoming adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC algorithms lack a proven track record as they are still relatively new. Consequently, there’s a necessity to potentially switch algorithms more frequently, with an unpredictable timeframe, including the vulnerability window of existing algorithms to quantum computer attacks. Automation plays a crucial role in supporting this increased renewal frequency.</p>
<p>Industry calls for automation to reduce security risks</p>
<p>While the 90-day proposal from Google has not officially been discussed in the CA/Browser Forum, both certification authorities and certificate consumers agree that automation is a necessity for a smooth transition to certificates with a shorter validity period. We can see a similar recommendation in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-16/">NIST Special Publication 1800-16</a>:</p>
<p>“Automation should be used wherever possible for the enrollment, installation, monitoring, and replacement of certificates, or justification should be provided for continuing to use manual methods that may cause operational security risks.”</p>
<p>Challenges of a 90-day certificate validity period for organizations</p>
<p>The need for TLS certificate workflows to be done multiple times a year means an increased workload for certificate operations, server owners, infrastructure, and webmaster teams. The inability to renew the domain verification and replace certificates at a rapid pace may increase the risk of outages. Additionally, the automated solutions do not guarantee a one-size-fits-all approach, as each context and organization has unique requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you consider your next steps and plan your strategy with these key points in mind:</p>
 
 Spend the time to prepare for a 90-day or shorter maximum certificate lifetime future so that you can seamlessly handle the change 
 Start thinking about your security model(s) and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">post-quantum</a> readiness 
 Consider how you pay for your certificates and evaluate how <a href="https://go.entrust.com/SSL-Flex2">subscriptions</a> can provide more deterministic costs 
 Invest in robust <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/digital-certificates/tls-ssl/entrust-certificate-services">certificate management</a> capabilities 
 Focus on standards-based APIs and integrations 
 Plan a path to support 100% automation, even if it means applying a hybrid approach for different parts of your organization

 IDnow explores the UK’s attitudes toward fraud prevention technology and the steps they’re taking to protect themselves. 



 



<p>Our recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report revealed worrying behavioral trends, such as a third of the public sharing ID documents via unencrypted channels and almost half of respondents not knowing what deepfakes were.</p>



<p>For an overview of the UK’s education gap when it comes to fraud, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">blog, ‘What does the UK really know about fraud?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second of a three-part series, we explore the nation’s attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology and the steps Brits are willing to take to protect themselves.</p>



 Fight fraud with biometrics. 



<p>Biometric identification, such as automated facial recognition, is an optimal way of identifying business partners and customers, achieving security goals and complying with regulatory requirements. Our survey discovered that almost two-thirds of Brits (63%) were already using biometric technology, like fingerprint scans or FaceID, to access their online bank accounts, or approve bank transfers, with another 10% planning on using it in the future.</p>



<p>Less than a quarter of the population (24%) do not use biometric technology and do not plan on using it in the future.</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology.

 Customer journeys: Start as you mean to go on. 



<p>The odd adage ‘start as you mean to go on’ rings true in every walk of life, especially in business, and especially at the beginning of a customer journey. Onboarding, the point at which the identity of the user is established and verified, is one of the most vulnerable stages for fraud. This is why service providers, especially banks or insurance companies, often establish more secure, but lengthier onboarding processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speedy, seamless customer journeys are incredibly important, especially in the digital world, 75%&nbsp;of the UK population said they would be willing to go through lengthier online onboarding processes for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, if it made it safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, over <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">£3 billion is lost to fraud every single year</a>. According to our survey, while over half of Brits (54%) would move banks, if they were to become a victim of banking fraud, almost a quarter (24%) would remain loyal and stay with their bank, while another 21% were unsure what they would do in the event of banking fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow said that this should act as a wake-up call for traditional banks and fintechs that want to protect their customers, and in turn their business. ““Between deepfake videos and spoof texts that pretend to be from banks, it’s becoming harder for consumers to know what’s genuine and what is fraud. Meanwhile, huge amounts of data are stored online, making everyone ever-more vulnerable to data breaches.”</p>



<blockquote><p>While technology can be a curse when it comes to tackling fraud, it also has the potential to be a solution to the problem.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Preferred identity verification methods. 



<p>The digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, there were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">61 billion digital identity verification check</a>s conducted in 2023, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be a physical identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document. Identity verification services can range from automated, expert-led to in-person. Each method fulfils different security, regulatory and convenience requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are numerous different methods of identity verification.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a> provides seamless 24/7 online experiences, enabling businesses to grow and scale with confidence, without compromising on security or data privacy. We offer extensive data checks from diverse and trusted sources, including official databases and credible records to confirm the existence of a legitimate identity in an intuitive and frictionless way. We also can validate more than 3,000 identity documents from 195 countries and growing. Our automated identity verification solutions leverage the latest in facial recognition and liveness technologies for seamless biometric verification, utilizing liveness, selfies and video to confirm the existence of an identity and that the person is physically present during the verification process.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a> ensures optimal KYC customization while maintaining a balance between security and accessibility. Our face-to-face video verification with expert assistance allows businesses to compare photo taken during account creation process with photo from identity document. And, with liveness detection, you can add an additional layer of assurance to detect and protect against a variety of presentation attacks. Our specially-trained experts ask specific questions to identify social engineering. Expert-led identity verification can also help organizations improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety and convenience. Protect your most vulnerable customers and ensure they don’t miss out on the services they deserve.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">In-person identity verification</a> enables your customers to have their identities verified at a public location, such as a gas station, near them. It also allows businesses to perform Point of Sale (POS) identification processes on-site. In-person verification ensures compliance with the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) and the Telecommunications Act (TKG) and a premium high-touch experience that doesn’t compromise on the speed and convenience of a digital solution.  



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a> are an integral part of identity verification and are crucial for businesses to protect their customers – and themselves – from fraudsters. KYC can ensure the power of identity is put back in the hands of the people it belongs to and the businesses they are trying to interact with.</p>



 



    



 



<p>According to the UK’s Fraud Awareness Report, the most popular method of identity verification in the UK is a combination of data checks and document / facial recognition. Although not particularly commonplace in the UK, 9% of Brits said they would trust a human agent conducting a live video verification call. In Germany, this is considered the most secure and accurate method of identity check, as the fraud expert&nbsp;can pick up emotional signs of distress or suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, around a fifth (19%) of respondents do not know what method to trust the most, which reveals a deeper lack of understanding of the different verification methods, their benefits and their drawbacks. This is something that should be addressed as part of ongoing fraud education efforts.</p>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=66fdb2ca674f">ChatGPT</a> debuted in November 2022, the hype and hysteria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to accelerate. Indeed, rarely can you read an article or watch a news clip without AI being inserted into the conversation. With AI-enabled <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/the-law-is-not-keeping-up-with-ai-deepfake-fraud-and-it-will-only-get-worse">deepfakes</a>, AI-displaced workers, alleged AI theft of intellectual property, and AI-fueled cyberattacks, the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/as-gen-ai-advances-regulators-and-risk-functions-rush-to-keep-pace">raging debate</a> is not only if and how to regulate AI, but also when and by whom.</p>
 Global Legislative Developments and Directives 
<p>Early calls for AI governance and industry self-regulation seem to be giving way to more rigid and enforceable legislative efforts. Afterall, world leaders are loath to repeat the unregulated social media experiment of the past 20 years that led to such unforeseen consequences as the rampant dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, fueling political and social upheaval.</p>
<p>To wit, the European Union is on the verge of passing the first comprehensive piece of legislation with the <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/the-eus-ai-act-and-how-companies-can-achieve-compliance">AI Act</a>, which promises to set the global benchmark for AI, much like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) did for data privacy protection. The AI Act provides prescriptive risk-based rules as to when AI can and cannot be employed, with severe penalties for non-compliers that include up to 7 percent of an enterprise’s global annual revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> this past fall, which is more expansive than the EU AI Act, contemplating everything from consumer fraud to weapons of mass destruction. The order demands more transparency from AI companies on how their models work and provides labeling standards for AI-generated content. However, an executive order is not a legislative act and the U.S. has already started down a decentralized path with individual states proposing their own legislation, including California’s <a href="https://statescoop.com/california-bill-would-form-new-ai-regulation-division/">Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act</a>, which aims to protect consumer privacy and promote ethical standards in the use of AI. Among provisions for transparency, accountability, and public engagement the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/californias-draft-ai-privacy-rules-show-ambitious-approach">draft rules</a> would require companies to conduct regular assessments of their AI systems to ensure compliance.</p>
 Perspectives and Considerations on AI Regulation 
<p>Proponents of AI legislation cite the protection of health, safety, fundamental human rights, democracy, rule of law, and the environment as paramount. However, others are concerned that legislation will hobble their domestic industry, ceding profits and AI supremacy to others, especially bad actors. On this note, the UK has taken a decidedly contrarian position with a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/united-kingdom-government-takes-pro-innovation-ai-approach-contrast-europe?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Main%20NL%2002/28&amp;utm_term=Main%20Newsletter">pro-innovation AI approach</a> that provides a policy of non-binding principles. Still others feel that <a href="https://medium.com/60-leaders/to-regulate-or-not-how-should-governments-react-to-the-ai-revolution-c254d176304f#:~:text=%2D%20AI%20is%20a%20powerful%20technology,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20abuse">AI does not warrant new or different regulation than traditional software</a>, stating that the only difference between the two is the ratio of data-driven to rule-driven outcomes, which does make AI behavior less transparent but not less deterministic.</p>
<p>Then there is the conversation around AI ethics and empathy, or rather the lack thereof. Those favoring a more laissez-faire approach to AI regulation assert that regulating empathy and ethics is not really an AI problem per se but embedded in the historical data on which the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) are trained. And this will take time to resolve with or without AI, and with or without regulation.</p>
<p>It seems regulators are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. No one wants to be the hapless bureaucrat that inadvertently enabled Skynet in the Terminator movie series, or the overeager regulator that quashed domestic innovation on the eve of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, ceding AI global leadership and economic prosperity for generations to come.</p>
<p>The path forward will be a balancing act, but the guiding star should be one in which AI is beneficial to all of humanity, regardless of country, status, or any other factor. A popular framework in this regard is that of Harmless, Honest, and Helpful AI. Initially proposed by the team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/training-a-helpful-and-harmless-assistant-with-reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback">Anthropic</a>, this approach focuses on reinforcement learning from human feedback and supervised fine-tuning to align a model that roots out inaccuracy, bias, and toxicity. This more curated approach can also help ensure that the AI is more secure as it can avoid eliciting a harmful and untrue output, and flag vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Discover the simplicity and security of magic link authentication in this article. We dive into how magic links work, providing a hassle-free and secure alternative to traditional passwords. By exploring its benefits, challenges, and comparison to other authentication methods, this post will equip you with valuable insights into this innovative authentication approach. Learn how magic links could revolutionize your online login experiences and enhance account security.</p>
 How does a magic link work? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a secure and user-friendly method of authenticating users during the login process. It sends a unique, time-sensitive URL to the user’s registered email address as a part of the authentication process.<br>
Instead of entering a password, users authenticate themselves by clicking on the received link. Once the magic link is clicked, the system validates the link, and if it’s correct and the private key hasn’t expired, the user gains access to the account.<br>
Magic links offer a passwordless approach to authentication, making it a compelling option in user verification methods and password breaches. It streamlines the password manager user experience, eliminating the need for password creation, memorization, and input. Moreover, a one-time password only helps reduce the risks associated with password-based attacks, such as brute force or password spraying attacks.</p>
 
The User Experience of Magic Links 
<p>From a user’s perspective, magic link authentication offers simplicity and ease. The user begins the verification procedures by providing their email address during the login process. Subsequently, a unique magic link URL is sent to the user who opens their email, which the user must click to complete the authentication process.<br>
This approach eradicates common pain points associated with passwords, such as the need to remember multiple passwords or frustration with password recovery processes. However, it requires users to access their email accounts. It ensures that their email account is secure, as the user’s email address becomes a single point of failure in this authentication model.</p>
 
Pros and Cons of Using Magic Links 
<p>Magic link authentication comes with many advantages, primarily focused on improving security and user experience. It mitigates risks associated with traditional passwords, such as the vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Moreover, it simplifies the user experience of passwordless authentication, reducing password fatigue and the inconvenience of password recovery processes.<br>
However, there are downsides to consider. The reliance on email as the user’s device and primary authentication method makes the user’s email provider or account a lucrative target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to a user’s email account, they can access any account that uses magic link authentication. Additionally, since emails can be intercepted or delayed, there’s a potential risk of identity fraud if the magic link falls into the wrong user friction hands or is not received by the user promptly.</p>
 
Technical Implementation of Magic Link Authentication 
 The Back-End Mechanism 
<p>The account creation and validation of magic links predominantly occur at the system’s back end. A unique token is generated when users open or request a magic link. This secret link token is usually bound to the user’s session and has a limited validity period to ensure security.<br>
The back-end system manages these tokens carefully, ensuring they are stored securely, usually in a hashed form, to prevent misuse in case of a data breach. Moreover, the tokens are matched and validated against the user’s user session and information when the magic link is accessed, ensuring the magic link endpoint hasn’t been tampered with or used beyond its expiration time.</p>
 
Front-End Handling and User Interaction 
<p>The user interacts with the system on their mobile device on the front end by requesting a magic link, usually by entering their email address login credentials. It’s essential to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience, guiding users through the process with clear instructions and feedback.<br>
The front end communicates with the back end to request the generation of the magic link and delivers it to the user’s inbox in just a few lines, typically via email. Additionally sign in screen and, it manages the redirection process once a user clicks on the magic link, ensuring that users are directed to the correct location and appropriate actions are taken based on the validity of the magic link.</p>
 
Security Considerations 
<p>Ensuring the security of magic links is paramount. The magic links work and should be generated using secure, random tokens that are hard to guess or predict. HTTPS should be the secure method used to transmit magic links to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.<br>
Furthermore, magic links should be time-bound, meaning they expire after a certain period or once used, preventing reuse or exploitation if intercepted after the validity period. Also, monitoring and alert mechanisms should be in place to detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as multiple failed attempts to access sensitive data breaches a magic link.</p>
 
Comparing Magic Link Authentication with Other Authentication Methods 
 
Magic Link vs. Traditional Username and Password 
<p>Magic link authentication simplifies the user login process, removing the need for password memorization and input. Unlike traditional username and password-based authentication methods, magic links offer enhanced security by mitigating common password-related attacks like brute-force or dictionary attacks. The absence of a password minimizes the risks associated with password reuse or weak passwords.<br>
However, traditional username and password methods have wide acceptance and familiarity among users and across platforms. While magic links streamline the authentication process for email providers, they also introduce a reliance on email provider access and security. In comparison, despite their vulnerabilities, passwords do not necessarily require users to gain access to another person’s identity or platform (email) as part of the authentication process.</p>
 
Magic Link and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
<p>Magic links can coexist and integrate with two-factor authentication (2FA) methods to authenticate access and bolster the mobile device’s security. While magic links replace the password, they can be used alongside a second, multi-factor authentication part, like a one-time passcode (OTP) or a biometric verification. This combination of authentication factors enhances the authentication process by requiring two separate verification steps, making unauthorized access more challenging.<br>
In contrast, using passwordless authentication with magic links alone simplifies the user experience but does not offer the same security assurance combined with a second authentication factor. Utilizing 2FA with magic links ensures a more robust security posture, providing additional protection beyond passwordless authentication.</p>
 
Magic Link vs. Biometric Authentication 
<p>Comparing magic links with biometric and authentication solutions highlights user experience and security level distinctions. Biometric personal identification methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, offer a seamless user experience, often requiring only a single action from the user. They also provide a higher level of security, as biometric data is unique to each individual.<br>
Magic links, while simplifying the authentication process, rely on the user’s email account security and the sent link’s integrity. The necessity to access an email to verify customers retrieved the magic link can be considered an added step in the sign in process when compared to the direct nature of biometric authentication. However, magic links do not require specialized hardware or sensors, making them more universally applicable and accessible.</p>
 
Future Prospects and Challenges of Magic Link Authentication 
 
Upcoming Trends in Magic Link Authentication 
<p>As technology evolves, magic link authentication is poised to benefit from emerging trends and innovations. Enhancements in email security and encryption technologies can make magic links work and link sharing and links more secure and resilient against attacks. Integrating the magic link emails and links with other authentication methods, like biometrics or hardware tokens, can also result in more secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Furthermore, as organizations continue embracing user-centric designs with a strong security strategy, magic links offer a pathway to more straightforward and intuitive authentication experiences. This user-centric focus and technological advancements can drive the broader adoption of magic links in various sectors and applications.</p>
 Security issues with magic links 
<p>Despite its benefits, the magic link email as a secure authentication method faces criticisms and challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. The dependency on email as a single point of authentication raises security concerns, as unauthorized email access can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, users without consistent email access or facing email delivery speed and deliverability issues might find magic links less convenient.<br>
Another challenge lies in user education and awareness. Users must be informed about authentication protocols, the secure management of magic links and the associated security risks to utilize this authentication method effectively and safely.</p>
 Expanding Adoption Across Industries 
<p>The versatility of magic link authentication facilitates its applicability across various industries. The finance, healthcare, financial institutions, and e-commerce sectors can leverage the magic link flow and links to enhance user experience and security. However, each industry must consider its unique requirements and challenges, such as regulatory compliance and user demographics.<br>
While magic link authentication presents a promising alternative to traditional authentication methods, its adoption requires a thoughtful strategy that aligns with industry-specific needs, user behaviors, and emerging technological trends. Such a nuanced approach can ensure the successful and secure implementation of passwordless magic link links in diverse sectors.</p>
<p>Magic Links allow for a simplified, passwordless login, promoting ease of access while maintaining security by providing users with a unique, temporary authentication link.

			 Hong Kong’s Competitive Leap: Fueling Tokenization Growth Across Asia 
<p>This month, we attended the Digital Assets Week Hong Kong conference and were struck by the rapidly growing ecosystem surrounding tokenization in the region. The gathering of regulator SFC and major institutions at the event sent a strong message:&nbsp;Hong Kong is positioning itself as a frontrunner jurisdiction for the tokenization of securities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Hong Kong has witnessed the emergence of numerous live tokenized securities projects alongside the CBDC pilot program (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/02/20230216-3/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HKSAR Government tokenized a green bond</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theasset.com/article/50768/hgi-launches-first-tokenized-fund-in-hong-kong?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HGI tokenized a fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20240207-tokenized-warrant.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">UBS tokenized warrant</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3254551/hong-kong-launches-worlds-first-wholesale-cbdc-pilot-city-positions-itself-cutting-edge-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">wholesale CBDC pilot</a>, …). The regulator provides clear guidelines, nurturing tangible use cases.&nbsp;This fosters regional competition for leadership in tokenization, driving the industry and the region forward.</p>
<p>Specifically, on 2 November 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced two circulars related to tokenized financial instruments: “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC52&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenized securities-related activities</a>” and “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC53&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products</a>”.</p>
<p>The guideline is straightforward:&nbsp;same securities, same rules, but with digital controls.&nbsp;There are four points we want to highlight:</p>
 
 Open for retail investors:&nbsp;Evolved from March 2019 “Statement on Security Token Offerings” where security token offerings are restricted only to professional investors (PIs), the new circulars permit primary dealings of tokenized SFC-authorized investment products by retail investors. These offers have to be authorized under Part IV of the SFO or have complied with the prospectus regime and not fall under any other applicable exemption under the Public Offering Regimes. Otherwise, the offers can only be offered to PIs. 
 Same business, same risks, same rules:&nbsp;The new circulars define that tokenized securities are fundamentally traditional securities with a tokenization wrapper, the existing legal and regulatory requirements governing the traditional securities markets continue to apply to tokenized securities. 
 Blockchain agnostic: SFC recognized all types of blockchain networks, including private-permissioned, public-permissioned, and public-permissionless. However, issuers have to address risks by implementing adequate controls regardless of the blockchains they use. 
 New risks management: Issuers have to address risks related to ownership (e.g., how it is transferred and recorded) and technology (e.g., forking, network outages, and cybersecurity). Elizabeth Wong from SFC emphasized in a panel during the DAW conference that issuers have to demonstrate to the regulators they have controls over their tokenized securities (e.g., recover tokens). 
 
<p>Here is an illustrative example of tokenized funds by SFC:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The risks highlighted in the circulars can be addressed with open-source ERC-3643, the validated and audited permissioned token standard:</p>
 
 Enforce compliance&nbsp;to ensure adherence to existing laws, and only eligible investors can interact with tokens, regardless of blockchain type. 
 Track ownership through identity-based on-chain registries to maintain the integrity of ownership records. 
 Take full control&nbsp;over their tokenized security to freeze or recover tokens as needed. 
 Enable multichain capability&nbsp;to address forking and network outage issues. 
 Upgradable implementation of smart contracts&nbsp;to ensure flexibility to address any vulnerability of the smart contract or updates of regulation. 
 
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;the circular mandates due diligence for tokenization technology, highlighting the importance of partnering with established players. With over 6 years of proven experience and enterprise-grade certifications like SOC2, Tokeny is well-equipped to support the Hong Kong market.&nbsp;The regulatory framework is in place, the technology is primed, and the market is set for rapid evolution!</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/m8umHdZBbHM">YouTube explainer video</a> on the browser changes underway to replace the functionality of third-party cookies when it comes to authentication services. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome.</p>



<p>There are several web features out there that support critical, basic security features like logging in and logging out. Those same features enable tracking individuals as they surf the web. Unfortunately, fixing this is not as simple as turning those features off for trackers. From a purely technical perspective, whether these features are used for authentication-related purposes or tracking, they are indistinguishable from the web browser’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, of all the features described in a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/03/16/understanding-browser-tracking-logins-the-invisible-trail/">previous post</a> that serve legitimate and clandestine purposes, third-party cookies are one of the more tractable problems to resolve. So, let’s look at where the work is happening, one of the new mechanisms being developed, and what the changes will look like.</p>



 The Role of the W3C in Browser Changes 



<p>The <a href="https://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is where most of the work happens between browser vendors and various other stakeholder groups to standardize functionality on the web. This global community effectively shapes the web, ensuring it’s secure, efficient, and open for everyone. Their work is crucial for the standards we rely on daily.</p>



<p>Diving into the details of how the W3C works is beyond the scope of this video, but feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more!&nbsp;</p>



 Federated Credential Manager (FedCM) 



<p>Now, onto <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">FedCM</a>. Developed by Google and incubated within the W3C, this API represents a significant shift in managing privacy and online authentication. As I mentioned earlier, a browser’s biggest challenge is distinguishing between acceptable use and hidden tracking. The purpose of the FedCM API is to help the browser determine whether a transaction is happening with the individual’s knowledge and consent. Let’s delve into how it works and why it matters.</p>



<p>Rather than acting like one of those annoying cookie banners, FedCM is designed to be called when an individual clicks on the login or sign-in button on a website. Before the website (the relying party, or RP) and the site responsible for authentication (the identity provider, or IdP) share any information, FedCM exists to mediate the transaction and make sure the individual is aware and ok with what’s happening.</p>



<p>Again, though, it’s not that easy. The FedCM developers must find a way to support some conflicting goals. For example:</p>



 
 Of course, the IdP needs to know what RP is asking for an authentication request! Our IdPs don’t talk to just anyone! 



 Of course, the IdP shouldn’t know anything about the RP! The IdP might track the sites the user visits! 
 



<p>Both statements reflect use cases that are 100% valid. There’s a reason this problem hasn’t been solved yet.</p>



 Other Initiatives 



<p>&nbsp;FedCM is just the tip of the iceberg. Google, Apple, Mozilla, and others are all innovating under the W3C’s umbrella, working together towards a more private web. These initiatives are reshaping our online experience. Some of their work focuses on enabling ethically targeted advertising (that’s happening in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">Private Advertising Technology Community Group</a>. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">Privacy Community Group</a>, on the other hand, has more than a few efforts in incubation, including one that’s focused on link decoration, known there as navigation-based tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each browser vendor also has their own internal projects that influence (and are influenced by) what’s happening in the W3C. Google’s <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a> is the most public of these efforts and describes various tools they’re trying to build a more privacy-preserving web experience.</p>



 Google’s Cookie Countdown 



<p>Coming back to third-party cookies, a major milestone is approaching. In Q1 2024, Google begins turning off third-party cookies for <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/">1% of Chrome users</a>. This test run is critical for their long-term privacy strategy. They are years behind Apple, a company that turned off <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/">third-party cookies in 2017</a> for Safari users. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Firefox</a> turned off third-party cookies by default in April 2023. Any changes Google makes, though, impact far more people. The Chrome browser has, by far and away, the largest market share of desktop browsers. They are also part of a much larger company, Alphabet, which still has several products that require third-party cookies to be available.&nbsp;</p>



 Real-world Impacts and Preparations&nbsp; 



<p>This shift on Google’s part to turn off third-party cookies by default for just a tiny fraction of their users might seem minor, but its implications are vast. Organizations must prepare for potential challenges and educate their people on these evolving technologies. Support desks already know to check to see a browser’s settings, but not everyone can or will call support. Companies should start turning third-party cookies off by default now to develop their plans, including testing out FedCM, to adapt to the changes.</p>



 Proactive Organizational Strategies 



<p>It’s time for businesses that aren’t browser vendors to be proactive in helping the web develop. Develop strategies, train your teams, and help define the solutions.&nbsp; It’s not just about reacting; it’s about being prepared for a new era of the web. I’ve had this conversation with individuals representing dozens of organizations in the last three years, and the biggest challenge is the executives who are entirely focused on their bottom line. And I get that. These executives want to know what to do and when to do it. Until they have answers to those questions, they are not inclined to assign resources to help other organizations figure out solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if these organizations want to make sure the web works the way they need it to, they need to invest in that bit of speculation. They need to assign people to test the proposed APIs and offer constructive feedback on how the code might be changed to suit their use cases.</p>



 Viewer Engagement and Further Learning&nbsp; 



<p>Eager to learn more about upcoming browser changes or get involved? There are links in the show notes to where the work is happening and how you can find out more. Your participation can influence the future of web privacy.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>We’ve covered a lot today, from the W3C’s vital role to the specifics of FedCM and beyond. Remember, these changes are shaping a safer, more private web for us all. Stay curious, stay informed.

 As the 2024 Olympic Games approach, the city of Paris is preparing to welcome an unprecedented influx of visitors. Mobility operators must be ready to respond to a substantial number of new customers in a very short span of time. 



<p>Over the past decade, urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has experienced major alterations, driven by rapid technological change. While getting around has never been easier, experiences vary from one operator to another. The advent of mobile-first is leading mobility service providers to focus their mobility journey around mobile-usage, in favor of a resolutely simplified experience.</p>



<p>In a world where mobility is at the heart of our lives, the organization of large-scale events raises major challenges in terms of accessibility and security. From July 26 to August 11, 2024, France will host the Summer Olympic Games, and is preparing for an unprecedented influx of visitors. These foreign visitors, accustomed to other modes of mobility and transport, will have to familiarize themselves in a short span of time with sometimes unfamiliar travel and booking experiences. Paris is equipped with many different means of transport, combining micromobility, public transport, service providers, transport rental companies and car-sharing. For mobility operators, the question arises as to their ability to accommodate a substantial number of new customers in a very short amount of time.</p>



 Let the games begin: challenges facing mobility operators. 



<p>Transport and urban mobility operators face a number of challenges: rapid user authentication, age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a>, and the collection of documentation and user information. To address these issues, identity verification service providers are positioning themselves as key players in meeting these needs, while ensuring a fluid and secure user experience.</p>



<p>In the context of a major event such as the Olympic Games, all mobility operators will be faced with many more demands during this period. Numerous people will be moving from various key points in a limited span of time. It therefore seems essential to simplify access to means of transport requiring a stronger means of identification, without compromising transaction security.</p>



 A seamless user journey, reflecting a smooth transport experience. 



<p>For mobility players, offering instant access to their services is crucial. When service users are confronted with a complex and unclear <a href="https://www.idnow.io/customers-experience/">onboarding process</a>, their frustration increases, as does the abandonment rate. A fast, accessible onboarding process, whatever the channel, becomes a major competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Operators are therefore seeking to offer their users a seamless experience, notably through a simplified, instantaneous and entirely mobile onboarding process. This means being able to quickly verify users’ age, the validity of their driver’s license or, in the case of some car rental companies, proof of address. One of the main challenges is therefore to minimize the time needed for these checks, while maintaining a high level of security.</p>



<p>At major events, such as the Paris Olympics in 2024, where mobility services will be particularly in demand, the ability to handle a high volume of requests becomes even more critical. Automated identity verification solutions can play a key role in this context. Not only do they considerably speed up the onboarding process by eliminating the need for manual account validation, they also ensure that the user meets the necessary conditions (age, valid license) to access the service.</p>



<p>In the case of rental contracts, the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">electronic signatures</a> to finalize transactions, and the automatic capture and extraction of information from identity documents, further accelerate the subscription process, without compromising the security of the transaction. Finally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video biometrics</a> enhances the security of mobility operators by ensuring that the person creating the account is who they claim to be, thus reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>For mobility operators, these tools are not only a means of improving the user experience, but also represent an opportunity to set themselves apart from the competition. In a context like that of the Olympic Games, it will also be important to respond efficiently to peaks in demand, while guaranteeing continuity and quality of service.</p>



 Mobility as a Service: the future of urban mobility? 



<p>For providers of transport services requiring advanced identity verification, such as car rental or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility services</a>, the implementation of appropriate solutions is crucial to effectively meet the influx of requests. Without automated systems, these operators risk being forced to invest in additional human resources, a costly and less efficient solution in the face of highly variable demand.</p>



<p>The solution could lie in the adoption of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a> service, offering a single account to access all a city’s transport and mobility facilities. Berlin’s <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">JELBI </a>sets the standard. By downloading this application, users fill in their information just once and can then access all the mobility services available in the city. This centralized approach considerably simplifies the user experience, reducing the complexity of accessing the various transport services. France, meanwhile, has yet to find its own MaaS operating model.</p>



<p>At a time when mobility is reinventing itself, security and ease of access to services are becoming major issues. As mobility is constantly on the move, it’s vital to understand the issues involved in order to anticipate tomorrow’s needs. The Paris Olympics will be an opportunity to test operators’ ability to manage the diversity of means of transport, to absorb the influx of visitors and also to test the means of identity verification available.</p>



<p>In this context, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is an indispensable solution, eliminating several points of friction for mobility operators. The aim is to enable users to access desired services quicker and to make their experience as seamless as possible. Operators, for their part, can look forward to being able to process flows faster by automating time-consuming and complex processes.</p>

It describes the “why” of a DCV bound on Volume DF rewards, what OCEAN rewards it led to, and how those numbers improved under Predictoor DF. It describes the bug and the fix, and how the Volume DF rewards changed due to the fix. It describes the issue of violating community expectations somewhat. Finally, it describes the fix: 5x Predictoor Boost, which restores Volume DF Rewards to ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> DF Budgets <p>Overall DF budget. We are in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">Data Farming Main 2 phase</a>, as Mar 14, 2024. From DF Main 1 to DF Main 2, the overall DF budget increased 2x.</p><p>Now, weekly rewards budget is 300,000 OCEAN (plus ROSE for Predictoor DF).</p><p>DF Budgets per Stream. DF is divided into streams. The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> About Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Volume DF is a substream of Ocean Data Farming. In it, users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Volume DF is not Active DF per se; it’s a subset of Active DF. Volume DF is not DF: there are several streams / substreams and it is one of them. Each stream is meaningful on its&nbsp;own.</p> The Wash-Consume Problem, and&nbsp;Fix <p>Early versions of Volume DF encountered a problem: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">wash consume</a>. Let’s explain. Volume DF rewards on DCV. People found a way to game this: publish data assets, then buy &amp; consume those assets themselves. A circular loop that drove up DCV. Volumes ballooned to&nbsp;$Ms.</p><p>This was not real volume, of course. And it is wasteful to reward OCEAN for this behavior. The aim is to reward OCEAN for things that truly drive value ot the ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s how we fixed wash consume: we ensured that rewards paid never exceed $ from fees. This works because fees themselves do not go into the pockets of the wash-consumers. Therefore anyone wash-consuming would lose $. (In Ocean, fees are baseline 0.1%; and baseline 20.1% for Predictoor feeds.)</p><p>The specific implementation is:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise. Call this the “DCV bounds” on the Volume DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This also means that some of the OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF for a given week may not get deployed as rewards for that week. Any OCEAN not rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> How much OCEAN is rewarded to Volume&nbsp;DF? <p>Before Predictoor was rolled out, DCV in Ocean was very small. And DCV_multiplier was 0.1%. So the DCV bounds (small DCV) * (small DCV_multiplier) = negligible number. Therefore OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF was negligible.</p><p>Then Predictoor &amp; Predictoor DF was rolled out, which caused both larger DCV and larger DCV_multiplier of&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Decent DCV. Predictoor came with Predictoor DF, where 37,500 OCEAN is spent as sales to buy Predictoor feeds. This is a “baseline” that incentivizes people to run Predictoor bots. In practice, it’s working extremely well, driving high activity and stake-to-predict volume. Predictoor feeds are the only meaningful contributor to DCV. So, DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Decent DCV_multiplier. Where other feeds had 0.1%, Predictoor feeds&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Let’s combine those: DCV bounds (decent DCV) * (decent DCV_multiplier) = decent-ish number. So, OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF comes out decent-ish.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We apply the formula above: 37,500 OCEAN volume, times DCV_multiplier=20.1% gives a bound of ≈7,500 OCEAN total. Therefore ≈7,500 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>The implementation described above was the intended behavior.</p> Discovery: a bug in DCV-bounds code <p>Thanks to decent DCV and decent DCV_multiplier in Predictoor DF, the Volume DF payout was supposed to be ≈7,500 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>However the payout ended up between ≈20,000-25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>That is, 2.67x-3.33x more OCEAN was being paid out for Volume DF, compared to the intended design of Volume DF. (Remember, this is only a bounds based on DCV of 37,500 OCEAN/week. If DCV was high enough, the full budget of Volume DF would be paid out: 112,500 OCEAN/week.)</p><p>Something was up in Volume DF payout calculations. We dug deeper. As of Fri Mar 15, 2024, we discovered the specific bug in those calculations.</p><p>The bug had applied data consume volume (DCV) bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account during&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Recall that the DCV bound for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier. Where “% stake in asset” is the amount of veOCEAN that a user has allocated, compared to the all veOCEAN allocated, for a given&nbsp;asset.</p><p>The bound was supposed to be on a per-asset, per-staker level.</p><p>But, the DCV bound code was written was only on a per-asset level. That was the bug. It missed the per-staker part. That is, “% stake in asset” was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>It meant that a user could create 10 separate accounts with 1/10 of her veOCEAN in each account, and get 10x more rewards compared to a single account. Yes, a Sybil attack. Anyone exploiting this flaw would be rewarded unfairly&nbsp;highly.</p><p>(To be clear: it wasn’t a security issue per se; there were no funds at risk. But it enabled people to game the system and get unfair rewards&nbsp;.)</p> Fixing the bug in DCV-bounds code <p>The core fix was to apply the DCV bound on a per-asset per-staker level. That is, to add the “% stake in asset”&nbsp;term.</p><p>We fixed the bug within hours of finding it. The first payout on the fixed code was for DF81, on Thu Mar 21. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9">DF81–82 blog post</a> provides further information: in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#a4c1">Section 5</a> (highly detailed); and with a complementary explainer in its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#2693">Appendix</a>.</p><p>The OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF never reduced. However, the amount paid out was reduced, because that payout is bounded by DCV, and DCV hasn’t been high enough to ignore this&nbsp;limit.</p> Bug Fix’s Effect on Volume DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>As expected, accounts doing Volume DF got reduced rewards in DF81&nbsp;payouts.</p><p>Smaller stakers (those with a small % stake on an asset) had larger APY drops than larger stakers. This is because the same DCV bound was (wrongly) only at the per-asset level. Each account saw the same bound. After the bug fix, the APYs should be identical.</p><p>Let us illustrate.</p>  If an asset has just one staker, where % stake = 100%, their Volume DF payout for that asset doesn’t change at all, because the new term “% stake in asset” = 1.0. So introducing it doesn’t change the&nbsp;numbers.  If a larger staker had 50% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 50%, ie a 1/0.5 = 2x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  If a smaller staker had 10% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 10%, ie a 1/0.1 = 10x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  <p>The above APY discussion is all for Volume DF. The APYs on Passive DF are independent; they’re at ≈20% these days. Passive DF APYs were not affected by this fix, since the fix is for Volume DF. Please don’t confuse Passive DF and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p> Bug fixed, but a second issue&nbsp;emerged <p>Like any professional software development team: we identified a bug; we fixed it asap; we deployed it; we communicated the&nbsp;changes.</p><p>However this caused a problem: people had locked OCEAN for years on the basis of seeing historical APYs in Passive DF and Volume DF. A long-term commitment which we appreciate.</p><blockquote>Those expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF.</blockquote><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>At the heart of the problem: Volume DF with the bug was ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN / week. After the bug fix, payout was ≈7,500 OCEAN / week (ie payout of DF81). That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. There were corresponding reductions in Volume DF APYs; those vary per-user as described above.</p> Towards addressing the second&nbsp;issue <p>How can we fix the problem of: expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF?</p><p>To make a specific goal: can we get Volume DF rewards back to at least ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week?</p><p>We have constraints:</p>  It doesn’t make sense to “undo” the bug fix, because then we’d still have the bug, with the issues it&nbsp;entails!  We want to ensure that DF code implementation reflects the intent of its designers (us).  As always, the design of DF and its sub-streams needs to remain flexible enough to keep evolving. All so that OCEAN rewards deployed most effectively drive traction in Ocean, and especially data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).  Related to the last point, some alpha: we do have other Data Farming sub-streams in the works! Those need breathing space. And, Predictoor is growing so the Predictoor DF weekly budget may increase&nbsp;too.   Introducing 5x Predictoor Boost <p>We are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. It is a solution to the problem&nbsp;above.</p><p>Recall:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>Before, Predictoor feeds had DCV_multiplier = 20.1%. 5x Predictoor Boost gives a 5x to this multiplier.</p><p>With 5x Predictoor boost, Predictoor feeds get DCV_multiplier =&nbsp;100.5%.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We haveDCV of 37,500 OCEAN from (due to Predictoor DF), times DCV_multiplier=100.5% gives a bound of 37,687.5 OCEAN total (≈37,500 OCEAN). Therefore 37,687.5 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>(And as DCV rises, up to the whole Volume DF budget of 112,500 OCEAN becomes available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.)</p><p>The 5x boost only applies to the first 37.5K rewards given out on Volume DF. After that, the usual dcv_multiplier=20.1% applies. This helps to ensure breathing space for new DF substreams or increased Predictoor DF&nbsp;budget.</p> Implementation of 5x Predictoor Boost <p>What happens&nbsp;today:</p>  Retroactively apply this new formula to DF81 payout (which was yesterday — Thu Mar 21, 2024). In practice, we have airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">Here’s the&nbsp;tx.</a>  <p>What happens in before next DF&nbsp;payout:</p>  Update the DF payout code to apply the 5x Predictoor boost, for future weeks. (Applicable to first 37.5K&nbsp;rewards)  Update documentation, etc as&nbsp;needed.   Conclusion <p>Due to a bug fix, the Volume DF OCEAN payouts shrunk. Previously, under the bug, payouts were about 20,000–25,000 OCEAN. DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction.

  <p>In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">previous blog</a> in the Data Exfiltration series, we discussed different types of tenant restrictions policy. In this blog, we’ll discuss migrating from tenant restrictions v1 to authentication plane tenant restrictions v2. In future blogs, we’ll discuss migrating to Universal tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions are a vital tool to help prevent data exfiltration from unauthorized access to external Microsoft Entra ID tenants and consumer Microsoft accounts. Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allow list of tenant IDs and Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. While tenant restrictions v1 served well for many years, tenant restrictions v2 offers more granularity and easier policy management with no additional licensing requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions v2 has several benefits over tenant restrictions v1. For example, admins can:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Update the policy from the Microsoft Entra portal rather than from each network proxy. There’s no need to update the header.&nbsp; 
  Increase the size limitations of your maximum proxy header length. There’s no limit to the number of partners you can add with tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp; 
  Selectively indicate which user groups access which apps in external tenants rather than allowing entire tenants for all identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll explain the differences between how the two tenant restriction types work independently from, and in tandem with, cross-tenant access settings (outbound) to highlight the benefits of upgrading to tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with tenant restrictions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions require routing all user authentication traffic through a proxy. Typically, the proxy is the on-premises network egress, but it can also be a cloud-based proxy. The proxy injects a header indicating that an allow list of destinations is enforced on the traffic, regardless of the originating device or network location. In tenant restrictions v1, the destination allow list is in the header. In tenant restrictions v2, the header has a tenant ID and policy ID. Traffic arrives at Microsoft Entra ID, which reads the header and enforces the policy. If the traffic destination isn’t in the allow list, the user receives an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of a user getting blocked by tenant restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How tenant restrictions v1 works&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of identities: internal and external. Your organization creates and manages internal identities with your identity provider (IdP) but doesn’t manage external identities such as personal accounts or those created by an external organization. Tenant restrictions v1 applies to both account types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, two types of identities (green is internal and black is external) are on the corporate network or connected with a virtual private network (VPN). Both identity types go through the corporate network egress proxy when attempting to access Microsoft 365 services. Typically, both receive the same header injection of allowed destinations. This enforcement has some limitations. If you maintain the allow list in the network proxies, administrators update the header at each proxy when you add or remove a tenant. It’s also important to note that the headers have size limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Tenant restrictions v1 applies to external tenant destinations equally with no user or app granularity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can improve tenant restrictions v1 by adding cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions v1 with outbound cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the cross-tenant access settings feature to control outbound access on a per-user, per-group, and per-application basis. This policy applies to your internal identities, regardless of device or network location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the users go through the egress proxy. Cross-tenant access settings and tenant restrictions are applied. However, the tenant restrictions v1 allow list is the only policy that applies to external identities. This option improves internal user management, but the architecture has limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tenant restriction v1 and cross-tenant access settings are evaluated, and the most restrictive policy is applied. However, cross-tenant access settings only apply to internal identities. If you allow access to an external tenant for your users, even with group or application restrictions, you enable all external identities to access any resource in those tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings adds user and app granularity for internal identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restriction v2 with cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restriction v2 works in tandem with cross-tenant access settings. Tenant restriction v2 is a cloud-based policy that applies to external identities. Internal users’ access is controlled by cross-tenant access settings. This separation allows per-user and per-application granularity for internal and external identity scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following example, the organization puts group and application restrictions on their internal identities. However, they can block other external identities from accessing external tenants unless they create exceptions. In this case, an exception is made for Bob from Tenant C. He is allowed access to only Microsoft Exchange so he can check email while on the corporate network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Tenant restrictions v2 adds granular user and app awareness to external identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous diagram demonstrates the flexibility that tenant restrictions v2 offers. Because tenant restrictions v1 and v2 have the same licensing requirements, the one-time migration involves recreating policies and updating the header injection at your network proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more in the tenant restrictions v2 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-migration">migration deployment plan.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance tenant restrictions, learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions">Universal tenant restrictions</a>. This feature adds data layer protection and prevents token infiltration that can bypass your corporate network proxy’s tenant restrictions header injection. The feature injects the headers and has a low latency connection to Microsoft 365 resources without needing to hairpin traffic through your corpnet proxies.&nbsp;</p>

 Creating Value with Identifiers  Why identifiers are essential to secure cross border trade, and how we have applied best practices and design principles <p>Transmute enables global trade digitization. Essential to this mission is facilitating an optimal digital identifier strategy for our customers, in which our Verifiable Data Platform plays an important part. In this white paper we discuss some points of inspiration and the design choices and principles we have made to bring efficient, safe, intuitive — and beautiful — identifiers to the supply chain&nbsp;sector.</p> Inspiration <p>In designing our identifiers, we have looked to major internet players for inspiration: HBO, LinkedIn and&nbsp;GS1.</p> HBO <p>HBO is a great source of inspiration, consistently following identifier design practices. For example, here is the URL for accessing the movie Dune:<br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>This URL consists&nbsp;of:</p>  Scheme (https), indicating that there is a resource resolvable over secure&nbsp;HTTP  Host (play.hbomax.com) with HBO’s domain&nbsp;name  Path of HBO’s video player (player), available to authenticated HBO&nbsp;users  Sub-path with a unique identifier of the movie Dune (urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ)  <p>We will dissect the structure of the identifier in a moment, but first it’s important to note the same identifier of Dune is used elsewhere to resolve different resources. For example:<br>https://www.hbomax.com/dk/da/a/param-feature/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>Which links to a publicly available “movie poster” page, in this case on a Danish microsite as per the&nbsp;path.</p><p>Looking closer at Dune’s identifier, urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ, this is a URN consisting of:</p>  Scheme (urn)&nbsp;, indicating a unique but not necessarily resolvable identifier  Namespace, NID (hbo)&nbsp;, which arguably should be registered with IANA, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml">but&nbsp;isn’t</a>  Namespace-specific string, NSS (feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ), which notably consists of a categorization of what is identified (feature:) as well as a unique&nbsp;string   LinkedIn <p>LinkedIn follow a very similar pattern as HBO for linked in posts:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744</p><p>Again, the URL is comprised of:</p>  Scheme (https),  Host (www.linkedin.com)  Path (feed/update)  Sub-path with a URN identifier (urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744)  <p>And again, the identifier is a URN constructed as:</p>  Scheme (urn),  NID (unregistered) (li),  NSS (activity:7062908400073887744), consisting of a categorization of what is identified (activity:) and a unique&nbsp;string.  <p>LinkedIn also allows for natural identifiers for identifying people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/</a>) and companies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries">https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries</a>). There are two interesting points to note&nbsp;here:</p>  The use of natural keys (nis-jespersen and transmute-industries). When this is possible, humanly recognizable keys derived from the business domain is a strong&nbsp;feature.  A more questionable part of this design is that LinkedIn is not sticking with URN identifiers. A better and more consistent design could have been for example: https://www.linkedin.com/company/urn:li:company:transmute-industries   GS1 <p>GS1 governs identifiers for elements used in trade such as product types (GTIN), organizations (GLN) and transport identifiers (SSCC). These can be extended, for example a GTIN with a lot number traditionally looks like this: (01)09520123456788(10)ABC123 where (01) and (10) are codes for GTIN and lot respectively, followed by their values, in combination forming a unique compound key for the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>GS1’s <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/uri-syntax/">Digital Link standard</a> defines how the GS1 identifier must be represented as URIs. The Digital Link of the above example could be <a href="https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a> (this is the so-called canonical form). Importantly, it could also be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a>, allowing the brand owner to host resolvable information about the&nbsp;product.</p><p>Per the spec, identifying properties are on the path, whereas non-identifying properties are placed in query parameters. Weight, for example, is non-identifying, so the Digital Link for (01)09520123456788(3103)000195 where (01) codifies the GTIN followed by its value, and (3103) codifies Net Weight and 000195 is 195 grams, can be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195</a>.</p><p>Peculiarly, GS1 has not opted to leverage the registered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5134.html">“epc” URN namespace</a> in the Digital Link standard. The above GTIN could be represented like this:<br>https://brand.example.com/urn:epc:id:gtin:0952012.3456788.</p><p>Granted, the QR code for this would be bigger; an important argument. Apart from that this seems like a missed opportunity to spread a best practice identifier pattern broadly into GS1’s established user&nbsp;base.</p><p>In conclusion of this little tour of inspiration, we’ve found that HBO and LinkedIn have taken practically identical approaches to identifying and localizing their platform resources. GS1 seems to have been on a similar path before changing direction for Digital Link. Next, we will look into some of the drivers which have led HBO and LinkedIn to the same best practice&nbsp;design.</p> Design Principles <p>In this section we will focus on properties which make a good identifier. We will also consider some properties which make them bad, if not dangerous.</p><p>Why does HBO bother adding urn:hbo:feature: and not just a “naked” identifier such as <br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>And, similarly, why do we consider this to be well formed:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p><p>But not this:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p> Unique Resource Identifier <p>First of all, bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is not a URI, whereas urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is.</p><p>There is a caveat, formally the URN namespace should be registered with IANA such that they can guarantee uniqueness. Our stance is that our use of the unregistered namespace (transmute) is sufficiently unique; a stance which we share with the likes of HBO and LinkedIn.</p> Usability <p>During development and integration, engineers often juggle identifiers from various platforms at once. Hints about which platform and type of resource the identifier is associated with makes it much easier to work with. As you glance over a table of identifiers, being able to pick out the one you are looking for is a time saver. Platforms often prefix identifiers with such context, in our case for example transmute:presentation intuitively and clearly point towards the origin and type of resource.</p><p>A developer should also intuitively trust that an identifier is unique. While UUIDs are a little long, they are recognizable and a developer instinctively comprehends the identifier’s uniqueness.</p><p>Finally, these aspects should come naturally. In working with identifiers, the good experience is the one you don’t experience.</p> Casing Convention <p>The natural keys employed by LinkedIn were kebab-cased (nis-jespersen). This is preferred because most operating systems and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-handle-underscores-dashes-differently-89672">search engines</a> treat dash-separation as separate words. In contrast, both camelCasing and snake_casing are generally considered one big word. Kebab-casing is also considered <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/41595/what-is-the-casing-convention-for-url-routes">more readable</a> than the alternatives.</p> Location Decoupling <p>The decoupling of the resource and its location(s) allow us for example to get Verifiable Credential data with<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6</a></p><p>And verify it with<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6/verify</p><p>This is similar to how urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ was used to retrieve both the Dune trailer microsite and the full movie&nbsp;player.</p> Security <p>Without this decoupling, there is just one identifying URL, for example:<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</a> <br>which means the entire identifier string is now a WHATWG URL, not an IETF URI, in turn allowing for UNICODE encoded internationalized domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>It is Transmute’s position that UNICODE is great for display strings, but dangerous for identifier strings. We wholeheartedly support the ability to capture people’s name in their local representation. Indeed, the author’s full name includes an “ø”. But we are saddened by the careless adoption of UNICODE in international domain names, which has unnecessarily exposed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">internationalized domain name homoglyph attack</a> surface. For example an ASCII o is very difficult to tell apart from a cyrillic о (not the same character!), allowing for microsoft.com and mіcrоsoft.com (not the same domain!) to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200102175251/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/homograph_full.pdf">coexist</a>.</p><p>We do not fancy ourselves that we can fix the internet. But we vigilantly seek to minimize exposures anytime we have the chance; in this case by adopting ASCII-based URN identifiers where we have the&nbsp;chance.</p> Key Origins <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a> is derived from business or application data which are unique in their nature and are typically intuitively understood by humans. By contrast, a synthetic or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key">surrogate key</a> is technically generated solely for the purpose of uniqueness, without direct linkage to the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>We saw how LinkedIn in some cases uses the person or organization name as natural keys. This is possible for finite resources which carry such natural identifiers. In such cases it is preferable to adopt human recognizable and intuitive keys. Where possible we have similarly adopted natural keys where resources are finite and under Transmute’s control. Prevalently, though, v4 UUID synthetic keys are used, in particular for all customer controlled resources.</p> Transmute Identifier Design <p>This section attempts to formalize Transmute’s identifier design, pertaining to our Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;(VDP).</p> Resource Identifiers <p>VDP resources are identified with&nbsp;URNs.</p><p>The general pattern for VDP URN identifiers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>urn:transmute:[resource-type]:[v4-uuid|natural-key]</p><p>Where:</p>  urn, the URN&nbsp;scheme,  transmute, the unregistered URN&nbsp;NID,  [resource-type]:, first part of the URN NSS, indicating the type of resource in singular&nbsp;form.  [v4-uuid|natural-key], second sub-delimited (unique) part of the URN NSS; a v4 UUID for user governed resources, kebab-cased natural key for Transmute governed resources.   API Resources <p>Resources are accessed on the VDP <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) API following this general&nbsp;pattern:</p><p><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]">https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]</a></p><p>Where:</p>  https, the HTTPS&nbsp;scheme,  platform.transmute.industries, the platform&nbsp;host  [resource-type], first part of the path, indicating the resource type in plural according to <a href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/">REST naming best practices</a>.  [resource-identifier], identifying part of the path, URN as described above.   Versioning <p>Note that we are not including API versioning on the path. Of course, we may have to introduce breaking changes on the API at some point (it has not yet been necessary). When this day arrives, we will adopt a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/versioning/">header-carried</a> design for version management.</p> Combining REST and Well-Formed Identifiers <p>The combination of self-explaining URNs and collections style REST endpoint URLs entails a degree of redundancy, for example the inclusion of&nbsp;:credential and /credentials in the same&nbsp;request.</p><p>LinkedIn faces the same situation on their <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/content/activities">LinkedIn REST API</a>, where for example “activity” is repeated on the path and in the identifier:</p> GET ‘https://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaActivities?ids=List(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7074127827113058304)' <p>Like LinkedIn, Transmute finds this is an acceptable consequence considering the combined benefits gained from strong identifiers and&nbsp;REST.</p> Content Negotiation Three representations of the same Verifiable Credential resource, respectively: text/html, application/json, and application/pdf.<p>Following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">cooluri</a> best practices, different representations of the same resource are available, subject to content negotiation. The best example of this is Verifiable Credentials, which are available both as HTML, JSON and&nbsp;PDF.</p> Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;Examples <p>This section lists identifier examples of resources currently supported on&nbsp;VPD.</p>  urn:transmute:credential:b5d5f8d6–3a83–4n1s-a4d5-a56cd09a5ac6  urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee  urn:transmute:identifier:09en1584–9366–44af-8a0b-1aaf95d83607  urn:transmute:contact:ef54af47–4303–4874-bee6-fe54c279b851  urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential  urn:transmute:workflow:definition:us-cbp-entry  urn:transmute:workflow:instance:f5fb6ce4-b0b1–41b8–89b0–331ni58b7ee0  urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j  <p>Note the extra hierarchical layer of workflow:definition and workflow:instance NSS sub-delimiters, reflecting the many-to-many relationship between the workflow definitions and instances.</p>Example of a workflow referencing a Workflow Instance and a Workflow Definition.<p>These are examples of credential and template resources on the platform:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:cc485f9e-627d-466c-b0b9-3ddf2ae0c60d">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:cc485f9e-627d-466c-b0b9-3nis2ae0c60d</a>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates/urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential">https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates/urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential</a>  <p>Here, the template identifier is passed in the queries string for issuing a Commercial Invoice credential from the template-based form:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/issue?template=urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential&amp;step=1">https://platform.transmute.industries/issue?template=urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential&amp;step=1</a>  <p>Some additional example of resource querying:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates?pageSize=10&amp;page=0&amp;unsupported=false&amp;search=commercial+invoice">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>/marketplace/templates?pageSize=10&amp;page=0&amp;search=commercial+invoice  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations?direction=outbound">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations?direction=outbound</a>  <p>Fragments are used to reference verificationMethods of a DID Document as per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a>:</p>  did:web:platform.transmute.industries:organizations:org_WioDDk68cALd3YoN#z6MksU7WFxyMS3jupvdTUnBn15vfjvh5taZbwixdfrqs1vJj   Wrapping Verifiable Credential <p>As all Linked Data classes, Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations have @id properties, and at first glance it may seem like a natural choice to identify the VDP resource. However, this identifier is entirely in our customer’s control, and can like any other property during issuance; or it could be issued on a different platform and only stored on VDP. Such untrusted user input is ill fitted as database primary keys, as we cannot guarantee uniqueness.</p><p>Moreover, the @id property is optional per the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> specification, which further underscores the point: a primary key cannot be optional.</p><p>Adopting the VC and VP’s @id as platform resource would have led to very unintuitive and intrusive platform behavior: rejecting storage requests, injecting identifiers into customers’ data objects, etc — clearly unacceptable from a business platform dealing with trade data. We believe this is a generic challenge faced by all but the most puristic Linked Data platforms, in which users expect, understand, and appreciate such behaviors and restrictions.</p><p>So, instead VDP maintains these classes in abstracted resources which wrap around the basic VC and VPs, separating the VC/VP itself from the platform’s representation of it. This has several benefits:</p>  There can be perfectly acceptable business reasons to have non-unique or anonymous nodes in a data graph, and this lets customers be in complete control of their verifiable data&nbsp;graph.  The wrapper can contain valuable metadata about the resource, for example the sender and receiver of a verifiable presentation.  The abstraction allows for storing multiple representations of the same credential, kept as different formats, controlled as media&nbsp;types.  Example of a presentation containing two credentials with colliding ids, urn:ex:x, stored comfortably in VDP within resources urn:transmute:credential:1 and urn:transmute:credential:2 (URNs simplified for clarity). Status List Credentials <p>Bitstring revocation credentials are an exception to this principle. Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/">the spec</a>, revocation credentials must be resolvable, so their identifier (referenced by the revocable credential) must be a URL, not a URN. For&nbsp;example</p> ‘id’: ‘https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/97abfc14-5n1s-45ff-bfde-de30eb772c20’ <p>As a consequence, revocation credentials are bound to VDP in that they cannot be moved neither to nor from other platforms. This is both acceptable and a logical consequence of the purpose they&nbsp;fulfill.</p> Execution Challenges <p>This section is based on interviewing our engineering team, reflecting upon the process of designing and implementing the above identifier design. The truth is developing this part of our platform has led to challenges and frustrations amongst the team. It is our hope that others can learn from our experience and plan for a smoother process towards implementing a great identifier design.</p> Leadership <p>Management has struggled to share the vision for Linked Data and combine it with pragmatic execution. Designing Linked Data relationships permeates the stack, and often got in the way of fast execution. When not communicated properly, there were tendencies towards disliking Linked Data before it was even properly understood.</p><p>This experience was mirrored in the engineering team as a sense of being too involved in the design process: “the vision gets muddy with too many people involved”.</p><p>Indeed, authoring this document is meant as an attempt to once and for all get team alignment on the company’s identifier strategy.</p> Value <p>Consistency in the API design has been a reoccurring challenge. When the vision and principles are not communicated well enough to the team, the normal self-correction mechanisms do not kick in, and so inconsistencies slip through. The deviations add up and become self-perpetuating, leading to bugs, miscommunication, and frustration.</p><p>When consistency is essential, it means the normal MVP feature approach fits poorly with identifiers. There is clearly an investment to be taken seriously. You should not do a half baked job of this; you are better off not starting at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The engineering team have had periods where this tweaking identifier semantics sugar has felt like “work, not value” which could be forever improved, but with diminishing impact.</p> Requirements <p>Something as fundamental as identifiers takes strong requirements up front. Sporadic bug tickets, for example that a collection should be plural, becomes a debate of the framework which it is held against, whether it is a bug at&nbsp;all.</p><p>In interviewing, one engineer requested a README document to avoid inconsistencies — essentially requesting this document. Once we had gone through it he immediately explained an API endpoint which he believed was inconsistent. The team self-correction worked! It is clear that a document like this one should have been produced much sooner in the&nbsp;process.</p> Commercialization <p>There is a duality in the team’s feelings about where we have gotten. We are proud of our identifiers! But we also recognize that they are long and may seem over-engineered and unapproachable, not least in our target supply chain sector market where it is common practice quoting for example “manufacturer numbers”. As much as we love the technical details, we realize they may be a hard selling&nbsp;point.</p><p>However, we insist that identifiers are essential to building systems with safety, privacy and value in focus, especially in today’s increasingly connected world. It has always been true that identifier collisions can be costly. The context and requirements for identifiers have changed dramatically since the analogue days. We take it upon ourselves to design for a safe and efficient future, even if — especially if — our customers do not fully appreciate everything which this&nbsp;takes.</p> Database Identifier Decoration <p>Rather than storing the full URNs at database level, we still only store the raw keys, adding the URN decoration around it. This means removal before it goes into the DB, and add it back on the outbound. There is a lot there you have to remember when making changes. And you have to think about future scenarios too, for example if Transmute got bought, that might affect the transmute namespace, and you would be adding more layers. As one engineer puts it “adding context adds complexity”.</p><p>Not storing the URNs is effectively a case of not making full use of our own investment. Partly due to history, partly due to the mid-process confusion described above. For example, there have been worries that the special code would have to deal with lower environments identifiers (subdomains used only internally), a result of conflating URLs with URNs. The database level is essentially the last, missing step of the process described in this section, and now that the principles are fully understood it will be a matter of time before we get&nbsp;there.</p> Conclusion <p>Transmute sells identifiers, and we aim to sell amazing products. So our identifiers need to be&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>We have studied examples of major internet players, HBO and LinkedIn, how they both construct URN identifiers, which are then used in URLs. We also studied the GS1 Digital Link, which has good reason to take a different approach, prioritizing backwards alignment.</p><p>We analyzed the drivers behind these design principles: URI benefits, separation of concerns, security, and key origins. Based on these, we were able to formalize VDP’s identification design.</p><p>Finally, we shared some honest reflections on the real-life transformation our team has been through. It is our hope that others who share our ambition will benefit from these learnings.</p><p>Consistency is an essential measure of quality. This document should make clear not just what quality identifiers look like, but also motivate&nbsp;why.</p><p>We encourage comments and discussion on this article, as well as signing up for free on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/creating-value-with-identifiers-ef9446b87835">Creating  Value with Identifiers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 As the Brazilian igaming market prepares for lift off, we discuss regulatory surprises, the challenges of encouraging players to leave the black market, and the feasibility of Brazil becoming the largest gambling market in the world. 



 



<p>Although at first glance, there may not appear to be a huge amount in common between the Brazilian aviation industry and the Brazilian gambling industry, for lawyer Neil Montgomery, there are parallels that gambling operators would be well served to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, the Brazilian online gambling industry took significant steps toward regulation, when Law No. 14,790/2023 was enacted further addressing fixed odds sports betting and igaming. While last month’s departure of <a href="https://www.telecomasia.net/news/other/mansurundefineds-resignation-could-impact-launch-of-bets-in-brazil/">government chief advisor, Jose Francisco Mansur</a>, is likely to result in considerable delays to the licensing process, it will not dampen the appetite for the official launch of a fully regulated gambling market in Brazil at federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The excitement and anticipation for a regulated market at federal level (since some Brazilian states – like Paraná and Rio de Janeiro – have already made state licenses available) is borne largely from two things: the federal government realizing it is missing out on significant tax revenue, and Brazilian players being able to benefit from a safer and more secure player experience that only a regulated platform can offer. However, Neil does warn that unless gambling operators take the necessary steps to become ‘regulation-ready,’ including adherence to KYC, identity verification, and responsible gambling measure requirements, there is likely to be trouble ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer legislation is strict and strictly enforced in Brazil so foreign operators are going to have to confront the nightmare of doing business when it comes to consumer claims.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neil explains that Brazil is infamously ranked number one in the world in terms of airline passenger claims. The reason, he suggests, is that although Brazil complies with international conventions on the limitation of carrier liability, said conventions do not apply to so-called ‘moral damages,’ or the pain and suffering inflicted on the passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe a similar situation will repeat itself in the gaming industry because disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and igaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages cost to consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Neil explains all about consumer legislation, tax, KYC, and why Brazilian gambling operators may have the upper hand on their stronger foreign counterparts.</p>



 Now that Brazilian regulations for sports betting and online casinos have passed, was there anything in the final draft that surprised you, positively or negatively? Is there anything you would like to see revised in future iterations? 



<p>Well, I think that in general terms, it was very positive. We had to wait until the very last minute in 2023 to see the law passed because there was a lot of discussion as to whether this was coming out this year or not. The federal government, of course, was focused on getting it passed since it has an objective of reaching zero tax deficit in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any additional revenue is welcome and of course the sports, betting and gaming markets are seen as a very good source of additional revenues. For this revenue to be included in the 2024 budget, everything had to be passed in 2023. A positive surprise was the inclusion of igaming in the law because it was originally only supposed to govern fixed odd sports betting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Brazilian law, we still need to wait and see what the Ministry of Finance will do with its many ordinances. There are 12 expected to be released, and we’ll see what the definition of igaming is. Another surprise was the fact that operators will need to have 20% Brazilian ownership. However, the way it is worded was a bit ambiguous because it doesn’t explicitly refer to a Brazilian individual and so adopting a two-tier corporate structure in Brazil (where the foreign operator would first incorporate a local holding company and have that company incorporate the local operator applying for the license – the latter thereby having a 100% Brazilian shareholder). The other positive was player tax being reduced from the initially proposed 30% to 15%. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There were certain paragraphs vetoed by President Lula, such as the player having to calculate income tax on net winnings on an annual basis. All vetoes are still to be heard at Congress, and there’s a lot of uncertainty as to how the income tax is going to be calculated and collected.</p>



 Have you noticed a surge in interest or activity among Brazilian gaming operators since it passed? 



<p>Well, there are very few Brazilian operators because most of them are all foreign operators that will now have to set up shop in Brazil to obtain a federal licence. For many years, players have been used to playing on offshore platforms. Upcoming law changes will make the experience of using an unlicensed platform much harder. For example, there will be restrictions on advertising and on payment methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign operators will therefore have to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Finance and players will have to play only on licenced operators in Brazil. Right now, we’re in a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/"> grey market</a> until the full legal framework is laid out, but from the moment licences are made available at federal level, it will officially become a black market, and will be considered significantly riskier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will always be ways of circumventing the regulated market, but I think it’s going to be more cumbersome for them to be able to play in the black market. So, hopefully the ordinances will allow a balance between what operators need to do, what the players need to do, and what the government needs to do so that the new regulated market will be sufficiently attractive to encourage players to bet in a licenced environment.</p>

 With many Brazilian players already familiar with gambling on the grey market, how ready and willing do you think players will be to switch to regulated, domestic platforms, where they will be required to complete a KYC process and follow tax payments? 



<p>It all depends on how easy it is to operate in the regulated market. I think there’s still some uncertainties regarding how the tax will be calculated and collected. I think if they had published the methodology of how the player’s income tax will be calculated then that would have been very positive in terms of encouraging players to place their bets in the domestic market. We just need to wait and see what happens. However, if the legal framework is more time and cost consuming than continuing to place bets on the black market, then of course we’re going to have channelization issues, which of course the federal government would like to avoid. Also, will the regulations leave enough room to guarantee the return on investment, because the licence fee is going to be quite high: 30 million Brazilian Reals, which is about $6 million for a 5-year licence. That puts Brazil as one of the most expensive places in the world to obtain a licence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, of course, let’s not forget the real reason for regulating the market, which is player protection and investment protection, so hopefully the balance will be found to avoid players continuing to place their bets on the black market.</p>



 Brazil is forecast to become the largest gambling market in the world. Do you see any obstacles in its way to achieving that? 



<p>Well, I’m an eternal optimist, so if a good balance can be found, which will require all stakeholders to make concessions, then I think so. In Brazil, professional football depends massively on sponsorship provided by operators, and there has been an increase in the value of sponsorship over the years and now that the law has passed, I have seen the amounts go up quite significantly. It’s likely to lower again at some point in the future, but right now sponsorship amounts are record-breaking, and every week we receive news that a football club is receiving twice, three times the amount of sponsorship of previous deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there’s a lot of appetite for Brazil to become the largest gambling market in the world, and I think it will generate a lot of jobs, a lot of investment, but we need to find the balance. This is the key issue; we are in a newly regulated market and everything’s new for everyone. This is the big opportunity we have been waiting decades for, and now is the time to get it right.</p>



 As a lawyer, what is your opinion of the Brazil licensing requirements? Too arduous, too many loopholes, or to be expected? 



<p>Well, the law has been framed in a way that if an operator doesn’t obtain a licence, they’re going to be subject to many restrictions to access the Brazilian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Brazilian federal government has always said that once licences are made available then they are going to enforce legislation. We have seen at state level many enforcement actions by certain states, especially Rio Janeiro and Paraná, because not only do we have the federal licence regime, but we also have state licences because federal legislation has taken so long to be enacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020, states have enacted their own legislation to grant state licences for traditional lottery and for fixed odd sports betting, as fixed odd sports betting was legalized in Brazil as a form of lottery, and we have seen many clients of ours receive notices and subpoenas as they have not obtained a state licence. One of the main problems we have is of the legal problems caused by the dichotomy between federal and state licences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re awaiting the official licencing requirements. We only have the main points in the law. So, we know it’s an open licencing model with no limit on the number of licences issued, which is good, that’s the model I have been advocating for many years. We know it’s going to cost 30 million Brazilian Reals for a five-year licence, and each operator can promote up to three brands, and not necessarily the operator’s own brand, so there could be licencing arrangements with other brand holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is to have two windows per year during which the applications can be filled. 134 companies submitted applications last year, well, submitted an expression of interest and the federal government has promised priority in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hopefully the Ministry of Finance will have sufficient human resources to process all these applications, because they are going to be flooded with a lot of paperwork. Everything is going to be done electronically, which should be more efficient, but there’s going to be a lot of documents that need to be provided. We still do not know whether documents coming from overseas will have to satisfy the formalities of notarization. It’s going to be the first experience in Brazil in terms of licencing at federal level, but hopefully we’ll get there!&nbsp;</p>



 In your legal opinion, how well-prepared are Brazilian operators, particularly start-ups, to navigate the complexities of the new regulatory landscape in the online gambling sector? 



<p>Well, there’s going to be a surge in igaming lawyers in all aspects of the law, because this is a very detailed, regulatory environment. So, there are many different aspects to it. So, I think Brazilian operators may have an advantage of knowing the law better, and how it could evolve with upcoming regulations, as they know the market so well. Maybe they don’t have the strength that foreign operators have, but at least they have the knowledge of the local market and knowledge of the local law, which should give them a certain competitive advantage. Foreign operators who set up shop in Brazil will gradually have to learn their way around the treacherous waters of the Brazilian legal system because, as we say, Brazil is not for amateurs.</p>



 With other countries in the Americas opening, such as Peru, how important do you think the region will become in the global gambling market in the next 5 to 10 years? Is the future bright? 



<p>I think Latin America is the new frontier of the gaming industry. So, most of it is still uncharted territory, especially Brazil, but I think things will become clearer with time. But, yes, Latin America is the place to be at the moment and I think we’ll be in the spotlight for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen other surprise advancements, even in the Muslim world, with land-based casinos being floated in the UAE for example, and even places like Saudi Arabia are now considering casinos. So, I think igaming is seen as something that needs to be focused on and Latin America, Mexico, all the way down to Argentina and Chile are going to be in the spotlight with Brazil likely to become the main player in that regional market.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF81 rewards. DF82 runs Mar 21— Mar 28, 2024. Bug fix in Volume DF reward calculation; 5x Predictoor Boost  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><p>👉 This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account. We have fixed the bug. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts onwards. <a>Section 5</a> has details; the <a>Appendix</a> has a complementary explainer. UPDATE [one day later]: we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a>, which restores Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p><blockquote>DF81 was the first round of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2</a>. In it, OCEAN rewards doubled to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF now get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF budget is 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 81 (DF81) has completed. 300K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 14, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 21. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF82 is live today, March 21. It concludes on March 28. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF82  <a>Section 5</a>: Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  <a>Appendix</a>: Complementary Bug Fix Explainer   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF82 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  5.1 Summary <p>This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely. We’ve fixed it now. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts&nbsp;onwards.</p> 5.2 Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/">df-py</a> is the GitHub repo implementing DF rewards formulae. The issue is in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/issues/821">df-py issue #821</a>; we bring relevant info&nbsp;here</p><p>Here is the main formula for Volume DF rewards, before the fix. It’s from df-py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/cca4665cfb0670d23b67767ce6e724c56be338e3/df_py/volume/reward_calculator.py#L182C1-L205C18">reward_calculator.py</a>.</p> R[i, j] = min(<br>    perc_at_j * perc_at_ij * self.OCEAN_avail,<br>    ocean_locked_ij * TARGET_WPY,  # bound rewards by max APY<br>    DCV_OCEAN_j * multiplier,  # bound rewards by DCV<br>) <p>R[i,j] is the reward amount in OCEAN, for user i and asset&nbsp;j.</p><p>Inside the min() function, the first term is the baseline reward amount. The second &amp; third terms bound by max APY and DCV respectively. The problem is in the third term with DCV_OCEAN_j.</p><p>If DCV is sufficiently low that Volume DF rewards should be bounded it (typical), and if Alice splits her veOCEAN across 2 accounts, then Alice will get more rewards compared to if a single account. This is incorrect behavior.</p><p>We can tell that this happens in the DCV_OCEAN_j line, because it’s only a function of j and not of i as&nbsp;well.</p> 5.3 Problem with Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <blockquote>The # rewards that Alice gets should only be a function of how much veOCEAN Alice has, not whether she has one account or two (or&nbsp;100).</blockquote><p>The bug exposed Volume DF to Sybil attacks: Alice got 2x more reward than she was supposed to for having 2 accounts. If she had 100 accounts, she would have got 100x more (up to where the asset-level DCV bounds kicked in). In other words, Volume DF over-rewarded each individual address.</p><p>It also meant that each account got over-rewarded, since they were only bounded by DCV of the asset, not by their pro-rata stake in the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>This was the case since asset-level DCV bounds were introduced: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">DF23</a> on Feb 2,&nbsp;2023.</p> 5.4 Reproducing the&nbsp;Problem <p>The following code exposes the issue, in test form. The first test is for one account; the second is for two accounts. It should have rewarded the same total OCEAN (50) whether there was one account, or&nbsp;two.</p> def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_1accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 1e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 50.0}<br><br>def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_2accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 0.5e6, user2_addr: 0.5e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 25.0, user2_addr: 25.0} <p>We had the first test before, and it passed. Whereas the newly-introduced second test failed. In it, of the two accounts got 50 OCEAN, for 50+50 = 100 OCEAN total. Correct would have been 25+25 = 50 OCEAN&nbsp;total.</p><p>This is good news: we had reproduced the issue in reproducible tests. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-936f12da0a54dc6256a4ffd1e8418c94405af8f70bb269a34a6cbf968d88528c">Here’s the PR</a>; the code shown is modified slightly for readability.</p> 5.5 The Fix to the&nbsp;Problem <p>Here’s the change in code. The “before” line in red didn’t properly bound rewards. The “after” line in green does. The main fix was just one line. (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-afc4732bb19ebf7622890387838941eddb3d67d74dee5cd6dc7127a6fe889a7f">Here’s the&nbsp;PR</a>.)</p>Red = before the fix, green = after the fix. DCV bounds are now scaled by the user’s proportion of rewards, perc_at_ij.<p>The specific fix is: the DCV bounds need to also scale by the account’s proportion of stake in the asset, perc_at_ij. Like all proportions, 0 &lt;=perc_at_ij ≤&nbsp;1.</p><p>With the fix in place, the previously-failing test now passed.&nbsp;Great!</p> 5.6 How does this affect users going&nbsp;forward? <blockquote>In previous rounds, accounts were being over-rewarded in Volume DF because it wasn’t properly bounding on&nbsp;DCV.</blockquote><blockquote>Accounts can expect the proper amount of reward now, from DF81 payouts onwards. It is almost certainly less than&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Here’s why one should expect less rewards in Volume DF. The additional term perc_at_ij in the rewards line has value between 0 and 1, and is rarely 1 because one user rarely has all the&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In other words, there’s an OCEAN reward allocated for a given asset (based on its DCV compared to other assets), and that reward is spread among different accounts (based on their relative stakes in the&nbsp;asset).</p> 5.7 Final Clarifications <p>Just to say it: we won’t retroactively reduce any rewards. For starters, even trying would be pretty uncool! Second, it’s not very pragmatic to implement.</p><p>Also, this only affects Volume DF rewards. There is no change to Passive DF Rewards, or to Predictoor DF&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>It’s also not a security vulnerability. Yes it was a Sybil attack, but in this case it means that a person could Sybil-attack to take comparatively more rewards for themselves. Emphatically, it was not a security bug: there were no funds at risk, and there were no funds&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>UPDATE: one day after we published this post, we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a> to restore Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p> Appendix: Bug Fix Explainer <p>This subsection describes the bug fix changes end-to-end, in a different voice.</p><p>You may see see a significant drop in your Volume DF rewards this week. This is indeed the correct behavior after the bug&nbsp;fix.</p><p>Let’s elaborate. We discovered a bug that gave more rewards payout for Volume DF than the design intent. We fixed the bug within hours of discovery. With the bug fixed, users will see a sizeable drop in Volume DF payout compared to previous weeks. Although this drop is large, the code is updated with the correct functionality that Volume DF rewards were supposed to have all&nbsp;along.</p><p>Here’s that rewards&nbsp;logic:</p>  asset X generates data consume volume&nbsp;DCV.  then, Volume DF rewards for asset X are either DCV_multiplier= 20.1% (Predictoor feeds) or 0.1% other&nbsp;assets).  those asset rewards for are divided among veOCEAN holders who allocated veOCEAN to this asset, according to their stake. This is where delegations get counted&nbsp;too.  <p>Then, repeat the above for each of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Realistically, there is only volume on Predictoor feeds. So DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500 OCEAN. Multiplying the 37,500 OCEAN times 20.1% for Predictoor feeds means about 7,500 OCEAN. The remaining 37,500–7,500=30,000 OCEAN that was budgeted for Volume DF goes back into the Data Farming pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Unveiling a New&nbsp;Era <p>In our digital age, the management of digital identities has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems, managed by entities like Google and Facebook, often fall short in safeguarding user privacy and security. This introduces Decentralized Identity (DID), a paradigm shift that promises not just a technological revolution but a cultural transformation, emphasizing digital independence and security.</p><p>The evolution of identity management from centralized to decentralized models, with DID at the helm, marks a significant departure from the status quo. Initially, online identification relied on methods like emails and passwords, with enhancements such as WebAuthn bolstering user authentication. However, these centralized systems presented considerable privacy and security vulnerabilities, leading to an urgent call for a new approach. DID, utilizing blockchain technology, represents this new frontier. By empowering users with control over their personal data, DID ensures privacy and enhances security, heralding a new era of digital interactions that prioritize user autonomy.</p><p>This shift to DID introduces numerous benefits:</p>  Streamlined Verification: Simplifies the authentication process, allowing for safe and efficient identity&nbsp;checks.  Enhanced Security: By distributing data across a decentralized network, DID minimizes the risks associated with centralized data&nbsp;storage.  Greater Privacy: Users control their personal information, sharing only what’s necessary and with whom they&nbsp;choose.  Reduced Data Breaches: The decentralized nature and encryption methods lower the potential for large-scale data breaches.  <p>Blockchain technology underpins DID’s advantages, providing a decentralized framework that transforms personal data management. This not only secures information through encryption but also assures data integrity, as altering recorded information requires network consensus. Blockchain’s role is pivotal in overcoming the limitations of centralized systems, offering a verification mechanism that bolsters trust without compromising privacy.</p><p>As we look towards a future shaped by these advancements, DID stands as a beacon for a user-centric digital ecosystem. This evolution from centralized control to decentralized empowerment signifies more than technological progress; it marks a shift towards a digital existence where privacy, security, and user autonomy are paramount. The journey towards this future, driven by blockchain’s innovative capabilities, promises to redefine digital identity management, ensuring a more secure, transparent, and empowering online&nbsp;world.</p><p>In conclusion, the move to decentralized identity systems is not merely a response to the shortcomings of centralized models but a forward-looking vision for a digital society grounded in autonomy and trust. As this paradigm shift unfolds, DID emerges not just as a technological solution but as a cornerstone for a future where digital interactions are rooted in empowerment and transparency, reshaping our digital lives in profound ways. This transition to a decentralized framework marks a pivotal moment in our collective digital journey, promising a more secure, private, and user-centric online experience.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), in conjunction with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently released its “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/">Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies</a>” for organizations to make their cloud environments more secure. The report contains a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) for each strategy, which includes MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings and cloud-specific mitigation guidance.</p>  
<p>The agency emphasizes that these measures are critical for every company that uses cloud services as these environments are increasingly targeted by malicious cyber actors (MCAs). Earlier this year, the NSA, CISA and a host of international cybersecurity agencies <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3686651/russian-cyber-actors-target-cloud-hosted-infrastructure/">issued a joint advisory</a> analyzing the way that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to focus on initial access and disruption of cloud services. The new guidance provides mitigation strategies to counter these threats.</p> 
<p>Full strategy list:</p> 
  
  Uphold the cloud shared responsibility model  
  Use secure cloud identity and access management practices  
  Use secure cloud key management practices  
  Implement network segmentation and encryption in cloud environments  
  Secure data in the cloud  
  Defending continuous integration/continuous delivery environments&nbsp;  
  Enforce secure automated deployment practices through infrastructure as code  
  Account for complexities introduced by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments  
  Mitigate risks from managed service providers in cloud environments&nbsp;  
  Manage cloud logs for effective threat hunting  
  
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #1: Cloud Security Starts With Identity Security&nbsp;  
<p>Much of the guidance centers on having a robust identity security program. Insufficiently secure identity systems leave organizations exposed to any number of threats including phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks, identity fraud, MFA bombing attacks and more. Last year saw a 71% spike in cyberattacks that exploited stolen or compromised credentials, according to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">2024 threat report</a>, accounting for 30% of attacks. The report also revealed that 90% of the cloud assets for sale on the dark web were cloud account credentials.</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA Is No Longer Optional  
<p>Two of the top strategies directly relate to secure identity practices, and several others on the list call out the need to protect credentials and the threat posed by passwords and shared secrets. Specifically, the guidance recommends the use of phishing-resistant MFA as widely as possible. It defines phishing resistant methods as FIDO standards based public key cryptography or PKI-based CAC/PIV cards, pointing to the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">phishing-resistant MFA fact sheet</a> issued earlier by CISA.</p> 
<p>Example of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow:</p> 
<p></p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #2: Context Is King  
<p>Multiple measures in the guidance emphasize the need for detailed contextual information about the system’s activity and behavior. This data is critical to govern access and drive appropriate and timely responses to potential threats. For example, the report highlights the need for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/context-based-authentication-to-improve-security">context-based authentication</a>, using conditions such as geo location</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of such context-based access controls depends on the fidelity of the information flow, which in turn depends on monitoring risk from a wide variety of sources. Ideally, an organization’s cloud identity control systems would leverage the same risk data being collected for threat hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #3: Minimize Complexity  
<p>Before rolling out MFA and other cloud security solutions, it's crucial to fully understand the range of scenarios they'll be used in. The NSA guidance cautions against an uncoordinated approach, which can leave gaps in coverage and create complexity. Using multiple IAM systems and different authenticators can create confusion for users and hinder adoption. It also makes it harder to manage and monitor security effectively.</p> 
<p>This becomes especially critical in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Attackers move back and forth between on-prem and cloud environments. The guidance recommends the organizations implement identity solutions that can unify disparate systems and support all of their use cases. Authentication protocols should follow the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST SP 800-63 </a>Digital Identity Guidelines.</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #4: Embrace Zero Trust Principles  
<p>Whether you’re of the camp that Zero Trust is a marketing buzzword, or if it’s your guiding north star, the principles behind Zero Trust are solid security best practices. A Zero Trust approach makes data, systems, and networks harder for attackers to compromise in the first place, and slows them down if they do manage to get a foothold.&nbsp; Much of the NSA Cloud Security guidance is, in effect, Zero Trust tenets made actionable, starting with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> and least-privilege access control, to strong cryptographic protocols and network segmentation. Implicit in all of the guidance is to bake in Zero Trust best practices as you migrate to the cloud. It’s harder to re-architect already established systems, especially if there is not adequate segregation of duties. For example, your authentication systems should be separate from your IdP.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The NSA recommendation for phishing-resistant MFA stands out as one of the simplest yet most effective strategies. Until now, it's been the high-stakes sectors like financial services, insurance, and critical infrastructure leading the charge in adopting phishing-resistant controls. The NSA guidance makes clear that it’s time for security teams across the board to catch up. Here are some things to keep in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Prioritize a consistent experience. Users want a simple login process that is the same across cloud systems and resources as well as other channels. Employ independent, phishing-resistant authentication controls that work with multiple identity sources to provide a uniform experience.  
  Take a phased approach. Start with critical systems and high-risk users to minimize disruption and maximize impact. As you troubleshoot and succeed, gradually extend the approach to wider systems and user groups.  
  Beware of FIDO imitators. There is a vast difference between "FIDO-like" or "FIDO-compliant" and "FIDO Certified." Verify vendors' certifications on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO website</a>, ensuring all solution components, authenticators and servers, are certified.  
  
 How Organizations Can Meet NSA Cloud Security Provisions  
<p>The new guidance from NSA underscores the critical role identity plays in fortifying cloud security defenses. With malicious actors increasingly targeting cloud environments, and specifically identity systems, following recommended best practices becomes indispensable. The rapid <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">weaponization of generative AI</a> in attacks makes this even more critical.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance platform, which includes HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt, and HYPR Affirm, ensures that identity security meets NSA standards. It combines advanced passkey-based authentication with adaptive identity risk management, automated identity verification, and a user-friendly experience.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">HYPR Authenticate</a> provides highly secure FIDO-based, phishing-resistant MFA. It ensures that biometric templates are linked to individual devices, addressing privacy and security concerns while following NSA guidelines.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>If you’re an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager in a small or medium-sized business, you know the challenge of trying to secure a growing ecosystem of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Every day, there’s a new app that one of your employees must have, and it’s your job to ensure access is granted quickly, consistently, and securely. But with each new app, the risks of inconsistent access management grows. Is there a way to solve this challenge? Of course, there is. Why else would I be writing this and you reading it?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p>Many apps can’t be easily integrated into your IAM system. The apps might support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), but that’s often locked behind an expensive “Enterprise” tier. And even if you can afford it, automated provisioning requires SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), which is even less commonly supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCIM is an open standard that defines a schema for exchanging user identity information between systems. It allows IAM systems to automate the provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of user accounts in SaaS apps, ensuring that access is always in sync with the user’s current role and employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without SCIM, IAM managers are forced to rely on manual processes and custom integrations to manage SaaS app access. As your team and SaaS portfolio grow, these manual processes become increasingly unsustainable and error-prone.</p>
 The Challenge: SaaS App Sprawl and Access Management Complexity 
<p>So what do you do? Many fall back on spreadsheets and a patchwork of playbooks to try to keep up. But this approach has serious risks – and the risks get worse as you add more apps and more people with varying access needs and roles. This perfect storm of complexity spirals out of control, leading to inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance issues.</p>
 The Risks of Inconsistent Access Management 
<p>When onboarding and offboarding processes vary from app to app, it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Imagine a new sales rep who starts work excited to dive in and close some deals, only to find they can’t access the CRM because their account hasn’t been provisioned. Or consider the IT team that thinks they’ve completed an employee’s offboarding, only to discover weeks later that the ex-employee still has access to sensitive data in a cloud storage app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inconsistencies not only frustrate employees and waste time they also create serious security risks that compound with each new app.</p>
 The Dangers of Access Creep 
<p>Then there’s the access creep. As employees move between roles, their permissions don’t always keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ex-engineer Al Sutton revealed that despite quitting 18 months ago he still retained access to Twitter’s central file store on GitHub, a website used by software developers to store source code.” — <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/08/24/ex-twitter-staff-have-access-secret-software-code-whistleblower/#:~:text=Ex%2Dengineer%20Al%20Sutton%20revealed%20that%20despite%20quitting%2018%20months%20ago%20he%20still%20retained%20access%20to%20Twitter%27s%20central%20file%20store%20on%20GitHub%2C%20a%20website%20used%20by%20software%20developers%20to%20store%20source%20code.">The Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Consider a tech startup that uses GitHub Teams to manage their code repositories. When an engineer leaves the company, their GitHub account isn’t always immediately deprovisioned from the company’s GitHub organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the IT team is busy or forgets to follow up, the ex-employee could retain access to critical codebases, infrastructure-as-code templates, and other sensitive IP long after they’ve left. This lingering access is a major security risk even if the engineer has no malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the engineer’s personal GitHub account is ever compromised, hackers could then gain access to the company’s crucial assets. As your company grows and more employees cycle through, the risk of this happening increases.</p>
 The Danger of Poor Visibility 
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the lack of visibility into user permissions across SaaS apps. Even with an IAM system in place, the lack of automation makes it impossible to fully track and manage access across all SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an auditor who asks to see a report of everyone who has admin access to your financial systems. If those permissions are managed in a spreadsheet or worse, in someone’s head, you’re going to have a tough time pulling that report together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you can’t confidently prove who has access to what, you risk failing the audit and losing out on big deals with security-conscious customers. Achieving SOC2 compliance with inconsistent access management is a daunting task that only gets harder as your SaaS ecosystem expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even if you’re not pursuing SOC2 compliance, put yourself in your customers’ shoes: would you buy a product from a company that can’t even track something as basic as what their employees have access to?</p>
<p>The longer you wait to address these issues, the more entrenched and intractable they become. That’s why it’s critical to implement a solution now, before your SaaS environment grows too complex to manage.</p>
 The Solution: Centralized IAM Playbooks 
<p>By bringing all your access management processes together in one place – including manual steps, automated workflows, and everything in between – you can ensure consistent, timely execution of access changes across all your apps, now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gain a single pane of glass to monitor and manage permissions. And you can easily generate the reports you need to breeze through your next compliance audit, no matter how many SaaS apps you’ve added to your stack.</p>
 Why Legacy IAM Falls Short 
<p>But not all IAM solutions are up to this task. Legacy IAM systems often lack the flexibility and extensibility needed to implement truly centralized playbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might handle the basics of single sign-on and provisioning, yet struggle to accommodate the custom workflows and manual steps that are a reality of life with SaaS apps, especially as your app portfolio diversifies.</p>

<p>With the turn of the 20th century and the rise of the internet, transactions and services became increasingly digital – and so did our identities. Unlike physical identities where a person is in complete control of their identification documents and knows when these documents are missing or stolen, digital identities are stored on servers and databases owned by third-party vendors that offer their services in a digital format. So, it’s highly unlikely a person would know when their digital identity is stolen or compromised. In effect, a cybercriminal could pose as a legitimate user and inflict financial and reputational damage over a long period of time before the breach is detected.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and digital transformation has accelerated over the last few years, so has application sprawl, with the average company having over 254 SaaS apps, and less than half of those being used on a regular basis, according to a Productiv study. And an average mobile phone user has 80 apps installed, with 62% of those apps not used on a regular basis, according to a DataProt study. This SaaS sprawl has led to password fatigue and reuse as well as dormant accounts, increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals to launch successful identity-based attacks. It’s no wonder that phishing and credential compromise are the two most common initial attack vectors.</p>
<p>Taking a layered approach to identity-first security</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI technologies and criminal SaaS offerings such as phishing as a service that enable cybercriminals to launch effective and targeted phishing campaigns, identity has quickly become the perimeter that organizations need to secure against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In order to build an effective identity-first security strategy, organizations need to take a layered approach to a proactive defense – starting with an effective AI-based biometric solution to verify identities accurately while detecting fake IDs and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Then, enabling high assurance phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless authentication</a> (e.g., certificate-based authentication with passkeys) can help authenticate seamlessly while protecting against phishing and MFA-bypass attacks.</p>
<p>You can further eliminate the dangers that come with SaaS application sprawl and password fatigue&nbsp;by implementing a true passwordless experience with <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO)</a> and just-in-time user provisioning capabilities. This can streamline the authentication process and help eliminate dormant accounts, reducing license costs associated with granting user licenses for applications that users never log in to.</p>
<p>Finally, tying in a robust adaptive risk engine that can evaluate the risk score of a user based on contextual information (IP address, geolocation, travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, etc.) introduces friction in the process by requiring a second <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">MFA</a> or blocking access when risk levels are higher than a set threshold.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in some recent breaches, bringing in an identity verification step with physical credentials and liveness detection during MFA/password resets – to secure a high-value transaction or out-of-compliance user –&nbsp;can build a robust, proactive identity-first security strategy.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance. 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy. 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.</p>
 Enhancing Step-Up Authentication with BlockID 
<p>BlockID by 1Kosmos enhances the functionality and security measures of Step-Up Authentication by leveraging biometric technology and other features. Its integration forms a robust, user-centric authentication framework ideal for modern digital infrastructures.</p>
 
 <a>Biometric-based Authentication</a>: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 <a>Identity Proofing</a>: BlockID provides tamper evident and trustworthy digital verification of identity – anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 <a>Privacy by Design</a>: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 <a>Distributed Ledger</a>: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 <a>Interoperability</a>: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 <a>Industry Certifications</a>: Certified-to and exceeds requirements of NIST 800-63-3, FIDO2, UKDIATF and iBeta DEA EPCS specifications. 
 
<p>With its adaptable approach, scalable features, and the perfect equilibrium it strikes between security and user experience, Step Up Authentication has become a critical element in contemporary cybersecurity landscapes. Integrating Step Up Authentication might seem daunting, but it’s essential to fortify your security framework. If you’re considering making Step Up Authentication a cornerstone of your security infrastructure and seeking a solution that can effortlessly manage your authentication requirements, don’t hesitate to <a>contact our team today</a>.</p>

We’ll get into it in the episode, but suffice it to say that it’s an effort to bring trust to content online.</p><p>Was the pope really photographed in that puffy jacket? Was the photo of a war zone really taken this week, or is that from several years ago? And we’ll get into how to identify the identity of the individual or business behind the content, in a privacy-preserving way.</p><p>We talk about adoption of the C2PA standard, how the content authenticity initiative recruited so many of the most influential tech and media platforms, and how Adobe built the conviction to ship the first versions into production despite a cold start problem.</p><p>We also talk about the user experience of content authenticity, both from the creator side and consumer side, and some thornier issues including potential for censorship and deceit.</p><p>This is a fascinating episode into an emerging standard that I believe will be an important part of all our lives over the coming years, and example of incredible innovation coming from a large technology company.</p><p>You can learn more about the Content Authenticity Alliance at <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">https://contentauthenticity.org/</a> and you can find more about the C2PA standard at <a href="https://c2pa.org/">https://c2pa.org/</a></p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

While machines perform tasks at remarkable speeds, the human workforce often encounters periods of non-machine idle time, hindering overall productivity. Enter digital machine intelligence, a solution poised to transform the way we capture and analyze production performance to alleviate this issue and propelling the payment card issuance and personalization industry into a new era of efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>What Is Idle Time?</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the widely accepted definition is that idle time is the duration of time we wait while a machine or person, though fully functional, is not productive.</p>
<p>Idle time = scheduled production time – actual productive time.</p>
<p>The key here is the machine is fully functional (no errors, no broken parts, no system down, no communication issues, etc.), but it is not producing output for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Why Is It Important?</p>
<p>The most recent data I have gathered as a business analytics consultant in the card issuance and personalization space suggests that the average availability time for a company without any analytics solution or continuous improvement program ranges from 16% to 38%. This means that anywhere from 62%-84% of the time machines are not running when they could be. Closing that gap is where we see the largest impact when implementing continuous improvement and data-driven productivity gains on the production floor.</p>
<p>What Are Sources of Idle Time?</p>
<p>There are many common sources of idle time shared across all industries, but here we focus on those related to card issuance and personalization centers:</p>
 
 Machine or operator waiting for work or jobs – this issue stems from job planning or an issue with the preceding steps. 
 Machine or operator not authorized to perform work and waiting on approval – this could be due to quality checks, security checks, supervisor checks, missing job instructions, and so on. 
 Machine or operator is missing raw materials needed such as consumables and operator materials. 
 Machine or operator not present – this can happen for a variety of reasons including scheduled or unscheduled break, reassignment to another activity, or absenteeism with no backup resource available. 
 Machine or operator is on standby due to personal process limitations such as dual custody is required and only one operator is available, missing card needs to be found, a security incident related to the previous job run occurs and an investigation is underway, or machine calibration checks are needed. 
 The machine is undergoing setup for a variety of reasons including job loading or material loading, machine is getting cleaned or calibrated, or the workstation is getting set up for the job. 
 External dependencies are at play including a halt to production ordered by the customer, a quality or maintenance lead who initiates immediate work stoppage, a power or network outage, a supplies shortage, external software delays, an emergency evacuation, or any situation where wait times are instituted. 
 
<p>How to Reduce Idle Time</p>
<p>The first step to resolving any problem is to understand the root cause and magnitude. This is the basis of knowledge-based management or Lean Six Sigma manufacturing: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.</p>
 
 Define: The definitions have been made clear on what idle time is; now the next step is to measure them. 
 Measure: To gauge machine productivity accurately, track scheduled work time and measure actual operational periods, focusing on the cumulative bursts of output like finished personalized products. If a software-hardware solution is not available, your best bet is manual monitoring with a stopwatch for the entirety of the day, ensuring unbiased and unhindered data collection. However, one caveat is that an on-site observer may not pinpoint process and employee-related issues with the utmost precision. 
 Analyze: After obtaining data for a single machine’s scheduled work versus actual work for a day, calculate the idle time. If the idle time exceeds 15% (idle time divided by scheduled work time), there is a problem requiring attention. Achieving the industry average of 15% idle time is possible with the implementation of software-hardware tracking systems along with fostering a continuous improvement culture. Thorough data collection enables the creation of a Pareto chart, identifying the easiest-to-solve issues, or “low-hanging fruits.” Targeting these areas strategically will maximize gains. In cases of insufficient data, a return to the measure phase is necessary to confidently identify root causes. Implementing tools like Ishikawa diagrams helps isolate overlapping causes, guiding resource allocation and energy to the right focus areas. 
 Improve: Identifying the problem is just the beginning; the real challenge is solving it. Now armed with insights into the issue’s source, you can brainstorm solutions – whether it involves process modifications, personnel retraining, or technological changes. Often, this is where an external consultant can offer valuable perspectives, leveraging industry experience and unbiased insights. Once a solution is pinpointed and evaluated, an implementation plan, coupled with a trial and measurement system, ensures fair assessment and feedback from all stakeholders. This initial trial is crucial for the success of the broader rollout. Lack of an experienced continuous improvement engineer often leads to challenges and failures at this stage, making external consultation advisable. 
 Control: After the successful trial and subsequent large-scale rollout, sustaining the solution becomes the most challenging phase. The absence of proper controls, feedback mechanisms, and the ability to steer the process, teams, and operation often leads to solutions unraveling after a few months. Management’s shift in focus and personnel reverting to familiar habits contribute to this breakdown. Control is about identifying any future pains that come up and developing and adapting the solution to overcome these bumps on the road so the gains of the solution can be earned for the long run. The key to process control is to know when it is going out of control, which requires continuous monitoring and data collection every minute of every hour to identify long-term trends. This is where having software running in the background collecting data analytics is key. Without control, processes fall apart. 
 
<p>The Power of Production Analytics</p>
<p>Idle time is by far the largest contributor to operational inefficiencies in card issuance and personalization environments. Many factories are using logbook-based manual measurements to understand what is happening, which can be marred by bias, human error, and lack of detail. Without a software-hardware based analytics solution, many key opportunities to improve go undiscovered. Once these problems have been clearly identified, there is a critical process to analyze the data to identify key root causes. After that, a rigorous and creative solution-generating process must take place with a carefully orchestrated trial preceding a large rollout of the solution. Additionally, any gains from these depend entirely on the factories’ abilities to control and sustain those gains in the long run, which requires continuous data monitoring and solution steering.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are a way to package and share tamper-proof digital information so that you can always authenticate where it originally came from. What makes this technology powerful is that anyone can cryptographically verify the issuer of the credential, and that no changes to the data have occurred since the credential’s creation, enabling the information inside to be trusted and immediately acted on.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>To put it simply, verifiable credentials are packages of data created in a decentralized network by issuing organizations or parties and stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>Once created, the party issuing these packages can be verified by anyone with the appropriate software. As a credential is created, the issuing party digitally signs the information inside, and once it is signed, any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential, so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What can a verifiable credential represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, any information tied to identification or an identity can be turned into a verifiable credential: you can represent a person, a car, a building, an organization, or a connected device, and any information that can be associated with these entities.</p>
<p>For example, colleges and universities can issue documents such as diplomas or transcripts to students&nbsp; as verifiable credentials. These can be easily shared with anyone who needs to verify that information. Verification is instant and doesn’t require going back to the university for manual proof, providing a much more efficient experience for everyone.</p>
<p>To learn more about this read our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of paper documents and manual processes</p>
<p>In today’s system, credentials are everywhere: you likely have a driver’s license, passport, maybe a badge to access your place of employment.</p>
<p>But paper documents have several drawbacks:</p>
<p>They can be stolen, copied, forged or misplaced.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be in the same physical location to acquire them</p>
<p>They need to be stored securely.</p>
<p>Using them can share more data than needed, or require you to copy down the information they contain manually.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable you to hold all the same information, digitally, in a way that you have more control over and can share how you like.</p>
<p>From an organization standpoint they provide a way to quickly share information across different systems without a need for complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Let’s walk through a quick example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the DMV can issue you a driver’s license, which contains personal information such as your date of birth, eye color, height, weight, full name, license number, and address. When attempting to purchase an age-restricted item, the vendor will often check your license to confirm your age and that you can legally purchase the item. When you hand over your ID, you hand over all of the information, not just your date of birth — and that information can easily be misused.</p>
<p>In the same scenario, a verifiable credential is still issued by the DMV, and it still contains all that personal data, but, crucially, the data can be separated and shared in a much more selective way. And we can even go a step further and simply share eligibility: the shop doesn’t need to know your actual birthdate, they just need to know if you’re over a certain age, which can be shared in the form of simple yes or no.</p>
<p>To learn more about making purchases with verifiable credentials read our article on how they will change <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">finance and payments.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does decentralization matter?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic that deserves its own blog but a quick few points are:</p>
<p>As other digital identification methods start to catch on, such as mobile driver’s licenses, it’s important to remember that simply digitizing a document does not make it secure. What is critical is how that document is stored and shared.</p>
<p>By storing verifiable credentials locally on the end user’s mobile device you can be sure they control that data and can share it only with whomever they choose to.</p>
<p>If the mobile driver’s license is not decentralized, it means that the system needs to be contacted to verify a person’s identity. This provides a slower verification process, can run into issues if the database is unreachable, and represents a huge target for bad actors.</p>

 Recently released compliance survey reveals operators’ most common concerns, why players abandon onboarding and the likely effect of UK’s upcoming financial risk checks. 



 



<p>The online gambling market shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by the end of 2024 the revenue generated from the sector is <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">projected to exceed $107 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As new markets like Peru and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a> open, and established markets like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK </a>and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Canada </a>revise their regulatory frameworks, the challenges faced by betting and gambing operators’ compliance teams are becoming increasingly complicated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, IDnow commissioned SBC Media to investigate the compliance challenges most likely to affect operators in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ features insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry, and looked at four areas: compliance, fraud, onboarding and financial risk checks.</p>



<blockquote><p>In understanding the compliance challenges that betting and gaming operators face, we believe we can better address our clients’ pain points and empower them to provide the journey that their customers deserve.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow. </blockquote>



 Biggest compliance pain points for gambling operators. 



<p>According to the survey, the most common compliance challenge was source of funds checks, which was cited as one of the most difficult issues by more than a fifth of global respondents, rising to nearly 30% of European-based compliance professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the other end of the spectrum, respondents found age verification the least difficult to deal with, followed by identity verification, reflecting the availability of robust third-party solutions to handle that crucial part of onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another question posed in the survey was related to speed of implementation, and how long it took operators to fulfil certain compliance requirements, such as obtaining a licence, undergoing an audit and complying with regulatory requirements in a new market. While being first to market is obviously an important factor, and can be a significant competitive advantage, results from the survey suggest that becoming compliant is not something that should be rushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two-fifths of operators said they typically take 6-12 months to fulfil the compliance requirements ahead of entering a new territory, while around 30% suggested the process took 3-6 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is the most important thing to factor in when entering new markets. At around 60% each, respondents were split between the ability to utilize existing compliance software (identity verification and AML solutions) and speed of implementation as the most important factors.</p>



 Biggest fraud concerns in the gambling industry. 



<p>The second section of the survey was designed to identify the prevalence and trends of different types of fraud and the prevention of fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It revealed that bonus abuse and attempts at document fraud remain most commonplace (65% and 57% respectively), despite improvements to identification and prevention tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the future, there is also concern about social engineering attacks (54%) and the growing threat of facial recognition spoofing attacks (33%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read about the growing threat of social media fraud, which leverages social engineering, in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also broad consensus on whether AI-powered anti-fraud tools were the way forward. More than 70% of respondents either already have such tools or plan to implement them in the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The results of this survey should act as a wake-up call for gambling operators in the UK and elsewhere to prepare themselves for the emerging fraud and compliance challenges. To address these challenges, operators will need a multi-dimensional approach to identity verification and fraud prevention, that enables seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere,” said Roger.</p>

 The importance and dangers of onboarding. 



<p>Onboarding is a pivotal stage in the customer journey and can make or break your business. In a regulated industry, like financial services or gambling, the balance between offering a seamless yet safe and secure onboarding experience has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of speed and simplicity in the onboarding process was emphasised by the survey responses, with regulatory requirements seen as less of a barrier (31%) to completion than a complex and lengthy registration experience (55%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document submission proved to be the biggest challenge for global players (51%), with both ID document submission and personal financial information submission (51%) proving to be an obstacle to the completion of onboarding.</p>



 What do operators really think about financial risk checks? 



<p>No topic has been more polarizing to the UK’s gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no operator yet has experience of working within the scope of these checks, the survey posed two questions: what they expected the impact of such checks would be on the UK market and what effect they would have on the wider international industry. Most compliance professionals (66%) expressed concerns that the move would lead to lower sign-ups for licensed operators, but would, in turn, strengthen the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some of the answers were nuanced and several respondents were open to the idea that an affordability check could have some positives for the industry such as improving trust levels among players, reducing fraud and helping to create a level playing field for smaller operators.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative, we announced </a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies</a> in November 2023. These policies are designed to help you secure your organization's resources and data based on your usage patterns, risk factors, and existing policy configuration, all while minimizing your effort. Our top recommendation for improving your identity secure posture is enabling multifactor authentication (MFA), which <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">reduces the risk of compromise by 99.2%</a>. This is why our first three policies are all related to MFA for different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we announced Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies, we’ve rolled out these policies to more than 500,000 tenants in report-only mode. In this mode, the policies don’t impact access but log the results of policy evaluation. This allows administrators to assess the impact before enforcing these policies. Thanks to proactive actions taken by administrators to enable or customize these policies, over 900,000 users are now protected with MFA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been actively listening to your feedback. Customers shared that Microsoft-managed policies impact the number of Conditional Access policies that organizations can create. We’ve addressed this by making a significant change: Microsoft-managed policies will no longer count towards the Conditional Access policy limit. Another adjustment relates to existing Conditional Access policies. If you already have a policy in the “On” state that meets or exceeds the requirements set by the Microsoft-managed policy, the latter will not be automatically enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we communicated that these policies would be automatically enabled 90 days after creation. However, based on customer feedback, we recognize that some customers need additional time to prepare for these policies to be enforced. As a result, we have extended the time frame before enforcing the policies for this initial set of policies. For these three policies, you will have more than 90 days to review and customize (or disable) your Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies before they are automatically enforced. Rest assured, you’ll receive an email and a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter">Message Center</a> notification providing a 28-day advance notification before the policies are enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call to Action</p>
 
 Review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>.  
 Add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
<p> </p>
 
 Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state.<br>  
 
<p>For additional customization needs, you can duplicate these policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in February, SpruceID participated in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill, a public event held in Salt Lake City at the Utah State Capitol. This yearly event celebrates Utah’s outdoor recreation opportunities and contributions to the state’s economy, health, and quality of life. SpruceID joined the Department of Natural Resources at a booth during the event to highlight our State of Utah pilot program for digital credentials, in partnership with the Division of Technology Services and the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The objective of the pilot program is to demonstrate the feasibility of verifiable digital credentials for state-issued credentials across various use cases, such as off-highway vehicle education course certificates. The pilot aims to pioneer a privacy-first digital credentialing program that empowers residents to take control of their online data and seamlessly integrate with the government’s existing infrastructure while ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p><p>The booth at the Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill provided us with a platform to connect with policymakers, legislators, and the general public. We took the opportunity to demonstrate the digital credential experience for both holders and verifiers while educating attendees about the pilot program for digital credentials in Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from paying bills and traveling to accessing healthcare and public benefits. This shift to digital services has highlighted the need for innovative government leadership in digital identity and credentialing solutions. Traditional paper or plastic credentials have increasingly shown limitations leading to privacy concerns, susceptibility to fraud, and poor user experiences.</p><p>As the pilot becomes publicly available, participants can download a digital credential for their OHV education course certificate to store on their mobile device and take it whenever they are on the trails. Whether in a highly trafficked area or remote location without cell service, the holder can access their permit and present it as a QR code for the verifier to scan in just a few taps. The verification checks the credential validity and that it has a digital signature by the Utah DNR without pinging back to the Utah servers. This means that verifications do not enable additional tracking or a new centralized database. Not only is this a more convenient and secure option for users, but it also saves significant time filling out and processing paperwork.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill was an opportunity to showcase the pilot program for digital verifiable credentials and a pivotal moment to engage with the Utah community and gather invaluable feedback. </p><p>This event demonstrated the program's potential impact on improving the efficiency, security, and privacy of state-issued credentials. We are grateful for the chance to contribute to Utah’s outdoor recreation community and look forward to the journey ahead as we work towards a more connected, secure, and digitally empowered society.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>When it comes to cyberattacks, March has come in like a lion for Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft said in an SEC filing that that information stolen in a hack of senior leaders’ email accounts is now being used to “gain or attempt to gain access” to company source code repositories and other internal systems. The fallout remains unknown. Just a few days earlier, threat researchers at Proofpoint <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft">reported a phishing campaign</a> by the well-known threat group TA577 that targets Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication information. Attackers sent thousands of tailored emails designed to steal employees' NTLM “hashes” (or challenge/response values) from hundreds of organizations around the globe. These “hashes” can be cracked with far-reaching consequences, depending on an organization’s security measures.</p>  
 Why Is NTLM Authentication Vulnerable  
<p>A still widely used protocol in Windows environments, NTLM provides a natively implemented and easy to use method for authenticating into applications on enterprise servers. At more than thirty years old, it’s also a perennial attack target.</p> 
<p>Weaker cryptographic algorithms, unsalted password hashes stored on the client and server / domain controller, and a lack of server authentication &nbsp;by default, leave the NTLM protocol susceptible to a variety of attacks, either in the first NTLMv1 or the newer NTLMv2 version. These include interception, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, relay and pass-the-hash attacks, as well as straightforward brute force and password cracking — eight-character NTLM password hashes can be brute-forced using <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-a-rainbow-table-attack">rainbow tables</a> and other techniques within three minutes. NTLM does not support modern authentication methods like biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or phishing-resistant FIDO keys.</p> 
 What’s Different About the TA577 NTLM Authentication Campaign?  
<p>The abuse of the NTLM protocol for gathering victim’s information and potentially stealing NTLM challenge/response material is not a new technique, and has been observed in the past in different ways. One notable example was the <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/newly-discovered-watering-hole-attack-targets-ukrainian-canadian-organizations/">compromise of the San Francisco airport website</a> and several other organizations across the world, where threat actors used the compromised sites to serve malicious code that triggered SMB connections to attacker-controlled servers.</p> 
<p>The newest campaign takes a new twist by using phishing thread-jacking techniques to deliver zipped HTML attachments customized for each individual target.</p> 
 How the Attack Works  
<p>The malicious emails appear to be replies to a legitimate message thread. Upon opening, the HTML file triggers a meta refresh attempt to connect to a text file set up by the attacker on a rogue Server Message Block (SMB) server. The attacker-controlled server can then steal the NTLM authentication values when the protocol performs its standard challenge/response exchange. Those values change according to the version of the protocol, and whether it is a NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 exchange, but consist of a nonce (a random value of a single use) that’s encrypted using the user’ passwords as the key.</p> 
<p>A very common technique used to make it easier to then crack the obtained challenge/response values, is to leverage a well known and fixed server challenge. The protocol requires the server to include a challenge, consisting of a 16-byte random number, on every connection. By making the server challenge a fixed one, it’s possible to use pre-calculated hash tables and reduce the time and processing required to crack the user’s passwords.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the steps of the attack:</p> 
 NTLM Phishing  
<p></p> 
 Consequences of a Successful NTLM Attack  
<p>Stolen NTLM challenge/response values can be used to obtain victim’s credentials and hijack accounts, access sensitive information and potentially elevate privileges. Attackers can then move laterally within the network and compromise additional systems in the case they’ve already obtained a foothold into the victim’s organization network.</p> 
 How HYPR Protects Against the TA577 NTLM Attacks  
<p>Microsoft has long provided mitigations and mechanisms to disable the use of the NTLM protocol, including migrating to more secure replacements like Kerberos. However, organizations have been slow to implement these recommendations due to the complexity and dependency of multiple products and legacy systems on these protocols.</p> 
<p>When the legacy NTLM authentication protocols cannot be disabled and are still part of the organization’s environment, the resistance to NTLM attacks comes from the strength of the user’s passwords.&nbsp;In these environments, leveraging HYPR’s passwordless approach with certificate-based authentication allows organizations to enforce smart-card usage for passwordless, and remove the dependency of users having to login with their passwords. This provides opportunities to implement mitigation strategies to some of the NTLM weaknesses, such as the use of IT or programmatically-managed strong passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR reduces the risk to organizations from attacks on NTLM authentication by TA577 and other threat actors. HYPR’s phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a> were built to protect Microsoft Entra ID environments from credential-based attacks while making login easier for users. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/press-releases/hypr-leads-passwordless-revolution-with-launch-of-microsoft-approved-enterprise-passkeys">Microsoft approved and validated</a>, Enterprise Passkeys use highly secure FIDO2 authentication protocols instead of passwords or other types of shared secrets. With HYPR in place, there is no password for an attacker to steal.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>As the NTLM authentication protocol relies on passwords, those — indeed all passwords — are a prime target for bad actors. It’s much easier to login with valid credentials than to find a new vulnerability to exploit. Moreover, attackers constantly come up with inventive ways to breach security controls. Organizations need to eliminate the source of insecurity. As a Microsoft partner and member of MISA, HYPR integrates tightly with Microsoft environments and products. Working seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, the HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines passkey-based authentication with continuous risk monitoring and automated identity verification to provide the highest level of identity security.</p>

  <p>The introduction of cross-tenant access settings for Microsoft Entra External ID marked a pivotal shift in how organizations manage security and collaboration across different tenants. This blog post dives into the essence of these settings, focusing on their significance for secure B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three key areas of focus, include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The critical aspect of trusting multifactor authentication (MFA) from business collaborators, including the exploration into the balance between maintaining high security standards and ensuring a seamless user experience for B2B guest users, plus highlighting a perspective to simplify authentication processes and reduce administrative burdens.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Offering a closer look at the cross-tenant access settings and how these settings enable more granular control over cross-tenant collaborations. Real-world use cases illustrate the application of these policies in managing and restricting access to ensure security without hindering productivity and cooperation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Insights into leveraging Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access policies for improved security and collaboration and to ensure a smooth user experience.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Trust MFA from business collaborators (B2B collaboration) by default&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations are increasingly embracing B2B collaboration to streamline workflows and facilitate cooperation with external partners. As part of this collaborative approach, many businesses routinely create guest user accounts within their Microsoft Entra tenants and grant trusted partners access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, many have already extended the requirement for MFA to B2B guest users. This, however, requires external users in cross-tenant access scenarios to register an additional authentication method in the foreign tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for B2B guest users to register for an additional MFA method in the resource tenant basically increases the account security, but at the same time it adds layers of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 User experience disruption in a B2B collaboration scenario&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2B guest users who have already implemented MFA in their home tenant and have become accustomed to the convenience of advanced MFA methods like Windows Hello for Business, encounter disruptions when attempting to access the resource tenant. Even if users have already provided strong authentication in their home tenant, they will still be prompted for authentication again in the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: MFA prompt for B2B guest user who access protected resource in foreign tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Administrative overhead for IT and users&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team face additional administrative tasks. For the guest user, navigating a new MFA setup and maintaining an additional MFA registration can be annoying. For the tenant administrator and the support team, managing these additional MFA registrations can increase overhead significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where a guest user loses access to their device or does not have a backup for a new device, regaining access to their account involves additional administrative tasks for both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team. The guest user may need to perform a new MFA setup, while the tenant support team need to manage the additional MFA registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering why guest users must register an additional authentication method per resource tenant when they already have one in their home tenant? Well, let's talk about the trust settings in cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the authentication process&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more efficient approach to managing MFA in cross-tenant B2B collaborations is to trust the MFA from a guest's home tenant. Doing so eliminates the need for additional MFA registration and maintenance in the resource tenant. This means that the user can continue to use his usual strong authentication method that he uses in his home tenant and does not have to register another method in the resource tenant. This is a considerable relief for the user and the support team of the resource tenant no longer has to deal with the MFA registrations of the guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA default trust settings are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center (<a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>). In the default configuration, a Microsoft Entra ID tenant does not trust any incoming MFA from other tenants. To change the behavior, the inbound defaults must be edited. The following screenshots provide a walkthrough and show the desired configuration. The "Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants" setting is disabled by default and must be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings - Default Trust settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple configuration enables B2B guest users to use their existing MFA in their home tenant to satisfy existing MFA requirements in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once configured, B2B guest users can use additional authentication methods that have a higher authentication strength than MFA methods that are only available in a foreign resource tenant. This is a very important advantage because this configuration also enables the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods for B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Comparison of the authentication methods available in the home tenant and a resource tenant</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about available authentication methods, refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strength-external-users">Microsoft Entra documentation about authentication strengths for external users.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this configuration is designed to enhance the user experience and ease the administrative efforts, it can inadvertently create security risks. For instance, guest users might opt for simpler, less secure authentication methods in their home tenant compared to the authentication methods typically used in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, the cross-tenant access trust settings work seamlessly with Conditional Access and authentication strengths. Plus, with MFA trust, guest users can use the same phishing-resistant authentication methods used in their home tenant like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 keys, and certificate-based authentication to get access to the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key advantage can be used to increase the login security of guest users. When the default trust settings are adjusted, the Conditional Access policies and authentication strengths should be reviewed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We explored the benefits of using MFA trust to leverage the same strong authentication methods used by guest users in their home tenant to improve security, usability and efficiency. In the next chapter, we will look at how tenant administrators can control outbound collaboration settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Outbound access restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings, organizations can manage their collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. These settings provide more granular control over access, allowing you to manage how you collaborate with external organizations. In this section, we will take a closer look at the outbound settings feature and its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions and cross-tenant access settings are two powerful tools that can help you control access to your organization’s resources. While they are often configured together, it’s important to understand that they operate separately from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-v2#tenant-restrictions-vs-inbound-and-outbound-settings">Microsoft Learn</a> article:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of cross-tenant access settings this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inbound settings control external account access to your internal apps.&nbsp; 
 Outbound settings control internal account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 Tenant restrictions control external account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, tenant restrictions allow you to create a policy to control access to external apps when users sign in with an external account from your networks or devices while the inbound and outbound access settings focus on guests accounts in your tenant or guest accounts in resource tenants (what your users is accessing and where).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this all cleared up let’s focus on using an outbound access setting and a real-world application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use case&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-world use case to leverage the outbound settings control. The Contoso organization is used in the following use case:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso would like to implement more detailed controls with B2B business collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Contoso would like to only collaborate with specific organizations. This includes the ability to securely add or remove partner organizations as the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Additionally, Contoso would need the ability to restrict applications that can be accessed in any partner resource tenant along with the ability to restrict and control user access to partner resource tenants.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up the outbound restriction for the needed use case, we will need to configure the outbound defaults. This essentially will block all outbound collaboration. Note that this can be scoped to either include all users, selected users or all or selected external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From within the Microsoft Entra Admin center, navigate to the External Identities menu and select the cross-tenant access setting feature. From here select the default settings config followed by edit outbound defaults.&nbsp; Select Block access followed by the applies to option. We can either select a subset of users or apply this to all users. In this example all users are blocked and all external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Outbound defaults</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Figure 6: Outbound block access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting any access in a resource tenant will result in the below notification. This is expected since the tenant wide outbound access default setting is in place explicitly blocking any resource tenant level access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Resource tenant blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking at the user sign-in logs, we can establish the same conclusion via the failure reasoned and the resource tenant accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Sign-in logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable collaboration when the outbound access default setting is applied, a tenant ID or domain name of a resource tenant or origin must be included in the cross-tenant access settings of Microsoft Entra. In the example below, the tenant of Contoso’s partner organization “Wingtip Toys” is added and the outbound access configuration setup to allow collaboration with selected Contoso users. In this case, the users with group membership to “External-TR-ContosoAccess” will be allowed access to selected application as per figure 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a Privileged Access Group (PAG) can be used allowing no permeant standing access. Access must be requested via Privileged Identity Management (PIM). The PIM activation process can be set up to require an approver, MFA or additional authentication context via Conditional Access. E.g. step-up authentication or location-based policy restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Outbound access settings users and groups</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Outbound access settings external applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon configuring the needed outbound access settings any user that is part of the selected user or group outbound configuration setting will be allowed access to the selected external applications. In the below example we can see the demo user accessed a selected external application as per previous configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: sign-in log successful</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>With cross-tenant access and outbound access settings, customers can granularly restrict and control collaboration with external resource tenants. This enables more control over what your internal accounts can access externally and where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: Before enabling, it’s important to understand this is a tenant wide configuration and you will need to understand and evaluate your organizations collaboration needs and scope the outbound access setting and allowed organizations accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explored how to use cross-tenant access and outbound access settings in Microsoft Entra to manage and secure external collaboration. Cross-tenant access allows you to share your resources with users from other tenants, while outbound access settings and tenant restrictions let you control which external tenants your users can access. You can configure both features at the tenant level and specify the allowed or blocked organizations according to your business needs. Additionally, we have discussed how to use Default MFA Trust to use existing, strong authentication methods from foreign tenants in cross-tenant access scenarios and improve your security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next blog, we will look more closely at tenant restrictions and authentication strengths and contexts. Keep following this blog series, post your feedback, and we hope you join us again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This blog is the second in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in practical ways on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Personal data stores (PDSs) equip individuals with the means of collecting, holding and using their own data for their own purposes, under their own control, independently of the organisations that collect data about them. Our <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">last blog</a> on PDSs themselves described how we have implemented this core functionality so that it can operate at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>But PDSs have limited functionality if operating just by themselves. Sure, they provide a secure digital ‘filing cabinet’ for your data, but this doesn’t include processes for putting data into this filing cabinet, taking data out of it, or sharing it with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>This is where the real day-to-day usefulness of the PDS kicks in. There are occasions when simply being able to look our own data up, or to use our own means of ‘crunching’ this data, helps us manage our lives better. But usually we need the help of domain experts — specialist service providers.</p><p>There are countless such service providers out there offering different ways of helping us manage our different ‘life departments’ (e.g. money, home, health, travel, work, leisure activities and so on). But they all need to access at least some personal data in order to configure what they do to our particular needs and circumstances. That’s where data sharing comes in. This is the job of our second platform: our Personal Data eXchange&nbsp;(PDX).</p> The workhorse at&nbsp;work <p>The PDX is the real workhorse of our infrastructure. It’s where stuff happens (as opposed to the PDS where our personal data is stored statically).</p><p>Most of this work is done via secure APIs or ‘Application Program Interfaces’. An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that software programmers can use for one software system to communicate or interact with another software system in a safe, automated way. APIs allow computers to ‘talk’ to each other following a set of pre-agreed rules.</p><p>Using our APIs, service providers can connect their systems to an individual’s PDS, enabling them (and the individual) to share and receive data, potentially in an ongoing, automated manner according to predefined rules. Each such request or communication is uniquely encrypted in such a manner that it can only be decrypted in the specific context of the relationship between the Mydex Member and the service provider in question.</p><p>Practically speaking, this involves lots of to-ing and fro-ing between the individual’s PDS and the service provider’s systems, <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/overview.html">as shown by this page</a> on our developer documentation website. These handshakes between computer systems are built into how our infrastructure works and are designed to carry on working in an automated way, always according to the data sharing agreements terms defined by the service provider and approved by the individual. In other words, always under the control of the individual.</p><p>To ordinary mortals who are not software developers, the details can look daunting. Take a look at these <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/connection-api-details.html">guidelines for developers</a> as an example. But for individuals using their PDS all this activity takes place under the hood. All that matters for the Mydex Member is that the right data can be moved in or out at the right times, safely, securely and easily. The result is a bit like a direct debit or automated payment mechanism like a salary payment: once it has been set up it keeps on running, automatically, until the person who set it up decides to change (or stop)&nbsp;it.</p><p>As part of what we do, we provide developers with all sorts of support systems and advice to help them deal with all the necessary technicalities. You can see an <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/developer-helpers.html">example&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The PDX is available 24hrs a day and 365 days a year. It is ‘always on’ and always available. It creates a safe, secure cloud of connectivity between people and their service providers which is fully GDPR compliant.</p> Data Sharing Agreements <p>At the heart of this process is our Data Sharing Agreements.</p><p>In today’s system, consent has become a stick to beat individuals with. Each organisation writes their own privacy policy and terms and conditions in their own, different way, and corporate lawyers sometimes craft the wordings of these documents to be as confusing and open-ended as possible. This can make it as hard for people to protect themselves from privacy invasions and data landgrabs. Many people give up even&nbsp;trying.</p><p>Our Data Sharing Agreements are designed to rectify this situation.</p><p>First off, as part of subscribing to the platform, service providers have to sign up to a Trust Framework. You can see its core principles of citizen data empowerment <a href="https://mydex.org/about-us/mydex-charter/">here</a>.</p><p>Data Sharing Agreements are written in a standard, easy-to-understand format. (You can see a <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-sharing-agreement.html">template of an agreement here</a>.) They focus on specifics: exactly what data is needed to do what, over what time period. The organisation creates the data sharing agreement, which is designed to be GDPR compliant, and makes their GDPR declarations as part of setting up their connection to the Mydex PDX API platform. As part of their terms for subscribers they acknowledge their legal commitment and liability if they fail to keep their side of the contract.</p><p>For organisations wanting to game current consent systems, our Data Sharing Agreements represent a horrifying prospect. But for bona fide service providers it’s actually a bonus. It cuts costs and complexity, creates added trust and assurance, and ensures they are GDPR compliant by default. It creates a value-releasing win-win.</p><p>The PDX uses these Data Sharing Agreements to operate. Once the individual approves the Data Sharing Agreement (DSA), the PDX notifies the subscriber that the DSA is active and they can commence delivery and collection. The PDX enforces the scope of the DSA — and only that scope. If an organisation seeks to access any data outside the terms of the DSA, the PDX blocks it. It will only allow transactions that are compliant with the DSA; that constitute a valid request. Thus, once the DSA has been set up, it operates continuously and automatically on behalf of the&nbsp;member.</p><p>Subscribers can create multiple connections and data sharing agreements to join the dots between their own systems. The system allows for fine tuning of the agreements to reflect service evolution and changing requirements safely, easily and in a fully auditable manner. Support services include as examples notifications of changes or additions to a Member’s PDS, or supporting batch data delivery for high volume data payloads (such as ‘smart’ meter electricity consumption data which can be generated every thirty seconds every day of the&nbsp;week).</p> Interoperability and data&nbsp;sharing <p>Working with the PDS, the PDX is an interoperability engine. Different organisations use different software systems using different standards and different formats. That’s not going to change any time&nbsp;soon.</p><p>This is one of our core challenges — and source of added value. Our infrastructure allows any service provider to interact with the member’s PDS using whatever software, standards and formats they currently use, and to access data shared by the individual that may have been originated elsewhere, using completely different software systems, standards and formats. We work as a translation service between these standards. This activity is built into how the infrastructure works.</p><p>Even so, one of the biggest potential benefits of our infrastructure is the way it enables data sharing between organisations via the individual who the data relates to. There are a very large number of scenarios across all industries where no one, single, service provider provides everything an individual needs to solve a problem or get a task done. That leaves individuals having to integrate the different inputs of different service providers to create an integrated whole.</p><p>Recognising this, often organisations try to set up direct ways of sharing data about the individual i.e. with each other. This quickly becomes nightmarishly complex, ethically and operationally risky, and costly. So much so that even where the need is great, often it still ends up not happening or happening slowly, badly and at great cost. Our Personal Data eXchange and PDSs are designed to eradicate this complexity, cost and&nbsp;risk.</p> Where the real value&nbsp;lies <p>One important point about this is that it’s all about data logistics. ‘Data logistics’. That’s not something that most people think about day to day. But it is immensely — pivotally — important for the provision of efficient, effective services. It is also the subject of many unhelpful misconceptions about where the value of personal data&nbsp;lies.</p><p>The way many people talk, you could be forgiven for thinking that data becomes valuable only when it is assembled in a massive database and when some clever algorithm or piece of AI gets to work on it, identifying patterns, correlations and trends within it, and so on. Data analytics in other&nbsp;words.</p><p>In lots of conversations this is treated as the be all and end all. But it isn’t. Not by a long shot. For real life services to work efficiently exactly the opposite is needed. Whatever the service is — planning and delivering a cancer intervention, say, or deciding on a mortgage or benefit application — what the service provider needs is access to exactly the right, reliable, relevant data at the right time. No more and no less. This is not about ‘the more data the better’. You don’t need a person’s inside leg measurement to decide on that mortgage application. It is all about the right data, and only the right data. It is highly focused and specific.</p><p>Our PDX infrastructure is modular and flexible, its potential data points infinitely configurable. It provides the data logistics infrastructure that every service provider (and every individual) needs to make sure that exactly the right data flows to and from the right people at the right times for every possible service relating to that individual.</p> Verified Attributes <p>A key part of all this is the ability to share what we call ‘verified attributes’.</p><p>For a service provider to be able to efficiently use data that has been shared by an individual, they have to be able to rely on it. To trust it. There’s no point in the person sharing the data only for the service provider to have to stop what they are doing to go and check to see if it is accurate or&nbsp;true.</p><p>What we all need is a system by which service providers can be confident in the reliability of the data they are receiving — for trust to be able to travel with the data. The PDX provides systems that enable this to happen. ‘Metadata’ — data about the data — lies at the heart of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>When sharing any data, the PDX also shares additional data about the data, for example, the time and date of its origination, who originated it, when it was last updated, and so on. Thus, for example, if the data is about an educational qualification, it’s not just the individual claiming to have passed the exam. They could be lying. It includes data from the educational establishment concerned, verifying that the individual has passed their exam and when they did&nbsp;so.</p><p>Depending on the type of data concerned, these levels of verification can vary. If an individual is merely expressing a preference e.g. “I like it pink”, the only piece of relevant metadata is the time and date of them saying so. If it’s a person claiming to be a qualified doctor, or that they are entitled to a certain benefit or payment, much more metadata is required, <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/verified-attributes.html">as explained here</a>. But the way our PDX infrastructure is designed, it doesn’t matter. It is designed to send all the appropriate, relevant metadata about the data routinely, as a matter of&nbsp;course.</p> Ongoing development <p>Providing a service like this is a bit like painting the Forth Bridge. There is always more we can do — and we have a roadmap for doing so. Some of the things included in this roadmap are Personal Data Adaptors that enable Members to invoke new connections themselves; extended interoperability and transformation of inbound and outbound payloads to accept and deliver payloads in the required format; dynamically configurable templates to enable subscribers to draw maps that correlate data held in the member’s Personal Data Store and their own internal systems; and support for ‘dynamic consent’ so that Data Sharing Agreements can be extended for one-time or defined-time periods to support specific transactions.</p><p>But behind these ongoing developments lie some very simple, general rules of thumb: make once, use many times and ‘FERC elimination’ — in whatever we do, the goal is to reduce or eliminate all possible Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost while always keeping individuals in control of their&nbsp;data.</p> Conclusion <p>We started this series on Mydex CIC’s personal data infrastructure by describing it as a sort of plumbing system. Personal Data Stores act as the ‘tank’ holding the data, with the Personal Data eXchange (PDX) acting as the pipes via which data flows in and out. Like a motor car’s engine, both those core infrastructure constituents work mainly under the hood. Largely invisible, and hardly ever directly experienced by individuals using their PDSs. The direct Member experience — the equivalent of the taps and valves via which data flows are managed — comes from what we call the experience layer. That is the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-and-data-sharing-1f59f5381c85">Personal Data Stores and Data Sharing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMmZNwOsIs">YouTube explainer video</a> on how tracking and authentication use the same mechanisms to meet their goals, and how browsers can’t tell the difference. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Welcome to The Digital Cow Network! My name is Heather Flanagan, principal at Spherical Cow Consulting. Let’s talk about how individuals are tracked as they surf the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve all know we are tracked as we surf the web. Sometimes, it’s to show us target advertisements to get us to spend more money. More nefariously, it influences our political leanings or generally sows societal chaos. Why isn’t there more control to prevent this from happening? Shouldn’t there be something that protects all web users, from the least tech-savvy to the most informed individuals? Yes, but it’s not that simple. The underlying mechanisms that trackers use are the same tools used to support third-party logging into a website, also known as federated authentication.</p>



<p>And you know what? Browsers can’t tell the difference when mechanisms used for tracking or when they are used for logging in. They are technically indistinguishable. This makes changing or removing those features more complicated than you’d think.</p>



 The Dilemma of Browser Tracking  



<p>What are these mysterious mechanisms, and why are they used when people log in to a website if they are also part of an invasion of privacy? Time for a quick history lesson!</p>



<p>The Internet came out of a research project. Everyone knew everyone else, or at least they knew the people online had to be a part of a very small community in order to use this new thing. The web came much later, but it still had that research and exploratory mindset, that nearly green field drive that suggested building little widgets that people could turn into anything they could imagine was the path towards innovation. The Internet, and therefore the web, was built on something that didn’t have robust, automatable trust mechanisms built in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of these innovations was the concept of a piece of data that would allow developers to keep information local to a browser so each web page didn’t have to ask for the same information over and over again, something called saving state. It also encouraged the use of IP addresses, once upon a time the unique address for each computer on the network, as a way to indicate whether an individual (the only one probably using that computer) to access something remotely. It encouraged a lot of things and people through of all sorts of ways to use these building blocks of the web to do new things, from supporting third-party accounts when logging in to targeting advertisements to individuals.</p>



<p>That’s enough history. Let’s dive into the mechanics. From third-party cookies to IP addresses and browser fingerprinting, these tools are essential for a smooth online experience but can also be used for tracking. Understanding these mechanisms is key to navigating the digital landscape.</p>



 Segment 3: Third-Party Cookies and Privacy  



<p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of information created by a website and placed on an individual’s computer or other device by their web browser. The idea behind doing this was to make it so people didn’t have to share information every time they went to a new page. Imagine if you had to log in Every. Single. Time. you went to a new web page owned by the same company. It’s crazy talk! Being able to “maintain state” from one page to the next is great for the user experience (UX).</p>



<p>Here’s where it gets murky. There is more than one kind of cookie, and for the sake of this explainer, we’re going to talk about first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are a way for a single domain to maintain state across all the web pages in its domain. It’s definitely a desirable thing for a clean UX. These cookies are ONLY accessible by the domain that created them. No other domain can read what’s in that cookie.</p>



<p>Then there are third-party cookies. These cookies are accessible to any website at any domain. And sometimes that’s fine. Let’s look at CNN. The company CNN owns cnn.com, headlinenews.com, cnnradionet.com, money.com, and probably several others. The parent company wants visitors to have a consistent experience, which means leaving bits of data for their various domains to read. They want all their services to look and act like you (probably) want them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party cookies are also used so that when you tell a website you want to log out, it knows what to log you out of. That’s a big security feature right there and something that needs to be adapted when browsers no longer support third-party cookies. Though, to be honest, implementing this properly is really hard and many sites have already given up on the idea of a secure, global logout.</p>



 Segment 4: The Complexities of Browser Fingerprints and IP Addresses  



 IP Addresses 



<p>Most people don’t have to think about a computer’s numeric address. That said, computers communicate via numbers, and both your devices (your phone, tablet, and desktop) and the computers hosting the websites you’re visiting all have these addresses. They are called IP addresses and are a fundamental necessity to ensuring Internet traffic knows where to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, these addresses were tightly tied to specific computers that didn’t move around. There were also enough of these addresses for all the computers on the Internet. And with that in mind, it made sense to say, “I know who is at this IP address. That address can access my computer.” While the basic assumptions about IP addresses are no longer always accurate, there’s still something to them. Some websites still create access policies based on what IP addresses are allowed. It’s a very smooth UX; the individual doesn’t have to do a thing. It just works.</p>



<p>When you go to a website, one of the things that happens is that the visit is recorded in a log. Logs are necessary to troubleshoot problems. They are also a way to understand who and what is visiting a website. And if that data is shared behind the scenes, a single IP address can be followed like you can follow footprints in the snow.</p>



 Browser Fingerprints 



<p>When you install a web browser, you probably add plug-ins, add-ons, your favorite fonts, your preferred settings, and so on. Here’s a fun fact: if you have done those things, you might have an impressively unique “fingerprint” that distinguishes your browser from all others.</p>



<p>There are a few websites that will let you check this out. For example, <a href="https://amiunique.org/">https://amiunique.org/</a> and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a> will let you see just how unique your browser setup is when compared to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you visit a website, it often asks your browser about all its settings to offer you the best UX. It might have a slightly different way of presenting information if you’re using Chrome or Firefox. It might pop up a sadness window if you’ve blocked ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Browser fingerprinting isn’t usually used to let you log into a website. However, some enterprise software may be looking for a specific plug-in or configuration as part of its requirements to allow you access.</p>



 Link Decoration and Bounces  



 Link Decoration 



<p>But wait, there’s more! One of the more subtle and ubiquitous features of trackers and authentication services is link decoration. Also referred to as “navigation-based tracking,” this feature adds extra information to the URL. That information can be part of an authentication token. It can be part of a query so the website knows what to display after you’ve done a product search. When you click on the link in an email, it will add the method you used to the address so the website owners know what advertising works for them.</p>



<p>Browser vendors are cautious when changing what they’ll support in links. Of course, they also have to worry about being able to identify when links are being used for tracking or something else. So many features that the web experience is built on requires link decoration. And so many trackers love it. It’s complicated.</p>



 Bounces or Redirects 



<p>The last one we’ll review in this post is bounces, also known as redirects. Bounces and redirects are as fundamental to the web experience as link decoration. These are used extensively to support critical login features for protocols like OAuth and SAML, used by websites everywhere. Authentication is complicated, and there is almost always more than one computer behind the scenes making it happen. These computers, possibly from different domains, need to talk to each other to get you logged in. They bounce data back and forth before returning a “go” or “no go” to your login experience.</p>



<p>Bounces are also, unfortunately, used by trackers to get around the third-party limitations on cookies described in the section above.</p>



<p>Remember that browsers are trying to prevent websites from reading cookies they didn’t write. Cookies are for the first party; third parties need to find another website to bother. But what if there is an advertising agreement between these two parties? They really want to share that data! The easiest thing to do is to make that third party become a first party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an individual visits a website directly, that makes it a first-party experience. You visit Website A; Website A is now a first party. But what if Website A has an agreement with an advertiser at Website B and adds a single pixel to their web page? Then the individual loads that pixel, thus “visiting” Website B. Website B can now set or edit a first-party cookie. They can do that every time you visit a website they have an agreement with, thus building up a record of what sites you’ve visited, where you’ve made purchases, etc.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Browser vendors can’t just wave a magic keyboard and fix all tracking challenges. Turning off all the mechanisms that allow tracking will also break some of the most critical security features of the web. Work within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is underway to find a way through this mess. Browser vendors have also been making their changes. Apple turned off third-party cookies years ago. Mozilla turned them off by default for all Firefox users in 2023. Google Chrome is still working on it, but they are much bigger than all other browser vendors combined and have much more business riding on these features.</p>



<p>In our next post, I’ll focus on the work around the deprecation of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>

KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>This blog is the second part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?</a>  Part 2: What exactly is&nbsp;KERI?  Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  <p>This part explains only essential components that constitute the KERI protocol while not going into deep technical details.</p> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet  Fragmentation in the decentralized identity ecosystem <p>As outlined in a recent “<a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Wallet Strategy</a>” series by <a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Dan Robertson</a>, one of the biggest problems in the decentralized identity space is its presently fragmented ecosystems. This is an extremely complex issue that involves many business and technical aspects—including credential formats, credential exchange protocols, and many more. This blog limits the scope of the discussion to identifiers and key management, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>As of March 2024, there are a total of 189 DID methods registered in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>. This number has been increasing steadily since the registry was created in 2020, and there are likely a hundred more DID methods out there in the wild, which have not yet been registered.</p><p>Although a large proportion of these methods are experimental, some of which have no longer been maintained, this number has raised significant concern among many members of the digital identity ecosystems. In the past few years, this topic has also been the subject of heated debates. While some argue that the abundance of DID methods is a sign of a thriving ecosystem, many contend that the sheer diversity has spawned considerable interoperability challenges.</p><p>While this blog shall not take part in the debate, one cannot help but wonder “Could there possibly be a unifying DID method that covers the use cases of all others?” This is precisely what KERI attempts to&nbsp;be.</p> An elephant in the&nbsp;room <p>However, we have to address a big elephant in the room before we continue.</p>Ref: Xkcd comic, “<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">How Standard Proliferate</a>”.<p>KERI is indeed a DID method that was designed to be the “one universal standard that covers everyone’s use case”. However, adding one more DID method to the ever-growing list does not necessarily mitigate the situation, and it remains uncertain if KERI will ever achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Putting all that aside, KERI provides unique properties and benefits not found in other DID methods, as elaborated in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a> of this series. What makes KERI special is also the fact that it is not just another DID method. The KERI protocol has a grander vision of being the identity overlay for the internet.</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be a secure identity overlay for the internet.</blockquote> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important inventions in human history, enabling instant connections between everyone across the globe. The success of the Internet is attributed to its hourglass model where the Internet Protocol (IP) is the one common protocol for all supporting protocols below it and all applying protocols above it, i.e., the IP protocol being the spanning layer of the Internet.</p>Ref: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the Trust over IP Stack</a>, Version 1.0, 17 November&nbsp;2021<p>Unfortunately, as the late Kim Cameron once wrote in <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">The Laws of Identity</a> in 2005, “The Internet was built without an identity layer.” Given the immense complexity and widespread usage of the Internet, attempting to reconstruct its infrastructure to integrate such a layer is simply unfeasible. Hence, the development of an identity solution must be overlaid on the existing Internet framework. To achieve global interoperability, such an identity overlay must also embody an hourglass shape, serving as a trust-spanning protocol that seamlessly links all Web2 and Web3 applications.</p>Ref: The <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a><p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF)</a> under the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation is currently developing the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> where KERI is used as one of its candidate protocols for Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs).</p> Foundational Components of&nbsp;KERI <p>The previous section explains what KERI is at the conceptual level where it is designed to be the identity overlay for the internet and is also a variant of DPKI. To get deeper into the technical details,</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized management protocol for persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), using novel key pre-rotation mechanisms. KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>There are four foundational components for the KERI protocol as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Autonomic Identifier (AID)  Pre-rotation  Key Event  Key Event&nbsp;Receipt   1. Autonomic Identifier (AID) <p>The KERI protocol is dedicated to the long-term management of a special class of identifiers that are both self-certifying and persistent. These identifiers are called autonomic identifiers (AIDs) in the KERI protocol.</p><blockquote>Note: The word “autonomic” is an adjective that means self-ruling, self-governing, or self-regulating.</blockquote> Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) <p>A Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived from one or more key pairs. It is self-certifying—i.e., self-authenticating—since the controller of the SCID who holds the private could cryptographically verify their control by digitally signing a message, e.g., via a challenge-response protocol. The mapping between an identifier and its controlling key(s) is self-contained in the identifier itself. Hence, a SCID is considered a decentralized identifier as it does not rely on any trusted third party to generate or&nbsp;manage.</p><blockquote>Note: An entity that holds an authoritative set of private keys is called a controller of an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Basic SCID <p>A basic SCID is a variant of SCIDs that is cryptographically generated and bound to a single key pair. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable since it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure. Hence, a basic is not persistent and is not suitable for long-term use.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates a process for creating a SCID, the controller captures sufficient entropy—e.g., using random noise from electronic equipment— to generate a key pair. A common basic SCID could be generated by using a hash digest of the public&nbsp;key.</p> AIDs are Persistent SCIDs <p>An AID is a variant of a SCID is that persistent as it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the same AID. The mechanism for evolving the AID’s key state is called pre-rotation.</p>Difference between a basic SCID and an&nbsp;AID An AID is a primary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI <p>A root of trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely. An AID is also a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol, which is purely cryptographic and decentralized, not relying on any centralized entity or even any blockchain network.</p><blockquote>An AID is used as a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol that is purely cryptographic. As a consequence, the security of KERI-based identity systems only relies on cryptography, requiring no trust in external entities or even any blockchain network.</blockquote> 2. Pre-rotation <p>In the KERI protocol, the mechanism used to evolve a key state of an AID is known as pre-rotation. Except for a few special cases, an AID is cryptographically bound to at least two sets of key pairs, each of which holds different control authorities over the&nbsp;AID:</p>  The first set is called the current key(s), which holds the signing authority. The current key(s) of an AID can be used to, for instance, sign arbitrary messages such as verifiable credentials, authenticate the AID’s controller, and anchor external data to KERI’s ledgers, called key event&nbsp;logs.  The second set is called the next key(s), which holds the rotation authority. The next key(s) of an AID can be used to change the key state of the AID, including changing the current keys, that is, transferring the signing authority to another set of&nbsp;key(s).  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote> Pre-commitment <p>When an AID is created (i.e., incepted), the controller of the AID makes a pre-commitment to the next key(s) that hold rotation authority over the AID. The next key(s) are hidden using a cryptographic hash function, and they are only revealed at the moment the key state of the AID is&nbsp;rotated.</p><p>The next key pair — both private and public keys — must be kept secure and hidden until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority.</p><p>This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is pre-committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote> Recovery from Quantum&nbsp;Attack <p>As pre-rotated next key(s) are hidden by a cryptographic hash function, the next key(s) are thus resistant to quantum attack. This is because hash functions are not vulnerable to the Quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current key of an AID could still be broken by a quantum attack, allowing a threat actor with access to a quantum computer to gain the signing authority over the AID. However, the legitimate controller of the AID could still regain control over the AID by using the next key(s) to rotate the AID’s key state, perhaps using a quantum-safe algorithm for the new set of current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Hence, the use of pre-rotation in the KERI protocol makes it quantum-recoverable.</p> 3. Key&nbsp;Event <p>The key state of an AID is determined by a data structure called a key event that consists of the current key(s) and pre-rotated next key(s) as well as other configurations for the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The key state of an AID is defined as a set of currently authoritative key pairs for the AID and any other information necessary to secure or establish control authority over an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Key Inception Event <p>The AID is itself cryptographically derived from its very first key event, called an inception event, thus giving the AID its self-certifying property. The inception event must also be cryptographically signed by the current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where an AID has single key pairs for its current and next keys. An AID is derived and bound to the key inception event, which includes:</p>  the first public key, which is used as the current&nbsp;key,  the digest of the second public key, which is used as the pre-rotated next&nbsp;key.  <p>The first public key could be revealed to other entities while the pre-rotated second public key must be kept&nbsp;hidden.</p>An AID is derived from an inception event that consists of two sets of keys, namely the current key and (pre-rotated) next key. The current key is used to sign the key inception event. The AID is pre-committed to future rotation by the second&nbsp;key. Key Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>The pre-rotated next key(s) of an AID may be used to create a subsequent key event, called a rotation event, that changes the AID’s key state. The rotation event must be signed by the next key(s), revealing the next key(s). Hence, the next key(s) can be used for rotation only once, after which the next keys must be either discarded or repurposed as members of the new set of subsequent current key(s). The controller of the AID must also assign a new set of pre-rotated next key(s) in the rotation&nbsp;event.</p><p>Following the example above, the AID could be rotated to revoke the signing authority of the first key pair by using the private key of the pre-rotated second public key to sign a rotation event. In the rotation&nbsp;event,</p>  the second public key is now repurposed to be the new current&nbsp;key,  a new key pair, the third public key, is pre-committing to the future rotation of the&nbsp;AID.  The key state of the AID is evolved by revealing the second (pre-rotated) key and using it to sign a key rotation event. The rotation event includes a new next key that pre-commits the AID to future rotation. Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL) <p>As the key state of an AID evolves, the key events are cryptographically linked in a hash chain that provides a key history for the AID. Such a data structure is called a Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>Formally, a KEL is a hash-chain verifiable data structure used to verify the key state of an AID as it evolves through its lifecycle. A KEL could be compared to a transaction ledger in a traditional blockchain, where key events are transactions in the KERI protocol.</p><p>Following the example above, the KEL of the example AID starts with the inception event with the first public key and the hash digest of the second key. The inception event is chained to subsequent rotation events via the pre-rotation mechanism.</p>A key event log of the AID that contains a hash chain of its key&nbsp;events.<p>Hence, the control authorities — both signing and rotation — of the AID at any point in the KEL can be validated in a self-contained manner by verifying the signatures and recalculating the hashes that connect the key events in the KEL, all the way back to the inception event.</p><blockquote>Note: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote> 4. Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>At its core, the KERI protocol establishes an infrastructure facilitating the exchange of key events as well as key event receipts. This highlights the protocol’s designation as the “Key Event Receipt Infrastructure.”</p><p>The exchange of key events and key event receipts could carried either directly between controllers of AIDs or indirectly through supporting infrastructures.</p> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>In the KERI protocol, communications and transactions revolve around the exchange of key events among controllers of AIDs. When a controller receives a key event, they can sign it using the key associated with their AID. This signed key event is called a key event receipt, which provides a non-repudiable proof that the recipient has received—i.e., witnessed—the key&nbsp;event.</p> Key Event Receipt Log&nbsp;(KERL) <p>Key event receipts of an AID could be recorded in a verifiable data structure called a key event receipt log (KERL). A KERL contains the signed key event history of an AID. A verifier of an AID may verify the AID’s key state by using a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Direct mode <p>Key events and key event receipts can be exchanged directly between two controllers. This is known as the direct mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>In the direct mode, a controller of an AID may send its KEL to another controller, called a validator of the AID. Upon reception of a key event, the validator signs the received key events to generate a key event receipt and subsequently returns it to the controller as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for their AID and the validator for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL of their own AID as well as a KERL of the other’s AID. This allows each party to be trusted with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p> Indirect mode <p>Since a controller of an AID may not always be online. The controller may designate witnesses that store and forward key events to any requestor. This is known as the indirect mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for discovering the KEL of an AID. The witnesses also sign the key events to create witnessed key event receipts.</p><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p> Additional Infrastructures <p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller of the AID, they may not be entirely trusted by validators of the AID. For example, the AID and its witnesses could be compromised or behave maliciously such that the witnesses provide inconsistent key event histories, called duplicity.</p><p>Consequently, a validator of the AID could designate additional infrastructure to detect duplicity of the AID’s key event history. These additional infrastructures include watchers, jurors, and judges. The infrastructures may be designated a validator or a group of validators to “watch” the witnesses to detect any duplicity in the AID’s key event history as well as make decisions on the validity of the AID’s&nbsp;KEL.</p> Blockchain as KERI witnesses and&nbsp;watchers <p>As discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a>, while the KERI protocol does not necessarily rely on a blockchain, KERI may leverage blockchain for the discovery and verification of KELs. In other words, blockchains could be utilized in a KERI-based identity system practically taking the roles of KERI witnesses and watchers. Hence, you could have the best of both worlds, obtaining the advantages that traditional blockchains offer. Since the root of trust in the KERI protocol is within the AIDs themselves, the AIDs could be migrated from one blockchain network to another, avoiding the ledger-locked problem that plagues most blockchain-based DID&nbsp;methods.</p> KERI in a&nbsp;Nutshell <p>Conceptually, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be an identity overlay for the Internet. Each word in KERI has the following meanings:</p>  Key refers to asymmetric key cryptography that is used to control persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs).  Event refers to a series of Key Events in a hash-chain verifiable data structure called Key Event Logs (KELs) that record the key-state evolution of AIDs via the Pre-Rotation mechanism.  Receipt refers to signed receipts of key events, called Key Event Receipts that provide non-repudiable proof while exchanging key events between&nbsp;AIDs.  Infrastructure refers to the protocol for exchanging non-repudiable key event receipts, including the designation of Witnesses, Watchers, Jurors, and&nbsp;Judges.  <p>The next part of the series discusses “How do you use KERI?” which includes references to other introductory materials and a collection of open-source implementations, standards, and whitepapers.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide. Learn how <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/pki/managed-services/pki-as-a-service">Entrust PKI as a Service (PKIaaS)</a> enables seamless <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/mobile-device-management-byod">integration with leading MDM vendors</a> like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, Google Enterprise MDM via Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), Ivanti, and Jamf Pro, so customers can deploy and provision digital certificates with ease.</p>

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a provisioned pay-as-you-go licensing model&nbsp;that makes Copilot for Security accessible to a wider range of organizations than any other solution on the market. With this flexible, consumption-based pricing model, you can get started quickly, then scale your usage and costs according to your needs and budget. Copilot for Security will be available for purchase April 1, 2024. Connect with your account representative now so your organization can be among the first to realize the incredible benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot for Security helps security and IT teams transition into the age of AI and strengthen their skillsets. This is a huge milestone towards empowering organizations with generative AI tools, and we are so proud to work alongside our customers and partners to bring you a better way to secure identities and access for everyone, to everything.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing it? (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-1-d950ae770ef2">Linked&nbsp;here</a>)  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE.  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 2 — the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE  Using narratives, diagrams and images to open a generative dialogue <p>In our first publication we introduced two questions that we are using to navigate towards a foundational logic for Life-Ennobling Economics. In this next post we are using those overall queries to share some initial thoughts, together with the cascading questions that are continuing to arise. A strong reflection at this point is that it’s difficult to express many of the core sentiments of LEE using only words. The articulation of certain ideas feels premature and constrictive and this is something that we want to hold up to the light. On the one hand, it feels important to drive clarity and not to hide behind vague, even poetic phrasing. Yet on the other hand, a sense of humility, awe and deep curiosity makes us reluctant to distil and label these early ideas. How can we adequately express diverse interpretations, yearnings and fears for this future that we are daring to open ourselves towards? How might you as the reader? How might your children, parents or more-than-human relations?</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>In the sections that follow we are outlining three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>3 WORLDVIEW PHILOSOPHIES</p> Philosophy 1 <p>Rooted in the recognition of the full web of life: From violence, scarcity and separation to a thriving planetary community of interbecoming.</p><p>What would it mean to fundamentally reimagine ourselves as permeable, dynamic interbecomings, deeply entwined in diverse right relationships and joyfully part of a full planetary consciousness. This concept challenges the traditional economic view of humans driven primarily by rational, objectified, self-interest. Instead, it suggests a new understanding of self where our individual interests are indistinct from what we can collectively become.</p><p>This shift in perspective would call for a re-evaluation of the infrastructures that shape our lives and identities. It would question how we think about everything; from education and learning, health care and human development to the roles and functions of prisons and the judicial system. For example, what does justice mean in a world where we see ourselves as interconnected becomings?</p><blockquote>What do we mean by when we use the term Interbecoming?</blockquote><blockquote>Interbecoming is an extension of the word Interbe which was invented by the Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The becoming element signifies the emergent potential of what it means to verb as a community into the future. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyQnwz_yJ0">short video</a> he describes how you cannot be by yourself alone, to be you need to be with everything and everyone else and therefore to be means to inter-be.</blockquote> Philosophy 2 <p>Grounded in a non-bounded understanding of value: From extractive profit-driven goals to entangled, intergenerational and distributed value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>In our current economy our measures of success are calculated using a narrow set of accounting rules. This is a collectively accepted norm, but can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or context? In an interconnected world, externalities seem to be a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of profit and GDP. Imagine an economy where value was understood to be attributed to relationships themselves rather than the things that are related? How would our economy behave if the collective goal and source of status was increasing regenerative potential or stocks of&nbsp;care?</p><blockquote>The illogical tyranny of&nbsp;metrics</blockquote><blockquote>“People becoming unhealthy can actually have a positive effect overall on GDP, as revenue from associated healthcare boosts growth. Similarly, the extraction of oil and gas pushes GDP up, while pushing us closer to the precipice of climate breakdown.” — Caroline Lucas, MP (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-07-10/debates/FFE2C4E7-4ED0-4537-BA1F-0DE8B46CA084/EconomicGrowthAndEnvironmentalLimits">UK Parliamentary Debate,&nbsp;2019</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Hazel Henderson’s layer cake was the <a href="https://twitter.com/KateRaworth/status/1528866241683017728">original inspiration</a> behind Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics framework. It is a metaphor for how the current monetised economy (the top layers of cake) are entirely dependent on the non-valued, supportive lower&nbsp;layers.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Annie Spratt</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Philosophy 3 <p>Enabled by technological ecosystems of care: From the utilitarian ‘othering’ of technology to animistic interfaces of wisdom and&nbsp;care.</p><p>The accelerating technological complexity of our world can be seen as a threat. However, it could also offer new opportunities to nurture the capacity of society to understand itself more fully, rather than trying to mould and regulate it. Imagine a future where our governing institutions are empowered to advance and scaffold the continuous learning of a self-aware system. Where we can sense the unique, embodied value of every context, thus fostering care for the entangled impacts, both positive and negative. Ultimately we have a choice; will we use the stunning power of advanced technologies to embrace a new freedom to care, or will we use it to destroy everything we depend on and hold&nbsp;dear?</p><blockquote>Busy fools?</blockquote><blockquote>‘We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom’- E.O.&nbsp;Wilson</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">The Cornerstone Indicators </a>work is an example of participatory dialogues being combined with smart data, to create intuitively understandable multi-contextual indicators of care. In another <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">live initiative</a>, we are exploring ways of linking distributed currencies to participatory governance structures, as a pathway towards stewarding bioregional health.</blockquote>Cornerstone Indicator: the number of people with a dream, plan or goal more than one year into the future. Image: Vlad Afanasiev<p>6 STRUCTURAL SHIFTS</p> Shift 1 <p>Beyond Property: From exerting control over ‘objects’ to seeking reciprocal relationships with the full web of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Words like property and ownership are often associated with ideas of dominion and control, allowing us to treat elements of the living world (such as land and rare earth minerals) as objects. Deep down though, do we really believe that timber holds more value than a forest? Or that a whale’s life is interchangeable with a barrel of oil? What would it mean to explore a world beyond property, a world of self sovereign agents who we are respectfully in treaty&nbsp;with?</p><blockquote>The paradox of individual identity</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of self-sovereign agents is being used to express a conviction that life is not a sum of its constituent parts. Instead, both the whole and the parts co-arise with equal agency. The word identity is derived from the Latin idem, the same and identidem, again and again. We identify ourselves by our internal consistency, but this concept only exists in contrast to external self identifying elements (and vice versa). This idea has been expressed by diverse thinkers from <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-experience-of-meaning/jan-zwicky/9780773557437">Zan Zwicky</a> to <a href="https://www.systematics.org/journal/vol9-2/TheWhole_Bortoft.pdf">Henri Borthoft </a>and is carefully explored by Daniel Wahl in Designing Regenerative Cultures¹ and Iain McGilchrist in The Matter with&nbsp;Things².</blockquote><blockquote>‘To shut ourselves off from these other voices…is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human’ — David&nbsp;Abram</blockquote> Shift 2 <p>Beyond Labour: From humans employed as resources to vocations of creativity, purpose and&nbsp;care.</p><p>In our industrialised economies humans are often framed as a functional resource. However, rapidly advancing technologies (such as machine automation and alternative distributed currencies) have the potential to weaken the requirement for labour to service financial capital. What would it mean to emancipate the idea of work from its current focus on hierarchy and external incentives? Could we build a future economy that harnesses our inherent, embodied intelligences and unleashes our intrinsic motivations and ability to discover? Perhaps this would be a future of virtuous flow where human satisfaction is rooted in low impact, transcendent goals.</p><blockquote>Can a state of flow be virtuous?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://timjackson.org.uk/finding-flow-lancet/">Professor Tim Jackson</a> has proposed the concept of flow as a pathway towards sustainable fulfilment.</blockquote> Shift 3 <p>Beyond Extraction: From extractive resource claims to the infinite guardianship of the global&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Even the word resource is innately extractive and predicated on violence. When we see a sentient animal or element of an ecosystem and name it as a natural resource, we are using language to justify collective violence in pursuit of private comfort. We have become highly proficient at accessing diverse fodder for the global economic supertanker; from the deep sea beds to the depths of the Amazon rainforest nowhere is considered too difficult to access if the price is right. What would happen if we erased ‘resource’ from our active vocabulary, and redirected our ingenuity toward stewarding the global&nbsp;commons?</p><blockquote>Do words&nbsp;matter?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714174/46011659/INAYAN_LANDSCAPE+%281%29.gif/36b31524-6d41-6ed3-8cda-bf444bde3fe0?t=1659621341143">Inayan — “Unethical deeds”</a>: Inayan is a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. For the Kankanaey people in the Philippines it expresses a community value of refraining from harmful behaviour towards living and inanimate relations. For example, it is inayan to pollute the&nbsp;rivers.</blockquote> Shift 4 <p>Beyond Private Contracts: From linear agreements that optimise for the few to multi-party, dynamic, digital treaties of&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Many of our existing contracts are structured as bilateral agreements. By design, these agreements ignore the complex interplay of values and the mutual need for care that is integral to most transactions. With the emergence of capabilities such as many-to-many and smart, self-executing contracting, we see an opportunity to revolutionise this root structure of the economy. For example, how would our interactions change if we could easily assemble contracts that recognise relational value? Could we collectively drive a bureaucratic revolution that would create new ways to acknowledge and manage the intricate, entangled flows of&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>Are these new contracts too technical or theoretical to engage&nbsp;with?</blockquote><blockquote>From a conceptual provocation (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons provocation</a>) to a live multi-partner collaboration (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Beyond The Rules Portal</a>), we are working out loud to test the theory and practical applications of these new forms of contracting.</blockquote>Credit: Terri&nbsp;Po Shift 5 <p>Beyond Governance: From centralised enforcement to nurturing institutions of stewardship.</p><p>Historically our dominant governance structures have sought to control and instruct. However, with the increasing complexity of both our societal systems and escalating risk pathways, this theory of governance no longer appears viable. From their top-down view, many governments are struggling to intelligently regulate the increasingly complex systems of property that they guarantee.</p><p>The most probable directions of future societal travel do not seem appealing. On the one hand we might fail to resolve our global coordination challenges and continue to experience ever intensifying crises (for example, individual countries reopening coal mines to reduce energy costs in the short-term ). Alternatively, we might find ways to overcome perverse incentives but the means to do so will potentially lead us towards authoritarian dystopias. With this in mind, how can we transition away from a centralised model of control, and embrace a governance style that fosters collective learning and empowers the entire&nbsp;system³.</p><blockquote>Is there an adjacent, third&nbsp;option?</blockquote><blockquote>Consilience: the idea that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can “converge” on strong conclusions.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-neighbourhoods-digital-democracy">In Taiwan</a>, the combination of open data and civic participation has created a transparent governance model that drastically reduced the impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;virus.</blockquote> Shift 6 <p>Beyond Monetary Capital: From the accumulation of financial wealth to a social contract that regeneratively stewards the diverse capitals of&nbsp;life.</p><p>What would it mean if we understood capital wealth as an expression of crystallised suffering? Recognising that financial capital is intertwined and enabled by living and social systems could be an important pivot point towards a future rooted in mutually assured thriving. Perhaps then we would feel empowered to reject a monetary system that continues to colonise, exploit and exclude by design. Imagine how our relationship to financial capital might change if we understood the act of investing to be a commitment to our collective futures? What would a system look like where the ways of creating and stewarding money are decentralised and respectful of incommensurate value&nbsp;flows?</p><blockquote>Is the plurality of existing alternative currencies a blessing or a distraction?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3IuJx8O9o">Bernard Lietaer</a> who co-designed the Euro has proposed three core design principles that fundamentally shape the interaction between money and society: a) who issues a currency, b) the qualities it is given, and c) what it can be used&nbsp;for.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">this provocation</a> we explore 10 design principles that could underpin a cohesive yet diverse regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.</blockquote> What’s next and how can people become involved? <p>We have created these first two sections as a landing point for the LEE movement. The idea will be to leave this initial piece in its original form and update the links to new materials as they emerge. What happens next depends on who engages and in what capacity. When we initially proposed the idea, we had imagined that LEE might manifest as a collaborative book and we are still open to that possibility. However, we feel strongly that whilst a tangible artefact would be a powerful tool, it should not be the end goal. Instead, we are aspiring to create a container that can scaffold a distributed exploration and implementation of LEE principles.</p><p>Publications in the&nbsp;pipeline</p><p>We are working on the following pieces and will publish them&nbsp;soon:</p>  Exploratory conversations with critical friends who have read the early versions of the LEE&nbsp;concept.  An outline of how Dark Matter Labs is organising itself to work on the questions raised by the&nbsp;LEE.  Internal conversations: what would it mean for the different strands of our work if we embraced Life-Ennobling Economics as our overarching mission?  <p>Potential pathways for engagement</p><p>We are interested to hear diverse perspectives and will adjust our approach depending on the feedback we receive. As an initial prompt perhaps one of these descriptions is relevant to&nbsp;you:</p><blockquote>Funding support: we are hoping to convene a partnership of funders who can support, elevate and actively contribute to this vision. The scope of ambition is wide but we will curate the process as a series of modular steps. If you are interested in supporting us, either as a general contribution or as a standalone module, then we would be very happy to discuss your ideas. Email: jayne@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborative support: We expect to organise a series of diverse gatherings and working groups. As a first step we will create a live database of potential collaborators and propose a series of online and in-person events following initial conversations. If this is something you would like to hear more about, we would be grateful if you could send us a short email to let us know your area of interest. Email: emily@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Staying updated: our hope is that the ongoing LEE work will provide a convening point for a wider body of thinking on alternative economies. Please feel free to send us your email contact and we will keep you updated on progress and new publications.

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it?  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the LEE (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-2-da43434545c8">linked&nbsp;here</a>).  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 1 — Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it? <blockquote>The term life-ennobling is in itself an adjacent extension of <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2023/02/07/ruthie-wilson-gilmore-abolition-geography%EF%BF%BC">Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work</a> on life-affirming institutions.</blockquote><p>Our economic systems are failing to serve the interests of our living planet and the great majority of those who inhabit it. It is not our intention to restate the multiple crises that this mismatch has fuelled and continues to perpetuate. Instead, we are sharing our emerging thinking as we strive to build pathways towards alternative ways of organising society. Reading this opening paragraph you may already be holding many questions. For&nbsp;example:</p>  ‘Surely we don’t need yet another type of economics?’.  ‘We already have Doughnut Economics, Wellbeing Economics, Solidarity Economics, Ecological Economics — the list goes on — wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on implementing their principles rather than proposing a new version?’  ‘What gives Dark Matter Labs the authority to suggest a new form of economics? This seems like an audacious and perhaps even arrogant proposal to&nbsp;make.’  <p>We are holding many of these questions ourselves and fully acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. LEE draws on the work of intersectional scholars, feminist and ecological economists and fuses their insights with indigenous wisdom, the life-affirming passion of the abolitionists and the dynamism of radical technologists.</p><p>As we move deeper into the work we are planning to weave the questions and wisdom of our ecosystem into the things that we are learning. We will embrace the friction that comes with an organic conversation and share this unfolding journey using different mediums. If you have comments on the content, or ideas to shape the format of the conversation, then we would welcome feedback.</p>Credit: Martin&nbsp;Lorenz The concept <p>We are proposing Life-Ennobling Economics as an invitational vision and as a call to action. It is an ennobling invitation to break free from ideological constraints, to embrace the radical potential of new technologies, and to challenge the structural codes of our current socio-economic systems. Implicit in this opening position is an understanding that the structure and values of the economy must be in service to all forms of life (present, future, human, non-human and machine) providing a scaffold of care and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>One way of understanding LEE is as a series of linked questions:</p>  What would a desirable future economy actually look&nbsp;like?  What would need to shift for that to become a&nbsp;reality?  What does that mean in the context of our current socioeconomic and political reality?  What can we build or seed to test those assumptions?  <p>We have started to explore these questions as part of our own organisational strategy. We have visualised our response as a 3D matrix and we will publish more about this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>To open the dialogue with a wider audience we are testing three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a reality. The aspiration is to begin building and testing elements of these proposed shifts on the ground, in diverse contexts and communities.</p> What are the core elements of the hypothesis? <p>We are presenting the opening hypothesis as three short sections: (1) an overall framing (2) a philosophical framework (3) an action orientated scaffold. In some places we have included links to more in-depth content and we will expand on the concept in our upcoming publications, including a series of conversations with critical&nbsp;friends.</p><blockquote>1. Overall&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house</blockquote><blockquote>— Audre&nbsp;Lorde</blockquote><p>The central augment being put forward by the LEE is that whilst we indisputably need to shift to a new economy, we will not get there using the mental models, tools or value systems of the current one. If we allow ourselves to sit with this statement for a moment, how do we feel? Possibly a sense of deflation, frustration or hopelessness. This is not our intention. Rather, we are proposing that we allow ourselves to lean into the idea of a beyond paradigm movement of unusual allies. Donella Meadows retrospectively adjusted her <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">thesis ↗</a> to include an additional level that she named the power to transcend paradigms. Building on this insight, LEE is inviting us to explore what could happen if we allow ourselves to sense into the edges of everything that we are capable of becoming. From nature rights activists and abolitionists to the advocates of self sovereign technologies and universal basic income, many diverse voices are advocating for a common shift. What might be unlocked if we could collaborate across a broad spectrum of unusual&nbsp;allies?</p><blockquote>2. A philosophical framework</blockquote><p>Iain McGilchrist has commented that in modern society we are living under a philosophical error that is far from abstract and instead runs deep to the way that we experience the world¹. Collaboratively building a coherent philosophical base for a more generative future feels critical, because it is this foundational logic that shapes the more tangible layers of our societies. For example, if we start from a value system that promotes individualism and competition then we are likely to design narrow indicators of progress such as GDP, that further entrench these values. In contrast, in a system centred on regenerative vitality we would probably lean towards more embodied measures of success, thus reinforcing the interconnected basis of societal wellbeing².</p><p>To begin exploring and crafting a shared philosophical baseline we are using the following questions to frame our opening thoughts:</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation, what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>We are deliberately using a beyond x,y,z rather than a steps towards framing to explore the proposed structural shifts. We hope that this will encourage a less prescriptive and declarative mindset as we consider what we might collectively work towards. For&nbsp;example:</p>  What could be unlocked if we looked beyond our current understanding of terms such as natural resources, money, institutions and governance?  How can we ensure that voices from the ideological left or right, those who are privileged or oppressed, indigenous or geographically separated can are respectfully represented within the LEE framework?  What might we imagine (or perhaps glimpse existing fragments of) if we let go of a solution oriented&nbsp;mindset?  Are there already existing pockets of these alternative worldviews spread across diverse communities?  <blockquote>3. An action oriented&nbsp;scaffold</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve been told repeatedly that the current political economy can provide the answers, ignoring systematic faults and invested interests in the way of change. Isn’t the real question here then, how we go about redesigning this political economy in a way that includes other voices, values, and&nbsp;ideas.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Gail Bradbrook</blockquote><p>Establishing a strong theoretical baseline is a priority for this initiative, but it also feels important to begin testing and elevating alternative pathways. There is already a stunning global constellation of organisations, movements and thinkers who are actively embodying regenerative crafts and values (for example we recently mapped actors <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=sharing">working on a just transition for housing</a> in Europe). We hope that by broadening the conversation, welcoming unforeseen allies and recognising diverse interests, the LEE can contribute to strengthening this distributed network.</p><p>An initial suggestion for this scaffold is to think of it as two connected threads:</p>  Case studies: we cannot be sure of how the future will play out. However, we can draw on historical events and foresight methods to explore the more likely scenarios. What might we discover if we collate an evidence base of existing signals of change from around the world (for example UBI trials and distributed currencies)? Or perhaps we can gain new insights from building out exploratory case studies, over varied time horizons, for specific sectors such as finance and food systems. How could our understanding shift if we embrace practices such as vision-questing, somatic and dream work? Perhaps you have practices or ideas that you think might be powerful for this collective visioning? We would be grateful for any suggestions and references.  Systemic capabilities: building on the case studies, we hope to identify a speculative portfolio of systemic capabilities that can be developed, tested and iterated in parallel to the existing system. Potential pathways might include designing large scale participatory dialogues, launching transitional financial instruments or developing the policies and tools for distributed decision making structures.   Living the questions <p>In Part 2 of this post we have illustrated our current understanding of some of the questions raised above. We are also working on a series of conversations where we will present some initial reactions to this proposal and explore the points of resonance and friction.</p><p>This blog was designed and written by Martin Lorenz, Emily Harris and Indy Johar as part of Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>The list can never be complete but to the following, thank you for your wisdom, foresight and work — your voices have given shape and clarity to the LEE concept: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Ilya Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman, Hermon Daly, James Lovelock, Donella Meadows, Kate Raworth, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Fritjof Capra, Daniel Wahl, Katherina Pistor, Aime Cesaire, Iain McGilchrist, Tim Jackson, Nora Bateson, Elinor Ostrom, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, E. F. Schumacher, Farzana Khan, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mariana Mazzucato and David&nbsp;Abram.</p><p>References:</p>  Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist and polymath most famous for his work on how the different hemispheres of the brain impact individual behaviour and thus society as a whole. His view is that this psychological error is based on a belief that the world is made up of a series of parts, rather than understanding that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes.

We do this with a combination of legaltech solutions that connect the <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/">1958 New York Convention (NYC) on Arbitration</a> and the UK Judiciary Taskforce (UKJT) <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> using the blockchain, which is going to enable a once in a century transformation, like when music went&nbsp;digital.</p><p>Now, I want to unpick exactly what this means for the future of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>I see the global scope of the blockchain as fundamental to all this, which is not quite the same thing as globalisation, but close. Anybody can run Free Software, anybody can generate keys, so the blockchain is universal in that sense. The best fit for that global scope in legal / trade systems is the New York Convention on Arbitration. That’s 170 countries. So wiring up blockchain transactions to the NY Convention is close to global scope (it skips North Korea - but then everything does - and a few other places). This is supercharged by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce Digital Dispute Resolution Rules which make a ton of blockchain-specific provisions which can be invoked from any of the New York Convention counties. <a href="https://arbitrationblog.kluwerarbitration.com/2022/04/27/arbitration-tech-toolbox-arbitrating-digital-asset-disputes/">This gives some analysis of the&nbsp;rules</a></p><p>Some of the “Mattereum magic” has been in figuring out how to use the NYC / UKJT system to carry things like legal definitions of assets on chain in a way that can be seen in those 170 counties. The <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> does some very sophisticated things by using suites of contracts to define asset value and risks. This makes the blockchain vital - if you try to make something like the NFT/MAP system work, only on paper, the complexity goes through the roof because you don’t have atomic swaps and various other blockchain capabilities on hand. It’s a neat system: the solution to trade on the blockchain requires the blockchain to&nbsp;work!</p><p>I am personally pretty pro globalisation because trade is always a good alternative to war, and rival trade blocs often wind up at war, but I do think 1990s American-led globalism is dead. What’s&nbsp;next?</p><p>There is a very clear difficult path forwards: we could very easily wind up with a world which runs on three incompatible global trade technology platforms: the American VISA-SWIFT etc. regime, the EU Digital Product Passports etc. regime, and the Chinese Belt and Road etc. regime. In this instance trade between these blocs will slow down over time as the technical and legal friction of trading across borders is reduced within the systems, but trade between these systems is more costly and difficult. I lay out this case in some detail <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">here</a> (which contrasts the blockchain with high frequency trading systems). You can even find threads of this model in my 2015 “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>” piece written for the Ethereum launch day. The problems database systems have interconnecting using APIs are even more severe when we start looking at things like automated customs clearing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Is there a more peaceful, positive path we could take? Maybe this: internet-led globalism: Wikipedia style global shared resources, and Alibaba-style free trade. “One ERC721 NFT per item” assets work pretty much anywhere. “Many ERC20 fractional ownership tokens per asset” is likely to work best in the EU under <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a>, at least at first. So the goal state is “world trade moves to the internet” — a “back of the envelope” calculation would be <a href="https://lawcom.gov.uk/project/electronic-trade-documents/">$250bn of savings a year</a>, estimated – and “real estate moves to the blockchain” — $150bn a year of savings, estimated.</p><p>This is a different “theory of value” of the blockchain to the bitcoiner’s “governments can’t stop printing money so eventually all fiat goes to zero and only Bitcoin remains” model. In practice governments don’t die easy. They’ve got moves: they’ll use them. So the hardcore “internet maximalist” view is centred around trade not money-like tokens, we don’t care what tokens are used to pay for real estate: ether, dollar coins, wBTC, digitised gold bars, CBDCs, SDRs, Doge, what we care about is the transactions happen basically paperlessly, AND we get a cut of the transactions for securing them. That’s our business model: get as much of $trillions of transactions on chain as possible, and take our cut from every one. Currently it’s all still 30-day invoicing and bank transfers once you start routinely dealing with assets over about $10k, never mind the arcane mess that is real estate transactions. Some of the regulations governing that are still written on goat skin, and you breathe a sigh of relief if a transaction only takes three months, because that is currently what passes for fast and&nbsp;smooth.</p><p>We aim to change this, once and for&nbsp;all.</p><p>If this takes off, it’ll do for real estate and&nbsp;trade:</p>  what Big Bang in the 1980s did for trading stocks and shares (electronic exchanges replaced human face to face exchange in trading&nbsp;pits!!!)  what Spotify did for&nbsp;music  what Amazon did for physical goods purchases  what Netflix / YouTube / TikTok did for&nbsp;video  <p>Digitisation of entire industries is routine at this point. Each one needs new technology. Amazon needed HTTPS cryptography and certificate authorities. Spotify and Netflix needed The Cloud, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Our bet is that real estate and global trade need Ethereum to move them&nbsp;online.</p><p>If we are right, your transformation will be much larger than just tokenizing stocks and bonds and revenue streams from rental homes, the current “RWA” leaders. Stocks and bonds etc. are already massively digital and traded on the internet, tokenizing them is an additional improvement but an eToro-type training app isn’t so much worse than real&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The improvement is incremental.</p><p>But enabling internet trading for assets that are currently ENTIRELY manually traded is an absolute game changer. Half a trillion dollars a year of savings by the time cars and a few other things are added to the mix. That’s a lot of potential.</p><p>Just to quantify it a&nbsp;little.</p><p>Half a trillion in savings, cut five ways: buyers, sellers, exchanges, technology providers, traders/market makers/lawyers and other middle men niches that are created - three out of five are maybe new companies. $300bn a year at a 10x multiplier suggests $3 trillion in market cap for the companies living off that revenue stream, kind of about the size of the<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/industry/internet-retail/"> entire internet retail industry</a> that currently exists. Now you can argue this 50 different ways: 10x multiplier? How long will it take to get to this scale? <a href="https://www.failory.com/startups/shoes-unicorns">Why did Tradelens fail etc</a>, but there are four billion dollar companies just trading sneakers right&nbsp;now.</p><p>What do you think tokenized real estate is going to&nbsp;do?</p><p>And we are playing for the position of “the company everybody uses to lift their assets up to the blockchain”.</p><p>All the global legal stuff and the risk management and dispute resolution and so on — build your own or use the same stuff everybody else uses. A parallel there is the ISDA template contract which carries most of $600 trillion of <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2211.htm">derivatives</a>. Standardisation pays! That’s one paper contract template that defines what a derivative is, broadly speaking. (I should say the $600 trillion of derivatives mostly cancels out — it’s about $20 trillion of actual money so about 10x the size of the crypto&nbsp;market.)</p><p>These macro trends are huge beyond all imaging, they’re just staggering in scope, and yet we see people getting wildly excited about relatively small local transformations - remember that fashion for “decentralised Uber” for a while? It’s potentially a really good business, but the city itself is up for grabs, not just the&nbsp;taxis!!</p><p>It’s all a question of scale in the&nbsp;end.</p><p>So with a story that large, where do you&nbsp;start?</p><p>“There is only one world and trade can and should work the same way everywhere” and the rest just&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Ethereum needs a new narrative. Ethereum needs a new&nbsp;plan.</p><p>THIS IS&nbsp;IT.</p><p>And all this comes down to enabling legislation in the&nbsp;end:</p>  UKJT <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">digital dispute resolution rules</a> (tertiary legislation?)  <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a> in the EU (coming into force by degrees, starting later this&nbsp;year)  <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/38/contents/enacted">Electronic Trade Documents</a> legislation in the UK (brand new late last&nbsp;year)  <p>Getting things up and running to fully utilise the global opportunities created by the new legislation is key.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p>Cloud IaaS is used extensively to develop, deliver new applications, and reengineer existing ones. This is often because cloud services provide an environment for accelerated development without the need for capital expenditure and avoids lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, this also creates challenges, in particular security as a shared responsibility, and this increases complexity since each cloud service provides security capabilities in diverse ways. While the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must take steps to secure the service they provide, it is up to the customer to secure the way they use the service. Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) are intended to reduce complexity by helping organizations using multiple cloud services to identify and manage the risks for which they have responsibility.

 Stakers can claim DF80 rewards. DF81 runs Mar 14— Mar 21, 2024. DF Main 2 is&nbsp;here  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><blockquote>As of this DF round (DF81), <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2 is here</a>. OCEAN rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 80 (DF80) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 7, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 14. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF81 is live today, March 14. It concludes on March 21. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF81   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF81 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN per week. Expected APY &gt;&nbsp;20%  Summary <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts (round DF81). Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Contents<br>1. <a>Overview</a><br>2. <a>Reward Budgets &amp; APYs</a> <br>3. <a>How to Data Farm</a><br>4. <a>Conclusion</a><br>(Plus Appendices)  1. Overview <p>Data Farming is Ocean Protocol’s incentives program. Participants earn OCEAN rewards for locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Predictoor</a>).</p><p>DF’s first round (DF1) launched on June 16, 2022 with 10,000 OCEAN/week rewards. DF went through alpha and beta to the final “DF Main” phase. DF Main has sub-phases 1-4:</p>  DF Main 1 had 150,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  ⭐ DF Main 2 has 300,000 OCEAN/week rewards. It starts today, March 14, 2024, in DF round 81 (DF81).⭐ Bonus: 20,000 ROSE/week thanks to Oasis&nbsp;🙏  DF Main 3 starts six months later, with 2x more rewards. DF Main 4 is six months after that, with another 2x. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/reward-schedule">Reward Schedule docs</a> have&nbsp;details.  <p>DF is evolving. At first, DF exclusively rewarded data curation. Now, it also rewards locking OCEAN and making predictions. We can expect further evolution.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes DF reward budgets and expected APYs. Section 3 describes how to data farm, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">the webapp</a>. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Reward Budgets &amp;&nbsp;APYs  2.1 Budgets per&nbsp;Stream <p>The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> 2.1 APY Estimates <p>As of DF Main 2, how can we expect APY to change? Here’s a quick estimate.</p><p>Today’s rewards increase includes a doubling of Passive DF rewards from 75,000 OCEAN/week to 150,000 OCEAN/week. So APY for Passive DF will jump by 2x (all else being equal). If you’ve locked for 4 years to hit max APY, expect APY to rise from ≈10.1% to&nbsp;≈20.2%.</p><p>APY of Active DF is currently ≈3.13%. It’s capped by data consume volume, so we shouldn’t expect it to increase by&nbsp;2x.</p><p>Overall APY is currently ≈12.75% (for max lock time). Given that Passive DF will increase things by (20.2–10.1) = 10.1%, then overall APY will jump to about 22.75% (all else being&nbsp;equal).</p><p>To max your APY, it makes sense to lock OCEAN for long; to curate with all your locked OCEAN; and to run a predictoor bot with aggressive staking.</p> 4. How to Data&nbsp;Farm  4.1 DF Webapp tasks&nbsp;overview <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Volume DF, and Predictoor DF. The DF webapp facilitates most of these; the rest are via Predictoor.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim”&nbsp;button.  Volume DF. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once).  Predictoor DF. To earn: become a predictoor by running a bot that makes regular predictions. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Here’s how</a>. To claim: predictoors get paid via sales of the prediction feeds to traders. Predictoor DF is treated as extra&nbsp;sales.  <p>The subsections that follow elaborate on key&nbsp;steps.</p> 4.2 Navigating to DF&nbsp;webapp <p>You can get to the DF webapp from the main Ocean Protocol site <a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com,">oceanprotocol.com,</a> and clicking on “STAKE&nbsp;OCEAN”.</p><p>Or, you can go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p>Getting to Data Farming page from main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) 4.3 DF Webapp&nbsp;homepage <p>Here’s the DF webapp homepage.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp&nbsp;homepage</a> 4.4 DF Webapp for Passive DF /&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Passive-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">df.oceandao.org/passive-df</a>.</p><p>This page’s main role is to let you lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN. It allows you to explore “what-if” scenarios: you can lock for different durations, with different OCEAN amounts, and different # compounds; and it will tell you the expected OCEAN rewards and APY (including accounting for gas&nbsp;fees).</p><p>This page also lets you track your veOCEAN balance, lock more OCEAN, and lock for&nbsp;longer.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.5 DF Webapp for Volume&nbsp;DF <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Volume-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">df.oceandao.org/volume-df</a>. To participate in Volume DF, you need to allocate your veOCEAN to data assets. The higher the volume the asset, the more you earn: this is curation.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.6 DF Webapp for Claiming&nbsp;Rewards <p>Click the pink “Claim All” buttons on the homepage to claim OCEAN rewards. The image below illustrates.</p><p>Where to claim? All earnings for data farmers are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. This is the case even though data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon, etc. All rewards come through Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>When to claim? There are fresh passive rewards available every Thursday. If you wish, you can wait for many weeks to accumulate before claiming. (It’s all on-chain.) Predictoor rewards can be claimed at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>When to do a first claim? From the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. The nerdy version: if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first weekly ve “epoch” that begins after day x+7. This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">here’s the&nbsp;code.</a></p> 5. Conclusion <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts. Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Aergo is excited to announce Booost’s expansion as an Aergo sub-brand specializing in consumer NFT. <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">As stated in the previous article</a>, Aergo will focus on enterprise-led NFTs, while Booost will specialize in web3 functionalities and NFTs tailored for consumer engagement, particularly leveraging location-based models. This strategic division allows us to tap into distinct markets and cater to diverse needs from both B2B and B2C&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Firstly, Aergo will add dynamic NFT (dNFT) functionality for enterprise customers to utilize with various services. Aergo has already established blockchain infrastructure for numerous companies. By introducing dNFTs and leveraging accumulated network data, Aergo will be pioneering NFTs tailored for specific enterprise environments, extending beyond mere blockchain recording and authentication.</p><p>This innovation stands to revolutionize markets like STO (Security Token Offering) and RWA (Real World Asset). Unlike static NFTs, dNFTs feature continuously updatable metadata, consolidating changes like mortgages and titles without individual raw data storage. This shift offers superior data management and security for enterprises and government agencies, particularly those favoring private networks.</p><p>Take the automotive market for example, where dNFTs are issued when a vehicle is sold. The NFTs record the vehicle’s maintenance and fueling records, which are essential for value conversion which now can be easily performed by simply looking up the dNFT without accessing the blockchain where the raw data is stored. This can be utilized for more accurate valuations, simplifying trades and collateralization. dNFTs can also streamline pre-owned sales for automakers by calculating vehicle purchase values and associated maintenance costs. Luxury car brands also can leverage dNFTs to enhance loyalty programs, offering tailored rewards like event-based incentives and consumer participation rewards to their clientele.</p><p>Meanwhile, Booost will increase its user base by expanding various web3 functions and consumer-focused NFT features. Beyond the event information and location-sharing services successfully tested at the previous Korea Blockchain Week, Booost plans to test and upgrade advertising services linked to NFTs at various domestic and international web3 and crypto&nbsp;events.</p><p>Booost’s primary focus is on location-based advertising (LBA), inspired by Niantic’s groundbreaking integration of gaming with real-world elements. Our innovative LBA model will incorporate features such as event check-ins, admission tickets, raffles, airdrop events, and more, offering a compelling and immersive experience for users and more targeted marketing for retail, enhancing customer engagement</p><p>These dynamic and consumer NFT technologies will be implemented in enterprises and across various industries. Aergo will support companies in various fields including manufacturing companies, governments, and retail to easily utilize dNFTs. The BOOOST app will be a gateway to the web3/consumer NFT markets, expanding the Aergo-based NFT issuance and ecosystem while Aergo taps into the enterprise NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/booosting-the-dynamic-nft-and-consumer-nft-markets-bee8ca91635e">‘BOOOST’ing the Dynamic NFT and Consumer NFT Markets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Suppose you’re a growing company. Then you’ve got a growing Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problem–because that happens when you grow. You’ve probably been using a combination of spreadsheets, emails, checklists, and half-remembered procedures to handle onboarding, offboarding, and compliance audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then along comes an IAM vendor who pitches their shiny identity provider service: a vision of IAM nirvana with automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and access requests. All you have to do is sign up and push a couple of buttons. (After you pay them, of course.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what the IAM vision looks like:</p>
 
 One Platform, Seamless Control: Manage all your SaaS applications’ identities and access in a single, centralized IAM platform. No more jumping between different tools or spreadsheets. 
 Automated Efficiency: Streamline user access with automated provisioning and de-provisioning across all connected applications. Forget manual tasks and ensure instant access when needed. 
 Cost-Effective Security: Secure your SaaS environment without breaking the bank. Expect transparent pricing for essential IAM features like SCIM/SAML support. 
 
<p>Great vision. But according to the customers we’ve talked to, it’s a mirage.</p>
<p>Here’s what IAM reality looked like once they encountered it:</p>
 
 Fragmented Landscape: Many IAM tools only manage a limited subset of SaaS applications, leaving you with a patchwork of tools and manual processes for the rest. 
 Paywalled Integrations: Access to crucial features like SCIM/SAML often requires upgrading to more expensive tiers with your SaaS providers. 
 Inconsistent Implementation: Even when available, SCIM/SAML implementations can vary significantly between SaaS providers, causing compatibility issues and integration headaches. 
 Manual Mayhem: Unsupported applications force admins to resort to manual workarounds, relying on static documentation and informal communication (emails, Slack, spreadsheets) to manage access, leading to inefficiency and security risks. 
 
<p>So they experience IAMBM – an acronym I just made up for Identity and Access Management Buyer’s Remorse. Automating a chaotic, uncontrolled, disorderly process does not make it harmonious, controlled, or orderly. You replace a messy manual mess with a messy automated mess.</p>
<p>Bill Gates said it right: “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting the Paradigm 
<p>Consider orchestration before automation. YeshID’s orchestration lets you capture and organize your tasks in playbooks. As you organize your activities–in one place, with a single source of truth–you can automate when it’s cost-effective, convenient, and technically feasible. You can integrate manual processes, partly automated processes, and completely automated processes using a single interface. Orchestration lets you delegate tasks, follow up, and distribute work without losing visibility and control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestration will make your IAM activities transparent, orderly, distributed, and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAM is about people, not just technology. Don’t fall into the automation trap. By empowering your team and focusing on clear, trackable processes, you can achieve secure and efficient access management without the “buyer’s remorse” hangover.</p>

<p>How do we prove who we are in an increasingly digital world?&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of identity has evolved from social constructs to centralized digital profiles defined more by technology companies than individuals themselves. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to put personal ownership back into the equation through emerging solutions centered around distributed ledger technology and cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation that ranged from philosophy to blockchain technology, Lohan Spies discusses how SSI and related innovations might empower youth in developing nations, enable marginalized populations’ participation in regulated economies, and help regenerate land while fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, complexities around public/private key management, unintended consequences of new systems, and the excitement of driving real global change through collaboration come clearly into focus.</p> Defining Digital Identity <p>The concept of identity has shifted greatly in the digital age. As Spies explains, "The traditional way for identity was very much a social construct." People associated names and faces and built interpersonal trust through repeated interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet lacked an innate understanding of identity, however; online systems resorted to centralized user profiles attached to email addresses, unique IDs controlled more by service providers than individuals.</p><p>This approach enabled security risks, data breaches, and unilateral account shutdowns without recourse. Spies contrasts these realities with self-sovereign identity "where you have full control and ownership of your identity, meaning nobody can take it away from you." Control and ownership sit right at the crux of the philosophical and practical divide.</p> Realizing the Potential of Self-Sovereign Systems <p>For digital identity solutions to reach their full potential, Spies believes several essential ingredients need to coalesce. "The first thing that's extremely important is that we do have standards and video specifications," he explains, "because that is the one thing that aligns us or not."</p><p>However, Spies cautions against rigid standardization stifling innovation, noting that "some people might have a different view...but ultimately, I think we're going to get to a point where we will diverge into a common understanding of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable."</p><p>This balanced approach allows for experimentation on the fringes by "people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases" while still working towards interoperable frameworks.</p><p>“The hope is...it aligns us,” Spies notes of identity standards while allowing for “people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases” on the fringes.</p><p>Second, spreading access to cryptography and related capabilities helps empower individuals rather than leaving specialized knowledge in the hands of a small subset of people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote>“We kind of call it democratizing in a way, the concept of cryptography,” Spies explains regarding this drive to distribute understanding and control, “really giving it to everyone to leverage and utilize to their own benefit.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.</p><p>The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. "I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together," Spies explains.</p><p>Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions.</p> Use Cases, Obstacles, and Promise <p>If coordinated properly, self-sovereign systems could greatly benefit populations in need across the globe. Spies points to the <a href="https://www.generationunlimited.org/yoma?ref=blog.holochain.org">YOMA project from UNICEF</a>, which empowers youth in developing countries, where he is working to help integrate digital identity technology to increase access to education and employment credentials.</p><p>Other models help shift marginalized groups away from all-cash economies into greater digital inclusion. Environmentally, distributed identity solutions offer promise by securely tracking and verifying sustainability data. Spies details one such application in regenerative agriculture:</p><p></p><blockquote>"From the ground, it's verifiable data...we can make sure that a human or IoT device can be identified and how we can make sure that that data feeds up into the chain of various layers. But we know we can trust the data that originated from the ground."</blockquote><p></p><p>This trusted provenance allows for the creation of what Spies calls "nature certificates," which go beyond traditional carbon credits:</p><p>Of course, obstacles remain in these early days. Complexities of public/private key management persist, though various startups work toward solutions. Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.</p><p>However, with expanding real-world deployment comes cause for optimism. Spies expresses excitement “to see this technology really being adopted, really solving real-world problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>New collaborations between digital identity projects are driving tangible progress in addressing real-world challenges. If holistic human needs and ethical considerations guide developers and adopters alike, efforts like YOMA and Holochain could portend more equitable and empowered societies ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>SAP recently announced the end-of-life of their SAP Identity Management solution in 2027, with an extended maintenance period until 2030. With already being in 2024, this leaves three to at maximum six years for migrating SAP Identity Management to another solution. Three years, if avoiding the extended maintenance period and associated cost (even while the premium is only slightly above the regular maintenance fee), is not long enough for the transition of an IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solution. In other words: It is time to start planning.</p>
 IAM solutions provided by SAP and the SAP solution approach 
<p>SAP recently <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101">proposed a solution approach</a> based on <a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/cloud-identity-services">SAP Cloud Identity Services</a>. This article has been frequently misinterpreted in saying “SAP endorses a combined solution based on SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID”. In fact, it says that SAP will continue its investment in both SAP Cloud Identity Services and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/cloud-iam.html">SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance</a> (Cloud IAG) and “that these enhancements are designed to facilitate integration with other partner identity management solutions, like Microsoft Entra ID, that provide a comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide identity and access scenarios.”</p>
<p>SAP unveils its strategy for the own IAM-related solutions as well as their focus on a flexible integration strategy for scenarios that require IAM capabilities beyond what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud Identity Services are a SaaS solution supporting a good set of IAM capabilities, ranging from Access Management features for authentication and identity federation to SCIM-based provisioning, integrated directory services, and authorization management for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM). SAP focuses on utilizing open standards, but also on integration to other IAM solutions in the organization. Access Governance features are provided by SAP Cloud IAG, which is primarily focused on the SAP ecosystem and neatly integrates with the SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
 Challenges and limitations 
<p>With SAP itself supporting an integration approach with other identity management solutions “that provide a comprehensive approach”, the question is where such expansion and integration is needed. There are two dimensions to look at. One is the breadth and depth of capabilities that are needed versus what is provided by SAP’s own solutions, which needs a thorough requirements analysis. To keep in mind here: Access Governance capabilities are delivered by the “companion product” SAP Cloud IAG, not by SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
<p>The other is the breadth and depth of integration to target systems. The focus on SCIM-based provisioning is one important area here. While SCIM is increasingly supported by SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, SCIM interfaces are very rarely found in legacy on-premises applications.</p>
<p>A simple rule is: The more non-SAP solutions, the more legacy and on-premises integration, and the larger and more complex the organization is, the more likely such integration approach is needed.</p>
<p>Plus: There are several IAM solutions out there that can cover what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide in capabilities. There are options. And some of them provide very powerful, in-depth support even for complex SAP environments.</p>
 Taking a structured approach 
<p>Don’t oversimplify a decision that will impact your IT for the next 10-15 years at least, when taking common lifetimes of IGA solutions. Analyze the options you have thoroughly.</p>
 
 Start with your overall IAM strategy: How will your Identity Fabric of the future look like? 
 Analyze what you have and what (SAP Identity Manager, due to end-of-life) must change 
 Understand what you will need 
 Go into the detailed analysis of requirements 
 Run a thorough tools choice process to find the right solution 
 
<p>For that tools choice process, best practice for an organization that has SAP Identity Manager in place is to have SAP Cloud Identity Services and Cloud IAG as one of the shortlisted options, amongst other IAM solutions. Such process also will allow you to assess combinations such as SAP Cloud Identity Services in combination with Microsoft Entra ID or other enterprise IAM solutions.</p>
<p>In any case: Don’t take it easy. Spend the time for planning and assessing the options you have, to find the right solution for your enterprise. Impacting factors include aspects such as</p>
 
 The current and future SAP landscape versus a multi-vendor strategy for Line-of-Business applications 
 The complexity of the non-SAP application and system landscape in scope of IAM 
 The state of IAM solutions beyond SAP Identity Manager 
 The overall IAM strategy towards a modern Identity Fabric 
 The organizational structure, specifically regarding responsibilities for SAP environments vs. IAM 
 
<p>There is no simple answer to the right approach for replacing SAP Identity Manager. Don’t oversimplify.</p>

<p>This blog is first in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in a practical way on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p> Summary   Mydex CIC’s personal data infrastructure is live and operational 24/7/365  The personal data store (PDS) lies at the heart of this infrastructure. PDSs enable individuals to collect, receive, store and use their own data under their own control, independently of the organisations that collect data about&nbsp;them.  PDSs can hold any and all types of data and are designed to last the individual’s lifetime.  PDSs are designed to protect peoples’ privacy. The data held in a person’s PDS can only be seen or accessed by them. Not even Mydex can see or access this data, because each individual holds their own key to their own&nbsp;PDS.  PDSs are designed to be safe and secure, using many different methods and approaches, all designed to work together to maintain the system’s integrity and continuity.   Introduction <p>Over the years, we have blogged many times about developments and issues as they relate to personal data. We’ve talked about the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">economic opportunities</a> that are opened up by empowering individuals with their data, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">related human rights issues</a>, or the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">design principles needed</a> to operate a safe, secure, benign and efficient personal data ecosystem.</p><p>But we haven’t talked much about what we (Mydex CIC) actually do. After working on it for 17 years now, it’s time we&nbsp;did!</p><p>All this time we’ve been building, building, building. Not just a ‘product’ here or a service or app there, but an entire personal data infrastructure capable of providing every citizen nationally (and internationally) with the means to collect, store, manage, use and share any and all their data, from birth to death, in their own own safe, private database, independently of the organisations that collect and use data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This infrastructure can and will change how our entire economy and society works. By giving individuals as much power over their data as organisations currently have, and by enabling individuals to build up the richest and most powerful personal data assets ever seen (data assets that provide individuals with a complete picture of their life), this infrastructure will transform what both people, and the services, researchers and governments they deal with, can do with&nbsp;data.</p><p>Building this infrastructure — infrastructure that works safely and securely, day in, day out, 24/7/365, at national/international scale — hasn’t been easy. It has taken time. But it’s live and operational and it’s time we talked about it in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>If you are a software developer and you really want to dig deep into the nuts and bolts of how this infrastructure works, there is a separate website for you: <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/">dev.mydex.org</a>. There are pages of detail here about, for example, how our APIs work, our data schema (describing what data we can currently collect and hold), or how to access and use our Identity or Master Reference Data services. But this blog will describe what we do at a higher level — the core functionality and design requirements of a Personal Data&nbsp;Store.</p> An overview <p>Three core platforms make up the foundations of our infrastructure. They are akin to a plumbing system with a tank that holds the water, pipes that let water flow into and out of this tank, and taps and valves which control these flows. Similarly, our infrastructure provides:</p>  a Personal Data Store (PDS): the ‘tank’ that actually holds the&nbsp;data  a ‘Personal Data eXchange’ (PDX) system: the ‘pipes’ which enable data to flow into and out of the&nbsp;PDS  interfaces which enable individuals to control this flow of data — the ‘taps and valves’. Internally, we call this interface the Member Experience Layer or&nbsp;MEL  <p>Another analogy is that of a digital filing cabinet. The PDS acts as the filing cabinet itself, keeping each person’s data safely for them under their own lock and key. It is linked to a postal service that enables them to send and receive data as and when they wish (the PDX). Then there are administrative tools that let them decide what data they wish to send or receive, to and from whom, for what purposes (the Experience Layer or&nbsp;MEL).</p><p>Now let’s answer some basic questions.</p> Who? <p>At its most expansive, our mission potentially embraces every individual in the world. We believe every individual in the world should have the means to collect, receive, store and use their own data for their own purposes — to manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>They can (and should) be equipped with a PDS even before they are born — that starts gathering data about them, for them, in pregnancy. Their PDS should still be working for them after they die — to help manage probate and digital wills for example. In between, a person’s PDS creates a lifelong digital record of that person’s life for use by that&nbsp;person.</p> What data? <p>Our PDSs can hold any sort of data you like. Here are some examples.</p>  Transactional activity data This is data that has a time series component. It keeps a record of things that have happened and that you have done. This could include bank transactions, itemised bills, browsing history, secure messages and interactions with service providers and other people. It could also include self- monitoring activity data, for example from wearable devices and sensor data. Huge amounts of data can be involved here. For example, right now, we are collecting billions of rows of data from smart energy metres that are making new readings of electricity in peoples’ homes every 30&nbsp;seconds.  Lists, including assets of all types (documents, contracts, agreements, warranties, bookmarks, actions, calendars and&nbsp;events),  Verified State data This is usually data about you that has been generated by an organisation in the course of providing you with a service (for example blood pressure readings, test results or diagnoses in the case of a health service). Or it could be data that has been ‘conferred’ upon you by an organisation. This is potentially a very long list including, for example, educational attainments, training and professional qualifications, employment history, tenancy, tax status, National Insurance Number, passport details, driving licence details, Disclosure and Barring Service details, approved entitlements (e.g. to a Government benefit) or verified identity. And so&nbsp;on!  <p>These are all ‘verified attributes’, where the data point in question comes wrapped with additional metadata (data about the data) by which the originating organisation confirms its validity. In this way, trust that this data is reliable can travel seamlessly with it wherever it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>Using the PDX, it is possible to keep track of any ways in which this data might change. For example, if you have a driving licence, the data about your driving licence in your PDS can be linked to the data in the DVLA’s systems so that any changes it makes to its records are instantly registered in your PDS. Thus, if you have just passed your Heavy Goods driving test or have been barred from driving, your PDS will log this change as soon as it is logged by the DVLA. In this way your PDS works for you ‘while you are asleep’, keeping your records up-to-date.</p>  About me data This includes additional data that you decide to add to your PDS. This can be information about you that nobody else would necessarily know — for example your preferences, goals and plans. This is another potentially vast set of data, and it can be organised into different modules and dimensions. It is the sort of information that can be critically important to service providers wanting to understand you and your needs in the context of the services they provide. Because it is modular in nature (e.g. broken down to a series of separate details about you) you can choose to share different bundles of this data with different service providers, who often need different bundles of information. This helps you gain access to services and configure them to your&nbsp;needs.  Metadata about relationships and connections Metadata is data about the data. In this case, this metadata includes account level records of your relationships with service providers and other people that you share data with or received data&nbsp;from.  Immutable logs These record all activity and interactions with your and your use of Mydex APIs (links between your systems and others’ systems) and the applications connected to those APIs. They log who undertook what activity, via what route. Where relevant, they keep a before-and-after copy of the record, to show how it has been updated. All of this is crucial for audit and accountability. Should anything go wrong in your relationship with a service, you have proof of what has been transacted under your own control, like an audit trail which removes&nbsp;doubt.  <p>To keep on top of each new piece of data that comes into or goes out of the PDS, and to keep it in its right place, we have created what we call the ‘Personal Data Store Master Schema’. It is this Schema that structures and scopes the personal data store held in the PDS, enabling it to be used in endlessly different ways in different combinations. The Schema enables interoperability between the individual’s PDS and the subscribers who deliver and collect personal data via the&nbsp;PDX.</p><p>You can see a list of the data sets we are <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/datasets.html">currently handling here</a>. This list is forever growing and will continue growing. Mydex can automatically deploy updates to the PDS Master Data Schema as new datasets become available, using open standards where applicable and available. Some examples in the current list are: bank account details (including each bank transaction), browsing history, energy consumption data, health and social care records, intentions and notes made by members using the PDS, telephone calls and SMS messages, and details of voluntary activities.</p><p>Over an individual’s lifetime their PDS can collect and hold a potentially vast amount of data. Even so, not all the data that is generated or collected by an organisation will necessarily be deposited into an individual’s PDS — only the data that is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We stress this point because some people get the wrong end of the stick about PDSs, thinking they are meant to replace the traditional organisation-centric database. They are not. They are meant to complement it, adding to the ecosystem by enabling individuals as well as organisations to use this data, and enabling new uses of this data via eased data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Organisation-centric databases continue operating as they did before, with two changes. They can now deposit verified copies of some of their data in the individual’s PDS if the individual asks for it. They can also receive additional information from the individual’s PDS if they ask for it and the individual is prepared to provide&nbsp;it.</p><p>One crucial change made possible by the PDS is the ability to create new combinations of data. Currently, all your data is dispersed across the hundreds of different organisations that collect data about you (often the same data in many areas). Each one collects their own little slivers of data that really matter to them. PDSs enable individuals to become the ‘point of integration’, by which all this data from a vast range of sources can be gathered together and combined to create a complete picture of the individual’s life — all directly under the individual’s exclusive control.</p> How? <p>For us as a PDS provider, keeping on top of it all the above takes a lot of work. As you can imagine, providing this service involves a number of technical issues. Amongst these issues, interoperability is&nbsp;key.</p><p>It is irritating but true that different organisations use different formats to hold data — and if you jumble up these formats you end up with multiple data sets that cannot ‘talk’ to each other. A simple example is data formats where Americans and Europeans switch days and months around. To an American, 9/11/2001 means the eleventh of September 2001. To a European it means the ninth of November, 2001.</p><p>To cope with these endless sources of confusion, we have designed systems by which the PDS can store data that is delivered in the originating organisation’s raw delivery format but which also parse that data into the right part of the Master Schema (making appropriate links to ensure the integrity of the data is maintained at all times). The data is always watermarked with its source and verification status.</p><p>This means the data can be used in many different contexts, including being combined with other data sets that were once originally in completely different formats. By attaching metadata to the data — for example, who originally minted it, when, and when it was last checked and updated — trust can travel with each data&nbsp;point.</p> Where? <p>All the data held in our members’ PDSs are held in the Cloud, independently of and separate to any systems that organisations use to collect data about individuals.</p><p>This means that Mydex personal data stores are NOT just a different name or version of a traditional organisational ‘MyAccount’ service. With a MyAccount service, an individual can log in to an organisation’s systems (not their own personal system), see some of the data held by that particular organisation, tweak settings, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Mydex personal data stores have nothing to do with such MyAccount systems (even if these systems are sometimes misleadingly called ‘personal data stores’ or ‘personal online data stores’ — i.e. where an organisation is storing personal data about an individual.)</p><p>Using the Cloud as the storage medium is important because it provides maximum possible flexibility with security. Mydex personal data stores are not held in distributed ledgers or blockchains. These are too slow and unwieldy. Nor are they held on the individual’s device such as a smartphone. That’s too risky. (What happens if your device is lost or stolen?) Our PDSs are not the same as phone-held ‘wallets’ either, because these wallets hold only a tiny proportion of the data held by a&nbsp;PDS.</p><p>This doesn’t mean we are against any of these things. Mydex PDSs can and do connect to organisations’ MyAccount systems. They can work with specific blockchain applications. Mobile phones (and ‘wallets’ held on the mobile phones) are one of the main ways that individuals access and use their PDS — including via different types of web app. They are an interface. Part of the experience layer.</p><p>But the Cloud is the place for the PDS itselfbecause of its scale, flexibility and security. The simple fact that the Cloud is ‘always on’ means data deliveries and collections can operate 24hrs a day, following the rules the member has set for their relationships with&nbsp;others.</p><p>Of course, the Cloud is provided by physical infrastructure sitting in physical places. Our PDSs sit in data centres rented off specialist service providers, with the servers operated in highly secure locations in the individual’s country of residence (to comply fully, not only with the letter of GDPR data protection regulations but with their spirit too). Because they are ‘always on’, we operate them across ‘availability zones’. This means that if one location goes off-line we keep running. We also back them up continually. This means we always have a means of recovery even in the highly unlikely scenario of the Cloud being lost and all the availability zones being&nbsp;lost.</p> Who is in&nbsp;control? <p>One key feature about our PDSs is that we cannot and do not want to see the data it holds or exert any control over it. The only person able to see the data held in a PDS is the person that the data relates to (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Znjev1g6XtYXaiew_OLjS1uav21v6MvWlpCbiJddy28/edit#heading=h.7ki3ej3oc5ty">But is it safe?</a> Below). We provide individuals with the tools by which they can exercise control over the sharing and use of this data, but these tools are designed to empower the individual, not us. We act for the individual, as their agent, carrying out their instructions. We explain more about how this works in our blog on the PDX (personal data exchange).</p><p>This issue of control raises a further important question about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">guardianship</a>. The baby in the womb isn’t up to managing and controlling their data. Nor is an ageing person with dementia. Processes for safe, ethical guardianship are key to the design of what we do: we have designed auditable, easy-to-manage ways by which one individual can act for another in managing that individual’s data, including powers of attorney, when needed. Again, we’ll say more about this when we look at the PDX. These arrangements may include one individual acting on another’s behalf e.g. sending messages, reviewing referrals, calendar invites and any number of interactions with their service providers. Every such activity is tracked and audited transparently. This helps protect both the individual and the service provider interacting with that individual.</p> But is it&nbsp;safe? <p>Given the vast range and potential sensitivity of the data that can go into a PDS, security has to be paramount. (After all, this is a hugely powerful personal asset that will grow in value over your lifetime)</p><p>To maintain security at all times, all data held in a Mydex PDS is encrypted both at rest and in motion. From the moment it is entered into your PDS, your personal information is encrypted using AES 512-bit encryption, the highest standard available today.</p><p>The company as a whole is independently accredited and certified for Information Security and Management under ISO27001 (and has been for the last ten years). As part of this, Mydex operates extensive security and threat vector protections and monitoring to ensure the stability, availability and performance of its data infrastructure. This is constantly monitored with specific triggers and alerts and automated responses and mitigations.</p><p>To get an idea of the detailed work that goes into operating our encryption processes, go to <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/pki.html">this page on our developer website</a>. There, you can see the instructions we give to developers wanting to deposit data in a PDS or receive data from it. <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/fyi/security-model.html">This page provides</a> a higher level overview of our security&nbsp;model.</p><p>Our platforms and all data held in our PDS have triple availability (e.g. stored in three different availability zones across a scalable infrastructure, all in undisclosed locations within the UK (for UK citizens). ​​These locations are monitored 24x7 and cannot be accessed without security clearance including photo ID and pre-notification in advance. Meanwhile, as part of our ISO27001 certification, we operate multi-layer backup services which means that if any data should be lost in some sort of outage or physical damage, it can be recovered (as described above).</p><p>Many companies make a big fuss about how privacy protecting they are because, like us, all the data they hold is encrypted. What they don’t point out is that while such encryption protects the data from external prying eyes, it doesn’t do anything to protect it from internal prying eyes — e.g. the company itself. If the company holds the encryption key, it can access this data any time it likes. Which means that their much-vaunted encryption-based privacy protection amounts to very&nbsp;little.</p><p>Our PDSs are different. First off, each PDS is a standalone database and each is separately encrypted. This means we have not built one single huge database holding millions of records, but a separate personal database for each individual. The distributed nature of this infrastructure means it is impossible for a hacker to do one, single hack to access a million records in one fell swoop (the sort of thing that is reported daily, in growing numbers, across the globe). To access a million people’s records on the Mydex platform, a hacker would have to conduct a million separate, successful hacks. This turns the economics and incentives of hacking on its head, maximising the hacker’s costs while minimising their&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In addition, every individual has their own private encryption key to their PDS. Basically, this is their own additional passphrase (which can be up to 128 characters in length). Mydex doesn’t have access to this passphrase. This means not even Mydex can ‘see’ the data held by its members in their&nbsp;PDSs.</p><p>There are no hidden ‘back doors’. The entire system is designed NOT to have such back doors. (This isn’t without its problems. For example, many Governments and security services don’t like services that don’t keep secret back doors open for&nbsp;them.)</p><p>Because only the individual knows their particular Private Key, if they forget this passphrase we cannot reset it for them — because we never knew what it was in the first place. The downside of this is that if they lose this Private Key — if they forget this additional passphrase — they lose direct access to their&nbsp;data.</p><p>We have ways of addressing this problem. In a nutshell, we have created a system whereby individuals can break their Private Keys/additional passphrase into ‘shards’ or fragments. Each of these shards is cryptographically secured so it can only be accessed by the person who set it up. These shards are then distributed among the PDSs of friends and family, who are invited act as trustees of just one particular shard. The shards are thus held securely by friends and family on behalf of the individual. (The fact that it is a shard means that should the friend or family member turn evil and, in the extremely unlikely event of their being able to break the encryption, even then they would only be able to access one part of the Private Key, thereby rendering it useless.)</p><p>If the individual forgets their Private Key passphrase, they can then ask friends and family to return the cryptographic tokens back to them, and our systems will help the member put them back together and de-encrypt them for the individual. This is a bit of hassle for both us and the individual. But it’s needed if the whole system is to be genuinely secure.</p> Conclusion <p>Mydex has built citizen-empowering personal data infrastructure that enables individuals to safely and easily collect, store, manage, use and share their own data in their own database independently of all organisations that collect data about them. This helps remove friction, effort, risk, cost and micro-stress in their lives. It is core to our mission to equip people with easy to use tools that allow them to exercise their human rights easily, safely and securely and to take an active part in the workings of the digital economy and&nbsp;society.</p><p>The personal data store itself lies at the heart of this infrastructure, and it works as described above&nbsp;. But to be really useful, it needs to enable data sharing. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">What IS a Personal Data Store?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare organizations must address a multitude of high-priority challenges. With competition at an all-time high, healthcare organizations are under pressure to meet patient and member demands for easy, personalized digital experiences. Healthcare providers, workers, and partners are also insisting on seamless digital experiences that streamline their work for greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the healthcare industry is facing unrelenting cyberattacks that wreak havoc upon patient care, budgets, and business operations. According to the 2024 ForgeRock Breach Report (ForgeRock is now a part of Ping Identity), healthcare systems have remained the number one breach target for over five years.&nbsp; Electronic health records containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI), such as medical records and patient data, are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Unauthorized access is the root cause of most breaches – emphasizing the dire need for modern digital identity cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations are using <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/iam-modernization.html">legacy systems</a> that weren’t built to deliver personalized experiences and secure access for millions of diverse identity types to on-premises, cloud, and SaaS apps from any device, at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a modern, HIPAA compliant <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> platform should be on every healthcare leader’s radar. Modern IAM is proven to protect sensitive information and data by drastically reducing cyberattacks. It also improves user experience and engagement, such as removing friction from the authentication process, all while protecting sensitive data against ransomware, fraud, and other cyberattacks. HIPAA-compliant IAM platforms also enable healthcare organizations to meet compliance requirements for regulations such as HIPAA, TEFCA, HITECH, the 21st Century Cures Act, and many more.</p>

				  Learn how some educators are taking advantage of new technologies to provide faster student and employee verification and eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the US <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/highest-school-enrollment-count.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20college%20enrollment%20remained,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202020">17.3 million students were enrolled in college</a> in 2022, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184010/school-enrollment-in-public-and-private-institutions-2008/#statisticContainer">17.16 million were enrolled in high school.</a> Each student generates data — such as transcripts of courses taken and grades achieved — all of which will need to be shared and verified over the course of the school year and beyond.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in higher education, colleges in the US received roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2023/03/30/college-applications-are-up-dramatically-in-2023/?sh=6b7324349c4d">seven million applications in 2023,</a> each of which requiring a short list of supporting documents.</p>
<p>Student athletes will need documents for sports they participated in, as well as medical paperwork, such as physicals or injury reports, to be on file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitnux.org/college-housing-statistics/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20college%20students%20in,colleges%20have%20on-campus%20housing">50% of college students who live on campus </a>need an identity and access management system to access dorms, dining halls, labs and libraries.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="https://educationdata.org/number-of-college-graduates#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20graduates,college%20students%20graduated%20in%202021">4.16 million students who received some level of degree in 2021</a> will need to prove that achievement when they apply for a job and will need to keep supplying that data for many jobs to come.</p>
<p>Employers will want to verify that the degree is real, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-employers-verify-college-degrees#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20check%20is,which%20usually%20incurs%20a%20fee">manual process most often handled by the school records office</a>. This process can take up to <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/#:~:text=Education%20Verification%20Turnaround%20Time&amp;text=The%20normal%20turnaround%20time%20for,or%20state%20and%20federal%20holiday">72 hours</a> unless subject to additional delays such as school holidays, resulting in a lot of work for the school.</p>
<p>Verifying these degrees is not just a “nice to have,” fraudulent degrees and transcripts are estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">seven billion-dollar-a-year industry</a> worldwide, with real impact. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">Thousands of nurses</a> have recently been caught practicing using fake or purchased credentials.</p>
<p>What if there was a really simple way of managing all this, so that all this data was portable, held by the student, and instantly and reliably authenticatable?</p>
<p>How decentralized identity can help</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology is a way to digitize data so that its original source can be cryptographically proven and any attempt to alter it will be caught. It is designed so that a person can hold their own data, locally, on their mobile devices in the form of a verifiable credential. This makes data easy to share directly with other parties, each of whom can verify the authenticity of the data with simple, mobile software. Critically, this system of holding one’s own data, sharing it directly, and verifying it easily means that direct integrations can be avoided (saving money) and third parties are no longer needed as data brokers (simplifying data privacy), — a revolution in data management.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for an educational institution, paperwork such as grades, transcripts, and diplomas can now be issued to students directly with a verifiable credential. The student or graduate holds their records and shares them with whoever needs the information, such as when signing up for more classes or applying for college or a job.</p>
<p>Similarly, a student’s identity card can be issued as a verifiable credential, meaning educators have a way to verify a student’s identity for access to accounts, buildings, research collections, laboratories, and more. Verifiable credentials can easily be configured with rules to grant and revoke this access and expire upon graduation.</p>
<p>By issuing verifiable credentials for identity and data, an educational institution can remove the need for passwords, locks, key fobs, or access cards, manual checks in the records office, digging through servers, paper documents and more. By issuing degrees through a verifiable credential, any business with the proper verifier agent can immediately know that the information presented to them is trustworthy, removing the need to go back to the school at all.</p>
<p>How Open Badges fit in</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to verify a person’s transcript, diploma, or certificate, you will need to contact whomever issued the transcript or diploma or certificate. This often means contacting them directly.</p>
<p>But what if that issuing party no longer exists? Schools close, businesses go under or become absorbed. Even if the original data exists, it can be time-consuming to track it down.</p>
<p>This is where Open Badges 3.0 comes in. As a type of verifiable credential for storing data about academic achievements, or certifications, an Open Badge credential can be verified without having to directly check in with the institution that issued them, meaning it can essentially “live forever.”</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier versions of the Open Badges format, the badge can be held by its owner and shared directly. Previously, the badge was hosted by a website (with the risk that it, too, could go bust and disappear, taking the credential record with it).</p>
<p>Open badges 3.0 offer a new smart, decentralized way to store transcripts, grades, and diplomas. Even if a school closes, merges with another, or loses the records, the student has a record and can prove what they have accomplished.</p>

 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>



 



<p>About SOTERIA</p>



<p>The SOTERIA consortium consists of 13 partners from eight EU countries, composed of small medium enterprises (ERDYN), large enterprises (IDnow, SCYTL, IPCenter.at), universities and research centers (Audencia, KU Leuven, CVC, IDIAP, Inria, Biocruces Bizkaia) and non-for-profit organizations (INFOCONS, STELAR, NORIA Onlus). The project was written and submitted to the European Union in August 2020, following a call for projects by the European Commission on the topics of digital security and privacy for citizens. The SOTERIA project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101018342. More information on the project can be found at <a href="https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/">https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/</a>.<a>[1]</a></p>

<p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, Bluesky operated by three principles:</p>
 
 Simple and Powerful: Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood 
 User Choice: Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems 
 Openness: Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces 
 
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
 Sensible Defaults with User Choice 
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>

  
  An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.

<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  
  Configurable options per label from an example moderation service. 


  
  Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”

<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>For additional information, read our technical explainer for moderation architecture across the AT Protocol <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/blueskys-moderation-architecture">here</a>.</p>
 How will this all work? 
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
 From a user perspective: 
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
 From a moderator perspective: 
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>

  
  Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.

<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
 From a developer perspective: 
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
 FAQ 
<p>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial in managing and authenticating users and securing access to organizational resources. IAM involves identifying users in a system and controlling their access to resources by associating user rights and restrictions with the user’s device and established identity. On the other hand, a passwordless authentication method is an advanced user verification method that doesn’t require the user to enter a password. Instead, it uses various other forms of authentication, such as biometrics, hardware tokens, and SMS, significantly reducing the vulnerabilities associated with passwordless technology use.<br>
Incorporating passwordless authentication into IAM establishes a more secure and user-friendly system access method. Users gain access and are verified using personal attributes or devices to verify identity that they possess, simplifying the access process while maintaining or even improving the level of security.</p>
 Evolution from Password-based to Passwordless IAM 
<p>The need for better security and ease of access has driven the evolution from password-based to passwordless authentication work IAM. Originally, passwords were the universal method of securing access to systems and data. However, as technology evolved and security threats became more sophisticated, relying solely on passwords became a vulnerability.<br>
Passwordless IAM reflects a move towards implementing passwordless authentication methods as a more secure form of identity verification. This modern approach emphasizes the authentication factor of a user’s identity, removing the traditional password vulnerability and incorporating stronger, user-friendly authentication methods with security frameworks.</p>
 Significance of Secure Identity Verification 
<p>The importance of secure identity verification in IAM cannot be overstated. Ensuring users are who they say they are is fundamental to safeguarding sensitive data and systems. Passwordless IAM technologies enhance this security by further authenticating users using the security key authentication factor, reducing reliance on easily compromised passwords.<br>
Passwordless IAM amplifies the security of identity verification processes, using advanced authentication methods like biometrics or even hardware token tokens, which are much harder for malicious actors to compromise than traditional passwords.</p>
 Diving Deep into Passwordless IAM 
 Exploring Passwordless IAM Technologies 
<p>Various technologies enable the functionality of passwordless authentication safe IAM. Biometrics, authentication factors such as fingerprints or facial recognition, use unique physical characteristics for identification. Hardware tokens and smart cards are physical devices that users can use for biometric authentication, adding another layer of security to a passwordless world.<br>
Software tokens and mobile applications can generate or receive one-time passwords and verification codes from a user’s mobile device, providing a secure and convenient way for users to authenticate their identities without the need for passwords.</p>
 Advantages and Challenges of Going Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless IAM has several notable advantages over passwordless methods, primarily enhancing security and user experience. Removing passwords from the authentication process reduces the risks of phishing attacks and other password-related vulnerabilities. Users also benefit from a more streamlined and simplified access process.<br>
However, transitioning to passwordless IAM is not without challenges. Issues like technology costs, potential vulnerabilities, and user adaptation to new authentication methods must be carefully managed and addressed to implement passwordless IAM successfully.</p>
 Passwordless IAM in Action: Real-World Applications 
<p>Passwordless IAM has numerous practical applications across various sectors, improving data security and access management wherever it is implemented. For instance, it facilitates quick, secure access to patient records in healthcare. It helps protect customer data in finance, offering a more secure access method than other password-based authentication-reliant systems. The adaptability and increased security of passwordless IAM make it a valuable asset across diverse industries and use cases.</p>
 How Passwordless IAM Enhances Security 
 Bypassing the Risks of Password-based Systems 
<p>Password-based systems come with inherent risks, such as vulnerability to phishing, brute force attacks, and password fatigue. Passwordless IAM eliminates these risks by removing passwords from the equation entirely. Instead of traditional usernames, authentication methods like biometrics, tokens, or SMS are used to authenticate users, which are not susceptible to the same kinds of attacks as passwords.<br>
In a passwordless environment, malicious actors are deprived of the opportunity to get login credentials, exploit weak passwords to gain access, or use stolen passwords for unauthorized access. This fundamentally enhances an organization’s security posture by bypassing the typical risks associated with password-based systems and data breaches.</p>
 Reducing Threats and Enhancing User Experience 
<p>Passwordless IAM augments security and significantly enhances the user’s mobile device and experience. Users no longer need to remember and manage multiple passwords, simplifying the login process. It also alleviates the common issues related to password resets, lockouts, and password management, streamlining user access to systems and applications.<br>
An improved user experience, combined with more secure authentication factors with advanced authentication methods, strengthens the user’s overall security. Users are less likely to adopt insecure practices such as using weak passwords or reusing passwords across multiple services, contributing to the user’s identity in a more secure environment.</p>
 Success Stories and Learnings from Implementations 
<p>Implementing passwordless IAM has succeeded in various sectors, showcasing its efficacy and reliability. Companies that have transitioned to implement passwordless authentication using IAM have experienced enhanced security, reduced costs associated with password resets, and improved user satisfaction.<br>
Learning from these successes, it’s evident that a strategic approach to implementing passwordless authentication solutions, considering user education, technology compatibility, and comprehensive planning, is essential. These real-world success stories provide valuable insights and lessons for organizations aiming to successfully adopt and explore passwordless authentication and IAM.</p>
 Implementing Passwordless IAM 
 Transitioning: Strategy and Best Practices 
<p>Transitioning to passwordless authentication works IAM requires a well-considered strategy and adherence to best practices. Initially, evaluating the organization’s specific needs and challenges is essential, followed by choosing appropriate and implementing passwordless authentication technologies that align with organizational objectives.<br>
A phased approach to implementation is advisable, starting with pilot programs or specific user groups. This allows for testing, feedback, and adjustment before a broader rollout. Continuous user education and support throughout the transition are also paramount to ensure that users are comfortable and confident in using the new authentication methods.</p>
 Tackling Potential Hurdles in the Implementation Journey 
<p>While implementing passwordless IAM, organizations may encounter technical issues, user resistance in answering security questions, or compatibility challenges with existing systems. To overcome these, a clear understanding of potential problems, along with planned strategies for their mitigation, is necessary.<br>
Having a dedicated team to manage the implementation, providing necessary support and guidance to users, and ensuring that the selected username and password-less login solutions are compatible with the user registers existing infrastructure are crucial steps in navigating the potential challenges effectively.</p>
 Ensuring Sustained Success Post-Implementation 
<p>Ensuring the sustained success of a passwordless login system or IAM post-implementation involves continuous improvement, monitoring, and support. Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the chosen solutions, gathering user feedback, and making necessary adjustments are vital for maintaining a robust passwordless IAM system.<br>
Ongoing user education and support help adapt to any changes or updates in the passwordless authentication system work processes, ensuring that users remain informed and capable of utilizing the passwordless IAM system effectively. This ongoing effort helps maximize the benefits of passwordless IAM authentication work, ensuring it remains a secure and user-friendly authentication solution.</p>
 Regulatory and Compliance Aspects of Passwordless IAM 
 Navigating through Global IAM Regulations 
<p>Navigating global regulations is essential to implementing and managing passwordless IAM systems. Various regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and others, stipulate specific requirements for managing user identities and access to sensitive information.<br>
Passwordless IAM systems should be designed and operated with these global regulations. Understanding and aligning the passwordless IAM strategy with regulatory requirements is vital in ensuring lawful operation and avoiding potential legal penalties related to non-compliance.</p>
 Ensuring Compliance in a Passwordless Environment 
<p>Ensuring compliance in a full passwordless authentication environment involves aligning the most common passwordless authentication processes and methods and IAM system’s operations with industry standards and regulations. Regular audits, reviews, and updates of the most common passwordless authentication methods, IAM processes, and technologies are necessary to maintain compliance.<br>
Developing and adhering to policies that define the secure management of identities and access, aligned with regulatory requirements, is essential. Such policies should cover user registration, verifying identity, authentication, access control, and the secure storage and transmission of user identity provider authentication data.</p>
 Managing Audits and Demonstrating Compliance 
<p>Managing audits effectively is crucial in demonstrating compliance with regulations and industry standards. Organizations should maintain detailed records of their passwordless IAM operations, including user logs replacing passwords, authentication activities, system access logs, and changes to the IAM configuration.<br>
A well-documented audit trail facilitates the review and verification processes, helping demonstrate compliance during audits. It also supports identifying and rectifying potential issues, contributing to the continuous improvement and optimization of the passwordless IAM system.</p>
 Future Trajectory and Innovations in Passwordless IAM

Continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies and practices are necessary for maintaining a resilient and up-to-date passwordless IAM system.</p>
 Preparing for Emerging Security Threats and Challenges 
<p>Passwordless IAM systems must be robust enough to withstand emerging threats and challenges. This involves regular updates, continuous monitoring, and adopting advanced security practices and technologies as they emerge.<br>
Preparation for new threats requires a proactive approach, including participating in cybersecurity communities, staying informed about the latest threats, and adopting best practices for passwordless IAM security. This readiness is crucial for ensuring the passwordless IAM system remains secure against evolving threats.</p>
 Sustainable and Scalable Approaches in Future Scenarios 
<p>Adopting sustainable and scalable approaches is essential for the long-term success of username and password based authentication-less IAM implementations. As organizations grow and evolve, the IAM systems should be capable of scaling to accommodate more users, applications, and systems seamlessly.<br>
Building scalability and flexibility into the design and operation of passwordless IAM systems allows them to adapt to changing organizational needs and technologies effectively. It ensures that the passwordless IAM system can continue to provide secure and efficient authentication services, even as the organizational landscape evolves.</p>
 How BlockID helps achieve Passwordless IAM 
<p>BlockID is instrumental in achieving Passwordless Identity and Access Management (IAM), driving a secure, efficient, and user-friendly transformation. BlockID Verify specializes in frictionless identity proofing, ensuring verifiable identities with over 99% accuracy. It’s digitally innovating the user onboarding process using advanced methods such as LiveID, FaceID, and device biometrics combined with government-issued IDs, banking, and telecommunication credentials.<br>
BlockID’s unique advantage lies in its commitment to non-biased and objective identity verification, eliminating identity fraud and reducing operational costs. The technology ensures a swift and convenient user experience, enabling immediate identity verification and onboarding through a browser or a customizable mobile application. By incorporating BlockID in IAM strategies, organizations can modernize identity verification processes, promote secure and rapid onboarding, and seamlessly transition towards a passwordless enterprise environment, enhancing workforce and customer experiences.<br>
BlockID bolsters IAM policies by providing supplementary security features such as:</p>
<p>1. <a>Biometric-based Authentication</a>: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification.<br>
2. <a>Identity Proofing</a>: BlockID provides tamper evident and trustworthy digital verification of identity – anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy.<br>
3. <a>Privacy by Desig</a>n: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.<br>
4. <a>Distributed Ledger</a>: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.<br>
5. <a>Interoperability</a>: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.<br>
6. <a>Industry Certifications</a>: Certified-to and exceeds requirements of NIST 800-63-3, FIDO2, UK DIATF and iBeta Pad-2 specifications.<br>

<p>The health sector faces a staggering array of challenges and consequences in the relentless battle against cyberthreats. Surprisingly, it’s not just a battle against malicious outsiders — within healthcare organizations internal users represent 39% of all threat actors.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human error in the forms of data loss and misuse are the most common ways internal actors pose a threat to the healthcare organizations they work for. With the average cost of a breach at $10.93 million2, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers, employees, contractors, and partners only have access to the internal apps and systems that they need to do their jobs — and nothing more — to keep the risk of internal threats at bay.</p>

<p>Over 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are dealing with increased fraud and financial crime, putting more pressure on banks to choose between friction and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

<p></p>



 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce 



 Human resources and employment 
 




<p></p>



<p>Although widespread adoption is still evolving, various pilot programs and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving challenges and improving user experiences across industries.</p>

				  Together, Indicio and SITA are changing how we travel —&nbsp;and in doing so, how we can share and trust data to make the world a better place.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>I’m proud to announce that Indicio’s partnership with SITA is deepening with a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">new and important investment</a> in our company.</p>
<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>
<p>Indicio has distinguished itself by making our customers’ ideas become a reality. Our team members are world-class visioneers. So watch this space as we accelerate — and drop us a line if you’d like us to make your vision for a smarter, smoother, safer world real too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Heather Dahl</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Theme#:~:text=The%20campaign%20theme%20for%20International,belonging%2C%20relevance%2C%20and%20empowerment.">IWD website</a>, “The campaign theme for International Women's Day 2024 is Inspire Inclusion. When we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world.” Needless to say, Ping Identity is both thrilled and honored to inspire inclusivity among our coworkers, peers, and greater network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what inclusivity means to people at Ping, I spoke with several female team members to get their perspectives on contemporary gender issues. I’m grateful to these women for sharing their hard-won insights learned from working in the tech space.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as a central theme, with a vision of wallets supporting multiple protocols to facilitate diverse interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers. This flexibility is seen as key to the widespread adoption of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Mathieu invites listeners to actively participate in shaping the future of digital credential protocols by joining the Trust over IP Foundation’s Credential Exchange Protocol Task Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of digital identities and the role of technology in securing and verifying digital credentials.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Anonyome Labs team has headed to Washington, D.C., for the biggest credit union advocacy event of the year—the Governmental Affairs Conference, March 3–7, 2024!</p>



<p>If you’re attending the conference in D.C., we invite you to meet with us to learn how to streamline your operations, boost member satisfaction, and stop fraud with the revolutionary verification solution, reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Our sales team will be on hand to explain how reusable credentials are replacing inefficient and risky conventional Know Your Customer (KYC) methods with a frictionless system in which customers only have to verify themselves once.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>

<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> is the leader in proactive identity protection technologies. From verifiable credentials to VPNs and encrypted communications, we leverage our cryptography and blockchain technology expertise to take data privacy and security to the next level. Check out our podcast, <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/">Privacy Files</a>, to hear what your peers and experts are saying about the state of member and consumer privacy in real time.</p>

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

 Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government Infrastructure <p>Cities worldwide are competing to become hubs for blockchain innovation, and the City of Daegu, South Korea, is among those taking proactive steps to position itself as a leading blockchain city.</p><p>Daegu is spearheading efforts to advance the ABB (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data) sector, recognized as the key driver of future growth. With a focus on bolstering blockchain technology, Daegu has established a Blockchain Technology Innovation Support Center. The center, launched in December 2023 through a public initiative by the Ministry of Science and ICT, is dedicated to nurturing projects.</p><p>Daegu Embarks on Aergo Blockchain Mainnet</p><p>Venturing into blockchain technology, <a href="https://plus.hankyung.com/apps/newsinside.view?aid=2023112750785&amp;category=&amp;sns=y">Daegu has established public blockchain networks based on Aergo and Avalanche</a>. The goal is to integrate diverse blockchain services onto a single city-level infrastructure, paving the way for the city’s evolution into a comprehensive blockchain city. Setting itself apart from other municipalities, Daegu is prioritizing the creation of blockchain-powered services including:<br>- Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs), <br>- Security Token Offerings(STOs), and <br>- Decentralized Identity Verification(DID)</p><p>In line with this initiative, Aergo Foundation and the City of Daegu are actively fostering the development of Proof-of-Concept cases including intelligent mobility supply chains, electronic prescriptions, and herbal product authenticity certification.</p><p>Rising Trend of Central and Local Governments Embracing Blockchain</p><p>Daegu leads the charge as an increasing number of local governments explore integrating blockchain technology into public services. Municipal authorities are actively exploring blockchain’s potential for administrative tasks like document authentication, public records maintenance, and voting systems. By embracing blockchain, local governments aim to enhance transparency, streamline bureaucratic processes, and elevate the effectiveness of governmental functions.</p><p>Leveraging the experiences from past cases, the Aergo Foundation and its key partners, including Blocko and CCCV, are spearheading efforts to develop more comprehensive and competitive use cases based on the Aergo mainnet. Furthermore, the Aergo Foundation has been actively participating in Korea’s government-led Blockchain Trust Framework(K-BTF). This case further reinforces Aergo’s commitment to establishing a presence in the public blockchain service sector. More details regarding K-BTF will be released&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Previous Aergo and Blocko Cases with the Korean Central and Local Governments</p>  Blockchain Voting: Gyeonggi-do, one of the largest provinces of Korea, implemented a blockchain-based voting system to collect resident input on community projects, resulting in a successful vote with 9,000 participants casting their votes through both online and offline channels. With the increasing interest in blockchain-based voting, we anticipate witnessing the development of more cases in this&nbsp;area.  Blockchain-based real estate administration system(land registry): Blocko implemented a blockchain solution for land registry in South Korea. The system enabled financial bodies to use government data by sharing it on a ledger across Jeju Province. Major Korean banks including Shinhan Financial Group, Korea Exchange Bank, and Korea Development Bank participated in the initiative. The banks conducted all real estate transactions based on the blockchain.  Blockchain-based micropayment: Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea, explored blockchain-based micropayment settlement infrastructure. Blocko provided a blockchain system for transaction validation, participant authentication, and wallet management by creating transaction processes and mobile implementations centered around the micropayment solution. The project aimed to assess the efficiency of microtransaction settlements on distributed networks in expediting transaction outputs and reducing&nbsp;costs.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/empowering-koreas-central-and-local-governments-driving-blockchain-innovation-in-government-91730fd4cd7b">Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

<p>Scotland’s The Herald recently ran an article talking about how technology could be used to genuinely improve health and care services. It <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24140446.prof-george-crooks-dhi-spearheading-hi-tech-solutions-nhs/">quotes Professor George Crooks</a>, head of Scotland’s Digital and Health Care Innovation Centre, saying it is time for a digital revolution which will empower both patients and free up clinical staff to direct their efforts to where it is most&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>It may sound like science fiction, but Prof Crooks foresees a future where citizens are empowered to make decisions through having detailed knowledge of their own health needs, gathered by constant collection of data which flows into the hands of medical professionals digitally.</blockquote><blockquote>The ongoing health needs of individual Scots would be recorded in a data cloud accessible to themselves and those who need it, providing scope for targeted care on a round-the-clock basis.</blockquote><blockquote>Even details such as whether there are pets that need taken care of should someone need to go into hospital would be recorded, along with data which could even predict when care might be needed before a problem manifests in such a way that the health need becomes&nbsp;urgent.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of this programme, and the ethos behind it, is what Prof Crooks would like to see happen NHS Scotland as the digital revolution takes&nbsp;hold.</blockquote><p>Professor Crooks said: “Scotland’s medical model of care, that has served us very well for the past 150 years, is no longer fit for purpose in the 21st Century. We must move away from our existing approach to one where we listen to, activate, and empower our citizens to make better informed health and wellbeing choices supported by resources in their communities.</p><p>“The only way that can happen is through the appropriate use of digital technologies allied to an understanding of the lived experience of people in Scotland, using our expertise to co-design with them, and tailoring services to meet their personal and local circumstances. That’s the crux of the knowledge, skills and experience DHI has acquired over the past 10&nbsp;years.”</p><p>We, Mydex CIC, are proud to say we have been working with DHI over the past eight years to build the personal data infrastructure needed to make such an approach work. This infrastructure is now being used in an increasing number of projects.</p><p>The NHS faces relentless operational, front line and demographic challenges, compounded by increasing financial constraints. For example, the combined financial deficit in Scotland’s NHS Health Boards and Health &amp; Social Care Partnerships now approaching one billion pounds for 2024–2025. Yet service providers in the third, public and independent sectors still have to find a way to deliver the best possible&nbsp;service.</p><p>It’s possible for them to work together on this, to develop a common vision and delivery plan for the future that is inclusive, building human rights and operational efficiencies into how it works. The person centred data infrastructure that is now available helps achieve&nbsp;this.</p><p>Our next blogs explore in detail how this infrastructure works.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-positive-vision-for-health-af66990ca7e9">A Positive Vision for Health</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

 The Year of Broadening Adoption and Empowering Identities <p>As we navigate through 2024, Ontology embarks on a journey to redefine the landscape of digital identity and blockchain technology. Our roadmap is designed with a clear vision: to catalyze the widespread adoption of Decentralized Identity (DID) and enhance the seamless interaction across blockchain networks, advancing digital assets management technology. This year, we aim to deepen our engagement with the community, lead innovation, and offer unparalleled support to developers and users alike. Our commitment is to not only advance the technological infrastructure of Web3 but also to enrich the user experience and security that underpin the digital economy of the future, emphasizing data sovereignty and identity verification.</p> Providing All-Round Interoperability of Ontology Blockchain <p>As Ontology continues to cement its position as a leading public blockchain, our strategic focus remains steadfast on key application scenarios that include identity, data, and reputation management. This commitment drives our initiatives and innovations, ensuring that our technology not only meets but exceeds the evolving needs of our users and the broader blockchain community.</p> Integration with Goshen&nbsp;Network <p>Ontology is set to enhance its infrastructure significantly by incorporating Goshen Network’s Ethereum layer 2 and Bitcoin EVM layer, a strategic move aimed at providing a seamless interaction across EVM and Bitcoin blockchains. Through this integration, facilitated by the Ontology and Goshen Bridge, users will gain the ability to effortlessly manage and access their assets across diverse blockchain ecosystems. This initiative not only underscores Ontology’s dedication to fostering cross-chain interoperability but also positions Ontology’s Consensus Nodes to actively participate in Goshen’s governance, leveraging its unique mechanism to ensure a fluid, interoperable digital asset experience.</p> Strengthening Blockchain Security <p>In its unwavering commitment to security, Ontology is implementing stringent measures to safeguard its blockchain. This includes the establishment of strict confirming and proving procedures for all wrapped assets across blockchain interfaces, coupled with the introduction of a Slash mechanism. These measures are designed to fortify the Ontology blockchain against malicious threats, thereby providing a secure and trustworthy environment for conducting transactions and managing digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Expansion of ONT&nbsp;Staking <p>Ontology is expanding its staking ecosystem to be more inclusive and accessible through the introduction of the Naming Nodes Program and the launch of the stONT product. This expansion aims to streamline the staking process for both individual users and institutional partners, making it simpler for them to participate as stakers or node operators. By lowering the barriers to entry for ONT staking, Ontology enhances the overall security and participation within its network, fostering a more robust and engaged community.</p> Pushing DID Adoption &amp; Application  Enhancing DID Awareness <p>Ontology is amplifying its efforts to increase decentralized identity awareness by enhancing communication with pivotal DID entities such as DIF, Polygon ID, and Verax, who have joined as co-builders. This initiative aims to extend the reach of DID-related educational content, bringing a broader understanding of decentralized identity solutions across the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Support for ONT ID Integration <p>We are committed to providing comprehensive support across technical, marketing, business, and community aspects for projects integrating ONT ID, alongside our OWN infrastructure for enhanced data exchange and collaboration. Protocols like ONT Login, ONT TAG, and Mercury are made available as open-source tools, enabling seamless integration and fostering innovation within the decentralized identity space, ensuring robust identity verification processes without any additional charges.</p> Improving User Experience <p>The ONTO Wallet is undergoing significant updates to enhance its functionalities for digital assets management. By increasing inclusivity and interoperability with external protocols, such as domain providers, we aim to offer a superior user experience in managing IDs, VCs, and reputation, while also prioritizing data sovereignty. A robust loyalty and referral system is being developed to improve user retention, underlining the value of comprehensive digital identity management across various platforms.</p> ONTO Wallet as a Comprehensive DID&nbsp;Tool <p>The ONTO Wallet is evolving into an all-encompassing DID management tool, allowing users to manage their domains, IDs, VCs, and reputation across different chains and applications. This approach not only simplifies the management of digital identities but also enriches DIDs with additional utility, enabling users to access various task platforms like Galxe and TaskOn for credential management.</p> Enhancements to Orange&nbsp;Protocol <p>Orange Protocol is set to receive substantial updates, including the introduction of the Orange Points mechanism designed to incentivize user engagement and contribution. Integrating more Proof of Humanity (PoH) providers and launching reputation-related campaigns are steps towards activating users’ on-chain reputations and cultivating a more trustable Web3 community.</p> ONT ID Fund for Innovation <p>An ONT ID fund is being established to incentivize actions that optimize and promote the adoption of ONT ID. The fund will support projects based on their brand impact, existing user base, and their strategy for continuous growth, underscoring Ontology’s commitment to supporting innovation within the decentralized identity&nbsp;domain.</p> Building Global Community with Continuous Loyalty&nbsp;System  Global Expansion of Ontology Harbingers <p>Ontology is focused on expanding its Harbingers program worldwide, providing localized support to community members and fostering potential business collaborations. This global network plays a crucial role in growing the Ontology ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of community support and engagement.</p> Engaging Online Community Campaigns <p>Regular online community campaigns, including Weekly Discussion, Community Call, and Web3 Wonderings, are pivotal for keeping the community engaged and informed. These initiatives, hosted across X, Telegram, Discord, and other local social channels, ensure that the latest developments and updates within the Ontology ecosystem are widely shared and discussed.</p> Ontology Loyal Program Incentives <p>Encouraging active participation in the Ontology Loyal Program and related campaigns is a key strategy for building a loyal and engaged community. By offering diverse ways to earn Ontology Loyal NFT Plus and Ontology Collabs NFTs, we aim to reward community members for their contributions and engagement, fostering a sense of belonging and loyalty within the Ontology ecosystem.</p> Stay Connected with&nbsp;Ontology <p>Your insights, feedback, and participation are what drive us forward.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>

 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>
<p>They also plan to implement natural voice interfaces and personalized reminders.</p>
 The True Value of Data Ownership<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-true-value-of-data-ownership" title="Direct link to The True Value of Data Ownership">​</a> 
<p>Simon envisions a future where Kin takes full advantage of Web5's data ownership and cryptographic verification capabilities. He provided a futuristic example: After a year of personalized interaction, Kin could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> to serve as a digital assistant with verified authority on the user's behalf. Kin could share preferences with third parties like e-commerce websites with the user's permission.</p>
<p>"This is where owning and controlling your data suddenly becomes extremely valuable," Simon proclaims. Data ownership is not just about keeping your data private but having control over who you share your data with.</p>

<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one time passwords (OTP) </a>delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them? What features and functions would you want to prioritize and fund, or contribute engineering resources to help implement?</p><p>As an individual using IPFS from your desktop or through various apps, how do you want such an open network to function, and what should it prioritize?</p><p>There are a number of legal challenges, takedown requests, and content moderation topics that come up across public gateways. Should IPFS Mainnet supporters join forces to decide on how to handle some of these concerns across the commons network?</p><blockquote>This year, the IPFS and extended ecosystem is graduating to a more commons based approached, with many separate companies, foundations, and funding partners.<br><br>At ETH Denver we want to introduce the changes, and invite people to take part in supporting and governing large public commons projects like the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">ipfs.io</a> public gateway, and the Kubo IPFS node codebase.<br>​<br>We will have a presentation by Adin Schmahmann from IP Shipyard, IPFS Core Maintainer, to introduce <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/new-chapter">IP Shipyard’s New Chapter</a> and other existing and upcoming initiatives.<br><br>We will follow with a discussion of IPFS as Commons, welcoming IPFS operators, dapp builders, blockchain ecosystems, and others interested in the future of the IPFS commons. This will be a facilitated discussion and Q&amp;A, hosted by Boris Mann, Founder of Fission.</blockquote><p>If you're in Denver, you've still got time to join us for the <a href="https://lu.ma/6suk3oa5">IPFS Mainnet event today, Wed Feb 28th, 4pm MST</a>, otherwise we'll be sharing presentation slides and other follow up notes <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/ipfs-mainnet-at-ethdenver/17620">on the IPFS Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems. No need to rip and replace what’s been working for years.</p>



<p></p>



 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can affect credit union operations here.</a></p>



 




What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions — in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are excluded from the public sale of MATR. Sorry about that,&nbsp;folks.</p><p>==============================================================</p><p>At the end of January, Mattereum GmbH launched its token MATR* on Swarm, a German exchange regulated to the same level as a bank. As I write, prior to our big marketing push, it has already sold something in the region of $650k of tokens. This is the culmination of a long path that began, for Mattereum, back in 2017, but for me, much&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Nine years ago (almost to the day!) I started as launch coordinator for Ethereum, and I set out the big vision for it in Ethereum’s launch document <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains In Context</a>. It was nothing less than a new vision for the blockchain, a vision based around smart contracts. Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 is conventionally seen as the inflection point, the moment when everything changed, the moment when the blockchain became the future. I am not so sure, we’d definitely never seen anything like that before, but Bitcoin was weird money, and decided to stay as weird money, even though the prospect of the blockchain being able to do everything could be seen by the far-sighted from the start — Satoshi got it, it’s there in the original <a href="https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> — “Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect&nbsp;buyers”.</p><p>So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">Ethereum</a> happened. The key thing that you could do with Ethereum that you could not do with Bitcoin was smart contracts; you could use the blockchain as a computer to execute digital contracts that would allow it to do almost anything. This loosed the true potential of the blockchain on the world — the ability to create new kinds of property, beyond money itself. It is perhaps this that was the true inflection point. In a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-does-ether-100-mean-bb58522f781e">piece I wrote</a> when ETH hit $100 I described its origins as “a bunch of funny-looking villains pull together this remarkable piece of technology which, at the time, we thought was going to change the world”, and well, it kind of did, but maybe not how we envisaged it.</p><p>As I write this ETH has just hit $3500, the NFT craze, which needed Ethereum to function, has come and gone making a whole lot of people a bunch of money, then, just as quickly, losing it for them again. There have been scandals, frauds and rug pulls, and the entire reputation of the blockchain, particularly Ethereum, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">stank like a month-old kipper</a> for a while. But those of us with the long view know about the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a>. This describes how world-changing innovations undergo a steep innovation curve, create unsustainable bubbles, which burst, ruin a lot of people, become radioactively untouchable for a while, then have the sound, workable elements picked up by mature actors and built into solid, useful and profitable long term businesses. We saw it in the dotcom boom, we saw it in 1929 with the stock market, and even with the railway boom way back in the mid-19th century. Out of these came web 2.0, the modern financial system, and most countries’ transport infrastructure. And so it is with Ethereum. What we have seen so far may not have embodied the vision we had for Ethereum, but that vision was not&nbsp;lost.</p><p>I have kept that vision in sight and sat tight. Mostly, the Mattereum team are old, at least compared to other blockchain people, and have seen the Perez Cycle before; one of our team ran a top level domain in the early 2000s and I lived through the dotcom crunch. While bull markets turn to bear markets and back, and crypto winters come and go, we have had our eyes on long-term mature use cases. We have spent the time doing the hard, complicated, slow work that builds the machinery to make Ethereum everything it was supposed to be so that it has a long-term future.</p><p>If you wonder why the blockchain has not got greater traction, why it has just been the locus of fads, fancies and scams, it is because it hasn’t had a mechanism to connect it to the real world. It’s been like an engine revving in isolation, it needs the gearbox to connect it to the wheels so that it has grip on the road and the traction to actually get somewhere. Mattereum has been building that gearbox, the thing that gives the Ethereum blockchain a way of grasping the physical world by firmly and legally connecting it to RWA. That way it can achieve what it was always meant to do. The reason I left the Ethereum Foundation was that I saw that this is what was needing to be done and it was becoming increasingly clear that they were not going to do it, so I needed to. Now I have, through Mattereum.</p><p>But what is it exactly that I have done? What was it that took six years and millions of dollars of investment? Mattereum has built the digital and legal infrastructure that enables the sale and lease of physical property and other assets through smart contracts using Ethereum. To do this we have created the Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), which is a detailed product description of physical assets backed by legal warranties bundled together using smart contracts on the blockchain. With our partners at Swarm, we can now tokenize any asset a lawyer can recognise and fractionalize it too, and any asset or fraction of an asset comes with the Mattereum protections. This means that when you buy a real world asset token that has a MAP on Ethereum, you have unambiguous legal ownership of the linked physical asset. If you buy a token representing a gold bar, it enables you to turn up at the vault where the gold bar is stored and say “that specific gold bar there is mine” and have your claim accepted.</p><p>This is major — it is a potentially world-changing innovation.</p><p>Moreover, a MAP provides guarantees that the real world asset it describes is as claimed. If you buy a piece of real estate with a MAP that has been guaranteed to be in a certain condition and you turn up to find the roof leaks and the drains are blocked, you have the right to make a claim and be compensated. It is not just Mattereum that makes these promises, it is independent guarantors, and legal claims against them can be made in 172 jurisdictions worldwide — Mattereum’s legal infrastructure is built on UK common law provisions for digital commerce and is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions under international law. We help create a doubt-free environment for trade. We’ve started with gold, real estate, luxury goods, art, antiques, and other items where authenticity is particularly important, but ultimately our system could be used for everything. There are huge implications for this that I’ve explored in more depth <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">elsewhere</a>.</p><p>It’s easy to claim to put physical, real world stuff on chain, but it’s hard to prove that the stuff is real to a buyer on the other side of the world, and it’s even harder if that buyer is an AI (the Mattereum system also has important implications for enabling AI to connect to the physical world). Without the ability to prove that stuff is real, there’s no way to keep scammers out, and RWA scams will make the old NFT scams look trivial. Allow the scams to thrive and the long term viability of Ethereum as a global platform for trade will be doomed. Mattereum’s system squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>If you buy things like stock in major companies, say Facebook or Tesla, due diligence is built in, but for most other things, like real estate, you have to do that work for yourself before you buy, and it’s expensive. Diligence is the hard problem in almost all financial transactions.</p><p>Mattereum solves this; it is essentially a diligence facilitation company for Ethereum. Any transaction done on Ethereum for an asset with a MAP has the diligence done automatically.</p><p>We can do this for Mattereum customers, but we can also do it for other companies in the RWA space. Making it work took time and money (a lot of both); other companies putting RWAs on the blockchain don’t have to repeat that work, we can provide our system to them as a service, giving them a shortcut to secure and reliable tokenization and fractionalization.</p><p>Mattereum has built upon successive waves of innovation on the blockchain that have peaked and then crashed, building as more and more people get involved. At each step there are ten times the number of people involved than were in the previous wave, and each time that happens the story changes radically. Eventually the innovation reaches escape velocity and goes stratospheric, and, I believe, this is where we are&nbsp;now.</p><p>Our system has the potential to be the rails on which the future of commerce runs. Serious TradFi people are getting it; <a href="https://x.com/radarhits/status/1746155031265489197?s=46&amp;t=kMmiWeWpV1U1zyPrnuPkAA">Larry Fink from BlackRock Capital </a>has come out in favour of a tokenized future, saying that their great new horizon is tokenization of every real world financial asset, and Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, has followed him, <a href="https://twitter.com/EstateProtocol/status/1751673693141361095">saying</a> “everything of value in the world will eventually be a token”. The City of London, too, gets it, the world’s leading financial centre. The Lord Mayor, who heads the City, has set up his <a href="https://www.mainelli.org/?page_id=3704">Smart Economy Networks</a> project, which has tokenized assets as a major plank and actually names Mattereum as a key company in the network. Before all this, Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, head of the UK’s civil justice system, involved Mattereum in the development of the UK’s <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) as he <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">is a firm believer in the blockchain</a> as the future of commerce, and sees the opportunities offered by Mattereum’s innovations. Mattereum has gone on to be the first company to use the DDRR in their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past ten years we’ve gone from a single lone hero talking about building smart contracts into Bitcoin (Vitalik’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">MasterCoin</a>) to the leaders of TradFi insisting that blockchains, tokenization and similar are the future of&nbsp;finance.</p><p>We nailed this. Too early to know if we won or not, but back in 2015, the Ethereum team wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things. Now Mattereum is delivering on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the end it’s about the&nbsp;money.</p><p>How much&nbsp;money?</p><p>All of it: how much information is left offline these days in unscanned paper books and undigitized music? A few percent. What we are doing is like that, but with money and assets. We have the potential to be bigger than Visa; I had long conversations about Mattereum with Dee Hock, Visa’s founder, and he did not think this was ridiculous.</p><p>Ethereum is now hitting Early Adopters where institutions with real use cases stop trying to fit the technology into their existing technology stack, and start moving their assets on to Ethereum’s technology stack, Mattereum is here to guarantee that this works. This is the beginning of “TradFi” and “DeFi” merging into, well, just&nbsp;“Fi”.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went digital. That doesn’t happen&nbsp;twice.</p><p>We held back on issuing a token until now, until we were sure we were being lifted by an unstoppable rising tide, and the legal, licensing and regulatory environment were ready. We could have leapt onboard with one during the ICO goldrush with everyone else, but our strategic mindset said “wait”, and we were not wrong. With the mature use case for the blockchain that we were planning for now being understood by the serious players, now is the time, so the decision was taken to launch MATR, a token offering discounts on Mattereum’s products and services.</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to provide a legal structure for RWA operations on the blockchain so that when users buy a tokenized asset such as real estate or gold, the purchaser of the token unambiguously owns the connected physical asset, or a fraction of the physical asset if it has been fractionalized as well. As a result, it was particularly important for any token associated with the Mattereum Group to be constructed in a legally sound way that provides the protections for purchasers that many other tokens fail to do. Without such protections other token buyers are vulnerable to rug-pulls and other sharp (and illegal) practices. To do this, Mattereum’s chosen path was to incorporate a subsidiary in Germany (Mattereum GmbH) which could mint and sell the MATR token through Swarm, a fully regulated and licensed German exchange operating under the same regulations and to the same standards as TradFi banking institutions in Germany and so providing customers with equivalent protections.</p><p>This was not, perhaps, the simplest route, but it was the one that gave MATR the absolutely best protection. We believe we are the first group to issue a token through an exchange regulated under the same rules as banks, but we hope this paves the way for more people to do things the same way. It involved more lawyers and negotiation than other routes, but it works, and now we’ve done it we can help others do it too, adding assistance with token issue processes to Mattereum’s portfolio.</p><p>The <a href="https://mattereum.de/token-whitepaper/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum Discount Token White Paper</a> gives the exact formal details of how the MATR token works, but essentially it offers a discount on Mattereum fees for transactions with real world assets on chain, such as Onboarding Fees and Certifier Fees. Each token used reduces the fee by 1% and given that, in turn, onboarding fees are 1% of the assets’ selling price, for the kind of assets we’ll be onboarding, the discount received for using a token could be substantial. Let’s just have a look at how that would play out in a real transaction:</p><p>If a client wishes to onboard a $1m asset, the onboarding fee would be $10,000. If they use MATR tokens to reduce this fee, each token reduces the onboarding fee by 1% (subject to a maximum discount of USD $10,000), and a user can burn up to 50 tokens per asset. So for that $1m asset this means that burning the maximum of 50 tokens would result in a 50% reduction in the onboarding fee, or $5000. For that transaction each token would represent a cost saving of $100, and they are currently on sale* at $0.65 per token (going up in increments to $2.00 until the sale ends on 4 July — details are in the white&nbsp;paper).</p> We think this will be&nbsp;popular.

 Crisis and/of&nbsp;Property <p>The concept of property is deeply embedded in our modern socio-economic systems. So much so, that it is often viewed as sacrosanct, a near-natural law-like means to distribute agency, power, and freedom, breaking away from the dominance of the few and old empires. Yet, property has simultaneously been part of a pathway of dispossession, violence, environmental degradation and the exclusion of vast and growing numbers of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Where property seemed immutable, the ground is shifting, for better or worse. Property has been an information processing and structuring mechanism through which we have governed our world by means of abstraction, simplification, and dominion over. Faced with today’s unprecedented complexity and entanglement of risks, externalities, and value creation, this theory of governance is falling&nbsp;short.</p><p>Indeed, the very paradigms underpinning our property institutions have become unavailable to think with, technically, materially and ethically:</p>  Objectification: The existing paradigm of objectification of land, nature, labor and information has obscured intrinsic interdependence  Extraction: The detachment of property rights from embodied responsibilities of stewardship had caused systemic negative externalities  Centralization: The optimization of abstract, exclusive rights has led to growing concentration of means of production and the benefits derived from&nbsp;them  Control: Top-down regulatory practices have failed to manage complex conceptual systems of value creation and extraction, and their externalities and&nbsp;impacts  <p>Interestingly, the structural failure of existing property systems to respond adequately to many of our critical contemporary challenges — be it the housing crisis, COVID-19, or Generative AI — is opening up windows of opportunity for large-scale transformation. What is emerging is a <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/fc2ab4ede8e254491b3160db3fed49d060634671.pdf">new theory of change</a> where increasing and cascading crises of various forms that will have profound and tragic effects, will also create conditions to open up new imaginative and political space for alternative approaches. Preparing for these moments, and developing proactive strategies, is critical.</p> Launching Property &amp; Beyond&nbsp;Lab <p>That’s why at Dark Matter Labs we are launching <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a>: a new part of our ecosystem focused on developing the building blocks for futures of property and ownership. Property &amp; Beyond Lab aims to build a diverse and proactive portfolio of alternative forms of property, from collective ownership of land to self-owning houses, land, and&nbsp;cameras.</p>Property &amp; Beyond Lab&nbsp;website<p>Some of the questions we’re exploring:</p>  How might new conceptions of property reflect and embed a more entangled notion of the&nbsp;human?  How might we move beyond control-oriented mechanisms towards ennobling systems, leveraging distributed protocols to recognize complexity and respond to contextual needs and&nbsp;nuance?  How might we move from commoning externalities towards outcome-based governance and long-term guardianship?  How might we move beyond centralization towards distributed and peer-to-peer permissioning, verification and accountability systems?  How might we braid alternative paradigms such as Indigenous governance and rights-of-nature with property institutions?  How might we create the enabling infrastructures that allow for alternative property mechanisms to be financed and adopted at&nbsp;scale?   Our portfolio <p>To help us prepare for deepening and emerging crises, we need to delve deeper into the multifaceted challenges of property and build shared understanding and urgency. We are therefore <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool">launching a digital tool</a> that maps critical global risks and their interplay with property and ownership.

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have sparked a revolution in the ownership and exchange of unique digital assets. This innovation has birthed a burgeoning market where creators and collectors can engage in buying, selling, and trading. However, traditional NFTs, often referred to as “collectible NFTs,” are heavily influenced by market conditions, leading to volatility in values and, more importantly, volatility in interest.</p><p>In response, we propose the concept of “utility NFTs,” which offer a more practical and versatile approach. Unlike collectible NFTs, utility NFTs are issued and managed by enterprises or organizations for their customers and users, serving as a means of interaction. In this article, the first of a series showcasing Aergo’s future strategies and initiatives, we’ll unveil our roadmap for the rest of the year, packed with some significant updates.</p><p>Collectible vs Functional</p><p>Initially, many collectible NFTs primarily revolved around speculative trading. Although they can be widely accepted and utilized in dynamic sectors including gaming, the liquidity dynamics within NFT marketplaces tend to align with market conditions, posing challenges for enterprises seeking to integrate them directly into their services or products. Moreover, collectible NFTs are commonly associated with artistic and creative endeavors such as visual art, music, theater, and literature, further complicating efforts to sustain long-term value.</p><p>In contrast, utility NFTs position themselves with a real-world business component. The most distinguishable use case is probably in identification, where uniquely issued tokens offer a secure and reliable means of verifying individuals’ identities. They serve as a digital representation of one’s identity for premium membership and a gateway for accessing exclusive content, including the metaverse and other Web3 platforms.</p><p>Why Aergo Focuses on the&nbsp;Segment?</p><p>It is important to lure individual users through a user-friendly environment and B2C marketing for the organic growth of a platform. However, we have shifted our focus more towards the enterprise side of the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Enterprise-led NFT segment offers a unique opportunity as it automatically brings in loyal users and fosters a strong foundation for long-term collaboration and mutual growth. Additionally, enterprise involvement often lends credibility and stability to the NFT ecosystem.</p>Enterprise-led NFT Growth Trajectories<p>One example of Aergo’s enterprise-led NFT initiative is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/members//samsung-members-nft/">Samsung Members regional NFT in Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania</a>. Samsung Members NFT serves as a key enabling holders to unlock exclusive experiences and rewards with Samsung. Samsung leverages NFTs as a gateway to its imaginary universe, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ph/members/whats-new/new-drop-the-epic-club-nft-collection/">the Kaleidoscope</a>.</p><p>The number total count of unique digital assets(NFTs) created is gradually increasing. The recent transaction spike on Feb 21st is also linked to this initiative. While specifics are under NDAs and cannot be disclosed yet, it’s evident that more enterprises, as well as government affiliates and agencies, are venturing into the NFT market. We will reveal more details for various projects as they progress, sharing insights into our ongoing initiatives and the exciting developments ahead</p><p>Despite challenging market conditions, Aergo has made significant strides in establishing itself within the enterprise blockchain market. With a focus on efficiency and enterprise-friendliness, Aergo, Blocko, and CCCV are expanding to establish more use cases in the enterprise-led NFT initiative through strategic partnerships driven by the increasing demand for innovation within this&nbsp;segment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">Digital Assets as a Gateway: Expanding Enterprise-led NFT Initiative</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey. Check if your domain is BIMI ready using this free <a href="https://redsift.com/tools/bimi">online tool</a> from our partner Red Sift.</p>
<p>As Google and Yahoo make email authentication mandatory, industry-wide adoption of these practices is crucial. Businesses can ensure compliance for improved email deliverability and overall security.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape. There will be opportunities to learn about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5687/3">Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World</a>, to get insights into <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5568/1">How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization</a>, to get answers the question: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5504">Can you trust AI in IAM?</a>, to find out <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5509/1">How Identity Forces Are Making Enterprises Rethink Identity</a>, and much, much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on identity in the context of IoT, IIoT, and IoMT. These included presentations that considered how to make these identities and networks secure by design in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/safeguarding-iot-eic2023">Safeguarding IoT/OT/IIoT with Autonomous Networking</a>; how self-sovereign identity (SSI) enables decentralized identity and access management for things in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iot-with-decentralized-iam-eic2023">Empowering the Vision of the IoT with Decentralized IAM</a>; and the implications of applying SSI to IoT in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ssi-meets-iot-eic2023">When SSI meets IoT – challenges and opportunities</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Mydex, we’ve grown wary of ‘market’ talk. People often talk about ‘the market’ for this or for that, as if they have a clear, precise understanding of something definite and real. But the deeper we dig, the more we discover the opposite is usually&nbsp;true.</p><p>In fact, we’ve concluded that thinking about economic challenges and opportunities in terms of markets where firms trade things for money prices is, more often than not, a good way of not understanding what’s going on and an even better way of not seeing opportunities that lie within our grasp. Market myopia blinds far more than it illuminates.</p><p>To rise to the challenges our society and economy now face, we need to escape market myopia. This blog explains Mydex’s thinking on this issue and what we are doing to escape&nbsp;it.</p> The information challenge <p>For a market to happen, money needs to change hands as ownership of something is handed over from one person to another. For the exchange to happen, a money price needs to be put on this ‘something’.</p><p>Friedrich Hayek was the high priest of market talk. Writing in the mid-1940s, he noted that to make good decisions and execute plans effectively, people and organisations need good information. Money prices are, he argued, the key source of such information.</p><p>Hayek’s bete noir was state socialism. When he pointed out that central planners could never, ever, collect and crunch the amount of information they needed to make and implement a good economic plan, he thrust an intellectual stake into state socialism’s heart.</p><p>“There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts,” he wrote in his book The Road To Serfdom. “It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them, that decentralisation becomes imperative.”</p><p>Markets, he argued, are the best way to achieve such decentralisation. But such decentralisation generates a ‘division of knowledge’ between people, that acts as a potential source of fragmentation. It creates the need for a system of coordination which brings the separate efforts of decentralised parts together, to create a greater whole. This coordination can be achieved, he argued, by “the price system”&nbsp;… “which leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the facts that only they can&nbsp;know.”</p><p>Hayek’s was a brilliant argument that helped set the course of Government economic policies across the world to this day. But it was and remains irredeemably flawed.</p><p>Price changes, he argued, can and should “register all the relevant changes in circumstances&nbsp;…[to] provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions”. This “enables entrepreneurs, by watching the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities to those of their fellows.”</p> Why markets never work as&nbsp;intended <p>Trouble is, the one thing price changes can never do is register all the relevant changes in circumstances that provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions.</p><p>Here are three reasons&nbsp;why.</p> Externalities <p>An ‘externality’ is economists’ jargon for a cost or benefit that is incurred by an entity that is ‘external’ to a transaction between two&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Pollution is a classic example. A producer spills noxious substances into a river. Not having to clean up his own waste means he is able to keep his costs (and therefore his prices) low. But these costs haven’t disappeared. They have just been passed on to somebody else — costs not recognised by the money price that has been paid by the producer’s customer.</p><p>Externalities aren’t always negative. They may be positive. For example, if a big new employer sets up in a town, the new enterprise attracts all sorts of other services related to and surrounding its enterprise. The result is extra employment on top of the enterprise itself, in services like food outlets, taxis and hotels for&nbsp;example.</p><p>In his writings, Hayek was well aware of the importance of externalities. “The main condition on which the usefulness of the system of competition and private property depends,” he wrote, is “that the owner benefits from all the useful services rendered by his property and suffers all the damages caused to others by its use”. (Our emphasis).</p><p>If there is a ‘divergence’ between the two, he continued, “whenever this divergence becomes important some method other than competition [the market] may have to be&nbsp;found”.</p><p>Oh dear. In making this statement, Hayek thrust an intellectual stake into the heart of his own arguments, because the way modern economies work means it is never possible for all the benefits and all of the costs of the owner’s services to be reflected in the money price. Which means that, using Hayek’s own logic, “some method other than competition” [the market] needs to be&nbsp;found.</p> Internalities <p>‘Externalities’ (both positive and negative) are one reason why the price system can never capture all the information needed for economic decision making - because externalities are ubiquitous. But ‘externalities’ are just one example of a much bigger challenge of information loss.</p><p>The genius of a money price is that it allows you to compare the values of completely incommensurate items: a pair of socks to a flight to Paris to a pizza. That’s wonderful and incredible. It’s why money prices have proved to be so&nbsp;useful.</p><p>But this genius comes at a very high price: a catastrophic loss of information. The only way it becomes possible to use one, single measure to compare diverse things like pairs of socks, flights to Paris and pizzas is to ignore everything about them which is not directly comparable. Which is&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… virtually everything, including their unique and special qualities, their utility (e.g. what they will actually be used for) and the real-world costs of producing them.</p><p>By ‘real-world costs’ we don’t mean anything measured by money. We mean physical, operational reality. Amount of time spent doing something. Amount of energy used doing it. Amount of resources used up. These are the real costs of production — costs that the money price&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Hang on a second! Good economic decision-making depends on information about two crucial things: real-world utility and real-world costs. But these are precisely the two types of information that money-prices discard. People may use money price as a proxy for these things but, it turns out, the result is a distorting, obfuscating proxy. A blurring lens that crowds out other useful information, not than a clarifying one.</p><p>‘Internalities’ is one way to describe information about the real world utilities and costs that money price ignores. These ‘internalities’ go right to the heart of wealth creation. Why? While externalities relate to impacts on third parties not directly involved in either the production or consumption of the good in question, internalities relate to the costs and benefits of those directly involved.</p><p>By discarding all information relating to real world costs and benefits, to focus all attention on just one comparison point — the money price — the price system actually renders everything needed to make good economic decisions (and to take effective economic actions) invisible.</p><p>So, for example, if an organisation makes all its decisions based on money measures, e.g. budgets, ‘profits’ and bank balances, it is not using any of the real-world information it needs to actually understand what it itself is doing, or how to improve its operations. By focusing only on ‘what we can afford’ rather than <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘what we can actually do</a>’ — such organisations routinely end up making counterproductive decisions and taking counterproductive actions.</p><p>Carbon emissions are a good example. Twenty years ago, if you had asked ‘what are the carbon emissions of this product or that service?’ you would have been met by a blank stare. People hadn’t even thought of collecting this data, never mind working out how best to do it. Yet, now, twenty years later, many people think an item’s carbon emission is its most important metric — a metric that money price does not, and cannot,&nbsp;measure.</p><p>The catastrophic information loss perpetrated by the price system means that Hayek’s vision of markets registering ‘all the relevant changes’ in circumstances and ‘providing a reliable guide for the individual’s actions’ can never happen. Instead, it results in informationally emaciated organisations operating within an informationally emaciated economy, lacking the informational nutrients they need about real world time, energy and materials costs and real world benefits (utility) — lacking the information they need to make better decisions and to implement these decisions better. That ignore what ‘we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p> Transaction costs <p>Externalities and ‘internalities’ represent a fundamental problem for the price system. But there’s more: the costs of operating the price system itself. This is the arena of transaction costs.</p><p>Many years ago the economist Ronald Coase described transaction costs as ‘market-ing’ costs — e.g. the costs of taking something to market. This is what he&nbsp;wrote.</p><blockquote>“In order to carry out a market transaction it is necessary to discover who it is that one wishes to deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on what terms, to conduct negotiations leading up to a bargain, to draw up the contract, to undertake the inspection needed to make sure that the terms of the contract are being observed, and so&nbsp;on.”</blockquote><p>Without an understanding of what transaction costs are, and what effects they have, he continued, it is “impossible to understand the working of the economic system”. He was absolutely right. Far from being an automatic guarantee of efficiency, the market-isation of economically productive activities can simply add multiple layers of extra, burdensome red&nbsp;tape.</p><p>Two important things about transaction costs&nbsp;are:</p><p>a) that the particular transaction costs generated by each item are often very difficult to isolate or measure. So they tend to get lost in blanket accounting terms such as ‘overheads’. Once again, money prices don’t represent these costs accurately.</p><p>b) the very act of putting a price on something — of ‘market-ing’ — generates many extra costs in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>You can see this if you compare the cost structure of the UK health system to the American insurance-based health system (where everything has to have a price put on&nbsp;it).</p><p>In the American system, physicians spend an average of 19 hours a week dealing with the administration of insurance claims. Administration accounts for over 27% of all costs. The result is a country with the highest health care costs in the world but among the worst outcomes. In comparison, the NHS, for all its ills, is a paragon of efficiency, partly because it avoids the (hidden) transaction costs of putting a price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p> Market-speak as a confusion engine <p>Hayek was right when he said “some method” other than the market “may have to be found” if money prices do not capture all the information people and organisations need to make decisions. When advocating markets as the solution to socialism’s information deficit, he simply advocated another system that creates even worse information deficits. Western societies have been yo-yoing between different variants of these two flawed solutions ever&nbsp;since.</p><p>To rise to the social and economic challenges nations now face, we need to free ourselves of market myopia and address the information deficit challenge. At Mydex, we are doing our bit — by demonstrating what ‘some method other than the market’ could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Externalities People mesmerised by market-speak assume that the test of an organisation’s success is in how much money it makes: its profitability. But often a good way to improve profitability is to simply dump costs on other people, like the river polluter. Mydex does not exist to maximise money profits. Sure, to survive within today’s institutional frameworks we have to earn enough money to cover our costs. But we exist to maximise positive externalities — to create social and economic benefits for others that don’t flow back to&nbsp;us.</p><p>For people mesmerised by the money-price-market mindset, this is dumbfounding.</p><p>Internalities People who focus only on money prices and money costs lose awareness of all the information they are discarding (so can’t use). They have a huge blindspot, but they don’t even know they have it. We at Mydex are working to fill this hole and repair the damage it causes. Our data sharing infrastructure is all about information replenishment, making critical informational nutrients available (in our case, personal data) so that both people and organisations can make better decisions and implement these decisions better. We are doing what Hayek said needed to be done — but which his price system failed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Transaction costs Everything we do is about stripping away the many layers of excess costs that are generated by attempts to put a money price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p><p>These are just a few examples. There are&nbsp;more.</p><p>Markets are famously amoral, whereas humans judge each others’ behaviour on all manner of moral grounds. Markets have a one dimensional approach to human rights —recognising only property rights. Whereas humans recognise <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">a wide diversity of&nbsp;rights</a>.</p><p>Markets can only work if it is possible for one side to fully and completely ‘own’ the thing that’s being traded and to fully transfer this ownership to somebody else. If this can’t happen, a market can’t happen. But personal data isn’t legally owned by the organisations that collect or the individuals it relates to. So with our data sharing infrastructure, the question of ‘ownership’ of the data doesn’t even come up — so the question of ‘creating a market’ doesn’t come up&nbsp;either.</p><p>The best way of realising data’s value is to share it. So that is what we do — enable data sharing. This has nothing to do with ownership, and therefore nothing to do with ‘markets’. Nevertheless, enabling such data sharing helps unleash enormous economic value, generating real world utility and reducing real world costs — the things the price system&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Also (by the way), markets never actually create any value in the first place. All a market can ever do is shuffle title deeds to bits of value that have already been created elsewhere — not in a market but by a producer. The focus of our work at Mydex isn’t to shuffle title deeds to value that already exists, but to enable the creation of new value — helping people and organisations use data to do better things in better&nbsp;ways.</p> Conclusion <p>The era of digital data opens up an epoch-defining opportunity to address the informational deficits created by externalities, internalities and transaction costs. But as soon as people try to shoe-horn their activities back into the price-market system, they risk squandering this opportunity&nbsp;. It was this price-market system that generated these informational deficits in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The money-price-market mindset is the source of a dazzling, mesmerising mirage — a mental straitjacket — that obscures peoples’ vision of how the world really works and how to act effectively within it. It renders them unable to see what’s right before them, in front of their&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>We don’t dislike market-talk because we are swivel-eyed ideologues. We dislike it because we are practitioners. Our focus is on what actually works. On how to get stuff done in the real world, not a parallel symbolic universe.</p><p>When one sets market myopia aside to look at the world afresh, suddenly enormous social and economic opportunities become visible. Opportunities to do existing things much better. Opportunities to do new things that weren’t possible to do before. Mydex is making such opportunities real in one area — personal data. Our next blogs will focus on exactly how our infrastructure enables these opportunities to be realised.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/escaping-market-myopia-9a3669014dcd">Escaping Market Myopia</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the different types of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover the steps that one woman is taking to expose romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>



 How IDnow helps prevent fraud. 



<p>IDnow offers comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to safeguard against various types of fraud, including social engineering, fake IDs, identity fraud, and much more. Our automated document verification and biometric checks, including selfie and face match, verify users’ identities with precision, while our passive liveness detection feature adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that genuine customers are verified seamlessly. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also offer an expert-assisted video verification process, where trained professionals who verify users’ documents and ask security and fraud related questions looking for any signs of suspicious behavior or social engineering attempts. Through real-time intervention and questioning, our experts can detect and prevent fraudulent activities effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow also regularly runs education and awareness sessions to help clients and their customers recognize and respond to social engineering threats. By combining advanced technology, expert insights, and proactive strategies, IDnow is committed to helping businesses mitigate the risks associated with rising fraud attempts and protect both their reputation and their customers’ trust.</p>

             February 2024   
	 
		 
			 Why Do Asset Managers, Like BlackRock, Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy development is BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization, heralding it as the logical progression beyond cryptocurrency spot ETFs. In March 2023, just one month after our initial newsletter release, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-fomc-interest-rate-decision-march-2024/card/blackrock-launches-first-tokenized-fund-on-ethereum-blockchain-nzDSJjH5mEijUzKO24T4">BlackRock made waves by debuting its tokenized asset fund named ‘BUIDL’ on the Ethereum network</a>. This marks a significant milestone for the industry, given BlackRock’s status as one of the world’s largest asset managers, embracing tokenization and a public blockchain. It sets a precedent likely to be emulated throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>About Making Data Better episode 9, <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">“The Bigger Step: Want a Single Digital ID?”</a></p>
 The presumption of a singular ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

   Moving towards a passwordless future is crucial for cybersecurity. So many high-profile breaches highlight the vulnerability of relying on passwords. Embracing passkeys, digital credentials tied to user accounts, and applications, offers a more secure and user-friendly alternative.

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Deletion Activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard deletion activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore activity &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Group &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore user  &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore application &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete administrative unit &nbsp;</p>


<p>(hard delete not possible) &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Administrative Unit &nbsp;</p>




<p>Remove service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard delete service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore service principal &nbsp;</p>




<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>
