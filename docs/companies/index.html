  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>I am often asked “does using a cloud service alter risk?” I always reply to this question with “well it depends”. Every organization has its own set of circumstances, and the answer needs to take these into account. It is also important to think about how the responsibility for security is shared between the service provider and the customer. This blog outlines the core business risks and what organizations need to consider.</p>
 Business Risks 
<p>While much discussion focusses on the technical risks, at the business level there are three distinct cyber risks, and using cloud services can have an impact on all of these.</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – the more organizations depend upon their IT services, the greater the impact any service outage or cyber incident will have. 
 Data breaches – data is now the most important business asset, and any loss of intellectual property or sensitive and regulated data will have a serious impact. 
 Compliance failure – organizations are now faced with a wide range of obligations coming from a tidal wave of regulation and legislation. Failure to comply with these will lead to sanctions. 
 
 IT Service Infrastructure 
<p>Poorly secured service infrastructure can result in all of the above business risks, and securing that infrastructure against all the potential risks is challenging. The large cloud service providers have the skills and resources to secure their infrastructure to a level beyond that possible for many enterprises. <br>For example, many small businesses run their IT services in environments with poor physical security. They may have little or no control over physical access or protection against fire and floods, and disruptions to the power supply or communications networks. This is described eloquently in a presentation by Mark Evans entitled: The reasons why RLB moved to the cloud. All the major cloud services provide their services from datacentres with strong controls over all of those aspects.&nbsp; <br>However, there is still a residual risk because <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU">some cloud services have been impacted</a> by disruptions, and the customer always needs to consider this.</p>
 Data Confidentiality 
<p>Data is the most important business asset of the modern enterprise and needs to be protected against unauthorized access and changes. Its confidentiality and integrity can be compromised while it is in transit, in storage, and being processed, and using cloud services places all three of these outside of the customer’s direct control. <br>Organizations must evaluate these risks based on the sensitivity of their data and ensure that it is appropriately protected both on premises as well as in the cloud. Organizations using cloud services should protect their sensitive and regulated data using certified strong encryption algorithms and implement strong controls to protect the encryption keys. Cloud services must provide capabilities to help their customers protect their data as well as supporting the various technologies that the customers may adopt.</p>
 Data Resilience 
<p>Loss of access to your business data would have a severe impact. The prevalence of ransomware attacks has emphasized the need for data resilience. In addition, the changes in working patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic have also increased organizational dependency on cloud services.&nbsp; <br>There is a temptation to believe that the use of a cloud service removes the need for the customer to consider the resilience of their data. The responsibility for data held in cloud services is shared between the tenant and the service provider, and there are many situations where the tenant is responsible for the resilience of their data. For example, while many cloud services promise very high levels of data resilience, these do not cover the data being deleted by the customer. <br>Whether or not you use a cloud service you need to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80762/cloud-backup-and-disaster-recovery">back up your data</a> and have a<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/incident-response-management"> tested disaster recovery plan</a>.</p>
 Service Access Management 
<p>Controlling which people and which devices can access your assets is a fundamental security control. It is your responsibility to control access to your business services and data, whether or not, they are held in the cloud. This is an essential part of a Zero Trust approach. <br>Virtualized services such as those delivered from the cloud add a new challenge in this area. The virtual service elements need access to each other and the service infrastructure, and failure to manage this can lead to data breaches. An example of this led to a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/capital-one-to-pay-190m-settlement-in-data-breach-linked-to-seattle-woman/#:~:text=Capital%20One%20Financial%20agreed%20to,and%20stole%20their%20personal%20information.">data breach and a large financial penalty</a>. <br>Many organizations have mature processes and technologies in place to manage access to their on-premises services. However, these may not be well integrated with their use of cloud services. This is especially important in the area of privilege management.</p>
 Privilege Management 
<p>Managing IT services uses <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80636/privileged-access-management">accounts with privileged access</a>, and it is vital to control these. These accounts are the targets of cyber attackers – since they provide a route into the organization’s IT infrastructure. They can be misused by insiders, and even a simple mistake can have a severe impact on the business-critical service. <br>The cloud service provider needs these accounts to manage their service and there are concerns that these could be used to access the cloud customers’ assets. In particular, there are concerns that governments could legally demand that the cloud service provider turn over their customers’ data. This is effectively the risk underlying the Schrems II judgement.&nbsp; <br>In addition, where many departments with a large organization use the same cloud service, there will be many local administrators. The scope of these administrators’ privileges should be limited to prevent malice or mistakes from affecting other parts of the service.</p>
 Complexity 
<p>The more complex the system, the more difficult it may be to protect. One argument for using a cloud service is that it provides a consistent environment and together with application modernization using containers it reduces complexity. Unfortunately, most organizations now have a hybrid environment using multiple clouds as well as on premises delivery of business applications. <br>This hybrid environment is even more complex because each cloud has its own security model and associated tools. According to the <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR">Cloud Migration Stats - 2022 Flexera State of the Cloud Report</a> the top challenges are trustworthiness with security, risk and compliance as well as cost management. These challenges stem from the added complexity from the multiple environments.&nbsp; <br>Organizations need to adopt a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/security-fabric-modernizes-cybersecurity">security fabric</a> paradigm to assist with this complexity.</p>
 Transparency 
<p>For highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals the issue is transparency of cloud service controls. In these industries, it essential to be able to prove the existence and effectiveness of controls to demonstrate compliance. Currently it is not practical for the large CSPs to allow tenants to audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations. This is an inhibitor to the take up of cloud services in these sectors. <br>Cloud service providers will need to provide much greater transparency around their controls. This should be done in a way that allows an organization using the service to map both their own controls and the controls in the service to their compliance obligations. This should ideally be automated, for example through APIs, in a way that allows compliance to be monitored in near real time. Some cloud vendors are moving towards this to meet <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/a-sovereign-cloud-is-about-more-than-just-privacy">cloud sovereignty </a>obligations.</p>
 Summary 
<p>The business risks associated with the use of cloud services depend upon several factors. The cloud is only one service delivery model in today’s complex hybrid, multi cloud IT environment. Organizations should consider at least the aspects described above in their own context. KuppingerCole can provide advisory services to help find the best approach for your organization.

 Keeping abreast of the different EU online gambling rules and requirements can be confusing, time-consuming, and incredibly expensive. Here’s how IDV solutions can help organizations easily follow multiple countries’ compliance regulations. 



<p>The popularity of online gambling continues to rise, despite the introduction of diverse and increasingly complicated regulations, and severe risks surrounding identity fraud.</p>



<p>In the UK, it comprises nearly <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/taking-a-more-in-depth-look-at-online-gambling">40% of the overall gambling market</a>, while in Europe online gambling is growing at <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/behind-the-success-of-the-growing-european-online-gambling-market-301187049.html">around 10% per year</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/resource-post/european-online-gambling-key-figures-2021-edition/">European Betting &amp; Gaming Association (EBGA)</a>, the market value of online gambling is expected to reach more than €29.3 billion by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>The recent increase in online gambling can be explained by a) the Covid effect, increasing the time people spend online, and b) <a href="https://1883magazine.com/biggest-european-casino-trends-for-2022/">technological advancements</a> that enable gamblers to bet anytime, anywhere.</p>



<p>With the Qatar World Cup 2022 coming up, and hundreds of new online casinos opening every single day, the rapid increase in online gambling shows no signs of slowing.</p>



<p>However, gambling operators have a balancing act to handle when it comes to offering frictionless onboarding processes, maintaining high conversion rates, and meeting all licensing requirements.</p>



 Regulations, risks, and rewards 



<p>As there is no uniform legislation in the EU that governs gambling services, each member state is autonomous and free to regulate how they see fit. For example, some countries allow all types of gambling, while others <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe">restrict certain forms</a> such as only permitting poker or casino games, for example.</p>



<p>Keeping abreast of regulatory differences can be confusing, time-consuming, and expensive. Some of the most common gambling regulations concern age limits, which means verifying the age of players is essential in preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>. There are also specific national and regional laws that gaming operators must follow. Find out more in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">overview of both the EU &amp; UK Online Gambling Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>The rewards for capitalizing on this growing market are extraordinary (an industry expected to be worth over <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460420/0/en/Online-Gambling-Betting-Market-Worth-USD-172-23-Billion-by-2030-Growth-Size-Share-Revenue-Drivers-Trends-Opportunities-Challenges-Top-Players-Regional-Analysis-Types-Applications.html#:~:text=Online%20Gambling%20%26%20Betting%20Market%20Worth%20USD%20172.23%20Billion">US$172 billion by 2030</a>), however, the risks are high as well.</p>



<p>As with many online platforms, online gambling poses an increased risk of fraud and security breaches than traditional gambling as criminals have set their sights on this industry. They have been known to set up fake online casinos or hack the mainline casinos to steal sensitive information.</p>



<p>There are also additional social responsibility concerns with online gambling, as it is considered to be a <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/new-study-shows-online-gambling-more-addictive-casino-gambling">much more addictive</a> form of gambling, due to the increased likelihood of it turning into a habitual part of a consumer’s everyday life, like watching television.</p>



<p>Online gambling can also be used to launder money, with criminal gangs choosing online platforms to transfer money anonymously.</p>



<p>Operators must therefore adhere to online gambling regulations to not only protect their customers, but their organization from being exploited for criminal purposes. If they do not, they run the very real risk of fines, or even being banned from the marketplace.</p>



<p>Commenting on the recent <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/online-operator-leovegas-fined-gbp1-2-million">£1.32 million fine</a> of gambling operator, LeoVegas, Leanne Oxley, Gambling Commission Director of Enforcement and Intelligence, said, “We identified this through focused compliance activity, and we will continue to take action against other operators if they do not learn the lessons our enforcement work is providing.</p>



<p>“This case is a further example of operators failing to protect customers and failing to be alive to money laundering risks within their business.”</p>



<p>LeoVegas was found to have exhibited social responsibility failures, including not setting an enforced 45-minute break following six hours of use, and anti-money laundering failures, such as financial triggers for anti-money laundering reviews being too high.</p>



 







 Need for speed 



<p>With so many regulatory risks associated with online gambling, it is understandable if gambling operators decide to cash in their chips and focus on a different line of business.</p>



<p>Businesses that do enter the online gambling market, and comply with regulations, are also often plagued by sluggish UI, and poor customer experience. In fact, <a href="https://egr.global/compliance/news/report-up-to-30-of-online-gambling-customers-abandon-sign-up-process/">research</a> shows that 30% of online gamblers have abandoned the onboarding process when registering a new account with a gambling website due to its complicated sign-up processes.</p>



<p>The importance of offering a fast and smooth, multi-jurisdictional, and KYC-compliant onboarding experience cannot be overstated. As every potential customer needs to be verified before being allowed to gamble, players will no doubt flock to the website or gambling platform that can verify their information the quickest. This need for speed is becoming increasingly important in both the KYC, and online gambling arenas. If player onboarding is too complicated, or has too many hurdles, organizations run a real risk of <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/online-gambling-authentication-security-digital-identification/">significant drop-off</a>.</p>



 How to leverage IDV and KYC for a better and safer online gambling experience 



<p>Although it may seem overwhelming, implementing a robust KYC procedure should be seen as an opportunity to offer a better and safer customer experience, and the first step in a productive working relationship between an ID verification company and online gambling operator.</p>



<p>This partnership can help operators meet the many challenges associated with verifying customers’ identities, while ensuring their users practice <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gaming</a>. It can also help in perhaps one of the most crucial aims of IDV: fraud prevention.</p>



<p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">the UK saw an increase of 43% in online gambling fraud</a>, and, since fraudulent gambling activity spikes during major sporting events, now is the time to implement a KYC procedure, before the Qatar World Cup 2022.</p>



<p>IDnow offers a seamless onboarding process, reducing verification times and increasing compliance with all major European regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, for example, uses artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents, with a key focus on security.</p>



<p>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s solutions have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages. IDnow can be trusted to deliver security, support, engagement with regulators, and the prospect of global scalability.</p>



<p>Leveraging IDV and KYC will allow gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience, which is a win-win, for the business and the consumer.</p>

<p>The work of Mydex CIC has been recognised by the Community Interest Company Regulator in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-interest-companies-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022/cic-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022">latest Annual&nbsp;Report</a>.</p><p>The report notes how CICs have grown in vision and ambition, demonstrated resilience over the pandemic and branched out into many new and unexpected fields. Some, including Mydex, are now thinking at an international level.</p><p>To highlight these developments the Report also includes case studies that illustrate this expanding vision and ambition. One of them is from Mydex CIC. It&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>Mydex CIC will be turning 15 years old this year. In our time, many people have been surprised to discover we are a CIC as we don’t fit their expectations of what a ‘normal’ CIC looks like, for many&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, our mission revolves around digital technologies and, specifically, personal data. Our goal is to empower citizens with their own data by providing them with personal data stores that enable them to collect, use and share their own data independently of the organisations that traditionally collect data about us. We operate at the cutting edge of new technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, unlike many CICs which operate locally, to fulfil our mission we need to operate at scale — providing personal data stores to every citizen in the country&nbsp;… and, as we grow, across many countries. Our ambitions are both national and international.</blockquote><blockquote>Thirdly, we don’t just provide front line services. We are building data storage and sharing infrastructure that could become a part of how the entire economy works. Our mission is long-term, unfolding over decades, not just&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the way we do good is multifaceted. We don’t only help individuals protect their privacy; we enable social inclusion, use data to tackle social problems such as poverty, and redress the balance of power between citizens and global data behemoths. We are also helping to unleash economy-wide economic benefits — reducing the costs that both citizens and service providers incur in collecting and using personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>So why, given these differences, do we think CIC status is important? One strategically vital reason is that in our field of personal data, demonstrating trustworthiness is essential to achieving our mission. It’s easy for organisations to make high-falutin’ statements about ‘consumer empowerment’ or ‘privacy protection’. Legally embedding such things into everything you do is a different matter.</blockquote><blockquote>A second reason follows. When push comes to shove, our society and economy rests on two main types of enterprise: companies seeking to maximise their profits and organisations that rely on subsidies from one source or another. Huge untapped opportunities lie between these extremes, with viable, sustainable enterprises that cover their costs, are not reliant on handouts and may make a profit — but whose main function and impact is to maximise positive external social and economic benefits. We believe that the CIC model allows us to point to the potential of a new and different economic model, and we are glad to be a part of&nbsp;it.</blockquote> The missing&nbsp;middle <p>In its report, the Regulator notes that over 26,000 CICs are now operating in the UK. They’re beginning to impact the way the economy works. But their potential impact reaches much further than this — into the very way we think about economics itself.</p><p>In Mydex’s view, society’s current understanding of what makes an enterprise economically successful is both wrong and damaging. Stated simply, this understanding is that an enterprise’s economic success is measured by the profits it&nbsp;makes.</p><p>A moment’s thought soon reveals this to be nonsense. Take two insurance companies. One is a Mafia-front for a protection racket. It charges its ‘customers’ an insurance premium, a name given to the extortion people have to pay the Mafia for not burning their houses or workplaces down. The other is a genuine insurance company, working hard with its customers to reduce fire risk and paying out if a fire takes&nbsp;place.</p><p>The Mafia outfit is fabulously profitable but leaves misery and destruction in its wake. The genuine company is far less profitable but helps avoid destruction and alleviates misery. Which entity makes the greatest economic contribution? The Mafia one, because it has highest accounting profit?</p> Real results are always on the&nbsp;outside <p>The particulars of this example are deliberately extreme to make the point. But they illustrate a universal truth: the economic results of an enterprise are always experienced and measured by what happens outside its organisational boundaries.</p><p>To understand the economic contribution that any enterprise makes, we need to assess the degree to which it sustainably improves human lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. The test of an electricity company’s economic success is not how much profits it makes, but how efficient and effective it is at providing sustainable electricity to all who need it. The test of a motor car company’s economic success is how efficient and effective it is at providing its customers with safe mobility. The test of a hospital’s economic contribution is how efficient and effective it is at healing the&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Note two crucial things about&nbsp;this.</p>  None of these external results are measured in terms of money. They are measured in terms of life: access to energy, mobility, health.  How much money profit an enterprise makes — an artefact of invented accounting conventions that focus only on the inside of the organisation — is unrelated to how successful it is at “maximising positive external social and economic benefits”, as we put it in the CIC Regulator’s report.  <p>Our current society seems to be organised around a comprehensive denial of this basic economic fact. It leaves us with a soul-sapping ‘choice’ between profit maximising enterprises whose real economic contribution is often questionable or even negative, and activities that need to be subsidised — but with nothing addressing the missing&nbsp;middle.</p><p>Would we have our current cost of living and climate crisis if energy companies’ purpose was to make energy available safely and affordably, rather than maximising profits for shareholders? In the midst of a drought, UK water companies are wasting a trillion litres of water through leaky pipes while managing to organise 775,704 separate occasions of dumping sewage into England’s rivers — a feat that apparently cost them six million hours of work to organise. In recent years, they have also managed to pay out more than £72bn in dividends to shareholders. Does that make them economic successes or economic failures?</p><p>An enterprise doesn’t have to deliver maximum profits to outside investors to be economically viable and to make a positive economic contribution. If it earns enough to cover its costs, it is financially sustainable. After that, its real economic success is the degree to which it finds a way to improve peoples’ lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. It’s this missing middle where the big opportunities lie.</p><p>Mydex is proud to be a CIC, and proud to be recognised as making a contribution by the CIC Regulator. In our view, the CIC philosophy of earning money in order to make a social and economic contribution is the only positive, sustainable philosophy to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>No matter what its formal legal status happens to be, every company should be a community interest company, and its performance should be judged in this&nbsp;way.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/should-all-companies-by-community-interest-companies-a49fc9f3e9ba">Should all companies be Community Interest Companies?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Various people in the Holochain ecosystem are getting ready for DWeb Camp, a gathering of distributed web builders and supporters in California, USA. It’s happening next week!</p><p>The Holochain team is ironing out some bugs in Holochain, making sure all the infrastructure is working, and making final calls on which demo hApps we’ll bring with us to show off. The hREA team is getting excited about weaving peer-to-peer, multi-resource accounting principles into the DWeb story. Bear, our director of ecosystem growth, is volunteering as a space steward at the the <a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/DWeb-camp-peer-to-peer/blob/main/README.md">People-2-People Tent</a> with Anna Lenakova from <a href="https://fluence.network/">Fluence Labs</a>. Members of projects like <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">Kizuna</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn">Acorn</a>, <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">Flux</a>, <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artbrock/clutter">Clutter</a>, <a href="https://core.network/">Core Network</a>, <a href="https://trustgraph.net/">Trust Graph</a>, and <a href="https://www.perspect3vism.org/">Perspect3vism</a> will be there, along with Holo team members and friends from around the community like Marcus and Guillem, who led last month’s <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive</a>. And we’ll also be joined by <a href="http://krafel.info/">Paul Krafel</a>, an ecosystem restorer and elementary school teacher who <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548071.Seeing_Nature">wrote a book</a> that has nothing to do with computers but has been highly influential to many people in Holochain-land.</p><p>If you’re going, we’re so looking forward to meeting you. It shouldn’t be hard to find us; we’ll be everywhere. And the whole DWeb community is wonderfully welcoming, thoughtful, caring, and interesting. You’ll have so many great conversations at breakfast, in the river, in the forest, and between events.</p><p>If you’re not going, you may be wondering why I’m sharing all these details. Well, it’s because I’m excited about how the Holochain ecosystem has grown since the last DWeb Camp in 2019. Back then, there were just a few staff members and hard-core supporters sharing about a DWeb toolkit that barely even existed yet. Now, a pretty significant group of us are heading there with: a working framework, a P2P hosting network, a bunch of working apps, and a pretty awesome community to share, explore, and build with the others in the DWeb world.</p><p>That said, we’re not thinking of this as a place to ‘sell Holochain’. Even if we wanted to, nobody would listen — DWeb Camp is not that kind of crowd. And that’s part of the reason we like it so much. Instead, we’re going there to learn, to listen, to share what we’re working on, and to build mutually supportive relationships. On this theme, I’m particularly interested in one event, an attempt to <a href="https://gitlab.com/getdweb/dweb-camp-2022/-/issues/77">map the projects that make up the DWeb</a> and look for opportunities for interoperability. This was a <a href="https://dwebcamp2019.sched.com/event/S4vH/building-bridges-connecting-tech-stacks-for-humane-ux">vision</a> I carried with me to the last DWeb Camp, and I’m hoping to see more conversations about building bridges between networks.</p><p>And now it’s time for some Holochain release notes!</p> Holochain 0.0.152: Replacing coordinator zomes <p>Release date: 3 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.16<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.144</p><p>The big news in this release is the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.UpdateCoordinators">`update_coordinators`</a> admin API endpoint, which lets you replace the coordinator zomes in a DNA without forking the user into a new DNA space. As you may remember, this is made possible by the recent <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordinator zome split</a> in Holochain 0.0.144. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1494">#1494</a>). This is a huge improvement for app maintainability, allowing you to keep your core data model consistent while adding features and fixing bugs in your hApp’s business logic.</p><p>Other small changes:</p>  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.144/hdk/hash_path/path/struct.TypedPath.html">`TypedPath`</a> is exposed in the HDK’s prelude so it’s easier to reference it in your zome. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1470">#1470</a>)  The new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.16/hdi/prelude/enum.OpType.html">`OpType` helper</a> has gotten some good documentation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1505">#1505</a>)  Bugfix: Cryptographic primitives now have constant-time encoding when they’re being output via `debug`, which protects against timing attacks. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1495">#1495</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220803124141">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.153: HDI version info in CLI <p>Release date: 10 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.17<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.145</p><p>The Holochain conductor has a `--build-info` argument which tells you which HDK versions it’s compatible with. Now it will also tell you the HDI versions. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1511">#1511</a>) Known bug: Although this feature worked, it was preventing automated builds, so it was removed in Holochain 0.0.154.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220810012252">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.154: Sandbox gets a new Lair <p>Release date: 17 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.18<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.146</p><p>The `hc sandbox` command, which lets you spin up throwaway conductor configurations, has been upgraded to use the new Lair 0.2.0 API. This means that all generated sandbox configuration files are now incompatible and will need to be regenerated. See the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_cli_sandbox-0047">instructions</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1515">#1515</a>)</p><p>As mentioned, the addition of HDI versions to `holochain --build-info` caused build automation problems, so it’s been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1521">#1521</a>) But don’t worry; it’ll be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1523">re-added</a> in Holochain 0.0.155.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220817013233">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.155: Execution-limiting bug fix <p>Release date: 20 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.19<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.147</p><p>This is an out-of-schedule release which fixes a bug that was discovered in a recently introduced execution-limiting feature. This feature is meant to prevent DNAs from consuming too much resources (think infinite loops and the like). It works by terminating a zome call (including validation and other callbacks) after a certain number of WASM VM operations, currently set at 10 billion. However, the counter was accruing at the cell level, not the function call level, so cells would become inoperable after a certain amount of work, regardless of how much work was done in a given call. This is now fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1514">#1514</a>)</p><p>The conductor binary’s `--build-info` flag has also been re-enabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1523">#1523</a>)</p> Holochain Launcher 0.4.11: New Holochain versions supported <p>Release date: 19 Aug 2022</p><p>This version adds support for three more Holochain versions, including one legacy version:</p>  Holochain 0.0.145 (HDK 0.0.138 / HDI 0.0.10)  Holochain 0.0.152 (HDK 0.0.144 / HDI 0.0.16)  Holochain 0.0.154 (HDK 0.0.146 / HDI 0.0.18)  <p>Here’s something I hadn’t previously reported on: The bundled version of DevHub only supports DNA manifests that target Holochain 0.0.143 (HDK 0.0.136) and older. That’s because the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordinator split</a> in Holochain introduced changes in the DNA manifest file. A future version of Launcher will include an updated DevHub that supports hApps built with Holochain 0.0.144 (HDK 0.0.137 / HDI 0.0.9) and newer.</p><p>Get the release <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.11">here</a>.</p> Holochain In Action: Lots of action <p>I have two Holochain in Action videos for you! The first, published on 3rd August, unpacks the entertaining Burner Chat hApp developed by Matthias M, Łukasz G, and Thomas S at the Developer Immersive last month. In it, you’ll get a chance to see how they used a combination of the DHT for peer discovery and signals which bypass the DHT to create disappearing messages and a real-time experience.</p><p>The second, published on 17th August, takes a look at We, a system created by Lightning Rod Labs for building collaborative spaces. You can read more about the purpose behind We in <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390">this blog post</a> by Eric Harris-Braun.</p> See you in a couple weeks! <p>Well, I’m off to DWeb Camp; I’ll write more when I get back. Many hApps and developer tools are being created and polished, and I want to start showcasing more of them. And I’ll be sure to bring plenty of photos and videos back from DWeb Camp to share with you!</p><p>Cover photo by Brad Shirakawa at <a href="https://archive.org/details/campdaytwojuly19bradshirakawaimages/page/n105/mode/2up">archive.org</a></p>

   The ground for Fed-issued guidelines for banks planning to engage in crypto-related activities was set last year with the joint announcement of the OCC and the&nbsp;Fed.

<blockquote>The ground for Fed-issued guidelines for banks planning to engage in crypto-related activities was set last year with the joint announcement of the OCC and the&nbsp;Fed.</blockquote><blockquote>The Fed made it clear in its new guidelines that although the crypto space may provide a new opportunity to the banks, they must have a system in place to ensure consumer protection at all&nbsp;times.</blockquote><blockquote>Under the new guidelines, any bank that plans to or is already engaged in any activity involving crypto assets must notify the Fed and the state regulator.</blockquote><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has issued additional guidance for banks considering or already engaged in activities involving crypto assets. The central bank emphasized in the guidelines that firms must notify the Fed, alert their state regulator beforehand, and make sure what they do is legally permitted.</p><p>This move comes after several Democratic senators, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the OCC to rescind its previously issued guidance on crypto and replace it with “a comprehensive approach in coordination with other prudential regulators.”</p> Clarity on the&nbsp;Matter <p>Last year, U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and the Fed, jointly said that they intend to clarify on kind of activities banks could engage in involving crypto as well as whether firms were able to facilitate crypto trades on behalf of customers and hold digital assets on their balance&nbsp;sheet.</p><p>Now, on Tuesday, the Fed said it is publishing its latest guidance. While crypto could offer “potential opportunities” to banks, firms need to have systems in place to ensure they do not threaten safety and soundness or consumer protections, the Fed said in a statement.</p> Prerequisites for Banks to Provide Crypto&nbsp;Services <p>As per the supervisory letter, banks supervised by the agency should take several steps before engaging in activities involving crypto, including determining if existing laws dictated any particular filings and if activities under consideration were legally permissible.</p><p>Banks should further have adequate risk management systems and controls in place in order to ensure that any endeavors were conducted safely and soundly and were in compliance with consumer protection rules, added the&nbsp;Fed.</p><p>The central bank has also published guidance for financial institutions to access its “master accounts,” which they need to participate in the global payment&nbsp;system.</p><p>This Monday’s announcement moves the Fed one step closer to possibly allowing Wyoming special purpose depository institutions (SPDI), like Kraken Bank, access to these accounts so they would not need banks as intermediaries.</p><blockquote>“The new guidelines provide a consistent and transparent process to evaluate requests for Federal Reserve accounts and access to payment services in order to support a safe, inclusive, and innovative payment system,” said Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard in a statement.</blockquote><p>Under the Fed’s guidance, Tier 1 banks would be federally insured, but while Tier 2 banks won’t be federally insured, they will still be subject to the federal banking agency’s supervision. On the other hand, the last Tier 3 banks are neither federally insured nor will they be put through prudential supervision, which likely would apply to the Wyoming crypto&nbsp;banks.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>With crypto companies suffering the brunt of the crypto winter, which has led to the downfall of some of the leading companies in the digital assets space, the U.S. authorities have now begun to set the ground rules to contain the fallout and ensure consumer security. The Fed’s new guideline is one of the many initiatives to bring stability to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>The regulatory actions are not limited to the United States alone, as other governments and international bodies, too, have started many such initiatives to bring crypto assets under the regulatory net. For instance, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has rolled out the Travel Rule to ensure that cryptocurrencies aren’t used in illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing.</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are obligated to collect and share personally identifiable information (PII) of both the beneficiary and the originator of crypto transactions. Although only a few countries have adopted the Travel Rule, sooner or later, almost all countries will start enforcing the Travel Rule over&nbsp;VASPs.</blockquote><p>Thus, it is ideal that VASPs prepare to comply with the Travel Rule. And to begin complying, VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution, such as the Veriscope, the best solution available in the market today.

<p>A popular idiom, “More Haste, Less Speed,” perfectly encapsulates how some Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as cryptocurrency exchanges, are complying with the FATF Travel Rule, which is something that Shyft Network’s Head of Strategy, Malcolm Wright, experienced firsthand. Hastily done Travel Rule compliance can lead to more troubles, bringing VASPs back to the&nbsp;square.</p><p>Recently, a cryptocurrency exchange emailed Malcolm demanding some Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from him about a USDC deposit into his&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965575365050187776?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The identity of the crypto exchange will remain anonymous here, as this is not really about them but the inaccurate Travel Rule compliance process per se, which is something that even Malcolm highlighted in his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965575365050187776?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">LinkedIn&nbsp;post</a>.</p><blockquote>The effort the crypto exchange is putting in to comply with the Travel Rule is commendable, but it does lead to four significant risks, which need to be highlighted.</blockquote> Risk #1: Security&nbsp;Risks <p>Sharing Travel Rule compliance data through emails can lead to phishing attacks. In fact, all a malicious actor will need here to pull off a phishing attack is a domain name with one letter difference.</p><p>There is data to back the claim. Reports indicate that <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/1670277/%5BCollateral%5D%20Tessian%20Guides,%20Infographics,%20eBooks/%5BTessian%20Infographic%5D%20Must-Know%20Phishing%20Statistics%202021.pdf">96%</a> of phishing attacks can be attributed to&nbsp;emails.</p> Risk #2: Legal &amp; Moral&nbsp;Troubles <p>One cannot share personally identifiable information of the sender without explicit consent from them. This is what even Malcolm highlighted in his&nbsp;post.</p><p>Imagine the horror if the crypto exchange with whom the user shares someone else’s PII falls into the hands of a malicious actor through a phishing attack or the VASP loses it due to inadequate privacy&nbsp;control.</p> Risk #3: Incomplete or Inaccurate Data <p>There’s a high chance that a user will send inaccurate or incomplete PII, given there are no safeguards to prevent such an instance while exchanging the data through emails. This can cause a significant rise in operational overheads beyond the usual email processing and customer support&nbsp;costs.</p> Risk #4: Poor User Experience <p>Last but not least, collecting Travel Rule compliance data through email is a UX disaster. It will lead to unhappy users, which will make them choose your competitors, especially if it is every transaction.</p> What’s the Solution? <p>Technology is the answer. It can solve all the challenges VASPs will encounter while complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><blockquote>Identify counterparty VASPs&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>Get accurate originator &amp; beneficiary data with consent&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>No additional headcount costs&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>Fully secured &amp; transparent ✔</blockquote><p>That, too, within seconds. Yes, you read that right. All you need here is Shyft Veriscope!

<p>Catchy title, but where is this going? In the world of identity and access management, as Ubisecure we know we can help customers manage single sign-on(SSO) sessions no matter how complex their environment. It doesn’t matter if you have a dozen separate applications, each with their own local username and password, or if you have tens or hundreds of partners that you want to give secure, authenticated access to. We know we can help you. But we’re often asked, “how?”. Well, this is where SSO integration for the old, the new and the strange comes into play.</p>
<p>Our Identity Platform can integrate applications with both SAML and OIDC; each protocol has its own method to authenticate a user session. And we can create adaptors for nonstandard applications which integrate via a CIBA framework. But, SAML, OIDC and CIBA, how do I know if I use these already?</p>
 The Old 
<p>For those of you who know, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) uses a series of XML-based protocol messages to create user sessions. There is typically a human user, an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). That is – you on your web browser, a service that can identify you with authority and the place you are asking your web browser to log into. Keep in mind the IdP and the SP might look the same to you – but your browser knows the difference. Launched as 1.0 in 2001 and updated to 2.0 in 2005, SAML is the “grand old man” of authentication.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of applications, probably millions, which use SAML to securely authenticate users to services. SAML is tried, true and robust. If your company or partner has been offering services online since before 2010, then the SAML protocol is in use to authenticate users – human and machine. It’s no problem, Ubisecure Identity Platform supports SAML out of the box.</p>
 The New 
<p>OIDC or OpenID Connect. This is a decentralised authentication protocol which uses OAuth 2.0 as its authorisation framework. In brief, OIDC is a series of secure message exchanges that allow you to delegate access of your online content to a third-party resource or service. It’s the “give this app access to only these 10 pictures on my phone”.</p>
<p>Like SAML, OIDC also has a human user and identity provider (IdP). However, differs from SAML by using a relying party (RP) to securely control and limit the personal information or resources you are granting access to. This sounds a little complex but is really an elegant way for you to trust a known resource to control access to your information and only give out the specific information you want, when you want it. And revoke access when you want to; this is nearly as important as granting access. As OIDC was finalised in 2007, it’s not that much younger than SAML – but still the few years between the release of the two protocols makes OIDC the new kid on the block</p>
<p>If you use Facebook or Google, Twitter or hundreds of other applications or services, you have been using OIDC. Do you use your Office365 identity to log into your company’s ticketing or intranet site? That’s OIDC functioning to authenticate you, via Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. It then creates an access token and id token to tell your company’s applications that you are a valid user and should be granted access.</p>
 The Strange 
<p>Ok – SAML and OIDC are pretty clear. They can both identify you as a user from a central location and exchange your right to access information from an online location. What happens when you discover that you have an application that is either COTS (commercial off the shelf) or homegrown that just doesn’t follow the standards? It’s an essential application, used for key business functions and it can’t be altered or rewritten quickly enough. This application needs to be available to your partners, but you don’t want the hassle of managing user accounts for all those external staff. Seems like a bind, but we have a solution here.</p>
<p>OIDC CIBA – OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication, or just CIBA for short. Ubisecure’s Identity Platform has a CIBA framework that can help to integrate this non-standard (or strange) application. While this isn’t a plug and play solution, you or your System Integrator will need to work with our Sales Engineering team to identify your essential applications APIs, then integrate them into our CIBA adaptor. We will connect to your partner’s user directory via SAML or OIDC and to your key application via this CIBA adaptor.</p>
<p>In the modern reality, a diverse range of legacy and new applications coexist. Blending on-premises and cloud services is often the quickest way for any organisation to grow resulting in a hybrid IT environment. Of course, it’s better to follow open standards, either SAML or OIDC. But when your business requirements extend beyond the norm, by either the protocols used or into a hybrid deployment, come talk to us. We have long experience with SSO integration for complex environments, no matter if they are “old”, “new” or “strange”.</p>

The application will include CRUD abilities, meaning that you can create, read, update, and delete the todo items on the Spring Boot API via the client. The Vue frontend client will use the Quasar framework for the presentation. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) will secure the Spring Boot API and the Vue client using Okta as

<p>This project has two major parts:</p>

 
   Spring Boot API 
   Vue client 
 

<p>The Spring Boot app will include an H2 in-memory database and will use Spring Data JPA to map our todo data model to a database table for persistence. As you’ll see, the server will leverage Spring Boot’s ability to quickly expose data via a REST API with minimal configuration.</p>

<p>The client will use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue 3</a> and the Quasar framework. <a href="https://quasar.dev/">The Quasar framework</a> provides components and layout tools to help build Vue applications quickly with a consistent, high-quality user interface.</p>

<p>Before you dig into the tutorial, I want to quickly introduce the technologies for those that might be unfamiliar. Feel free to skip down to the <a>prerequisites</a> section if you’re already familiar with Vue and Spring Boot.</p>

 What is Vue.js? 

<p>Vue is a JavaScript view library, like React and Angular. It’s designed to be incrementally adoptable, and the core library focuses solely on the view layer.</p>

<p>In my experience, Vue.js is a great alternative to React. I learned React first and came to use Vue later. Like React, Vue uses a virtual DOM, provides reactive and composable view components, and enforces a strict one-way parent-child relationship when defining properties and state. This means that it is performant and avoids many confusing state relationships that can occur without one-way data binding.</p>

<p>However, unlike React, Vue uses templates instead of JSX (a potentially welcome and more immediately accessible option). Vue gives you component-scoped CSS using style tags in single-file components. In practice, this difference is pretty significant because, in React, the JSX and CSS-like syntax are close enough to HTML and CSS to be confusing but not the same, which creates problems initially. (Ever gone from a language that doesn’t require semicolons back to one that does? It’s something like that.)</p>

<p>I find Vue to be a simpler, cleaner implementation. React requires a deep dive. You gotta take the red pill and go all the way. It’s a super powerful system, but you have to be all in. Vue is a little friendlier and a little easier to get started.</p>

 Introducing the Quasar Framework 

<p>The <a href="https://quasar.dev/">Quasar Framework</a> builds on top of Vue to add a cross-platform component library and grid layout system. It also provides many tools for deploying Vue-based applications to basically any platform you can think of, from web single-page and progressive web apps to mobile apps and Electron-based desktop apps. In this tutorial, you’ll only be using the layout and component library features. Still, Quasar’s big push is to allow developers to write a single web application and deploy it to any platform with a consistent look with minimal changes.</p>

 About Spring Boot 

<p>The server technology you’re going to use is Spring Boot. Pure, unadulterated Spring (pre-Spring Boot) is a bit of a behemoth: super powerful but potentially time-sucking and frustrating. I’m pretty sure the whole computer conference phenomena came about so that people could learn and understand old-school Spring XML files. It certainly drove large sections of the computer publishing empires.</p>

<p>Spring Boot was Spring’s answer to this complexity (and to frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Grails). They did a great job of distilling down all the power of Spring into a simple, quick, easy-to-use web framework. You can have a fully functioning resource server with a ridiculously small number of lines of code and a few annotations.</p>

<p>Plus, when you’re ready, you have all the power of Spring under the hood, just waiting.</p>

<p><a></a>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>Before you start, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed (or install them now).</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Java 11</a>: or use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN!</a> to manage and install multiple versions 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: the Okta command-line interface 
   <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">HTTPie</a>: a simple tool for making HTTP requests from a Bash shell 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node 16+</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">Vue CLI</a>: you’ll use this to bootstrap the Vue client 
 

<p>You will need a free Okta Developer account if you don’t already have one. But you can wait until later in the tutorial and use the Okta CLI to log in or register for a new account.</p>

<p>Instead of building the project, you can also <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example">clone the repo</a> and follow the instructions there to configure it.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect app 

<p>Open a Bash shell. Create a parent directory for the project. Eventually, this will include both the resource server and client projects.</p>

   <code>mkdir spring-boot-vue-crud
cd spring-boot-vue-crud
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Copy the client ID and issuer URI somewhere safe. You’ll need them for both the client and resource server applications.</p>

 Bootstrap a Spring Boot app using Spring Initializr 

<p>You’re going to use <a>the Spring Initializr</a> to create a starter project for the resource server. You can look at the project website if you want, but here you’ll use the REST API to download a pre-configured starter.</p>

<p>The following command will download the starter project and un-tar it to a new directory named <code>resource-server</code>.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.7.3 \
  -d javaVersion=11 \
  -d dependencies=web,data-rest,lombok,data-jpa,h2,okta \
  -d type=gradle-project \
  -d baseDir=resource-server \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd resource-server
</code>   

<p>The dependencies you’re including are:</p>

 
   <code>web</code>: <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">Spring Web MVC</a>, adds basic HTTP REST functionality 
   <code>data-jpa</code>: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa">Spring Data JPA</a>, makes it easy to create JPA-based repositories 
   <code>data-rest</code>: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-rest">Spring Data REST</a>, exposes Spring Data repositories as resource servers 
   <code>h2</code>: the <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">H2</a> in-memory database used for demonstration purposes 
   <code>lombok</code>: <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Project Lombok</a>, adds some helpful annotations that eliminate the need to write a lot of getters and setters 
   <code>okta</code>: <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> that helps OAuth 2.0 and OIDC configuration 
 

<p>Project Lombok saves a lot of clutter and ceremony code. However, if you’re using an IDE, you’ll need to install a plugin for Lombok. See the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">project’s installation docs</a> for more information.</p>

 Configure Spring Security 

<p>Open the application properties file and update it. You’re changing the server port so it doesn’t conflict with the default Vue local server (which also defaults <code>8080</code>).</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=9000
okta.oauth2.issuer=&lt;your-issuer-uri&gt;
okta.oauth2.clientId=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>You need to replace the two bracketed values with the values you generated above for the OIDC app using the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>You can run the bootstrapped project right now and see if it starts. It should start but won’t do much.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure Spring Security. The class below configures web security to allow all requests, effectively bypassing security. This is just so you can test the resource server initially. You’ll enable security shortly.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .anyRequest().permitAll();
        return http.build();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Replace the <code>DemoApplication.java</code> file with the following.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.cors.CorsConfiguration;
import org.springframework.web.cors.UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource;
import org.springframework.web.filter.CorsFilter;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.CorsRegistry;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    // Bootstrap some test data into the in-memory database
    @Bean
    ApplicationRunner init(TodoRepository repository) {
        return args -&gt; {
            Random rd = new Random();
            Stream.of("Buy milk", "Eat pizza", "Update tutorial", "Study Vue", "Go kayaking").forEach(name -&gt; {
                Todo todo = new Todo();
                todo.setTitle(name);
                todo.setCompleted(rd.nextBoolean());
                repository.save(todo);
            });
            repository.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
        };
    }

    // Fix the CORS errors
    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean simpleCorsFilter() {
        UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
        CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();
        config.setAllowCredentials(true);
        // *** URL below needs to match the Vue client URL and port ***
        config.setAllowedOrigins(Collections.singletonList("http://localhost:8080"));
        config.setAllowedMethods(Collections.singletonList("*"));
        config.setAllowedHeaders(Collections.singletonList("*"));
        source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);
        FilterRegistrationBean bean = new FilterRegistrationBean&lt;&gt;(new CorsFilter(source));
        bean.setOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE);
        return bean;
    }

    // Expose IDs of Todo items
    @Component
    class RestRespositoryConfigurator implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config, CorsRegistry cors) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Todo.class);
        }
    }
    
}
</code>   

<p>This demo application does three things that are helpful for demonstration purposes. First, it loads some test todo items into the repository.</p>

<p>Second, it configures the REST repository to expose IDs for the todo items.</p>

<p>Third, it defines a filter to allow cross-origin requests from <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. This is necessary so that the Vue application, which is loaded from <code>http://localhost:9000</code> via the local test server, can load data from the Spring Boot resource server at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>For more info on CORS (cross-origin resource sharing), take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">the Mozilla docs</a>.</p>

<p>Now, create the data model for the todo items.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/Todo.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import lombok.*;

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Todo {

    @Id 
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @NonNull
    private String title;

    private Boolean completed = false;
    
}
</code>   

<p>Notice the use of the Lombok annotations (<code>@Entity</code>, <code>@Data</code>, and <code>@NoArgsConstructor</code>) to keep the code simple and clean.</p>

<p>The todo items have two fields: a title string and a completed boolean. The fields are annotated with Spring Data JPA annotations that allow the Java class to be mapped to a database table for persistence.</p>

<p>Create a repository to persist the data model.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/TodoRepository.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;

@RepositoryRestResource
interface TodoRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Todo, Long&gt; {}
</code>   

<p>This is a Spring Data JpaRepository that can persist the data model you just defined. Because it is annotated with <code>@RepositoryRestResource</code> (and because the <code>data-rest</code> dependency was included), this repository will be automatically exposed as a web resource.</p>

 Test your Vue and Spring Boot app 

<p>Run the app using the following command from the <code>resource-server</code> subdirectory.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Open a new Bash shell and use HTTPie to test the resource server.</p>

   <code>http :9000/todos
</code>   

<p>You should see a response like the following:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...

{
  "_embedded": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/1"
          },
          "todo": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/1"
          }
        },
        "completed": false,
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Buy milk"
      },
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/2"
          },
          "todo": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/2"
          }
        },
        "completed": true,
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Eat pizza"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
}
</code>   

<p>Stop the resource server using <code>CTRL + C</code>.</p>

 Secure your Spring Boot API 

<p>Edit the <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> file and change the filter chain’s bean definition to enable a resource server.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/OAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>

   <code>@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
    return http.build();
}
</code>   

<p>This configuration requires JWT auth on all requests.</p>

<p>Restart the server. Use <code>CTRL + C</code> to stop it if it’s running.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Use HTTPie again to try and request the todo items.</p>

   <code>http :9000/todos
</code>   

<p>You will get an error.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 
...

401 Unauthorized

</code>   

<p>The resource server is finished. The next step is to create the Vue client.</p>

 Create a Vue JavaScript client 

<p>Use the Vue CLI to create a new application from the project’s root directory and navigate into the newly created <code>client</code> directory. Install the Vue CLI if you don’t have it installed with <code>npm i -g @vue/cli</code>.</p>

   <code>vue create client
cd client
</code>   

<p>Pick Default ([Vue 3] babel, eslint) when prompted.</p>

<p>Wait for it to finish. Add the Quasar framework.</p>

   <code>vue add quasar
</code>   

<p>You can just accept the defaults. For me, they were the following.</p>

 
   Allow Quasar to replace App.vue, About.vue, Home.vue and (if available) router.js? Yes 
   Pick your favorite CSS preprocessor: Sass with indented syntax 
   Choose Quasar Icon Set: Material Icons (recommended) 
   Default Quasar language pack: en-US 
   Use RTL support? No 
   Select features: Enter to select none 
 

<p>Add additional dependencies for HTTP requests, logging, routing, and authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i axios@0.27.2 vuejs3-logger@1.0.0 vue-router@4.1.3 @okta/okta-vue@5.3.0
</code>   

 
   <code>axios</code>: an HTTP client request library 
   <code>vuejs3-logger</code>: a logging library 
   <code>vue-router</code>: the standard for routing between pages in Vue 
   <code>okta/okta-vue</code>: the Okta helper for Vue 
 

<p>To learn more about how Okta integrates with Vue, look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-vue">the GitHub page</a> for the <code>okta/okta-vue</code> project. More resources and example applications are listed in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/vue/">the Okta docs for Vue</a>.</p>

<p>Replace <code>main.js</code> with the following. Look at the <code>OktaAuth</code> configuration object. Notice the client ID and issuer URI are pulled from a <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p><code>src/main.js</code></p>

   <code>import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import {Quasar} from 'quasar'
import quasarUserOptions from './quasar-user-options'
import VueLogger from 'vuejs3-logger'
import router from './router'
import createApi from './Api'

import {OktaAuth} from '@okta/okta-auth-js'
import OktaVue from '@okta/okta-vue'

if (process.env.VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI == null || process.env.VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID == null || process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URI == null) {
  throw "Please define VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI, VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID, and VUE_APP_SERVER_URI in .env file"
}

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: process.env.VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI,  // pulled from .env file
  clientId: process.env.VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID,  // pulled from .env file
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
})

const options = {
  isEnabled: true,
  logLevel: 'debug',
  stringifyArguments: false,
  showLogLevel: true,
  showMethodName: false,
  separator: '|',
  showConsoleColors: true
};

const app = createApp(App)
  .use(Quasar, quasarUserOptions)
  .use(VueLogger, options)
  .use(OktaVue, {oktaAuth})
  .use(router)

app.config.globalProperties.$api = createApi(app.config.globalProperties.$auth)

app.mount('#app')
</code>   

<p>Stated very briefly, the file above creates the main Vue app and configures it to use the dependencies you added: Quasar, VueLogger, OktaVue, and the router. It also creates the API class that handles the requests to the resource server and passes it the <code>$auth</code> object it needs to get the JWT.</p>

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the client project root directory. The Client ID and Issuer URI are the values you used above in the Spring Boot <code>application.properties</code> file. The Server URI is the local URI for the Spring Boot API. You can leave this unless you made a change (this gets used in the <code>Api.js</code> file).</p>

<p><code>.env</code></p>

 <code>VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI=&lt;your-issuer-uri&gt;
VUE_APP_SERVER_URI=http://localhost:9000
</code> 

<p>It’s important to note that putting values like this in a <code>.env</code> file in a client application does not make them secure. It helps by keeping them out of a repository. However, they are still public because they are necessarily visible in the JavaScript code sent to the browser. In this use case, it’s more of a configuration and organizational tool than a security tool.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the <code>.env</code> file out of the repository, you need to update the <code>.gitignore</code> file. There’s no particular need to do this for the Client ID as it will be publicly available anyway.</p>

<p>Replace <code>App.vue</code> with the following.</p>

<p><code>src/App.vue</code></p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;q-layout view="hHh lpR fFf"&gt;

    &lt;q-header elevated class="bg-primary text-white"&gt;
      &lt;q-toolbar&gt;
        &lt;q-toolbar-title&gt;
          &lt;q-avatar&gt;
            &lt;q-icon name="kayaking" size="30px"&gt;&lt;/q-icon&gt;
          &lt;/q-avatar&gt;
          Todo App
        &lt;/q-toolbar-title&gt;
        {{ this.claims &amp;&amp; this.claims.email ? claims.email : '' }}
        &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon="logout" v-if='authState &amp;&amp; authState.isAuthenticated' @click="logout"/&gt;
        &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon="account_circle" v-else @click="login"/&gt;
      &lt;/q-toolbar&gt;
    &lt;/q-header&gt;

    &lt;q-page-container&gt;
      &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;
    &lt;/q-page-container&gt;

  &lt;/q-layout&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'LayoutDefault',
  data: function () {
    return {
      claims: null
    }

    async updateClaims() {
      if (this.authState &amp;&amp; this.authState.isAuthenticated) {

}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>This top-level component defines the header bar and includes the router component. The header bar has a login or logout button and will show the authenticated user’s email address when logged in.</p>

<p>The app gets the authenticated user’s email address from the JWT claims. (A claim is a piece of information asserted about the subject by the authenticating authority.) This happens in the <code>updateClaims()</code> method, which is triggered when the component is created, and is also triggered by a watch method so that it is updated as the authenticated state changes.</p>

<p>Create a new file to encapsulate the resource server access logic.</p>

<p><code>src/Api.js</code></p>

   <code>import axios from 'axios'

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URI,
  timeout: 2000
});

const createApi = (auth) =&gt; {

  instance.interceptors.request.use(async function (config) {
    let accessToken = auth.getAccessToken()
    config.headers = {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

  return {

    // (C)reate
    createNew(text, completed) {
      return instance.post('/todos', {title: text, completed: completed})
    },

export default createApi
</code>   

<p>All of the requests to the server go through this module. Take a look at how the access token is retrieved from the global <code>auth</code> object and injected into every request.</p>

<p>Create the router file.</p>

<p><code>src/router/index.js</code></p>

   <code>import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { navigationGuard } from '@okta/okta-vue'
import Todos from "@/components/Todos";
import Home from "@/components/Home";
import { LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-vue'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/todos',
    component: Todos,
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: true
    }
  },
  { path: '/callback', component: LoginCallback },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes,
})

router.beforeEach(navigationGuard)

export default router
</code>   

<p>The router has three paths. The home path and the todos path are straightforward. The Okta Vue SDK provides the last path, <code>/callback</code>, to handle the login redirect from the Okta servers after authentication.</p>

<p>Create the <code>Home</code> component.</p>

<p><code>src/components/Home.vue</code></p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;

</code>   

<p>This component encapsulates the card that holds all of the todos and the todo-associated interface elements. It also handles the rest of the functions related to updating todos on the server and in the local cache.</p>

<p>You’re welcome to delete the <code>HelloWorld.vue</code> component if you want. Or you can leave it. It’s not needed.</p>

 Confirm your Spring Boot and Vue todo app works 

<p>Make sure the Spring Boot API is still running. In a separate Bash shell, from the resource server directory, run the following command (if it is not already still running).</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Start the Vue app using the embedded development server. From the client directory:</p>

   <code>npm run serve
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You’ll see the “please log in” page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log into the app using Okta’s sign-in interface.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That will redirect you to the Todo app’s main screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to delete items, add new items, rename, and filter items. All data is stored on the Spring Boot resource server and is presented by the Vue + Quasar frontend.</p>

 Do more with Spring Boot, Vue, and Okta 

<p>You built a Spring Boot resource server backend and a Vue frontend in this tutorial. The Vue client used the latest Vue 3 version with the Quasar framework. The app included full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) capabilities. It was all secured using Okta.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example">@oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>In this vlog, our Chief Operating Officer, Huzefa Olia, joins our Chief Marketing Officer, Michael Cichon, to discuss why Okta needs an identity layer.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, the chief marking officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here this morning with Huzefa Olia, our chief operating officer, to discuss how to make single sign-on a bit more secure. Huzefa, welcome to the vlog this morning. How are you?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Interesting topic, Michael. Pleasure to be here.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, listen, I appreciate you taking time. I know between the analyst briefings, the customer meetings, you’re pretty busy. I appreciate you taking time this morning. I want to start off talking a little bit about the Lapsus$ breach at Okta. I know some folks say it’s not a big deal, the breach only lasted 25 minutes. Other folks are saying this is a big deal. So what actually happened? And with Okta being a market leader, what does this say about the state of single sign-on?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. So the breach happened not directly within Okta, but it happened with a service provider that Okta uses. Lapsus$ was able to social engineer a password for one of the vendors that Okta uses, and through that, tunnel into the network. And I believe they had access to two or maybe three of customer data or customer instances that Okta manages. Through the reports that we have seen or what Okta has published, it essentially says none of the critical information was released to them. As part of the breach, they did manage to see more information around some collaboration sites that that particular customer had. So although the impact wasn’t as severe, but it happening to an identity provider, to a single sign on-engine like Okta is extremely critical. And I think it just leads to this particular discussion that we’re having right now, that what can be changed when it comes to any kind of an authentication that happens.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay So the breach wasn’t any real deficiency in Okta itself. It’s the reliance on passwords. And this has been a problem for business all along. It’s the account takeover, email account takeover at a partner, a company that’s not your own, but you inherit that as a business, you inherit that risk from your supply chain. So with that as context, what should customers of single sign-on be doing to shore up their security?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Great question. So if we look at it and just peel off all the different layers and whether it came from a supplier or whether it came internally, whatever that is, the essential or fundamental thing is the way we authenticate today is broken, irrespective of the type of system that we authenticate into. And what I mean by that is in this specific example and in all the different breaches that have happened, the model has been that a user’s password/PIN has been compromised. So every time when you’re relying on a knowledge-based authentication where a user is in the middle, a user’s knowledge of their password or PIN is important, social engineering is going to continue to happen. And there are more advanced methods of that happening. The essential method to change is move away from this knowledge-based authentication and do it based on possession, possession of a factor that you have, possession to say that this is my identity that I’m using to authenticate.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So possession on its own is not new. We’ve had this for a while with things like YubiKey and other devices that you would plug into your laptop to prove you have a physical key. But what is new and novel about this possession factor today?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>So always, possession was primarily based as a second factor for authentication. We are never moving away from the passwords, primarily because we relied on that to authenticate a user’s identity, your password where you’re a proxy to who Michael is to authenticate. With systems that are out there, one of them and I’m plugging 1Kosmos over here, essentially what we are doing is that in your authentication flow, A, we are proving your identity by digitally verifying who you are and using that certificate-based authentication where you’re possessing that device, where your certificate is enrolled, and then proving who you are instead of a password by using your biometrics to authenticate. So that changes the whole notion of how a possession-based authentication would work as well. You’re no longer using it as a second factor, but you’re using it as the primary factor in the authentication.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So passwords authenticate, but passwords don’t prove identity. At 1Kosmos, we talk about adding in identity layer, if you will. Can you talk a little bit more about what… You said prove identity. What does that mean? Can you translate that for people?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>So the way we have seen how identity and access management works today is it’s not necessarily an and. Every identity sits in a separate silo, and access management sits in a separate silo. Where from an identity standpoint today, you often may or sometimes you maybe proving who the user is, but that is one time and that resides in a separate repository. And authentication doesn’t care about the user’s identity. They care about the user ID, which is very, very different.</p>
<p>A Michael Cichon, I know who you are, is very different compared to an MC shown, who I just am trusting and saying that I’m going to provide that access. So we are bridging that particular gap. And the way we do this is anytime a user is coming into an environment, yes, we do the identity proving and verification, but we do the continuous verification of the user’s identity. And then in addition to that, we no longer rely on any kind of an MC shown ID to authenticate the user. We ask the user to prove who they are by authenticating using their biometrics. So the whole notion of identity and access management working together actually would make sense in this case.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So depending on the needs of the business, there’s different levels of this identity proving, correct?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And there are standards which are there in the market today. The most leading one in US is the NIST Identity Assurance Level. And there are different levels that you can get to depending on how do you want to get the user. If I have a low entry point or if my system is not as critical, I may want the user to log in to my system if they have an IAL level of one. But if it’s production and if it’s a critical system, I would like the user to be IAL level two or higher when they’re authenticating. And as well as when they’re authenticating, I want to use a factor that I can trust. And there are multiple different biometrics factors, which are there in the market today.</p>
<p>You mentioned a couple of them, YubiKey, where as well as other kind of device biometrics, like your Face ID and Touch ID that Apple provides. All of them great. But if you really, really want to know who the user is, then a live selfie is extremely important. When I am enrolling you, Michael, in my organization, you’re proving who you are, but I am taking some kind of a video recording with you. When I’m authenticating you, I want that same kind of a flow as well. And that’s something, again, which is unique into our platform where we not only take a certain level for a user, but we also try to authenticate them using those live biometrics.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Okay. So the 1Kosmos platform, we know it’s certified to the NIST standard, certified to the IDO2 standard. The biometrics are also certified, correct?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>That is correct, certified with iBeta.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, great. So bringing this back to Okta, how does 1Kosmos then work to complement Okta?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. This goes with respect to Okta or any kind of a single sign-on engine, which is out there. Single sign-on engines are wonderful and are an essential requirement now in any kind of a large enterprise today. How we work with a single sign-on provider like Okta is that we would integrate with them. So anytime you’re logging in into an Okta or a single sign-on engine a user, instead of entering the username and a password one time, you would no longer even have to do that. You will essentially be authenticating using your biometrics that would be enrolled using 1Kosmos. And 1Kosmos has all the plumbing that has been built in within Okta or any kind of other single sign-on provider that is out there.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Interesting. So when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, he introduced the new stylus, which was the finger. And now, we are introducing basically yourself as the authenticator. So what’s the user experience like then?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>As we say, instead of remembering a complex password, now you log in with a blink and a smile.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Blink and a smile. That’s awesome. Okay. Well, that’s the questions I had for you. This has been really interesting for me. I think you’ve been pretty clear in helping us understand this. We do have a webinar coming up. It’s called After Lapsus$, How to Protect Your SSO Environment from Vendor and Contractor Compromise. This particular webinar is happening on August 18th at 10:00 AM Pacific and 1:00 PM Eastern Time. So if you’re seeing this log after that date, that will, of course, be available on our website as a replay. So thank you very much, Huzefa. I appreciate your time today. Have a great rest of your day. And so long, everybody.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>

<p>As part of our series on understanding more about the vLEI, the new Verifiable Credential to identify organisations and organisation representatives, this article is a follow-up to a previous post <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials/" title="Introduction to Verifiable Credentials">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>. This time, we will look in more detail at how W3C specification verifiable credentials work.</p>
<p>The Verifiable Credentials specification by W3C provides a way to express credentials on the web. In this article I’m giving an overview of components and terminology related to VCs, and also some information about other technologies and specifications that are needed when implementing Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 Claims 
<p>Before I go into the components, I’ll run through a quick explanation on claims as a critical concept to understand for Verifiable Credentials. A claim is a name-value statement about a subject. The subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device. Examples of claims are:</p>
 
 Person’s first and last name, date of birth etc. 
 Organisation name 
 Personal ID 
 … and many others 
 
<p>The concept of claims is familiar to those who have been working with federation protocols, such as OpenID Connect and SAML.</p>
 Example 
 “credentialSubject” : {
&nbsp; “id”: “did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867”,
&nbsp; “birth_date”: “1970-01-01”
} 
 Components of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>A Verifiable Credential (VC) is a collection of claims made by an issuer (recap issuers in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials/" title="Introduction to Verifiable Credentials">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>). VC metadata describes properties such as type, expiration and issuer of a credential. VC proof is used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the issuer.</p>
<p></p>
 Example 
 {
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "e9ea3429-b32f-44ad-b481-b9929370bb90",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "type": [ "VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "issuer": { "id": "did:example:2d28bb79-87a9-4224-8c63-d28b29716b67" },
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "issuanceDate": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "credentialSubject": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "birth_date": "1970-01-01"
 &nbsp;&nbsp; },
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "expirationDate": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  &nbsp; "proof": {}
} 
 Verifiable Presentation 
<p>Verifiable Presentation (VP) is a collection of verifiable credentials. Typically, a VP contains a single VC, but in more complex scenarios (such as selective presentation or delegation) there could be many VCs within a single VP.</p>
<p>VP proof is used to verify the integrity of presentation. Proof is the holder’s counter signature of a collection of VCs where each VC has been individually signed by its issuer.</p>
<p>As with VC, proof is typically expressed as a digital signature made with the private key of the holder. Usually, the VP holder and subject of VCs within the VP is the same. In more complex scenarios, the holder and subject could be different. In such cases some information or rules need to exist that allow correlating VCs.</p>
<p>VP metadata describes properties such as expiration and nonce. The nonce is a random value generated by the relying party when requesting a VP, letting the relying party prevent re-play of VP tokens. In effect, VP is a classic challenge response authentication protocol.</p>
<p></p>
 Example 
 {
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "type": [ "VerifiablePresentation" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "verifiableCredential": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "e9ea3429-b32f-44ad-b481-b9929370bb90",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": [ "VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "issuer": { "id": "did:example:2d28bb79-87a9-4224-8c63-d28b29716b67" },
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "issuanceDate": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "credentialSubject": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "birth_date": "1970-01-01"
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; },
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "expirationDate": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "proof": {}
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "holder": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "proof": {}
} 
 Decentralised Identifier 
<p>A Decentralised Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is used to identify the subject, issuer and holder of verifiable credentials and presentations.</p>
<p>A DID is formatted as a URI starting with prefix “did:”, followed by the scheme identifier and a scheme specific part (did:scheme:address).</p>
<p>Numerous DID schemes have been defined, yet not all schemes have the same capabilities. Some schemes operate on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains. Others take more traditional approaches, such as simply referencing http resources, or even X.509 certificates.</p>
<p>Basically, the DID is an indirect reference to public keys, usually controlled by the entity the DID represents. This way, the keys of an entity can, for example, be rotated without the DID value having to change.</p>
 Example 
 did:example:e762e3b0-1cf9-4899-925f-9a6ae50a8ad6 
 DID document 
<p>The DID scheme defines how to resolve a DID value into a DID document. The DID document is a way to present metadata and public keys of the entity. The public keys are needed to verify VCs and VPs.</p>
 Example 
 {
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "verificationMethod": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867#key-1",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "publicKeyJwk": {}
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "authentication": [ "#key-1" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "assertionMethod": [ "#key-1" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "controller": [ "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867" ]
} 
 Trust Model 
<p>For claims to be verifiable, the relying party must establish trust with the issuer of the VC with the claims.</p>
<p>One possible model for a relying party is to use out of band methods to establish trust, where the relying party simply knows the DID value of the issuer being the trust anchor.</p>
<p>More complex models allow implementing chains of trust where a VC issued by the trust root could delegate trust to other intermediary VC issuers.</p>
<p>Self-attestation is a model where the VC is issued by the subject itself. In this case, the claims are not verifiable but could still be useful depending on the use case.</p>
 Digital Wallet 
<p>The digital wallet application holds VCs from issuers. The wallet creates VPs for relying parties with user’s consent. This application can exist on a user’s device, it can be hosted on a server, or it could be a combination of both.</p>
<p>Simon Wood looks at Identity Wallets used in the vLEI specification in more detail in his blog <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101-issuance-and-wallets/" title="vLEI &amp; Identity Wallets">vLEI &amp; Identity Wallets</a>.</p>
 Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>The wallet plays a critical role in implementation of the self-sovereign concept of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The wallet must not release information to relying parties without the user’s consent. Also, it must not let the VC issuer know when and where the VCs have been used. The latter property is one of the most significant differences compared to traditional OIDC and SAML based federated systems.</p>
 Selective disclosure 
<p>Selective disclosure lets the wallet app compose VPs from selected properties of VCs. This enables a wallet to “pick and choose” claims from VCs without disclosing full details and thus improving privacy. A typical example is a claim such as “age over 18”. This lets a relying party know the subject’s age is over 18 without disclosing the exact date of birth.</p>
 Issuing Credentials 
<p>Users receive VCs from credentials issuers and store the VCs in their wallets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To create VCs, the issuer needs to verify the identity of the user so that it can issue credentials with the correct claims.</p>
<p>Because the VCs are bound to a subject DID, the issuer must also verify the user is in control of the subject DID. One method is for the issuer to request the user to create a digital signature that is verifiable with the public key referenced by the DID.</p>
 OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance 
<p>Federated Identity Providers (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-provider/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/" title="IdP">IdP</a>) already implement user identity verification and they have repositories with claims and other statements about users. It is expected that many IdPs will be extended to become issuers of VCs. The OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (VCI) is a set of extensions to standard OIDC flows that enable interoperability across digital wallets and identity providers. The VCI flow takes care of both DID and identity verification requirements.</p>
 Relying Party 
<p>A Relying Party or Verifier is the entity that receives VCs embedded within a VP from a user’s wallet.</p>
<p>To get a VP from a wallet the Relying Party sends a Presentation Request to the user’s wallet. Properties of the request indicate things like what claims the Relying Party expects to receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After receiving a VP, the task of the verifier is to verify the integrity of both the VCs embedded within a VP and the VP itself. To do so, the verifier must look up public keys of both the subject and the issuer by resolving DIDs.</p>
 OpenID Connect for Self-Issued OP 
<p>To request and receive VPs from a wallet, a set of extensions to standard OIDC flows have been designed. The OpenID Connect for Self-Issued OP (SIOP) flow allows a relying party to request VPs from a wallet using a protocol that resembles the OIDC implicit flow.</p>
 Presentation Exchange 
<p>Presentation Exchange lets a relying party request particular types of credentials and claims. This specification defines filters and conditions that the wallet evaluates when it is constructing a VP from the set of VCs it has stored.</p>
 Example 
 {
  "id": "8cbe12c7-5d6b-4bfa-81c9-57855daebc77",
  "input_descriptors": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "ExampleCredential",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "constraints": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "fields": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "path": [ "$.type" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "filter": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": "array",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "const": [ "VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential" ]
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp; }
  ]
} 
 Token types and formats 
<p>The VC spec itself being very generic does not define any token format. The examples captured in this article are from JSON-LD formatted tokens.</p>
<p>In addition to JSON-LD there exist many other token formats such as VC-JWT, Mobile Driver’s License (mDL), AnonCreds and KERI ACDC. Each token format has its own characteristics, such as text or binary formatting, different cryptographic proof types, support for selective disclosure etc.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The privacy improvements by the Self-Sovereign aspects of Verifiable Credentials are a significant improvement compared to traditional federated systems.</p>
<p>The current W3C VC specification is highly generic. This presents a challenge to implementations wanting to achieve interoperability. Work on the next version of the W3C VC has already started, with the goal of addressing, amongst others, interoperability problems.</p>
<p>OpenID for Verifiable Credentials work simplifies some implementation challenges by reusing concepts and terminology from the very well-known OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 group of specifications.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Undoubtedly, many technology companies enjoyed an outstanding success during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses changed in several fields and we saw situations that we would have rarely expected before: switching to online shopping, online education, remote working, minimizing trips and avoiding human contact, just to mention a few. Lockdown forced humanity to look for a shelter against the confinement, and people found it in technology, which became the main protagonist in our everyday life. This scenario made companies like Zoom, Google, Apple, Meta, and others grow explosively. In the light of this unprecedented growth, IT professionals started claiming more money for the same roles, and technology companies started hiring so many new employees to meet the demand of the market. These events pushed the interest rates down and opened the door to more investors, especially beginners, into the stock market. With this high demand and the prices going up, tech companies have seen their greatest peak between 2020 and 2021. The question now is, if the technology industry seemed so promising and successful in the past two years, why do some professional investors not want to keep the investments up in this market?</p>
<p>Jim Chanos, a well-known American investment manager, compared this phenomenon with the revolution of the dotcom companies in 2000, which he defined as an “era on steroids” due to the exponential growth of these kind of corporations (“<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/06/27900928/short-seller-jim-chanos-betting-against-data-centers-heres-why">Jim Chanos</a>”). On the other hand, and regardless the opinion of some experts, many technology companies affirmed that they had a solid business model, and banks stated low interest rates to ensure cash flow in the market. Some firms could not prove their profitability, thus, they created their own metrics to justify their success. Speculations are not something new in the economy, in fact we have seen this repeated times along the history, and basically it happens when some assets receive a much greater value than their real one. An aggravator in the current context is that the stock market based the value of the companies on something that is not tangible, instead of considering their capabilities to generate business in the coming years, and it was a huge mistake. This pumped a bubble that, unfortunately, has no other future but busting when the reality knocks the door, and it always happens. While some experts such as Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne) say that the tech bubble already popped, others like Chris Senyek (Wolfe Research) say that we are at the edge of it (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/12/twenty-years-after-the-dotcom-crash-is-techs-bubble-about-to-burst-again">The Guardian</a>”).</p>
<p>It is hard to make predictions with all the political, ethical and economic substantial changes going on. The panorama does not look very promising: the new lockdown in China due to the rise in COVID cases caused delays at the Shanghai port, the busiest one in the world. This situation created a slowdown in the supply chain because there are ships waiting to be loaded and unloaded, and this delay impacted the inflation globally. The energy system in Europe counted with Russian resources and, in light of the current conflict, an energy crisis is happening in the continent. The main decision has been to reduce the energy supply, which does not just affect only the European region, but also the world. Apparently many industries are affected and technology is not the exception.</p>
 The beginning of the fall 
<p>Contrary to the popular belief that 2022 would be a year for recovery, many organizations experienced a big fall. The first giant that exposed the situation was Netflix confirming in March the loss of 200.000 subscribers in the first quarter, and the situation worsened in April, when the company decided to withdraw the services from Russia showing support to Ukraine in the war (“<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-04-19/lat-et-ct-netflix-loses-subscriber-first-quarter">Los Angeles Times</a>”). But this is not the only case. Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, PayPal, Amazon, revealed a loss of between 20 to 65% of market capitalization. The same fate has befallen the cryptocurrency industry, which led to freeze the investments, especially from the start-ups. Against this drastic scenario, CEOs and investors opted for a drastic decision: layoffs. The cybersecurity industry for example has strikingly decided to follow this strategy, despite a considerable growth in revenue and increase in ransomware attacks against which they must defend against. But why?</p>
<p>As a justification to this strategy, some experts compare the current crisis to those in 2000 and 2007, indicating that the fall in terms of employees and employability is unavoidable, that they need to protect the companies, and having less employees is a way to lower the expenses. The main focus would be now to direct the budgets to more stable assets. However, there are others saying that this is an alarmist perspective. The reality is that during the growth of the speculative bubble, technology companies spent a considerable amount of money in hiring new employees and in adjusting the company to the value they had in the market. But when the market went back to the real value, all these new employees would not be necessary anymore. &nbsp;In any case it is important to understand the two sides of this coin: the benefits to the company’s finances, and the reaction of internal employees. Looking at this from the business perspective, it is self-explanatory that having fewer employees in a company shows a growth slowdown and considering the decrease in the stock prices it represents a big financial relief. On the other hand, considering the situation from employees’ perspective, seeing many colleagues being fired from their roles awaken a general alert within the organization, and at the same time may push them to improve their performance to avoid being in those shoes. If we look at it from this perspective, a company that is facing difficult times needs people who are motivated to develop new ideas and use their endeavors to move out from that situation. In the end, once the bad times have passed, the organization will only keep those human resources who demonstrate tenacity, creativity, strength and high performance.</p>
<p>Although the advantages seem to be clear, a layoff impacts the business unavoidably. When the company recovers and looks for new talents, people will think twice before accepting an offer because they might think that their position would be at risk against the possibility of another financial crisis. Going deeper, we can think about the legal consequences for the company. There are agreements in different countries to compensate taxes for instance, and a massive layoff could affect the initial negotiations with the governments. In a similar vein, if the company decides to go for a merger to preserve the business, legal issues and employees’ condition would be a determinant factor that could block the negotiation. It is difficult to deny that a massive layoff causes stress on the employees, and if the situation escalated, probably some companies would discard the possibility of merging, reducing then the chances to get a better deal.</p>
 What comes next? 
<p>With the volatility of the market in sight, and the political and economic uncertainty present, many companies are just in a brief pause to analyze the full picture and decide the next steps. Financial analysts and investors recommend putting the money into companies that base their value in solid and tangible actives, and to split the investment, avoiding big expectations only on one of them. Experienced investors are very careful at the moment when investing in technology companies because it is highly risky to root for companies that created their own metrics to justify their great valuation in the market instead of having a look at the actual profits and benefits of the organizations. It is true that during at least the last 10 years, the market has prioritized the growth over the stability, and this offered more uncertainty around the economy. However, there is something certain, and is that the show must go on. A good way to go would be looking at the current scenario not as a crisis, but as a stage in which technology companies should come up with new and more attractive ideas to offer in the market, other than new metrics and promises. Moreover, we could say that the companies should work on low-cost proposals and B2B agreements, where the boost of income could make a great impact to some extent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is definite that surviving in a highly competent market such as the IT sector is hard, and although layoffs seem to be the necessary path to cut the budget, there are other solutions that could make a less tragic impact to the business, the society and the global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock has released a new feature on the mobile <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> app enabling users to create and manage decentralized identifiers that empower them to fully own and control their data.  Centralized and federated (e.g. signing in with a Facebook and Google account) identifiers can make organizations a target for large scale data breaches and enable companies to track people’s online behaviour as well as share their personal data without their knowledge. DIDs help users prevent tracking and correlation.  With the Dock Wallet, users can securely create, export, import, edit, delete, and copy/share their DIDs. The wallet enables users to fully own, control, and manage their credentials that are issued as Verifiable Credentials such as a university degree or government ID.  <p>We’re excited to announce that users can now conveniently create and manage their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) from the <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> phone app. Up until recently, people were using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> to create their DIDs. The Dock Wallet enables users to fully own, control, and manage credentials that are issued as <a href="https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a> such as training certificates, driver’s license, and university degree.</p><p>We’ll go over step-by-step instructions on how to create, export, import, edit, delete, and copy/share your DIDs.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What Are DIDs and Why Do They Matter? <p>For a long time we have been using user names, passwords, and emails which are centralized and/or federated (e.g. signing in with a Facebook or Google account) digital identifiers to access apps and websites. But these identifiers often enable many companies like Google to use data to track online behaviour, resulting in people’s data being used for ad targeting, and organizations risk being a target of hacks or large scale data breaches when they store user information on centralized storage systems. </p><p>In contrast to centralized identifiers, <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) solve many of these problems. They enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. </p><p>A decentralized identifier is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is independent of any organization. </p><p>Example of a Dock DID:</p>You can create as many decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as you want for different purposes.<p>DIDs:</p>  Allows the owner (organization or individual) to fully own and control their data  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Don’t contain personal data or wallet information  Enable private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  Can be associated with Verifiable Credentials  <p>You can make as many DIDs as you want for different purposes or interactions. For example you can have: </p>  DID 1: Used only for educational purposes that store credentials like a university degree and training certificates  DID 2: Used only for buying and trading NFTs  DID 3: Used only to hold different types of IDs like driver’s license, state ID, and passport  You can conveniently select which DID you want to use to authorize a verifier to receive data. DIDs and Verifiable Credentials <p>Verifiable Credentials are digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. These credentials are associated with the DIDs you create. </p><p>Examples of documents that can be issued as Verifiable Credentials:</p>  Driver’s license  University and college degrees  Passport  Course/training completion certificates  Your Verifiable Credentials are associated with the different DIDs you create.<p>Below are Step-By-Step instructions on how to create and manage your DIDs from the Dock Wallet.</p> Create a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Select DIDs at the bottom of your wallet and click on the + sign on the top right of the screen</p><p>Step 2: Select Create New DID</p><p>Step 3: Name your DID like educational credentials, NFTs, IDs etc. and select Create</p><p>Step 4: Choose a DID type. Difference between the two keys:</p><p>did:key</p><p>did:dock</p><p>Free to create this type of DID</p><p>Costs tokens to create this type of DID</p><p>DID isn’t stored anywhere</p><p>DID is stored on the blockchain</p><br><p>Will later have the capability to support several key pairs so you can choose which key pair to apply such as using different keys for different applications while still using the same DID.</p><p>Step 5: Select Create after selecting did:key for example and naming it</p><p>For the advanced options for developers:</p>  Schnorrkel (sr25519, recommended): Determines what cryptography will be used to create this account. Note that to validate on Polkadot, the session account must use “ed25519”.  Secret deviation path: You can set a custom derivation path for this account using the following syntax “/&lt;soft-key&gt;//&lt;hard-key&gt;”. The “/&lt;soft-key&gt;” and “//&lt;hard-key&gt;” may be repeated and mixed. An optional “///&lt;password&gt;” can be used with a mnemonic seed, and may only be specified once.  <p>Step 6: did:key is created</p><p>Step 7: This is the next step if you select did:dock. Name your DID and select the DID Payment Account. If you have multiple accounts, you will see an extra field on this screen for you to choose which account to use to pay for the DID.</p><p>Step 8: Select Confirm. </p><p>Step 9: You now have a new DID!</p> Export a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Click on the three dots of the DID you want to export and click Export DID</p><p>Step 2: Create a password</p><p>Step 3: Choose where you want to send your DID.</p> Import a DID <p></p><p>If your DID was created somewhere else like Dock Certs, you can export a DID and later import it into the Dock Wallet. </p><p>Step 1: Click on the three dots of the DID you want to import and click Import existing DID</p><p><br>Step 2: Select the DID JSON file. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your wallet password.</p><p>Step 4: Enter a DID name like “online shopping”</p><p>Step 5: Your DID has successfully been imported.</p> Edit a DID <p>Step 1: Select the three dots for the DID you want to edit and select Edit DID</p><p>Step 2: Enter a DID name and press Save</p><p>Step 3: The DID name has been edited.</p> Delete a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Select the three dots for the DID you want to delete and select Delete DID</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Select Delete</p> Copy/Share a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Click Share</p><p>Step 2: Copy the DID and share it where you want.</p> Conclusion <p>Dock has released a new feature in the mobile Dock Wallet app enabling users to create and manage decentralized identifiers that empower them to fully own and control their data. Centralized and federated identifiers are less secure because they are often at risk of being a target for large-scale data breaches, hacks, and tracking/storing user data. </p><p>Decentralized identifiers enable organizations and people to fully own and control their data. People can create as many DIDs as they want for different interactions and purposes.

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know about the new regulatory framework.&nbsp; 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was provisionally agreed-upon by the European Parliament on June 30, 2022, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto-asset sector. MiCA is also likely to attract operators and users to the market, as it is the first regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) at EU level. &nbsp;</p>



 What is MiCA?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA is a regulatory framework for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets</a> traded on digital platforms. It covers three types of crypto assets: Utility tokens, which provide access to goods or services;- payment tokens, which are used as a means of payment or can be traded for other MiCA-regulated tokens; and e-money tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies and used to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>



 What does MiCA do?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has established rules for the issuance, admission to trading, and operation of crypto assets, as well as requirements for the providers of crypto asset services. The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) has been set up to specifically promote cooperation between member states on blockchain technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the benefits of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has a number of benefits, including better regulatory clarity for CASPs in the EU, improved investor protection, enhanced financial stability, and the promotion of innovation. MiCA will also make it easier for member states to cooperate on blockchain technology, as the EBP will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of best practices.&nbsp;</p>



 Who will MiCA impact?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will impact all CASPs offering services to clients in the EU. This includes exchanges, custodian wallet providers, issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other CASPs. MiCA will not apply to persons who buy or sell crypto assets for their own account.&nbsp;</p>



 What does this mean for non-European crypto service providers?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How will MiCA play into AML regulation?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will complement the EU’s existing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD)</a> by providing a specific regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will require CASPs to put in place <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML measures</a>, such as Customer Due Diligence and reporting of suspicious transactions. MiCA will also allow national competent authorities to exchange information on suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities involving crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses. However, CASPs will need to ensure that they comply with MiCA’s rules and requirements when they come into effect.&nbsp;</p>



 When will MiCA come into effect?&nbsp; 



<p>The MiCA regulation is still subject to approval by the European Parliament and the European Council. The European Commission will also need to implement further acts to specify certain technical requirements for MiCA-regulated activities. MiCA is expected to come into effect by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CASPs are recommended to stay up to date with MiCA, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure they remain compliant.&nbsp;</p>

  Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know.&nbsp; On June 29, 2022, the European Union published a provisional agreement on the transparency of crypto asset transfers.

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know.&nbsp; 



<p>On June 29, 2022, the European Union published a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/anti-money-laundering-provisional-agreement-reached-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">provisional agreement on the transparency of crypto asset transfers</a>. The agreement will extend the European Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) to include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets,</a> meaning that the sender and beneficiary of all applicable or centralized crypto transactions need to be identified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opponents to the new regulation argue that TRF violates EU charters on privacy, and that the collection of Personal Identification Data will not necessarily help in the fight against money laundering. While those in the crypto community that relished the anonymity of decentralized transactions are likely to be unhappy with this development, others see it as a sign that regulation is finally catching up with the industry and bringing much-needed clarity for crypto asset service providers (CASPs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, though, is that the greater safeguards are sure to go some way to tackling fraudsters and scammers in the area of digital – fiat currency conversion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tighter regulations mean that not only will regulators track crypto to fiat exchanges, but they will also be monitoring decentralized transactions where a transfer is made between a centralized service provider and an unhosted wallet. This looks set to change the anonymity of operating in a decentralized self-sovereign environment.&nbsp;</p>



 Why was TFR extended to crypto assets?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The regulation is a response to the growing use of crypto assets for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">terrorist financing</a>. Crypto assets are often used for these purposes because they can be transferred quickly and anonymously. By requiring information on the source and beneficiary of the funds, authorities will be able to track these transactions and investigate any suspicious activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the latest TRF update, the European Union is catching up, and beginning to implement some of the recommendations from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, the global money laundering and terrorist financing organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/non-fungible-token/">Non fungible tokens (NFTs),</a> which represent ownership in digital art or other collectibles, are currently excluded from the scope of these rules. Within the next 18 months, the European Commission will evaluate whether certain NFTs should fall into this scope or require their own regulatory regime.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the new rules for crypto transactions?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>CASPs will now be required to collect and store information on the source and beneficiary of the funds for each transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This rule, known as the “travel rule”, already exists in traditional finance and requires that information on the source of the asset and its beneficiary travels with the transaction and is stored on both sides of the transfer. CASPs will be obliged to provide this information to competent authorities if an investigation is conducted into money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Does this include transactions to and from unhosted wallets?&nbsp; 



<p>In contrast to the original proposals, the current agreement now excludes private unhosted wallets that are not operated by regulated CASPs. In practice, this means that private wallets and person-to-person transfers conducted without a provider do not fall under the requirements of the “travel rule”.&nbsp;</p>



 What does this mean for CASPs?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The new rules will require CASPs to perform a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC-check</a> on the source and beneficiary of the funds for crypto transactions. This information must be made available to competent authorities if an investigation is conducted. In addition, crypto transfers above €1000 between exchanges and unhosted wallets owned by an individual will need to be reported to the national authorities. Crypto peer-to-peer wallets that are not hosted by a provider will not be subject to these rules.&nbsp;</p>



 When will the agreement come into effect?&nbsp; 



<p>Updates to the TRF regulation are expected to come into effect as part of a greater package of updates to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th AML directive (AMLD5) </a>by 2023. TRF updates are also expected to be aligned to the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/">Markets in Crytpo Assets (MiCA)</a> regulation, which will introduce a European licensing scheme for CASPs. These regulations are expected to be in force by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As one of the largest KYC providers in Europe, serving clients globally and locally, we have a clear view of this industry from a unique perspective. First, we support ‘smart regulation’ which, above all, is aimed at building trust in this digital ecosystem. The crypto space, which has grown at unprecedented speed, offers investors big and small a new and creative way to invest. The fragmented regulatory landscape has produced opportunities for significant gain and loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>



<p>“For adoption to grow into mainstream and to curtail scams and fraud, harmonized standards and accountability are essential to continue growth. The EU’s new rules offer a path forward that will allow Europe to become a mature crypto hub. KYC will play a central role and IDnow is here to support issuers and providers with meeting their compliance requirements,”&nbsp;added Armata.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Users will benefit from the transition to decentralized identity.&nbsp; 



<p>Identity and access management, or IAM, is the security function that makes it possible for the right users to access the right resources (applications or data).</p>



<p>IAM solutions are widely deployed and very mature, but for users the current approaches fall short. These solutions are difficult to manage, privacy invasive, and often lead to unwanted outcomes such as identity and financial theft.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a new approach to IAM. It overcomes many of the current IAM shortcomings and focuses on the user’s needs. DI simplifies how cryptography is applied so that it better protects a user’s resources while making it even easier for them to use.</p>



 Legacy IAM: a Centralized Identity Architecture&nbsp; 



<p>The first and perhaps still the most common type of IAM is based on a centralized model. In this model, a user signs up directly with a service (e.g., creating an account). During signup (and subsequent logins), the user gives the service personally identifiable information (PII) such as username, password, email address, mobile phone number, credit card information and other types of personal data. Typically these days, the user will also set up two factor authentication (2FA) to strengthen user authentication, which can require even more PII.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using IAM terminology, the service is both the identity provider (creates the user’s account and stores user attributes) and the service provider (provides the application and data). The access control policy is implemented at the service and it’s common to find group-based, role-based, and attribute-based models (or combinations) in use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, an enterprise’s employees and customers all use this centralized model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Centralized IAM has some key drawbacks for the user:</p>



  Remembering:&nbsp;Over a few years, users could create hundreds of service accounts. For each account, they must remember all their different username (could be email, phone #, or custom) and password combinations. Ideally, each account has a different password (for security) and username (for privacy). If the user has enabled 2FA, they must also give additional information at login (e.g., a one-time password or SMS code). The growth in the password manager products market is testimony to just how difficult users can find managing accounts and authentications.&nbsp;  New PII tracking:&nbsp;Users are providing their PII data to many different services—perhaps 200+. This puts the user’s PII data at great risk since any of those services could sell the data they collect or have their user information stolen. Consequently, loss of privacy, identity theft, and financial theft are on the rise.&nbsp;  



<p>Figure 1 shows the centralized model. With this model, the service is both an identity provider and a service provider. It also maintains the access control policy. Users create accounts on the service, provide it with PII, and access the service.&nbsp;</p>



Figure&nbsp;1: Centralized IAM



 Federated Model for IAM&nbsp; 



<p>The second most common type of IAM is where a user signs up with a major identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple, etc.). When users want to access a new service, instead of creating a new account, they use federated login (or social login). Usually this appears as a “Sign in with …” login on the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under this model, the identity provider and the service provider are distinctly separate. Using protocols such as SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect, the user is federated from the identity provider to the service provider. Both providers maintain a trust relationship between them. The user no longer needs to be authenticated at the service provider. At first glance, this improves on the centralized IAM model, because the number of services where a user must create an account is markedly reduced and the user uses fewer username/password/2FA combinations. While this model is much more manageable for the user, it&nbsp;significantly impacts the user’s privacy&nbsp;since&nbsp;the identity provider knows all the federated services the user accesses, when they connect, and which of the user’s PII the service provider is using.<a>[1]</a></p>



<p>The service provider creates the access control policy and requests the user’s PII from the identity provider as required. There can be only one identity provider for the user at this service provider—whereas decentralized identity users can present credentials from multiple identity providers (more later). The downside is that the user’s personal data is still being distributed among numerous services, which impacts the user’s privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The user doesn’t own their identity provider’s account. If the identity provider (e.g., Facebook) suspends or deletes the user’s account, the user is cut off from the identity provider as well as from any services that were federated through the service provider!</p>



<p>Figure 2 gives an overview of the federated model. The identity provider and the service provider are distinctly separate, but there is still a trust relationship between them. The service provider also creates the access control policy, which determine how a user’s PII is used and disseminated. The service provider requests PII from the identity provider.</p>



Figure&nbsp;2: Federated model for IAM



 Decentralized Identity Model for IAM&nbsp; 



<p>DI is specifically designed to improve security and the user experience. DI is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34632/decentralized-identity">described</a>&nbsp;as:</p>



<p>… an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>The DI approach is quite different from the centralized and federated identity models. While identity providers still exist in this model, they are providers of cryptographic verifiable credentials (VCs). VCs are signed electronic data structures that carry claims about the user, which the identity provider asserts. VCs have many security benefits for the receiver of the credential (service provider). Specifically, the receiver of the credential can:</p>



  Be assured of the identity of the identity provider (creator) of the credential  Be assured of the integrity of the credential (it can’t be modified without detection)  Be assured the identity provider hasn’t revoked the credential  Accept credentials from different identity providers (credential issuers), which can contribute to the access control policy. This creates resilience when some credentials may have expired (e.g., use a passport’s claims when a driver license may have expired).  



<p>An identity provider issues a VC to the user for storing in the user’s identity wallet. The identity wallet is an element that DI systems introduce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized ledger (e.g., Sovrin, Indicio, cheqd, etc.) provides the foundation of trust in the DI environment. This new component replaces the functionality that centralized identity systems (e.g., centralized PKI) currently provide.<a>[2]</a></p>



<p>When the user wants to access a service (the service provider), they assert claims from the VCs (received from one or more identity providers). This assertion/presentation of claims process is done via a&nbsp;proof&nbsp;of possession and control of the credential. The user uses their identity wallet to present the requested claims to the service provider. The access control policy at the service provider is based on attribute-based access control (ABAC) since the decisions are made on the attributes/claims present in the credentials.</p>



<p>Two important aspects of DI relate to the user presenting VC proofs to the service provider:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity provider doesn’t need to be aware of the legal identity of the user accessing the service provider and there is no interaction between service provider and identity provider.<a>[3]</a>  The user is in full control of approving or denying what PII (from their VCs) is presented to the service provider. Both aspects improve privacy and security over the centralized and federated models by&nbsp;asserting&nbsp;authentication information rather than&nbsp;providing&nbsp;it.  



Figure&nbsp;3: DI-based IAM



<p>Figure 3 presents the DI model. The identity provider and service provider activity is distinctly separate, but there is still a trust relationship between them. The identity provider issues VCs (containing claims) to the user. The user holds the credentials and presents them (as proofs) when required at the service provider. The service provider creates the access control policy, which is attribute-based.&nbsp;</p>



 The Role of the Identity Wallet 



<p>The identity wallet is at the heart of the DI user experience. In the wallet, the user creates and manages their decentralized identities and any VCs they receive. For each new decentralized identity, the wallet creates a:</p>



  Private/public key pair (usually based on elliptic curve cryptography such as ed25519)  Decentralized identifier (DID).  



<p>Once the wallet has created a key pair/DID, the user can interact with a DI ecosystem. To communicate and receive a VC from an identity provider, the wallet establishes a DIDComm connection (a durable, secure connection to allow two parties to communicate) between the identity wallet and the identity provider. In the same way, the identity wallet establishes a DIDComm connection with the service provider to present (as proof) claims from the VCs. This process introduces strong cryptography, but the user is no longer required to remember and present a username/password to either the identity provider or the service provider. This simplification comes from allowing the user to be authenticated after demonstrating&nbsp;control&nbsp;of the decentralized identity’s private key, rather than by presenting a secret credential (e.g., password).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 4 displays a few screens from the Sudo Platform’s mobile identity wallet. On the left, the user can view any VCs currently stored in the identity wallet. The second screen is a list of (DIDComm) connections the wallet has established. The third screen shows the user selecting specific PII elements to share from a credential. The fourth screen shows activities related to that credential.</p>



Figure&nbsp;4: Sudo Platform identity wallet



 The Role of VCs&nbsp; 



<p>VCs are the core technology enabling DI-based IAM. An identity provider creates VCs and issues them to a user who can later assert them (or a subset of their claims) to a service provider. VCs are designed for protecting the user’s privacy, and have privacy/security preserving innovations:<br></p>



  Service providers never need to communicate the user’s actions to the identity provider.  Users can control what PII from a VC is available to the service provider. They might disclose all of a credential’s claims, a subset of the claims, or even privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs or ZKPs (more later).  Service providers can be sure of the identity of the VC creator, that the credentials haven’t been modified, and that the identity provider hasn’t revoked the credentials.&nbsp;  Users no longer need username and password combinations to connect with the identity provider and the service provider.  



<p>There are two VC standards:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Credentials</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anonymous Credentials</a>&nbsp;(AnonCreds).</p>



 The Role of the Decentralized Identity Ledger 



<p>The DI ledger is another new component of the DI-based IAM model. It provides the foundation of trust to the environment and functions loosely like a&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;PKI. Many different DI ledgers exist; the most common are Hyperledger Indy-based ledgers.</p>



<p>Before an identity provider can issue credentials to a user, they must first establish their own identity foundation on a DI ledger. This process (using Hyperledger Indy as an example) includes writing to the ledger the:</p>



  Issuer’s DID&nbsp;  Schema of the credential&nbsp;  Credential definition (relates the Issuer DID and credential schema)&nbsp;  Revocation definition (in the case where the service provider needs to check on whether a credential has been revoked).  



<p>Since the DI ledger stores this information, the service provider can accept the security of a VC without having to check with the identity provider directly.</p>



 The Role of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 



<p>ABAC is the natural embodiment of the DI-based IAM system. This process enables the user to present claims (based on elements contained within VCs) to the service provider, and the service provider should be able to authenticate a user’s identity based on those claims. For example:</p>



<p>If a user presents a claim from a valid US driver license stating they are over age 21, they can avoid presenting their actual birth date. This allows a receiving merchant/verifier to verify whether a customer is over the minimum age required for certain activities, such as purchasing alcohol.</p>



<p>If a user presents proofs from their US passport, COVID-19 vaccine certificate, and a country visa, a receiving airline can verify whether a traveller meets current travel requirements and thereby is allowed to purchase plane tickets to that country.</p>



 The Full DI-Based IAM Model—Putting It All Together 



<p>Figure 5 gives an overview of the full DI-based IAM model. The identity providers issue VCs to users. Users store those VCs in their identity wallets. To access a resource from a desired service, the user presents verifiable claims (i.e., elements of the VCs) to the service provider. The service provider’s verifiable credential verifier checks the claims have not been altered, are issued by a trusted identity provider, and the containing credentials have not been revoked. If the verifier is satisfied in all those conditions, it can present the claims to the policy decision point so they can make a decision according to the ABAC policy.</p>



Figure&nbsp;5: DI-based IAM



 A Practical Security Use Case&nbsp; 



<p>One of the major advantages of DI is&nbsp;better security but simpler interactions. A user can be issued VCs into their wallet and subsequently present them on request to a service provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 6 gives an example of a user who is trying to find a new job. They apply for positions listed at an employment service. Before the employment service will put forward the user’s application to prospective employers, the service wants to verify two things:</p>



  User identity (KYC): The employment service asks the user to present their driver license (via a VC proof).  University qualifications&nbsp;(as listed on their resume): The employment service asks the user to present their university qualification (again, via a VC proof).  



<p>Since the user has previously received a VC-based driver license from their state department of motor vehicles (DMV) and a verifiable credential-based university qualification from their university, this process is convenient and easy for both the user and the employment service. Neither of them has to deal with paper copies or credentials (copying them and having them certified) or force in-person meetings. Everything can be done immediately and easily via electronic transfers.</p>



<p>The other advantage for the user is&nbsp;privacy. The employment service does not have to communicate with either the DMV or the university to confirm the VC proofs. Just by accessing the ledger, the employment agency can be sure the credentials are authentic and have not been revoked.</p>



Figure&nbsp;6: Applying for a job through an employment service



 Privacy-Preserving Use Cases 



<p>The employment service use case we just discussed shows how DI increases identity security while keeping interactions simpler and more private for the user. In that example, a user conveyed their full identity and their university qualifications to an employment service. This required the secure transfer of specific information elements from the VCs. Many use cases follow this paradigm.</p>



<p>Another type of use case focuses on preserving the user’s privacy. These use cases do not require the user to disclose actual data elements from VCs. Instead, they require only a ‘true’ or ‘false’ assertion based on those values. The proof method is cryptographically generated using a function known as a zero knowledge proof (ZKP). ZKPs allow a prover to prove a data item to a verifier without disclosing the data item itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These next uses cases illustrate when a ZKP-based verification is better than disclosing specific data elements:</p>



  Proof of age: In some countries, individuals must attain a set age before they can perform certain actions, such as purchasing alcohol. To prove their age, the person could use a driver license or passport, because these documents show their actual birth date. But disclosing their birth date would be providing too much PII since they are only really required to prove they are older or younger than the specified age. Instead, the person could use a ZKP to assert they are over the minimum age and safeguard their actual birth date.  Proof of qualification: Some jobs require a college degree as a qualification of employment. When applying for these jobs through an employment service, a person might only need to use a ZKP to assert they hold a college degree rather than disclose PII such as their alma mater, dates of enrolment, GPA, transcript information, etc. Giving only the required information (possession of a degree) means the user keeps their more unique information hidden and therefore more secure.  Proof of residency: In some locales, certain rights are conveyed only to residents since they pay taxes and visitors do not. A resident could use their driver license or passport to assert eligibility, but these documents would reveal more PII, such as street address and date of birth. If the resident used a ZKP, they could assert their residency without disclosing any unnecessary personal information that could be misused.&nbsp;  



<p>In each use case, the user could prove they meet the specified criteria (e.g., age, college degree, residency) without disclosing more specific information than necessary. This type of credential proof allows people to stay in control of their private information and grant access to it only as needed.</p>

<p>With so many login attacks out there, it’s hard to keep track of them all, but credential stuffing is on the rise and is important to be able to recognize.</p>
<p>What is credential stuffing? Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack that uses stolen usernames and passwords, AKA credentials, and enters them into many, many login forms in an attempt to gain access to these accounts.</p>
 How Are Passwords Compromised? 
<p>Passwords are by far the most common form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a>; as such, they are often the most vulnerable form of authentication credential. This is because, like all other forms of data, passwords have to be stored and protected in various ways… and anytime you store information, there are often several ways that information may be compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, login credentials can be compromised through a few basic methods:</p>
 
 Database Breach: Platforms often store passwords in databases, against which they compare login credentials to authenticate users. For the most part, intelligent and security-focused enterprises encrypt databases, using hashes to obfuscate passwords. However, many old and unprepared databases may still use cleartext storage.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In either case, if a hacker steals passwords from a database they can read, they can link the username and password to each other. Additionally, since usernames are often emails, the hacker has access to the user’s email address.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Engineering: One of the most common forms of hacking, social engineering involves gaining access to information or system resources through social interactions–typically, emails or other messages that pose as legitimate business communications.<br>
<br>
Suppose an employee falls prey to such an attack. In that case, they don’t just give up their own account–they give up the knowledge that a particular account name and password combination potentially works for other systems and platforms.<br>
<br>
Of course, if a hacker tricks an administrator with access to user credentials, then all bets are off. Such an attack can be more damaging than a database breach because the hacker can extract completely unprotected user data from the system. 
 Brute Force Attacks: While not as famous as the other versions of hacks, brute force attacks can compromise passwords in the same way as a social engineering or breach attack. 
 
<p>Compromised passwords are the cornerstone of credential stuffing attacks. Without stolen passwords, there is no ability to perform such an attack.&nbsp;</p>
 What is a Credential Stuffing Attack? 
<p>Credential stuffing is an attack where hackers take stolen credentials from one platform and attempt to use or “stuff” them into as many different platforms, service providers, or institutions as possible. For example, suppose a hack exposes a database of usernames and passwords from a retailer. In that case, hackers will then attempt to use those credentials on hundreds of common platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, banking websites, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timeline for a credential stuffing attack will generally follow a specific timeline:</p>
 
 Database Breach: An attack, either through a direct database hack, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attack</a>, or brute force attack, uncovers a database of authentication credentials.&nbsp; 
 Stolen Data Purchase or Distribution: This database is advertised, either to the public or via the dark web. Some hackers will announce their attacks and release the information to the public. Most will attempt to sell that database to the highest bidders.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note that a database isn’t a finite thing. Hackers will sell that information to anyone willing to pay, which means a massive potential for credential stuffing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Automated Brute Force Attacks: Once a hacker has possession of an authentication database, they will feed it into automation tools that attempt to use these credentials (and, in some cases, modified versions of the credentials via dictionary or hybrid attacks) to open any other account on other popular platforms.&nbsp; 
 Account Compromise: If the login credentials match another account, the hacker now has access and may use that account to launch further attacks, steal money or personal information, or commit fraud.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When combined with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a> tactics, stuffing can threaten users across hundreds of providers and platforms.</p>
 The Increase of Credential Stuffing Attacks 
<p>Poor cyber hygiene has led to the drastic rise in credential stuffing attacks. The unfortunate reality of cybersecurity is that the human element is often the weakest link, which is no truer than in authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does that lead to credential stuffing attacks? Simply put, when users reuse credentials (specifically login names and passwords) across different accounts, they open up both accounts to attack. This is because if one is compromised, the other may be as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, this isn’t the user’s fault–for example, if one platform experiences a data breach, the user bears some responsibility to change their passwords, but they didn’t cause the problem. However, poor judgment during a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">phishing attack</a> means that a user could potentially threaten two or more systems.</p>
<p>And, with consumers juggling dozens of different accounts, the temptation to just use the same credentials is real. This is why, as <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/05/20/financial-services-credential-stuffing/">reported by Security Intelligence</a>, there were 193 billion credential stuffing attacks in 2020 alone.&nbsp;</p>
 How Can I Defend Against Credential Stuffing Attacks? 
<p>Some of the best defenses against credential stuffing attacks are implementing best practices in your organization, and encouraging users to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common defenses against credential stuffing attacks include:</p>
 
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): One of the weaknesses of single-factor password authentication is that there is no way to ensure the user is who they say they are. MFA prevents this in most cases because the secondary authentication methods (biometrics, one-time passwords) will usually be tied to the user or their devices.&nbsp; 
 
<p>If the hacker has the user’s device (unlikely in a broad stuffing attack), then advanced spoof prevention measures can close the security gap.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secondary Passwords: You can often mitigate credential stuffing by requiring other credentials, like a secondary password or PIN alongside a password.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note that secondary passwords aren’t MFA. Multi-factor authentication requires different types of authentication. However, multiple passwords can blunt a stuffing attack because it’s unlikely the hacker would have the right combination of two different passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 
 CAPTCHA: CAPTCHA requires a human user to interact with an image or audio artifact to verify their liveness. Automated credential stuffing attacks aren’t typically equipped to interact with individual CAPTCHA challenges. However, if the attacker is targeting a specific person and not dozens, they might easily bypass this.&nbsp; 
 
 Shore Up Your Password Defenses with 1Kosmos 
<p>Passwords are often the weakest link in authentication security. Users simply cannot juggle so many passwords while maintaining adequate security. The result? Unintended and risky security holes where a weakness on one platform can undermine security on another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the answer? A modern identity and authentication platform removes typical password system weaknesses. 1Kosmos BlockID offers <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication </a>bolstered with biometrics, identity proofing, and an intuitive user experience that encourages users to employ good cyber hygiene practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos supports security against credential stuffing with the following key features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. This form of authentication would eliminate the threat of a credential stuffing attack as we eliminate credentials.&nbsp; 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.&nbsp; 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK.

America First Credit Union has announced the available of a mobile driver’s license for AFCU members in Utah, marking an unusual twist in the state’s broader effort to roll out digital identity credentials. To be clear, AFCU isn’t issuing the digital driver’s licenses, though you’d be forgiven for getting that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/utah-plans-biometric-self-enrolment-for-mobile-drivers-license-081701/">(more…)</a><p>The post <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/utah-plans-biometric-self-enrolment-for-mobile-drivers-license-081701/">Utah Plans Biometric Self-enrolment for Mobile Driver’s License</a> appeared first on <a href="https://findbiometrics.com">FindBiometrics</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/08/six-takeaways-from-gartner-hype-cycle-for-digital-identity-2022/&nbsp;">Six Takeaways from Gartner® Hype Cycle™ for Digital Identity, 2022</a></p>
<p>KeyFactor recently looked at key insights from the Gartner Hype Cycle for digital identity in 2022 and broke down what they meant. One interesting point they make is that while most people think of digital identity in terms of how people identify themselves online, the proliferation of IoT devices in recent years means that machine identity is outpacing human identity. With machine identity incorporating digital devices of all kinds, APIs, applications and containers, Gartner notes that the ratio of machine identities to humans is now 10:1. The result? A growing concern that many security teams are struggling to keep up. As bad actors adapt to the new increase in targets, Security Boulevard reports that “attacks grew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/venafi/the-future-of-security-lies-in-machine-identity-management/">400% from 2017 to 2021</a>, and in 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-security-and-risk-trends-for-2021">50% of cloud security failures</a> resulted from inadequate management of machine identities and permissions.” You can find the full Gartner Hype Cycle report here.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.cuna.org/articles/121322-synthetic-identity-fraud-the-chameleon-of-fraud-trends&nbsp;">Synthetic identity fraud: The chameleon of fraud trends</a></p>
<p>In our ever expanding virtual world this article serves as an excellent reminder to be selective about&nbsp; whom you share your data with, and who you allow access to. Eric Tran-Le, Vice President and head of Actimize Premier at NICE Actimize, writing on behalf of the Credit Union National Association, provides a deep dive into what synthetic identity fraud is. Synthetic identity fraud is when someone cobbles together a new identity from whatever authentic information they can find and falsifies the rest. Tran-Le explains that&nbsp; this type of fraud is so difficult to catch because&nbsp; “Financial institutions [are] struggling with the lack of a single source of truth for identity verification, siloed identity verification data sources, and inaccurate identity data across data sources.” Being able to trust who they are talking to on the customer side is critical for financial institutions, and Tran-Le touches on a few ideas for how to reduce risk before the article ends. We would adjust that list slightly in order to add the option for verifiable credential solutions, which Indicio has delivered for several financial institutions, and is the backbone of our recently launched <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> actionable credential suite: Indicio’s open source answer for any organization needing a trusted, verifiable, and complete data solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ&nbsp;">Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022</a></p>
<p>IBM recently published their Cost of a Data Breach Report for 2022 and some of the numbers are staggering: From the global average total cost of a data breach being USD 4.35 million to it taking, on average, 277 days to identify and contain a data breach, the numbers signal the high cost of cyber insecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few of the statistics we found interesting – and terrifying:</p>
 
 83% of companies that suffered a data breach admit it’s not their first one 
 “organizations that don’t deploy zero trust incur an average of USD 1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that do deploy” 
 “The most common initial attack vector in 2022 was stolen or compromised credentials, responsible for 19% of breaches in the study” 
 
<p>A quick reminder that decentralized verifiable credentials facilitate the continuous verification required by Zero Trust approaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/digital-healthcare-security/141202/">Digital healthcare adoption requires better security</a></p>
<p>Ansgar Steden, the Chief Revenue Officer for Utimaco, provides a unique look into the security of healthcare and the trust the public have in that security in this article for Open Access Government. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic there was a significant rise in virtual healthcare, with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) app&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/16-million-repeat-prescriptions-the-power-of-a-digital-nhs/140226/">being downloaded over 16 million times.</a>” Now, the NHS is looking into using technology to improve the healthcare available virtually. Some of the ideas include: access to high definition remote operations, connecting ambulances to more immediately see patients in critical conditions, and devices for real time monitoring of patients’ vitals. While these are all things that would be helpful to doctors and patients, the volume of sensitive information needing to be shared presents a massive security risk. Indeed, hospitals and healthcare organizations are already the sector paying the most for data breaches according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ">IBM’s Data Breach Report</a>. The article calls out the need for increased trust before these new features will see widespread adoption, saying, “Devices need to ‘know and trust’ each other and so digital identity becomes paramount.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the best solution is decentralized verifiable credentials that provide privacy-preserving features. There’s an entire open-source codebase developed by Indicio and SITA&nbsp; that can be deployed for these kinds of use cases at the <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea Project</a> at Linux Foundation Public Health.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre. 
<p>In our series opener, Ann Cavoukian discusses Privacy by Design – the 7 foundational principles, the issues that it aims to solve and how Privacy by Design has evolved and is being used in today’s tech products.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“You want to prevent the privacy harms from arising, not just resolve them after the fact, you want to prevent them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Ann Cavoukian is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts.&nbsp;Dr. Cavoukian served an&nbsp;unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognising Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Dr. Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Law, Science &amp; Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to join us a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And you might have heard about Privacy by Design before all the influence that has had in products and regulations, et cetera. And today, we’ll hear about that from its own creator. So, our guest today is Dr. Ann Cavoukian. She is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts.</p>
<p>Dr. Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, network infrastructure, and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. Today, Dr. Cavoukian is the Executive Director of the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre. Good morning.</p>
<p>Dr. Ann Cavoukian: Good morning, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And it’s fantastic having the pleasure of having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Ann: Thank you. It’s my pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us shortly how, yeah, your journey to this word of privacy and digital identity?</p>
<p>Ann: Well, you know, it’s interesting. When I became Privacy Commissioner, for the first term in ’97, I think, I joined the office and it was full of brilliant lawyers who wanted to apply the law to data breach or privacy infraction and get a good resolution, which is great. But I wanted something earlier than that. I wanted something that was proactive. That by design could be embedded into the operations that you have, bake it into the code, make it a presence, so that you could prevent the privacy harms from arising. I wanted a model of proactive protection. And it took a while to sell this to my staff, to my lawyers. But I literally created Privacy by Design at my kitchen table over three nights. It was all about being proactive. That’s how it came about.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, super interesting. If you can tell us, what is that concept for the ones who are not so completely familiar.</p>
<p>Ann: So, Privacy by Design is all about being proactive. You want to prevent the privacy harms from arising, not just resolve them after the fact, you want to prevent them. And in order to do that, you have to embed the necessary measures into the design of your operations. And privacy, as the default, the second foundational principles of the seven is probably the most important one. What it says to your customers, or your citizens is we don’t expect you to go and search through all the terms of service and the legalese in the privacy policy for the opt out clause that says, “Do not use my personal information for any purpose other than the primary purpose I’ve consented to.” No, no, that takes hours to do. We don’t expect you to do that. We will give you privacy as the default setting. Automatically, we will give you privacy, you don’t have to ask for it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly why it will be ideal if all products that we started using are like that. If you can tell us a bit of all the– well, the problems, some of the problems, I know you have many, some of the problems that Privacy by Design aims to solve.</p>
<p>Ann: At the beginning, the initial problem was that lawyers viewed it not as a legal structure, which is not. It’s trying to be very adaptive to the code, bake it into the code. I always say you got to work with whatever code you have to your operations, that’s where you have to focus. So that was quite different for a lot of people who take a very legalistic approach to it.</p>
<p>But the other thing is, you have to convince your CEO, your executive, your board of directors that this is a valuable pursuit so that they will devote time and attention to allowing you to create Privacy by Design and embedding it in your operations. Now, it’s always to your benefit. Companies that have become certified for Privacy by Design, have come back to me and said they love it. They love it, because it shows their customers the lengths they’re going to, to protect their privacy. So, it builds trust, it builds loyalty and attracts new opportunity.</p>
<p>So, it works very well once you’ve got it going. But people have to be committed to it. And I always say to companies, “Do you have a data map?” And they go, “Huh?” See what data map does. Often companies want to give privacy to their customers and at the first instance when they enter into the company, purchase something, a service or whatever, they get their consent, their positive consent for the primary purpose of the data collection. But the problems arise after that. Often that personal information flows throughout the office to various departments that may be using it in ways that were never consented to.</p>
<p>So, unless you have a data map that flows the direction that data takes within your company, you’re not going to know that. So, I always tell companies get a data map, ensure that you can, you know, like in a diagram almost, indicate what the data flow is. And then you’ll see if you need to obtain some additional consent for secondary uses of the data that were never contemplated.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you mentioned data map and it’s a term that I rarely hear actually, rarely read, I think it’s…</p>
<p>Ann: I think I created it, but I don’t know I always talk about it. And then people go, “Yeah, that’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. What I mean is that I’m sure not many CEOs, as you mentioned, or people who are responsible for billing to service is on their top of their mind so yeah.</p>
<p>Ann: Not top on mind. That’s for sure.</p>
<p>Oscar: If you could tell us briefly the seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>Ann: Sure. The first one prevent the harms. You want to be proactive so that you could prevent the harms from arising. It’s very, very clear. The second one is privacy as the default setting. And that’s– I talked about that quite a bit. It’s absolutely critical, in fact, it’s considered to be so important. When they enacted the GDPR in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, they included not only my Privacy by Design, but specifically privacy as the default setting as well. So that’s very important.</p>
<p>The third one embedded in design is absolutely critical. If it’s not baked into the code into your operations, it’s going to be overlooked. The fourth one you have to have, what I always say full functionality. Get rid of the zero-sum mindset of privacy versus security, or privacy versus data utility. It can’t be either, or, win, lose. It has to be win-win, privacy and data utility. You make a positive sum, and you get multiple positive gains, privacy and security always intertwined.</p>
<p>And the next one talking about security. While the term privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections and security alone, in this day and age of daily hacking and phishing, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end, with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, start with a solid foundation of security throughout your entire organisation. Give individuals access to their own data.</p>
<p>I always say to companies and governments, you may have custody and control of someone’s data, but it doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to the data subject. So, give them the right of access that they have, allow them to gain access to personal information you have on them. And companies actually have come back to me, companies that are certified for Privacy by Design, and they say, “We love this. We love this principle. Because once we give customers access to their own data, they come back to us and say – No, no, that’s no longer the case. That was true about me two years ago, here’s what’s going on now.” So, they correct the information. They increase the accuracy of the information we hold. And it increases the quality of the data we have. So, they love it.</p>
<p>And the last principle, keep it user centric. When you keep it focused on the user, all of this flows out. Because it should all be around the individual, when it’s personal information you’re dealing with. Because personal information is about identifiable individuals. So, you have to keep it focused on the user, and what they permit, what they don’t permit, things of that nature. So that’s it. Seven foundational principles by design. To me, it’s like motherhood. But to most people, it takes a while to digest.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, pretty solid principle. And thank you for reminding those seven principles that I guess– I think most of us have read at least a few times. But thank you for the reminder. And I would like to know, because it’s been a while since you created that, has that paradigm really evolved changed until now since published or how do you say?</p>
<p>Ann: It has grown enormously in terms of where it’s being followed. It’s followed in 165 countries all around the world. All new laws seem to reflect Privacy by Design. Of course, the GDPR, you know, and the European Union. But other new laws like Brazil enacted a new law last year, they included Privacy by Design in it. And the US is going to be enacting a federal law, there’s Privacy by Design in it. So increasingly, new laws are including Privacy by Design. And also, it’s been translated into 40 languages, 40 languages all over the world .</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a great achievement having 40 languages already so it’s spreading and spreading as it should be, of course. You have mentioned I think couple of times already, Certification of Privacy by Design, so who does that?</p>
<p>Ann: So how that works is if you think you’re doing Privacy by Design in your company, and you want to get certified, you come to me, send me an email. And with your consent, I partner with KPMG, with your consent, I send KPMG to you to review your information holdings in your operations, to confirm that you are in effect doing Privacy by Design. And usually, they have a few suggestions to make it better. And once they give me a report that you are indeed following Privacy by Design, then I issue a certification and you’re certified. That way, you’re golden.</p>
<p>I always tell people, if you’re certified with Privacy by Design, put it on your website, tell the whole world you’re doing this, because it builds such trust. Customers and companies that have been certified have come back to me and said, “We have the trust that has waned over the years. It’s now returning. Customers appreciate the lengths we’re going to, to protect their privacy. We retain the customers and the loyalty that customers we have. But it’s attracting new customers, attracts new quality, new information to us in terms of what their interests are. So, it’s growing our operations.” They love it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Excellent. So, it’s yourself, your organisation who does the certification.</p>
<p>Ann: With KPMG. KPMG does the actual going in and examining everything.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Excellent. Good to know. Absolutely. If you can tell us also how Privacy by Design is being put in practice besides, of course, certification. Tell us a bit how it’s put in practice in today’s technology products, if you can– tell example if you can.</p>
<p>Ann: Sure. In smart cities, for example, what do smart cities do? They collect a lot of information, everywhere. So my first advice to smart cities, is the minute you collect any personal information from a vehicle that’s driving down the street, or people walking down the street, or an apartment building or whatever, the first thing you do is you de-identify the data. You strip any personal identifiers from the data because that can be used in ways that were never intended, certainly hasn’t been consented to.</p>
<p>But once you have the personal identifiers removed, then it’s just someone’s walking down the street, but you don’t know who that is. Someone’s driving this car to this location, you don’t know who. That’s what’s critical. You don’t need the personal identifiers linked to the data, you just want to get a sense of what’s happening in the city, and how this movement flowing and things of that nature. So that’s one example.</p>
<p>Oscar: Smart cities. Also, in hardware physical products it’s also Privacy by Design?</p>
<p>Ann: Certainly, in terms of the computers that we have, in the mobile devices that we have smartphones, et cetera, Privacy by Design is essential. And the only company that I always point to is Apple. Apple is amazing. They have a – why of course I have an iPhone, because they have end to end encryption. The data are completely encrypted. So, I may be talking to you, you and I can exchange data, but no third parties can gain access to that data in an unauthorised manner. So, encryption is critical. And especially on mobile devices that collect so much personal information, phone calls, emails, texts, et cetera. You must have very strong encryption from end to end, and Apple, and the iPhone is the only company that I know that does that all the time.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, absolutely, smart cities, you mentioned, well, Apple as the mobile phones and we use all the time mobile applications, web services, different types of products. How, for instance, imagine that I suggested to start using a new product, let’s say a new mobile application. How do I know if that product has been designed with Privacy by Design? Is there a way to know in advance should I buy this product?</p>
<p>Ann: Well, unless they’re certified, you won’t know. But I always say before you use any new product or service, always ask the questions. What will you be doing with my personal information? I’m giving you my personal identifiable data for this purpose and this purpose alone; can you confirm that that’s the only use you will subject it to? Is there any chance of unauthorised third parties gaining access to my data, in which case I’m not interested, I’m out. So, you have to always post the questions before you start a new product or service. It’s critical.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but that’s post your question to yourself, or you’d say you have to contact the – to them.</p>
<p>Ann: You’ve got to ask it to them, what you’re dealing with , always. And I always do that. But you’d be amazed at the wonderful answers you get. Once you show, you reveal your interest in privacy, they come bxack with, “Oh, we can do this. We can do this. We can do that.” They just take it for granted. You don’t care. But once you show that you care deeply about privacy, they increase your protection dramatically.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, that’s great to hear. Actually, I should do it more often, definitely.</p>
<p>Ann: I do it all the time as you can imagine.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right. OK, I will follow your advice. Absolutely. One final question for you, Ann, fantastic conversation with you. For all business leaders who are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Ann: Trust. You want to gain the trust of your customers. Right now, trust is fleeting. It has diminished dramatically. The concern for privacy has increased dramatically in the last two years. Every public opinion poll in the last few years, Pew Internet Research et cetera, has put in concern for privacy at an all-time high. 90% of people indicated they’re concerned about their privacy. 92% are concerned about loss of control over their personal information.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in the management of your company, you want to gain trust. And you do that, by communicating with your customers. You tell them the lengths you’re going to, to protect their privacy, that you have great respect for them. And you will alert them if you have any additional needs for additional information, and you come back to them and obtain their consent. This builds trust like no other and it will build their business greatly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Trust. Just put in the word trust on the agendas, I think it’s… definitely.</p>
<p>Ann: And the Germans have a wonderful term for this. I always say privacy equals control, personal control over the use and disclosure of your personal information. The Germans have a term for this called informational self-determination. It should be the individual who determines the fate of his or her personal information. So, I love that term. It’s a good one to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is, self-determination, absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Ann, for this very interesting conversation. Would you please tell us, for people who like to learn more about the work you’re doing or get in touch with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Ann: They can go to my website, GPS, G P as in Paul, S as in Sam, by design centre, all one word, gpsbydesigncentre, spelled C-E-N-T-R-E.com, <a href="http://gpsbydesigncentre.com">gpsbydesigncentre.com</a>, they’ll find everything.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely, we will do. Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot, Ann, for this interview and all the best.</p>
<p>Ann: It’s my pleasure. Have a great day.</p>
<p>Oscar: Have a nice day. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>MALTA and GIBRALTAR // August 16, 2022 — In an era of interconnectivity, cross-chain utility still remains an untapped source of potential for encouraging growth between blockchain communities.</p><p><a href="https://www.hashguardians.io/">HashGuardians</a> and the<a href="https://t.co/9i3Xv9mGbo"> Stakernauts community</a> are teaming up to provide some of the first cross-chain Gamefi utility on either of their native blockchains — Cardano and the Sirius Chain by<a href="https://proximax.io/"> ProximaX</a>. Currently, HashGuardians NFT owners are able to earn passive staking rewards in the form of HashCoins, the in-game currency of the HashGuardians Universe. Starting this September, owners will also have the opportunity to earn staking rewards in the form of MetX, the Gamefi token for the Stakernauts initiative. Dubbed <a href="https://files.proximax.io/pub-research/Transcendental_Stkg_Prtcptn_Doc_030822.pdf">Transcendental Staking</a>, this novel cross-chain staking program marks the first steps for both projects in creating additional cross-chain utility for NFT&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Transcendental Staking is an innovative method of staking whereby owners of tokens from other chains can come together, participate in a staking activity, and get rewarded with a cryptocoin from the hosting chain. Stakernauts, a community initiative under the Sirius Chain, is pioneering this method of staking to extend staking and remove barriers that limit the earnings of token&nbsp;holders.</p>Some unique HashGuardian NFTs<p>HashGuardians is a leading play-and-earn title being developed on the Cardano blockchain. Launching their NFT-based playable characters during the earliest days of NFTs on Cardano, HashGuardians has consistently been at the forefront of creating functional utility for their players. Staking rewards and the first playable content launched in late 2021, while HashCoin NFT minting and a complete play-and-earn gameplay loop (The Infinity Jump Tower) went live in early 2022. Most recently, HashGuardians has launched full playable utility for all 10,000 of their NFT characters — a rare feat amongst NFT games on any blockchain. Each HashGuardians NFT is a completely unique, fully-animated playable character ready for adventures throughout the HashGuardians Universe.</p><p>“Our mission is to create engaging gameplay that gives the power back to our players,” says F. Katzmarek, HashGuardians CEO. “We want players to control their assets and reap the rewards of being part of the HashGuardians community. We are excited to welcome the ProximaX and Stakernauts community to HashGuardians and appreciate this opportunity to further increase the utility of our NFT collection.”</p><p>HashGuardians NFT and MetX holders that opt into the staking program will be able to register their Sirius wallet address for monthly MetX airdrops. Reward amounts will vary, depending on the number of HashGuardians NFTs and MetX held in the users’ respective blockchain wallets. MetX has a three-part utility on the Sirius Chain, where it serves as the token of choice for ecosystem Gamefi projects. Alongside the Stakernauts’ cross-chain collaborations, MetX will be used in Xarcade — a gaming focused marketplace, and MetaXar — an interactive experience focused on gamifying the link between blockchain gaming projects. Read here for specific information on <a href="https://files.proximax.io/staking/HashGuardians_Transcendental_Stkg_120822.pdf">how to&nbsp;stake</a>.</p><p>By building bridges across blockchains, HashGuardians and the Stakernauts seek to take early initiative in exploring the potential of cross-chain collaborations. With their strong presence in the Asia Pacific region, Stakernauts represent some of the fastest growing markets for blockchain gaming enthusiasts, while HashGuardians’ strong presence in the North American and European markets helps connect existing NFT collectors to the Stakernauts community.</p><p>Stakernauts’ mission is to break down blockchain barriers to build a community of communities. It is driven by the need to bring together an entirely fragmented cryptospace and form a guild of sorts so that communities can share their common goal of earning collectively and cross promoting projects that can be mutually beneficial to all&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Stakernauts is promoted by the people who created the Sirius Chain by ProximaX as part of a bigger picture. It is envisioned that the communities of Stakernauts will be involved in Xarcade — a games marketplace&nbsp;, and MetaXar — a Metaverse project- by Sirius Chain. Further, it is hoped that HashGuardians will be among the firsts to roll out its project in the Metaverse and offer its community an “extended play” of their activities and earn beyond its own rewards — thereby giving its players a multiplier earning&nbsp;effect.</p><p>About HashGuardians:<br>With a focus on the intersection of blockchain technology and engaging, fun gameplay, HashGuardians is developing a multifaceted project with elements designed to appeal to any gamer or blockchain enthusiast. Pre-Alpha gameplay content is now available for HashGuardians NFT holders. Built upon the Cardano blockchain and featuring a play-and-earn economic model, the HashGuardians Universe will enable players to directly benefit from gameplay through claimable NFTs and HashCoins (in-game currency). Players earn rewards both passively and actively, and will have opportunities to engage in mini-games, quests, and adventures whether they have 15 minutes or 2 hours available.</p><p>Additional Information:<br>Project Website: <a href="https://www.hashguardians.io/">HashGuardians — NFT Game<br></a>HashGuardians Discord Community:<a href="https://discord.gg/hashguardians"> https://discord.gg/hashguardians<br></a>HashGuardians Intro Video:<a href="https://youtu.be/bfFOkwuDuVQ"> https://youtu.be/bfFOkwuDuVQ</a></p><p>About ProximaX<br>Sirius by ProximaX is a next generation blockchain with advanced built-in features such as multi-layer multisig, validator rewards, fast finality, cross-chain swaps and much more.

As big tech continues to enclose our digital selves in high walls and capture our personal data for their commercial goals, it is crucial that civil society, together with the bigger business and tech community, forms an effective strategy against digital colonization by leveraging the emerging open standards for digital identity and personal data. These standards have enormous potential to support new digital public good via an identity layer of the Internet.

 US Senate Bill Proposes to Make CFTC the Go-to Regulator for Bitcoin, Ether, and Other Digital Commodities  According to the legislators, the proposed bill would give the cryptocurrency sector the much-needed regulatory certainty it&nbsp;needs. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- A US Senate bill was introduced last Wednesday to grant direct control over crypto assets deemed as digital commodities to&nbsp;CFTC.</blockquote><blockquote>- If the proposed legislation becomes a law, it will make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPS), such as exchanges, and custodians, among others, to register with the&nbsp;CFTC.</blockquote><blockquote>- The proposed bill referred to Bitcoin and Ether as digital commodities.</blockquote><p>Last Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators from the Senate Agriculture Committee unveiled a <a href="https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-stabenow-booker-and-thune-introduce-legislation-to-regulate-digital-commodities">proposal</a> to grant more regulatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the digital commodities markets. The proposal also applies to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets viewed as commodities.</p><p>The sponsors of this legislation include Arkansas’ Republic Senator John Boozman and Michigan’s Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow.</p><p>According to the legislators, the proposed bill would give the cryptocurrency sector the much-needed regulatory certainty it needs by consolidating much of its regulatory monitoring under a single regulator.‍‍</p> Protect Consumers‍ <p>If the proposal becomes a law, it will mandate that businesses providing crypto platforms, including custodians, brokers, and exchanges, register with the&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>And the CFTC would impose conditions on such registration to ensure that cryptocurrency businesses maintain sufficient financial resources, avoid conflicts of interest, stop abusive trading practices, uphold fair pricing, and strengthen cybersecurity protections, among other consumer protection measures.‍‍</p> Growing Popularity of Digital Assets in the&nbsp;US‍‍ <p>A <a href="https://finbold.com/americans-prefer-crypto-over-a-traditional-savings-account-study-shows/#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20State%20of,who%20own%20certificates%20of%20deposit.">January 2022 report</a> states that the number of Americans holding crypto has surpassed the number of Americans having access to savings accounts.</p><p>This is a significant sign of how crypto assets are experiencing a massive uptick in terms of adoption in the United States. Thus, regulators and authorities are demanding strong crypto regulatory measures to protect investors &amp; promote innovation.</p><p>The chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Stabenow, also believes that regulating the crypto industry is crucial amid its growing significance in the United States financial ecosystem.</p><p>Thus, she noted in the announcement, “One in five Americans have used or traded digital assets — but these markets lack the transparency and accountability that they expect from our financial system. Too often, this puts Americans’ hard-earned money at&nbsp;risk.”</p><p>But Sen. Stabenow has no intention to clamp down on the SEC’s powers to deal with what it sees as violations of the securities regulations. This is why she clarified that the proposed bill is not aimed at regulating every aspect of the cryptocurrency market or limiting the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate digital assets that behave more like securities.</p><p>In fact, she commended the SEC’s work, noting, “We’re not defining what a security is. I have great confidence in Chairman Gensler to be able to use his authorities.”</p><p>Senator Booker, too, referenced the growing number of Americans investing in digital assets as the motive behind this proposed legislation.</p><p>He noted, “As the number of Americans engaging with digital assets continues to grow, it is critical that we clarify and strengthen the regulation of our financial system.”</p><p>Sen. Booker added, “This bipartisan legislation will enhance oversight over digital commodities, taking an important first step to ensure that the digital marketplace operates fairly with commonsense rules in place and protects consumers entering this market.”‍</p> ‍CTFC: The Perfect Crypto Regulator?‍‍ <p>Although Sen. Boozman claimed that the CFTC is the rightful regulator for crypto businesses, he believes that the proposed legislation will enable the commodities and securities authorities to collaborate closely.‍‍</p> The SEC is Here to&nbsp;Stay‍ <p>The SEC will still be in charge of some elements of the crypto industry’s regulation, but the bill doesn’t provide specifics.<br>Interestingly, the proposed bill’s reference to Bitcoin and Ether as commodities is in line with the recent statements Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, made. After all, Mr. Gensler claimed that almost all other digital currencies are securities.‍‍</p> The Next&nbsp;Steps‍‍ <p>Sen. Stabenow and Sen. Boozman said they wanted to move the bill forward as soon as possible but did not give a specific time frame. The time for legislative action will close before the midterm elections in November.</p><p>The bill will now be sent to another committee in its next phase, where it will be discussed and voted on in the Senate after surviving the markup phase, and if passed, it will then be sent to the&nbsp;House.‍</p> ‍A new Tool for&nbsp;CFTC‍‍ <p>Sen. Thune believes that CFTC needs new tools to regulate the evolving commodities market amid the emergence of new-age technologies.</p><p>Thus, he noted, “Technology continues to transform digital commodities, and it’s critical that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has the proper tools to regulate this growing&nbsp;market.”</p><p>He believes that the proposed legislation will empower the CFTC to deal with any uncertainties rising from the crypto assets market while protecting the consumers.‍‍</p> Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto&nbsp;Bill‍ <p>The groundwork for crowning the CFTC as a crypto regulator began in June with the introduction of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/us-senators-kirsten-gillibrand-cynthia-lummis-introduces-the-responsible-financial-innovation-act-to-regulate-digital-assets-in-the-country">the Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto Bill</a>. Although its mission is not yet accomplished, it set off a chain of events in the direction of its final goal, such as the most recent US Senate Bill proposing to grant regulatory powers over digital commodities, including Bitcoin and Ether, to the&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>Introduced by US Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), the bipartisan cryptocurrency bill included provisions to grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulatory jurisdiction over digital assets and to establish an advisory council to draft guiding principles (CFTC).‍</p><p>A flurry of crypto legislative proposals &amp; statements make it clear that governments around the world will not let the digital assets industry continue without regulatory oversight. Global bodies and watchdogs, such as the FATF, too, are leading the charge in bringing crypto assets within the regulatory net. Thus, Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as the exchanges, brokers, custodians, etc., will have to comply with international as well as jurisdictional-level regulations sooner or later if they are not doing so&nbsp;already.</p><p>The FATF’s Travel Rule has been adopted by only 10+ countries, but this is likely to change soon with the global financial watchdog turning on the heat towards countries that have not taken any concrete steps yet. Thus, VASPs must stay prepared. But there’s nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>All VASPs need is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS) to comply with the Travel Rule. And we have the best TRS available in the market today: Veriscope. It is the only answer to the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs face while complying with the Travel Rule.

<p>Driver’s licenses were one of the top three most breached data attributes in 2021, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/publication/2021-annual-data-breach-report-2/">ITRC</a>). To make matters worse, many driver’s licenses are counterfeit or altered, making them inauthentic. The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) is committed to eliminating these issues by implementing the “one driver, one record” driver’s license concept. This is why 1Kosmos has partnered with AAMVA to automate driver’s license verification within the BlockID platform.</p>
<p>BlockID integrates with AAMVA to confirm instantly whether driver’s license data is authentic by confirming with a nationwide registry of motor vehicles (RMV) lookup. This allows government agencies, financial institutions, and employers to verify that a driver’s license provided by a citizen, customer or employee actually belongs to them based on RMV records. This way, identity verification is automated which gives organizations confidence that a user is who he or she claims to be. Let’s take a closer look at how this process works within the BlockID platform:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some key advantages of the 1Kosmos AAMVA verification are:</p>
 
 Meet eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) compliance by verifying customers’ identity as part of the onboarding process 
 Meet AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance with screening and monitoring capabilities 
 Easy to integrate web-friendly software 
 Data privacy — all data is encrypted and any PII is purged immediately after verification 
 Various U.S. document types supported 
 A seamless customer experience during account opening and re-onboarding

 Veriscope Weekly Recap — 8th August to 14th&nbsp;August  Tornado Cash, NFTs and pushback on adoption from the&nbsp;UNCTAD. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly regulatory recap. In a surprising move, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, a popular crypto mixing service, last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The OFAC’s action was called an unfair and illogical move by many in the crypto industry. So, without further ado, let’s dive into the major events that took place in the crypto regulatory space last week, including the U.S. OFAC’s sanction against Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> U.S. OFAC Sanctions Tornado&nbsp;Cash <p>Last Monday, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency mixer, Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>With this move, the OFAC’s SDN list, which is a list of “Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons” with whom U.S. citizens and organizations are not permitted to conduct business, has been updated to include Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury cited Tornado Cash’s use to wash out money during the $625 million Axie Infinity’s Ronin hack by the North Korean Lazarus Group, the $100 million Horizon Bridge hack, and the $190 million Nomad Bridge hack as justification for this sanction&nbsp;verdict.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916</a></p> Thailand Central Bank to Get More Authority in Crypto Regulation <p>As per recent reports, Thailand is preparing to strengthen crypto regulation and grant additional powers to the Thai central bank to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Speaking on the current limit to th central bank’s powers, Thai Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith stated, “Right now, the central bank has no room to enter into the regulatory framework except for notifying that cryptos are not a legal means of payment for goods and services.”</p><p>The talks on strengthening the country’s crypto regulations started gaining momentum after Zipmex, a recognized cryptocurrency and digital token exchange in the nation, paused, allowing withdrawals.</p><p>That said, the goal of stricter cryptocurrency restrictions, according to the Thai finance minister, is to give investors greater protection, not to stifle innovation or technology.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a

EU’s MiCA Law Will Regulate NFT Collections Like Cryptocurrencies <p>During a panel discussion at Korea Blockchain Week, Peter Kerstens, an advisor to the European Union (EU), provided fresh perspectives on the EU’s efforts to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks in the crypto and NFT&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>According to Kerstens, NFT collections will be treated similarly to cryptocurrencies under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)&nbsp;law.</p><p>Under this new classification, the EU residents planning to sell NFT collection will be considered crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).</p><p>Thus, they will be obligated to obtain express permission from the EU before launching their NFT collection to the general&nbsp;market.</p><p>The aim behind these measures is to “protect investors and safeguard financial stability while permitting innovation and encouraging the attractiveness of the crypto-asset sector.”</p><p>This procedure is anticipated to take one to three months, with larger CASPs required to mandatorily submit regular reports to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on their operations.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a

UNCTAD Aims to Stop Developing Nations from Embracing Cryptocurrencies <p>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) <a href="https://unctad.org/news/unctad-spells-out-actions-curb-cryptocurrencies-developing-countries">published</a> a policy brief outlining solutions for addressing the concerns that cryptocurrency poses for developing countries.</p><p>Highlighting the volatile nature of crypto assets, the report reads, “While these private digital currencies have rewarded some and facilitate remittances, they are an unstable financial asset that can also bring social risks and&nbsp;costs.”</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/UNCTAD/status/1557663129622003713">Image Source</a>)</p><p>It further cautions that “cryptocurrencies may become a widespread means of payment and even replace domestic currencies unofficially (a process called cryptoization), which could jeopardize the monetary sovereignty of countries.”</p><p>Thus, the report urges developing nations to specify cryptocurrency’s legal standing and impose reporting obligations on crypto service providers.</p><p>It also suggests global tax coordination regarding cryptocurrency tax treatments, regulation, and information sharing among countries to tackle these challenges.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://unctad.org/news/unctad-spells-out-actions-curb-cryptocurrencies-developing-countries">https://unctad.org/news/unctad-spells-out-actions-curb-cryptocurrencies-developing-countries</a></p><p>_________________________________</p><p>We can debate all about the morality of the government’s decision of sanctioning Tornado Cash, but this does clarify one thing. The government will crack down against anything remotely illegitimate when it comes to digital assets, no matter even if it means sanctioning a particular use of technology. Thus, complying with government regulations, both national and international, is a must for all&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>The federal rules that VASPs will have to comply with will depend on the countries where they are providing their services. As for the global regulations, the most prominent one that the VASPs will have to comply with or prepare for compliance is the FATF’s Travel Rule. As of now, only a few countries have adopted the Travel Rule, but this may change in the coming days, with global bodies and institutions urging countries to regulate crypto assets on an urgent&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Thus, it is in the best interest of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to at least prepare for the Travel Rule compliance, even if the country they are based in hasn’t adopted it yet. After all, Travel Rule adoption is just on the horizon. And all a VASP needs to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution&nbsp;(TRS).</p><p>We have the best solution to suggest: Veriscope!

<p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> has been a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2017, our expert team has been building cutting-edge Verifiable Credentials and Self-Sovereign Identity technology. We created this complete guide on &nbsp;Self-Sovereign Identity to explain its importance to organizations and individuals as well as how the tech works in a simple way.</p><p>TL;DR</p>  As we access apps and websites, organizations by default are dominantly using centralized and federated identity management (e.g. signing in with a Google or Facebook account) systems. Centralized systems often make organizations vulnerable to large-scale hacks and data breaches. With federated systems, credential system providers like Google may use people’s personal data to store and track their online activity without their knowledge.  Because ID and credential verification processes are very slow, expensive, and outdated, certificate fraud and lack of product traceability are big problems around the world.  To solve many of these problems, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) was developed. Self-Sovereign Identity is a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a central authority. For organizations, SSI technology enables them to create fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials and instantly verify the authenticity of a credential.  Self-Sovereign Identity is made up of 3 pillars: blockchain, decentralized identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials.  Self-Sovereign Identity technology can be applied to diverse use cases including issuing fraud-proof certifications, supply chain product tracking, and speeding up workforce recruitment times.  <p>Introduction</p><p>How would you feel if you found out that your doctor had a fake degree? </p><p>If you’re a food supplier, how would you contain a contaminated batch of products when you can’t trace it back to its origin? </p><p>And did you know that cybercriminals <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190219006067/en/Cyber-Criminals-Cash-in-on-Millions-With-Formjacking-Posing-a-Serious-Threat-to-Businesses-and-Consumers">earn up to $2.2 million</a> through formjacking attacks by stealing 10 credit cards per website?</p><p>While all of these situations seem completely unrelated, they actually all tie back to the recurring problems of outdated verification systems and reduced security with traditional identity management systems.</p><p>As we access apps and websites, organizations are dominantly using centralized and federated identity management systems (e.g. signing in with a Google or Facebook account) by default. The centralized system puts data at risk of large scale hacks and breaches while the federated model enables companies to track user data without their knowledge. Unsurprisingly, cybersecurity spending increases every year.</p><p>These problems are what motivated the development of the Self-Sovereign Identity model to manage digital identities. There are many advantages to Self-Sovereign Identity that we’ll dive into more detail later, including:</p>  Fully owning and controlling your data  Increased security and privacy  Eliminating central points of failure  Data can’t be tracked and correlated (data that is used to trace back to someone’s identity or track online behavior)  <p>Table of Contents</p>  What Is Self-Sovereign Identity? <p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. In contrast to centralized identity management, you are the boss of your identity and get to decide who gets to see your data. You can also remove access to your data any time.</p><p>Before diving into the details of Self-Sovereign Identity, it’s important to know what digital identity is first. A digital identity is any data that exists online that can be traced back to an individual or organization. Identifiable data includes passwords, user names, bank accounts, and social media photos.</p><p>SSI technology allows people to self-manage their digital identities without depending on third-party providers to store and manage the data. Currently, Self-Sovereign Identity is used interchangeably with the term <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a>. </p><p>There are three main participants in the SSI system: </p>  Holder: Someone who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives Verifiable Credentials.  Issuer: Party with the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials.  Verifier: Party checking the credential. &nbsp;  <p>The interactions between the holder, issuer, and verifier is sometimes called "the trust triangle." Every time information is requested by a verifier, the holder chooses whether to allow access to their data. </p> 3 Pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and decentralized identifiers are 3 pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity.&nbsp;<p>Self-Sovereign Identity is made up of 3 pillars: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personal identifiable information.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can present to verifiers.  <p>For example, let's say a new gym opens and every employee must have a First Aid training certificate, which is valid for three years.</p>  Holder: Sandy the job applicant  Issuer: First Aid training organization  Verifier: Gym  <p>Here is how these roles interact in a Self-Sovereign Identity system:</p>  Sandy (holder) has a digital identity wallet app on her phone that stores her Verifiable Credentials.  Sandy successfully passes her First Aid training and the training organization digitally issues her training certificate that she then keeps securely on her app. Her certificate is now fraud-proof.  Sandy applies to the gym (verifier) and presents her Verifiable Credential (the certificate) and the gym can instantly verify her credential by simply scanning a QR code.  <p>In this case, the gym trusts only the First Aid training organization as an issuer and Sandy wouldn’t be able to fake the certificate. The training organization’s DID is publicly known and only First Aid certificates issued by this issuer as Verifiable Credentials would be recognized as valid for verifiers. </p><p>If someone tried to make Sandy a fake digital certificate by changing the data, the verification would fail. The failed verification confirms that the certificate is not authentic because the signature wouldn’t match the issuer’s DID or the hash (acts like a digital fingerprint) would be wrong.</p> Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity With a Self-Sovereign Identity system, users fully own and control their data and decide who to share it with.<p>Many people have written about the principles of identity, including Kim Cameron’s “<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms996456(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN">Laws of Identity</a>” and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-ig/VCTF/charter/faq.html">W3C Verifiable Claims Task Force FAQ</a>. While there is no clear consensus on what Self-Sovereign Identity is among different thought leaders and organizations, there are 10 key principles that summarize the essential aspects of SSI. </p><p>1) Existence: A user must be able to exist in the digital world without the need of a third party.</p><p>2) Control: People must have ultimate authority over their digital identities and personal data.</p><p>3) Access: Users must have easy and direct access to their own data.</p><p>4) Transparency: The way an identity system and algorithms are managed and updated must be publicly available and reasonably understandable. The solution design should be based on open protocol standards and open software.</p><p>5) Persistence: Identities must be long-lasting. Solution developers should implement sufficient foundational infrastructure and design sustainable commercial and operational models.</p><p>6) Portability: People must be able to bring their identities and credentials anywhere, transport their data from one platform to another, and not be restricted to a single platform.</p><p>7) Interoperability: Identities should be as widely usable as possible by various stakeholders. Organizations, databases, and registries must be able to quickly and efficiently communicate with each other globally through a digital identity system.</p><p>8) Consent: Users must give explicit permission for an entity to use or access their data. The process of expressing consent should be interactive and well-understood by people.</p><p>9) Minimization: A digital identity solution should enable people to share the least possible amount of data that another party needs to minimize sharing of excessive and unnecessary personally identifiable information.</p><p>10) Protection: People’s right to privacy must be protected and safeguards should exist against tampering and monitoring information. Data traffic should be encrypted end-to-end.</p> Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity Self-Sovereign Identity was developed largely because governments and companies were sharing tremendous amounts of information and tracking people's online behavior without their knowledge.<p>There are a growing number of discussions about SSI around the world among citizens, companies, and governments. But where did this digital identity approach come from? </p><p>Christopher Allen is a standards and identity practice specialist at the blockchain development startup Blockstream and a veteran developer. He believes that <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/a-brief-history-of-ssi-where-does-it-come-from-a-timeline/">SSI began in the early 90s</a> when Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) mentioned the idea of “Web of Trust,” which is the first hint of what could become a Self-Sovereign Identity. PGP is a security program used to decrypt and encrypt email and authenticate email messages through digital signatures and file encryption. </p><p>The “Web of Trust” was an approach where trust could be established by allowing peers to act as introducers and validators of public keys and anyone could be a validator in the PGP model. While this approach was a great example of decentralized trust management, the limitation is that it focused on email addresses that depended on centralized hierarchies. This, in addition to other reasons, is why PGP never became broadly adopted. </p><p>In 1996, Carl Ellison wrote a paper on digital identity called “Establishing Identity Without Certification Authority.” He mainly argued that there was a need for a method to establish identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities. </p><p>SSI really gained momentum in the 21st century as the internet developed more. In his article, “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/27/the-path-to-self-sovereign-identity/">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>,” Allen discussed his vision for Self-Sovereign Identity where digital identity can enable trust while preserving individual privacy. He says SSI is much needed during this time because governments and companies are sharing tremendous amounts of information and correlating everything from purchases, people’s locations, and who they associate with. SSI can help protect people from increasing control from people in power. </p><p>Countries, governments, and companies often associate people’s identity with state-issued credentials like driver’s licenses and social security cards. But for SSI advocates, this is problematic because it implies that people can lose their identity if a central authority removes it from them. With a Self-Sovereign Identity, no entity can remove your digital identity. </p> <br>4 Key Phases in the Evolution of Digital Identity <p>The models of online identity have gone through these four main phases since the internet was invented: </p>  Centralized identity  Federated identity  User-centric identity  Self-sovereign identity  <p>Right now we are dominantly using centralized identifiers like emails, phone numbers, and user names to authenticate our identity to access websites and apps. As we create more accounts, our personal data is being spread more and more on the internet.</p> Phase 1: Centralized Identity (Administrative Control by a Single Authority or Hierarchy) <p>As the internet was first developing, centralized authorities became the issuers and authenticators of digital identity. <a href="https://www.iana.org/about">IANA</a> (1988) was an organization that determined the validity of IP addresses and <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> (1998) arbitrated domain names. In 1995, certificate authorities helped commerce sites authenticate their identities. </p><p>Some organizations went beyond centralization and created hierarchies where the root controller would choose other organizations to each oversee their own hierarchy. But the root controller would always have more power. As the internet grew, centralized authorities and hierarchies gained more power as more people had to manage a growing number of digital identities while having no control over them. </p><p>This model is a siloed one where systems are isolated from each other as people have to create a digital identity account for every platform. The average person has <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100 passwords</a> and a study from the University of Sydney conducted a survey among social media users from Australia, UK, and US revealed that a third of people <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/survey-finds-a-third-of-people-dont-trust-social-media-companies-with-thei/596830/">don’t trust social media companies with their data</a>. This creates a bad user experience as they have to manage an increasing number of accounts.</p><p><a href="https://gipviahy.com/gifs/Jasmine-Star-omg-work-laptop-ciPzVXFVbAcdFEHubs"></a></p> Phase 2: Federated Identity (Administrative Control by Multiple, Federated Authorities) <p>Because of the problems that resulted from the first siloed digital identity model, federated identity was developed. A federated identity allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains using a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps. A federated identity links a user’s identity across multiple identity management systems so they can access different applications efficiently. </p><p>Microsoft’s Passport initiative in 1999 was one of the first to offer a federated identity. But the problem is that Microsoft was at the center of the federation which made it almost as centralized as traditional authorities. </p><p>In federated identity systems, personal data is often being stored, tracked, and shared to other parties without people’s knowledge. In 2019, Facebook had 540 million user records exposed on the Amazon cloud server (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millions-facebook-user-records-exposed-amazon-cloud-server/">CBS</a>). Currently, there is a hacker attack <a href="https://aag-it.com/how-often-do-cyber-attacks-occur/">every 39 seconds</a>.</p> Phase 3: User-Centric Identity (Individual or Administrative Control Across Multiple Authorities Without Requiring a Federation) <p>In 2000, the <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988">Augmented Social Network</a> established the groundwork for a new kind of digital identity for the next generation of the internet. They recommended that a persistent online identity should be built into the architecture of the internet. The key advancement to digital identity is the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity.</p><p>The Identity Commons (2001-Present) began to compile the new work on digital identity with a focus on decentralization. Their most important contribution was their creation of the Internet Identity Workshop working group, or IIW (2005-Present), where they advance the idea of decentralized identity in a series of semi-yearly meetings. They focused on a new term: user-centric identity. </p><p>The user-centric identity model suggests that users are in the middle of the identity process, the user must have more control over their identity, and trust must be decentralized. IIW’s work supported different methods for creating digital identity including OAuth (2010) and OpenID Connect (2014). User-centric approaches tended to focus on user consent and interoperability. </p><p>However, powerful institutions prevented them from realizing their goals. Today, the ownership of user-centric identities remains with the entities that register them. Being user-centric isn’t enough. &nbsp;</p> Phase 4: Self-Sovereign Identity (Individuals Have Full Control Across Any Number of Authorities) <p>Self-Sovereign Identity is the next step beyond user-centric identity. The term Self-Sovereign Identity was used more in the 2010s when people advocated not just that people be at the center of the identity process but that they are the rulers of their own identity.  </p><p>There were a growing number of discussions of SSI within international policy that were largely driven by the refugee crisis in Europe. Many people lacked a recognized state-issued identity as they had to flee their homes.</p> Problems With Centralized Digital Identifiers, Credentials, and IDs   Centralized digital credentials, like health and safety training certificates and university degrees, &nbsp;are easy to forge. The only way to check their authenticity is by contacting the issuing organization, which can take days to even months to confirm the information you need  Traditional IDs like a driver’s license or other government-issued IDs are not private as the verifier can access all the information on a credential that they often don’t need like date of birth and address  The verification of credentials is dependant on the issuer and if their service is offline or disappears, then people can’t prove the authenticity of their credentials to a verifier  Data can be stored, tracked, and shared by third parties  More than <a href="https://gatefy.com/blog/key-points-verizon-data-breach-report-dbir-2020/#:~:text=In%20number%2C%20hacking%20was%20present,through%20lost%20or%20stolen%20credentials.">80% of breaches</a> within hacking involve brute force or the use of lost or stolen credentials.  Data stored on an issuer’s centralized servers have an increased risk of becoming targets for hacks, breaches, or leaks   Examples of the Consequences of Data Breaches<br> <p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/four-states-warn-unemployment-benefits-applicants-about-data-leaks-n1212431">33,000 unemployment applicants</a> were exposed to a data security breach through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program</p>  Yahoo holds the record for the <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics">largest data breach of all time</a> with three billion compromised accounts  Annually, hospitals spend <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/hospitals-spend-64-more-on-advertising-after-a-data-breach">64% more</a> on advertising the two years following a breach  In 2018, a Marriott International data breach affected roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html">500 million guests</a>   Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity Management for Organizations, Individuals, and Developers<br>  Organizations   Significantly reduce costs, inefficiencies, and resources by verifying credentials like nurse licenses or online course completion certificates instantly instead of days, weeks, and months  Issue fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials efficiently and at a much lower cost  Improve security with public-key cryptography  Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks, breaches, lawsuits, and fines by storing less user data   Individuals   Full ownership and control over your identity without relying on a third party  Create your own DIDs and fully manage your data with a digital wallet  You can choose which data to share and with whom to share it with while having the ability to remove access to the data at any time  Personal data is not stored on centralized servers  You don’t have to provide unnecessary and excessive information than what is requested like showing your full address if you only need to confirm your age  <p>Developers</p>  Build apps that eliminate the need for password, which creates a better user experience  Removes inefficient authentication processes like using text or email for secondary verification  Request data directly from users rather than a third party  <p>A Self-Sovereign Identity platform like <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> enables people and organizations to create, manage, and store their data on a decentralized network.</p><p>How Does Self-Sovereign Identity Management Work?</p><p>We’ll go over the key details of the three pillars of SSI which are blockchain, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials and how they work together. </p> SSI Pillar 1: Blockchain<br> Dock CEO Nick Lambert explains what a blockchain is and how it works.<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information on a digitally distributed database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network. These computers are called nodes. The way that blockchain is designed makes it very difficult to change, hack or cheat the system. Each block has unique data about the previous block and once the data on the blocks are verified, they are added to the blockchain. </p><p>Key Features of a Self-Sovereign Identity Blockchain:</p>  Decentralized: Blockchain uses a peer-to-peer network where no one party can change or manipulate the way a blockchain should act. Nodes can be anywhere in the world as long as they have the required equipment to be part of the network. If it’s a permissionless blockchain, anyone can join the network.  Distributed ledger (record of transactions): Every node in the network gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that it hasn’t been tampered with. When new data is verified, everyone adds this information to their copy of the blockchain.  High security with immutability: Blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. Every block has a hash (string of letters and numbers) of the previous block, which acts like a unique digital fingerprint. If the hash changes on a block, everyone in the network will know that it has been tampered with and tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes and not be added to the blockchain.  <p>Let’s consider a company where only one person has access to financial records and history. If they changed the numbers, who would know about it? There may be limited or no traceable evidence or record of this change so they can easily steal money or commit fraud. But if all transactions were recorded on a permissioned blockchain, other staff could audit and check the transactions to ensure they are accurate.</p><p>Here is how each party uses the blockchain in a Self-Sovereign Identity system:</p>  Holder: Owner of the Verifiable Credential (e.g. driver’s license) has their public DID on the blockchain.  Issuer: When an issuer, like a government department, provides a Verifiable Credential to a holder like a driver’s license, they sign it with their DID and associated private key. The department’s DID and associated public key will be on the blockchain.  Verifier: A verifier, like an on-demand driving company, can check the blockchain to ensure that the government department they trust did in fact issue the license because the credential was signed by the issuer’s DID that is on the blockchain.   <p>A blockchain allows the holder, issuer, and verifier to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials.</p>Dock's Solutions Architect explains what data goes on the blockchain and how privacy is protected in Self-Sovereign Identity management.<p>The identity and credentials are not stored on the blockchain but rather on the holder’s digital wallet.</p><p>What is stored on the blockchain</p><p>What is not stored on the blockchain</p><p>An issuer’s and holder’s public keys associated with their DID</p><p>A holder’s personal data like date of birth, name, and credit card details</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;</p> SSI Pillar 2: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<br> Mike explains how decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work and their benefits.<p>Everyone who has an online presence has a digital identifier like an email address or user name. Today, we mostly rely on centralized identifiers such as Google, Facebook, email providers, or mobile network operators to connect to websites and apps. But these digital identifiers are often used to store, track, and share user data. Companies can know who we messaged, what we bought, where we live, our location, and so on. </p><p>Thankfully, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) allow people to create digital identities that they can securely connect to their Verifiable Credentials that don't reveal personal information without authorization. DIDs allow us to have full ownership and control of our data. Having multiple DIDs makes it harder for someone to correlate those DIDs together. </p><p>A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is independent of any organization. DIDs are publicly known by relevant parties. </p><p>Here is an example of a Dock DID:</p><p>A DID:</p>  Is created by the user  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Does not contain personal data or wallet information  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>People can make as many DIDs as they want for different purposes and interactions. For example, someone can generate three different DIDs:</p>  DID 1: For their online shopping only  DID 2: For cryptocurrency-related services like trading and buying NFTs  DID 3: Professional purposes like holding their educational credentials such as a university degree and course certificates  Users can create as many DIDs as they want for different purposes and interactions. Private and Public Keys That Come With DIDs <p>To learn how private and public keys work, it’s important to understand what encryption is. Encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling its contents so only certain people can look at your message. </p><p>There are 2 types of encryption: </p>  Symmetric encryption: One key (password) is used to encrypt and decrypt data. Think about securing access to a document by choosing a password like “catsrule.” In order for someone to open the document, they need to type in “catsrule.” In this example, a single password (key) is used to encrypt and decrypt the document. <br>  Asymmetric encryption: The encryption key (also called the public key) and the corresponding decryption key (also called the private key) are different. Asymmetric encryption is also known as public-key encryption.  <p>Let’s say Ellen has a confidential document she wants to share with her colleague Ken. She uses an encryption program to protect the document with a password that she chooses. She sends the message to Ken who can’t open the message because he doesn’t know the password in the same way that he doesn’t have a “key” to open the lock to access the document. </p><p>Ellen doesn’t want to share the password through email because other people can use it to decrypt any message between Ellen and Ken. This is the problem with symmetric encryption and what asymmetric encryption tries to solve. </p><p>With asymmetric encryption, Ellen and Ken have to generate a key pair on their computers. A public and private key will be linked to each other. A public key can be used to encrypt data and only the matching private key can be used to decrypt data. But if you know someone’s public key, you can’t access their private key. </p><p>Ellen and Ken can use asymmetric encryption to communicate securely with each other. </p>  They first exchange their public keys  When Ellen sends her confidential document, she encrypts it with Ken’s public key  Ken then uses his private key to unlock the document. Because of asymmetrical encryption, only Ken can decrypt the message. Even Ellen can’t decrypt it because she doesn’t have Ken’s private key.  Ken and Ellen should never share their private key. If someone gets Ken’s private keys, a hacker can decrypt all messages intended for Ken. But the hacker can’t decrypt messages sent to Ellen because that requires her private key.   <p>Asymmetric encryption is used where security is very important including a website with the address https://, secure emails, or cryptocurrency to make sure only the owner of a wallet can withdraw or transfer money from it.</p>Every DID comes with one or many private and public keys.<p>Every DID comes with one or many private and public keys. </p>  Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign Verifiable Credentials. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.  Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.   <p>Think about a mailbox on the street that is public and many people know the location. Anyone can drop in letters but only the owner can open it up. The mailbox’s address would be like the public key that is safe for everyone to know. The owner of the mailbox is the only one who has the private key that is needed to open up the mailbox. </p><p>For additional security, you can generate a new public key whenever you transact with a different party to reduce the chances of someone correlating data. This practice can be compared to having a different password for every new website you create an account for. It’s not safe to use “itsreallyme123” for every site. It’s better to have longer and complex passwords to reduce the risk of your information being hacked.</p> SSI Pillar 3: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) <p>ID cards, certificates, and degrees can easily be faked and organizations have few to no options of verifying their authenticity without doing a tedious, manual process of checking with the issuer of a credential like a university or licensing organization. But Verifiable Credentials allow verifiers like an employer, government department, or app to verify credentials in seconds! </p><p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically-secured version of paper and digital credentials that people can present to parties that need them for verification. An employer for example can simply use an app to scan a job candidate’s QR code to confirm that they have a bachelor’s degree without needing to spend days or weeks contacting a university to verify if someone’s degree is authentic. </p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> is an international community of member organizations, staff, and the public collaborating to set international standards for the World Wide Web. When digital credentials conform to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 standards that they established, they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials. </p><p>The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 is a “specification [that] provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.” W3C created standards for Decentralized Identifiers, URL, and others.</p> Key Benefits of Verifiable Credentials   Issuing Organizations: Save money and time issuing Verifiable Credentials efficiently, including the option to issue in bulk, prevent fraud, and reduce manual work.  Verifying Organizations: Save time, resources, and money by verifying credentials instantly without having to contact issuing organizations.  Individuals: Only provide the relevant information to a verifier without disclosing unnecessary information and confirm claims without revealing the actual data.  Developers: Enhance the user experience by authenticating securely without the need for passwords.  <p>There are two main ways Self-Sovereign Identity blockchain companies can enable people to preserve privacy: </p><p>1) Selective Disclosure</p><p>You can decide which data of a credential you want to show to a verifier without revealing unnecessary information than what is requested. For example, if you need to be at least 18 to receive a service, you can show your birth date from your license that was issued as a Verifiable Credential without showing your name or address. </p><p>2) Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</p><p>With zero-knowledge proof technology, Self-Sovereign Identity providers go even further to help people maintain privacy by proving you are 18 years old or over without even revealing your date of birth. This is made possible with the use of cryptography where the holder can show the verifier that they meet a certain requirement (like minimum age, income, or area of residence) without needing to show the data that supports that proof. </p> How Blockchain, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials Work Together <p>We’ll go through an example that demonstrates how all of these pillars of SSI work together. </p><p>Let’s say there’s an online course on how to use a project management tool that will issue a certificate as a Verifiable Credential after students complete the course. </p>  Holder: Dawn Lopez completes the Jira Advanced Course and has a digital identity wallet  Issuer: Zip Education is an online course provider that issues a certificate to course graduates  Verifier: Employer hiring someone with project coordination skills and trusts Zip Education as an issuer    Dawn creates a DID with her digital identity wallet for professional purposes and the DID automatically comes with a private and public key pair.  Dawn successfully completes Jira Advanced Course.  Zip Education uses their private key to sign and issue a certificate to the student using Dock Certs. The Certs API is connected to their existing system.  The Dock blockchain holds the public DIDs of Zip Education and Dawn.  Dock Certs generates a PDF and JSON version of the certificate and Zip Education emails this credential to the student. Dock will soon have an update to automatically send the credential to the holder’s wallet. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.  Dawn imports the credential on her Dock wallet.  An employer who trusts Zip Education as an issuer verifies the credential by uploading the JSON file onto Dock Certs.   <p>Here is another example of how public and private keys are used in the SSI system. </p>  Holder: Tommy  Issuer: Government department  Verifier: Online English education company  <p>An online English education company in Japan wants to hire contract teachers from the USA and Canada only. They use Verifiable Credentials as part of their screening process to ensure that teachers are residents in North America.</p>  Tommy has a DID in his Dock Wallet and wants to add his passport details on it  Tommy goes to the government office and the staff asks him to scan a QR code, which enables a secure connection and exchange of DIDs  The staff uses the private key to sign and issue the digital passport as a Verifiable Credential  Tommy accepts the credential and stores it in his wallet  The online education company requests data to confirm that he lives in Canada or the USA  Tommy authorizes the online education company to see his relevant data  The company verifies the credential that confirms that he lives in Canada  In this example, the government issues a passport to someone as a Verifiable Credential. Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet <p>A secure Self-sovereign Identity wallet is essential because it allows people to carry their credentials anywhere on their phone or digital device. Portability is one of the principles of SSI.</p><p>Key aspects of an SSI wallet:</p>  Enables people to securely store and manage DIDs and Verifiable Credentials without relying on a third party  A holder must give the authorization to share data to a verifier who needs to confirm eligibility to access services or products  Makes it harder for companies to track or correlate information back to the user  People can access websites and apps without revealing personal information or any more details than necessary  People can sign in with a DID rather than creating a new account with a user name and password to access another website or app  <p>If Sarah wants to buy alcohol and needs to prove she is at least 18 years old, she can do this without revealing her date of birth or any other details about her identity by using a Self-Sovereign Identity wallet that has implemented zero-knowledge proof technology. </p>  The cashier requests data from her wallet that confirms that she is at least 18 years old (with her driver’s license) and Sarah is prompted to give permission to share the data  When Sarah approves the request, this creates a secure connection between the store and Sarah’s wallet while exchanging DIDs.  Sarah’s driver’s license confirms that she is at least 18 years old. Because of zero-knowledge proof technology, her license details like the actual date of birth and her full name are not revealed at all and the store trusts that the data provided by the issuer, the licensing organization, is legitimate. A verifier can use the issuer’s DID and associated public key on the blockchain to check that the data in the user’s wallet is authentic.   <br>Dock Wallet Dock's Self-Sovereign Identity wallet enables users to securely manage their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials.<p>The <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> is a secure Self-Sovereign Identity wallet that allows people to securely store their DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and take them anywhere. You can import Verifiable Credentials through QR code or a JSON file. </p> Self-Sovereign Identity Use Cases <p>SSI can be used in many ways across a variety of sectors and new use cases are continuously being developed. Below are just a few examples.</p><p>Supply chains</p><p>Verify parties and documents instantly in the supply chain while tracing the source of products that are tracked on the blockchain. </p><p>Streamline the recruitment process</p><p>Organizations that want to recruit high-quality candidates efficiently can verify educational and professional credentials like a university degree and professional certificates instantly with SSI. This will save days to weeks compared to traditional manual verification processes. </p><p>Healthcare</p><p>In order to provide efficient and consistent service based on accurate information on a patient’s identity and medical history, SSI can help maintain an accurate record that can be shared efficiently with relevant healthcare providers. </p><p>Authenticating employees and contractors<br>Organizations can issue Verifiable Credentials for an employee or contractor status. Holders can login with their Self-Sovereign Identity wallet. Organizations can add credentials that expire for temporary contractors. </p><p>Cross border processes and duties</p><p>Track shipment credentials and how they are used. </p><p>Know Your Customer Compliance (KYC)</p><p>KYC compliance can be streamlined by implementing Verifiable Credentials during the client onboarding process. Instead of doing a different KYC process for every service you sign up for, you can reuse your KYC credentials. For example, if Company A ran a KYC and issued you Verifiable Credentials, you can reuse these same credentials when you sign up for Company B to speed up the KYC process. </p><p>NFTs</p><p>SSI can help prove who created, owned or currently owns non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across their lifecycle. SSI can enable someone to prove they own an NFT without having to connect their ETH wallet. </p><p>Income proof for financial and government services<br>You can provide proof of income without revealing your actual total earnings. </p><p>Voting for an organization like a club or company<br>SSI can be used to ensure that only members can attend and vote. Their credentials will be linked to their DID and their names won’t be revealed. &nbsp;The organization can trust that people are who they say they are and they have the right to vote because they can cryptographically prove they own the rightful DID.</p><p>Immigration and demographic information <br>Verifiable Credentials can include details that would be needed to qualify for government services such as being old age, a veteran, Native/Aboriginal, or have a disability status. VCs can speed up the verification process because people can use these credentials to apply for a government program or prove something about themselves quickly with no wait times.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity Standards <p>SSI standards that help people create and manage their digital identities are a continuous work in progress. Standards include data models, open-source code, APIs, and more. These are the key standards that have been developed:</p> W3C: Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations 1.0<br> <p>The W3C Credentials Community Group explores the creation, storage, presentation, verification, and user control of credentials. The group published a first version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/05/vc-data-model/CGFR/2017-05-01/">Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations 1.0</a> in May 2017. The specification discusses the criteria of verifiable claims. By this standard, a self-sovereign architecture for verifiable claims is one where the holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their identifier and how they are used.</p> W3C DID: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 <p>The W3C DID Working Group established standards for DIDs in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> where they specify a variety of criteria including a common data model, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent. </p> Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <p>The <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity-foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> is an engineering-driven organization that represents a diverse, international collection of organizations and contributors working together to establish an open ecosystem of decentralized identity that is accessible to everyone. </p><p>DIF has a variety of working groups establishing standards and protocols (a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices) including the following: </p>  Identifiers and discovery: DIF members are working on protocols and implementations that enable the creation, resolution, and discovery of DIDs and names across decentralized systems like blockchains  Authentication: Members design and implement DID-based authentication spec, standards, and libraries  DID Communication: Produce one or more specifications that embody a method for secure, privacy, and authenticated message-based communication (where possible) where trust is rooted in DIDs.  Secure data storage: Create one or more specifications to establish a foundational layer for secure data storage.    Trust Over IP Foundation <p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/why-toip/overview/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> was founded in 2022. The organization: </p>  Promotes global standards for confidential and direct connections between parties  Leverages the opportunities for interoperable digital wallets and credentials  Protects citizen and business identities by anchoring them with verifiable credential signatures  <p>They have several working groups including: </p>  Governance stack: Working to define models and interoperability standards for governance frameworks that enable business, legal, and social trust between entities implementing the Trust over IP architecture stack.  Technical stack: Define the technical standards, test suites, and interoperability certification standards for the Trust Over IP architecture stack    How to Create a Self-Sovereign Identity With Dock Mike walks through the steps of how to create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential with Dock Certs.<p>Dock is a Self-Sovereign Identity platform, where people can create DIDs, issue, and verify credentials.</p>  Create as many DIDs as you want in Dock Certs  Easily issue Verifiable Credentials with the option to issue in bulk  Instantly verify credentials by uploading a JSON file under Credentials&gt;Verify   Summary of Key Terms <p>Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. </p><p>Centralized identity: Administrative control by a single authority or hierarchy.</p><p>Data breach: When an unauthorized person or party steals, views, transmits, copies, or uses information.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personal identifiable information. </p><p>Federated identity: Allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains using a single set of credentials.</p><p>Holder: Someone who owns the Verifiable Credential and stores it in their digital wallet app.</p><p>Issuer: Person or organization with the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people and organizations to prove ownership, sign Verifiable Credentials, and give consent to share selected data. </p><p>Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to. </p><p>Selective Disclosure: You can decide which data of a credential you want to show to a verifier without revealing unnecessary information than what is requested.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity: A model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on anyone or organization.</p><p>User-centric identity: This model suggests that users are in the middle of the identity process, the user must have more control over their identity, and trust must be decentralized.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can present to verifiers.</p><p>Verifier: The person or organization checking the credential.</p> Conclusion <p><br>Since the invention of the internet, people have dominantly used centralized and federated identifiers like emails and user names to access websites and apps. Centralized identity systems often make organizations vulnerable to large scale hacks and data branches while federated systems can enable companies to use people’s personal data to store and track their online activity without their knowledge. Centralized identity management systems have resulted in recurring data breaches, loss of individual control of their data, stolen identities, and the spread of confidential information. </p><p>Also, because ID and credential verification processes are very slow, expensive, inefficient, and outdated, credential fraud and lack of product traceability is a big problem in many sectors, particularly in supply chain and licensing.</p><p>These problems led to the development of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. There are a growing number of use cases that can implement Self-Sovereign Identity management across a variety of sectors including healthcare, finance, education, and cryptocurrency.</p><p>Key Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Individuals</p><p>Developers</p><p>Significantly reduce costs and resources by verifying credentials, certificates or documents instantly instead of days and weeks</p><p>Full ownership and control over your identity without relying on a third party&nbsp;</p><p>Build apps that eliminate the need for password, which creates a better user experience</p><p>Issue fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials efficiently and at a much lower cost</p><p>Create your own DIDs and fully manage your data with a digital wallet&nbsp;</p><p>Removes inefficient authentication processes like using text or email for secondary verification</p><p>Improved security with public-key cryptography</p><p>You can choose which data to share and with whom to share it with while having the ability to remove access to the data at any time</p><p>Request data directly from users rather than a third party</p><br><p>Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks, breaches, lawsuits, and fines by storing less user data&nbsp;</p><p>Personal data is not stored on centralized servers</p><br><br><p>You don’t have to provide unnecessary and excessive information than what is requested like showing your full name if you only need to confirm your country or residence</p><br><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

 GlobaliD 101: Every company is an identity&nbsp;company <p>In the first three parts of the GlobaliD 101 series, we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <p>At first, every company was a tech company. Every business needed a digital strategy. Back in 2017, Goldman Sachs’ CEO famously stated that the storied investment bank <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/goldman-sachs-a-technology-company/">was actually a tech company</a>: “We are a technology firm. We are a platform.”</p><p>Not long after, every company was a fintech company. Every business needed a way to manage money and payments. As Andreessen Horowitz’s <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/21/banking-on-the-future/">Angela Strange wrote</a> in 2019, “I believe the next era of financial services will come from seemingly unexpected places… Fintech is eating the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Fast forward to today, and every company is an identity company. Every business needs to connect with customers and users as well as manage their data, privacy, and trust in a compliant way.</p><p>In other words, every company is a verifier as part of the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Trust Triangle.</a></p><p>The problem is that most companies are focused on their core business — they’re not experts in the domain of identity, security, and data management. With the way digital identity works today, this becomes an incredibly expensive exercise, not only for businesses and institutions but also for society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Home Depot is in the business of selling home improvement supplies both in retail stores and online, but since 2014, the company has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-home-depot-cyber-settlement/home-depot-reaches-17-5-million-settlement-over-2014-data-breach-idUSKBN2842W5">spent nearly $200 million</a> in relation to a data breach that impacted over 52 million of its customers.</p><p>We’ve all seen the headlines — Home Depot is hardly alone in&nbsp;this.</p><p>Businesses and institutions have taken on much of the cost of an archaic approach to digital identity:</p>  $1 million per year <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705">spent</a> on password support costs&nbsp;alone  $6 million average <a href="https://www.akamai.com/lp/report/ponemon-the-cost-of-credential-stuffing-report">loss</a> from credential stuffing  $7-$30 million <a href="https://www.globalscape.com/resources/infographics/data-compliance-costs">spent</a> on data protection compliance  6%-9% of bank revenue <a href="https://www.ascentregtech.com/blog/the-not-so-hidden-costs-of-compliance/">spent</a> on compliance  $60 million per year <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9b18d648-4ff5-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc">spent</a> by financial institutions on KYC (Know Your Customer)  $163 billion in U.S. unemployment <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/27/fraud-had-significant-role-in-163-billion-leak-from-pandemic-era-unemployment-system.html">fraud</a> in&nbsp;2021  <p>That’s just the tip of the&nbsp;iceberg.</p><p>Identity needs don’t just increase expenditure and bloat for established firms, they also serve as barriers to entry for new upstarts, serving as a bottleneck for innovation.</p><p>There’s also the flipside to this, where companies and institutions that want to maintain a more frictionless experience for users must face the reality of diminished trust on their platforms — from bots to fake news, contributing to society’s growing trust&nbsp;deficit.</p><p>What if there was another&nbsp;way?</p><p>What if companies didn’t have to choose between focusing on their core business and becoming an identity company?

<p>85,000 USD in OCEAN is available for Web3 data economy projects!</p> Introduction <p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month, retroactively, rewarding the projects that contributed the most value to the ecosystem.</p><p>Round 21 has 85K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on August 8th, 2022, at midnight UTC.) 75K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD via our micro-grants run by <a href="https://www.algovera.ai/">Algovera&nbsp;AI</a>.</p><p>Round 21&nbsp;Dates</p><p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is September 6 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends September 8  Voting Starts on September 8  Voting Ends on September 12  Funding Deadline on September 26  <p>Goals in Improving OceanDAO</p><p>We are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who are engaged with the community and who are aligned with our value-add mission.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead  <p>Approaches to Improving OceanDAO</p><p>Towards these goals, we have received feedback from the community on possible approaches. After many iterations of discussion and design, we have arrived at the following.</p><p>The main change we are stewarding is a culture of “show don’t tell”: show us what you did, rather than tell us what you’re going to do. This is the main shift required for us to prepare ourselves for a future of retroactive grants where the community decides how much they’d like to reward you for the outcome, related to your number of yes votes, minus no votes, balanced through quadratic funding.</p><p>Second, we have come to see that OceanDAO is better suited to earlier-stage funding of projects. As projects get stronger, they are in better shape to seek funding from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a> grants program, complementary ecosystem grants programs, investors (angels, VCs), and potentially launching their own token. Given this, we have tuned OceanDAO to give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced projects, by capping the total funding amount for a project or team to 100k USD lifetime.</p><p>There is a category of an experienced team that has been using its funds to dole out micro-grants to their own sub-community. It doesn’t fit Shipyard because it’s too close to inception; it isn’t appealing to investors because it grants; yet it’s of value to the Ocean ecosystem and we want to encourage this. So, we have earmarked 10K USD to the first recipient of this, Algovera&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Between retroactive grants (which help for DAO efficiency) and shifting experienced projects to Ocean Shipyard and other sources, we feel comfortable reducing the total amount available per month, from 100K USD to 85K USD (including the 10K micro-grants). We tuned the funding ceilings per tier accordingly.</p><p>Round 21&nbsp;Specs</p><p>Total funding of 85,000 USD&nbsp;(min.)</p>  10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants.  100,000 USD max. per project in a&nbsp;lifetime  100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)  <p>Funding ceiling per tier, in a round (max possible that a project can request in a&nbsp;round):</p>  New projects — 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO))  Existing projects — 7.5K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)  Experienced projects — 15K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more&nbsp;grants)  <p>Grant Funding Categories</p><p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;Software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Submitting Proposals</p><p>We encourage you to submit proposals early.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Teams can reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for any guidance or assistance.</p><p>Please, do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>Funding Tiers are achieved by teams delivering on their grant promises, to unlock higher funding ceilings.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6,000 USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  6,000 USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  3,000 USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17,500 USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13,000 USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  35,500 USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There is specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-21-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R21</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>Note that R21 has earmarked for integration with Chainlink, TheGraph, Filecoin, and Arweave. (Ocean Shipyard specs for these are not quite ready&nbsp;yet.)</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features</p><p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases the probability of receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes.

  <p>Risk-based authentication (RBA) is quickly growing in popularity amongst identity and access management solutions. The reason is simple: it allows for improved customer experience by reducing friction in authentication journeys while maintaining appropriate security levels. While you can find many publications about what signals or technical controls RBA uses, the architecture of risk policies is somewhat customized and not widely discussed. Enterprises usually rely on their identity experts or vendors (third parties) during the implementation efforts. One of security's most important and essential goals is to enable and enrich business, therefore establishing a high-level logic that can be applied to various models.</p>

<p>Is there a blueprint you can universally use to deliver quality and relevant policies yourself? Which stakeholders should take part in designing risk policies?</p>

 The stakeholders 
<p>Identity architects should refrain from making the ultimate decision about risk policies in isolation from the rest of the business. Depending on the organization's structure, policy creation may require cross-business unit collaboration. After all, your privileged access management (PAM) and workforce identities may be something your security team oversees. Customer identity and access management (CIAM), on the other hand, may reside a bit closer to the business, namely the product. It depends on the use case, but the key stakeholders for CIAM are usually involved with security, risk, product management, and identity.</p>

 The classic outcomes of risk in authentication 
<p>Let's take a look at business-specific factors and discuss risk outcomes in authentication. There is no industry standard in RBA, but most vendors have adopted the three-level model of low/medium/high. In simple terms, these designations mean:</p>

<p>Low: You do nothing. (Access is allowed.)</p>
<p>Medium: You do something. (For example, you compensate for the risk using multifactor authentication [MFA].)</p>
<p>High: This marks the end of the road. (Access is denied.)</p>

<p>What most organizations tend to forget is that there is always a fourth outcome, which I like to call "default," but, in reality, it should be called "failed." If you look at RBA as an enhancement of the authentication (nonessential), the failure to assess the risk should not be a disqualifying factor. If you cannot validate the username and password, there's no path to success because it's strictly essential for security. If the security baseline, however, accounts for specific risk levels, you have to classify it as essential, and then the inability to assess risk could mark the end of the road (access denied).</p>

<p>What should the business do if the system failed to evaluate the signals? After all, your RBA engine may be that of a third party, or it may be using a third party to deliver signals, like an IP address reputation service. What's interesting is that there is no right or wrong answer. It depends on the business and on risk levels that business is willing to accept (risk appetite).</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 1: The (Forgotten) Default Outcome 
<p>Any security or risk wizard will tell you it is a balancing act. The more security, the more the friction (at least in principle). Business (product) may vote for "low," as much as the security or risk teams vote for "high." Usually, the argument would be supported by some numbers. An example would be loss associated with an estimated number of false positives.</p>

<p>You could venture a rule of thumb here and say, "when in doubt – average out," meaning default to "medium." While it's not a showstopper, this level provides a certain amount of assurance.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 2: The Risk Outcome Formula 
<p>How do you calculate risk scores to deliver the right outcomes? The answer is of paramount importance. Though it's a finite number of permutations, every use case and every business will be different. CIAM will be different from workforce identity and access management in the same way that government use cases differ from the private sector. Some solutions allow you to assign weights to the signals, and this is a first step in modeling the risk. But many think of the risk score as a direct derivative of signals in some proportionate mathematical model.</p>

<p>Averaging risk scores out across the board is ineffective. It makes sense in some use cases (global email providers, for example), but not everywhere all the time. You know your audience and use cases well enough to build a high-level picture of what should be classified as normal and what would be considered anomalous. To put it into context, here are examples of what you need to examine.</p>

 The landscape of devices being evaluated 
<p>For the workforce, you may be issuing a standard laptop to our employees. Therefore, a drastic change of context (moving from MacOS to Linux) should be a stronger signal than in a consumer case, where I may use my laptop (MacBook), my wife's desktop (an old iMac), or my son's iPad to purchase items online.</p>

 Geolocation 
<p>Geolocation is often called impossible travel. An organization, like an air-traffic control center, for instance, has a secure location, from which the staff operates. Due to safety and strict regulations, employees must work from the operation center. They will never experience an impossible travel scenario, so it should be a signal strong enough to take us to the "high"outcome on its own. A business using VPN technology (without split-tunnel approach) is prone to false positives as far as impossible travel is concerned. If you hit anomalous geo-velocity on its own, you should classify this as "medium."</p>

 Signal combinations 
<p>In the example above, impossible travel may be anomalous but plausible. Therefore, you can treat it with MFA. (The risk was "medium.") What if it was accompanied with a strong user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) signal, such as an operating system change? If the user moves from MacOS to Windows along with impossible travel, does that still qualify as a "medium" risk? Certain signal combinations may elevate to higher risk levels and, in this particular workforce scenario, it could well be classified as "high." The combinations depend on the signals used and the level of knowledge about the customer's patterns. As far as the rest is concerned, it's okay to average out.</p>

<p>Once you have created this blueprint, you can then translate it to technical controls. Both risk engine and policy (or multiple policies) that average, sum or multiply individual signals to to deliver the scores.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 3: The "When" 
<p>Your RBA policy may differ in the function of time. For example, a bank may not want to allow an account to be opened if the request is anonymous (for example, coming from TOR – The Onion Router – or a known proxy/VPN anonymisation service). In the language of RBA, the risk is "high."</p>

<p>If, however, you are trying to access the account, the risk may be classified as "medium." Unfortunately, privacy aficionados will be classified as risky for the foreseeable future. Not because you dislike their desire for total privacy, but because there are so many bad actors trying to cover their tracks in defrauding businesses. This approach has been widely accepted by email providers. Try to open a Gmail account from TOR, and you will see for yourself. Global providers may resort to "medium", while smaller (countrywide vendors) may end the journey and require identity proofing to confirm the requestor.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 4: The "What" 
<p>Risk is not just a front-end function. It has its back-end counterpart. What I mean by that is the criticality or data classification in the protected resources themselves. Confluence or Jira may require an MFA once a month if the risk is "low," but a competitive intelligence portal or a financial system may need much higher assurance levels more frequently. You may want to design policies based on the application classification, too. This involves weighing the signals, calculating, and treating the outcomes differently.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 5: The Custom Model 
<p>It's relatively straightforward to classify the outcomes as "low," "medium," or "high." But what if an organization chooses to use MFA every time? Salesforce is a good example here, and it was a subject of conversation in this year's Identiverse conference. You now need to "do something" as a baseline (just as in a "medium" risk outcome). The "low" and "medium" outcomes are somewhat combined into one, effectively moving into a "low"/"high" framework.</p>

<p>Well, that's not necessarily true.</p>
	
<p>Let's return to the reasons for applying RBA in the first place. It's a balancing act between customer experience (lower friction) and security (fraud prevention). If you need to perform MFA for everybody, you could introduce the MFA cookie. If the risk is "low," you can challenge the user, but only once a while (a day, a week, a month) for a given device/browser. If the risk is "medium," you can challenge them every time.</p>

<p>The business may also determine that no risk level should be a definite showstopper. Once again, it's a balancing act. It turns out that false positives and showstopping friction may be more costly than factoring the fraud loss into the business. There are formulas that allow us to calculate losses from non-returning customers due to false positives.</p>

<p>What you can do is reach for much stronger controls such as MFA methods at certain assurance levels. A push notification is not as prone to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks as one-time passwords (OTPs) are. You could also use multiple channels to confirm the identity (voice recognition and an authenticator app), which makes security much stronger. Ultimately, you may want to carry out proofing as a compensating control to reduce the risk level below its appetite threshold.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, risk calculation and treatment are most effective when you implement the concept of continuous authentication.</p>

 Continuous Authentication 
<p>It's important to remember that risk level may change within the context of a device if, for example, you have multiple app classifications or policies. At the same time, if the bad actor steals your SSO cookie, there's nothing that stops access from being granted to a federated application. RBA could potentially remediate this problem, but only if the authentication is a continuous process. It doesn't require a challenge for credentials every time someone lands on the authorization server or login page (that would defy the SSO concept). But you can honor the session and assess the risk every single time. If it all checks out, the experience is excellent (minimal friction). If you suspect it's fraudulent, you now have an opportunity to stop the access or add controls to validate the request.</p>

<p>OAuth workgroups are working on adding a standard for "origin protection," but it's in its relatively early days. A similar concept is used today in dynamic authorization, where you evaluate every call against a fine-grained, ABAC/PBAC engine. So why not do that for the first out of the three As, too? (AAA = Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.)</p>

 Brace for False Positives 
<p>No matter how well you design the risk policies, you will hit false positives. If it's designed well, there won't be many, but you need to be prepared to treat them. Ideally, you will have a whitelist or an override mechanism that allows you to quickly remediate showstopping paths if they're inappropriate. This is a business function that you need to develop yourself. While risk solutions may have technical controls to allow you to bypass certain signals or outcomes in the journeys, the decision about which one is classified as a false positive and its validation is entirely the business's responsibility. You may have a salesperson going into a meeting with an amazing prospect who recently has been hacked and their IP reputation is low (bad). They may be using a VPN or a service to make their guests anonymous. You really want to be able to run the demo no matter what. A good process and procedure of classification and remediation is essential.</p>

 One-Off, or a Continuous Process? 
<p>RBA deployment is not a one-off process. When considering risk outcomes and the ability to calculate them, break them down into a binary classification of those you know about and those you need to learn about. Known credential attacks (spraying, stuffing, brute-force) can be acted on right from the beginning, while user behavior is something the system needs to learn.</p>

<p>Aside from that, analyzing RBA data periodically (every six months, for example), will allow you to further fine-tune the policies and the engine. You may find that your most risky events come from a specific geolocation, network, or application, in which case you would tighten the controls around those use cases. On the other end of the spectrum, you may find there are a lot of false positives, and you may want to relax the controls a little around where they occur.</p>

 How Does ForgeRock Autonomous Access Fit into This Model? 

<p>The ForgeRock Autonomous Access engine design allows for the flexibility to create desired outcomes. Its custom logic adapts to almost any scenario or blueprint you want to implement, while the orchestration in the journeys (authentication trees) allows for accommodating "the when" and "the what" and for managing controls for false positives.</p>

<p>It also allows for fine-tuning of the AI/ML models, which is unique in the market. Autonomous Access is an extremely powerful anti-fraud tool that is easy to implement and follows the logic of the business-first approach.</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>Risk-based authentication is a brilliant concept. It may seem that it's all about signals and treating risk. But of equal importance are the calculation of security breach likelihood, tweaking of the engine, and customizable policies designed for specific operations.</p>

<p>If you are considering implementation of risk-based authentication, engage with key stakeholders and look at the technology/security as a function of a "business first" approach. Adapt the product to your enterprise instead of accepting the default model from the vendor. That way you can create excellent journeys, with minimal friction for your consumers (both external and internal), and a quality security posture driven by fraud prevention. It's a balancing act and "secure-enough" is much better than just "secure."</p>

<p>BOTLabs GmbH Secures Polkadot Parachain Slot</p><p>BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, is proud to announce plans to move the KILT blockchain from the Kusama Relay Chain to the Polkadot Relay Chain. The Polkadot parachain slot required for this move was secured by BOTLabs in auction 24 last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The Kusama and Polkadot Relay Chains provide shared security to parachains. Kusama is the experimental network, while Polkadot provides additional levels of stability and security. KILT is a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). KILT went live in September 2021 after winning a Kusama parachain slot.</p><p>During the last 11 months many new functionalities were added to KILT, and the network has proven its efficiency and utility to tens of thousands of users. Fifty partnerships within the blockchain and identity ecosystems have been established; Web3 apps including <a href="http://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> has been developed using KILT Protocol and the KILT blockchain. KILT has proven to be a mature infrastructure.</p><p>Now large-scale enterprises in the accounting, media and medical sectors are starting to implement business cases on KILT. These production systems will require extreme stability and bank-level security, which KILT cannot provide within the experimental Kusama network. So it’s time for KILT to move to Polkadot.</p><p>We will follow the original plan of “one KILT network, one KILT Coin”. By mid-October 2022, the network will be moved seamlessly from Kusama to Polkadot, leaving all functionality and the following data unchanged:</p>  All KILT Coin balances (including vesting)  All addresses  All attestations and credentials  All DIDs  All web3names  <p>There will be no difference for the user. All KILT Coin balances will be moved automatically onto the new Polkadot parachain. There is no change to the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">KILT Token Economy</a> and there is no fork or redenomination.</p><p>The migration to Polkadot is exciting news and sets the stage for KILT’s growth across the industry and institutional landscapes. We would like to thank the fantastic Kusama community for all the support, the fun, the engagement and the chaos. And we are excited to continue our work with the impressive projects on Polkadot, as KILT strives to become the fundamental digital identity infrastructure within the Polkadot ecosystem and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Next week a timeline and FAQs with technical and governance details will be published. Until then, here are answers to a few questions you may&nbsp;have:</p> FAQs <p>Q: As a KILT Coin holder, DID-owner, credential-holder, staker/delegator, or web3name owner: what will change for&nbsp;me?</p><p>A: Nothing.</p><p>Q: After the move, will my KILT Coins be available on both the Kusama and Polkadot parachains?</p><p>A: No. They will be automatically moved for you to the Polkadot parachain.</p><p>Q: As a KILT Coin holder, DID-owner, credential-holder, staker/delegator, web3name owner: is there any action required from&nbsp;me?</p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: As a collator, an exchange, or a project using KILT RPC or extrinsics, is there anything I have to&nbsp;do?</p><p>A: Yes. When KILT starts on Polkadot, you will need to change an endpoint. Documentation will be available in early September, well in advance of the&nbsp;switch.</p><p>Q: Will the switch to Polkadot occur after Lease 9 starts later this&nbsp;month?</p><p>A: No. The switch will be initiated via a governance proposal in mid-September by BOTLabs, then the KILT community will vote. If approved, the switch will be enacted in early&nbsp;October.</p><p>Q: Was there a crowdloan for KILT’s Polkadot slot and I missed&nbsp;it?</p><p>A: No. KILT has a low-inflation <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">token economy</a> that does not allow for further crowdloans. New crowdloans would dilute the community.</p><p>Q: Then who was parathread 2057?</p><p>A: BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, bid anonymously for KILT last week as&nbsp;#2057.</p><p>Q: Did BOTLabs sell KILT coins and use the money to pay for the&nbsp;slot?</p><p>A: No. BOTLabs has not sold any KILT Coins since KILT launched in September 2021.</p><p>Q: Wasn’t it planned that the KILT Treasury bids for the&nbsp;slot?</p><p>A: Yes, but that would have required a functioning bridge between Kusama and Polkadot. This bridge doesn’t exist yet. And waiting isn’t an option — KILT’s upcoming enterprise integrations require the stability and bank-level security that Polkadot provides.</p><p>Then the next Polkadot parachain slot (June 2024) should be obtained by the KILT network itself, using Treasury&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Q: Who are these large enterprise partners that will be integrating KILT?</p><p>A: We will announce KILT integrations later this fall with top accounting firms, global media companies and medical institutions.</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a blockchain R&amp;D company founded in 2018 and based in Berlin.

<p>Holochain is all about teaching computer networks to act like healthy human networks: sharing resources, contributing and receiving, cooperating to reach a useful shared approximation of the truth. So it was no surprise to me to see that very thing happening among the humans who came to our first in-person Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive in Kelchsau, Austria.</p><p>I could attribute this to the careful participant selection process stewarded by Liz Penny and Muhammad Meigooni. Both of them have lots of experience seeing people’s characters and calling out their best natures, skills they earned working together in educational organisations like <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>.</p><p>I could also point to the way that Marcus Phillips, the lead curriculum designer and facilitator, set expectations at the beginning of the course — explaining that when we all move together in our learning journey, we each move faster. In particular, when we don’t understand a concept and have the courage to voice our confusion, we help out everyone who secretly has the same questions.</p><p>And while all of this work contributed to the personality of the group, and requires many years of skill and experience to execute well, it’s also true that the participants themselves are simply great people. They devoted themselves to helping each other out as they journeyed together. They chopped carrots and put dishes away. They collaborated on inspiring, useful, and silly Holochain apps. They hiked, swam, philosophised, and played fussball. I don’t want to get too gushy, but I think the students and staff created a magical culture together.</p>Working through a hard problem togetherA student-led outdoor tai chi class What was the course like? <p>I have to be honest — between grocery shopping, food prep, photography, and other operational tasks, I didn’t get to focus on the coursework as much as I’d hoped. But what I did take in, I loved. And the other students clearly got a lot out of it too.</p>Sometimes misunderstandings are just as educational as perfect understanding<p>I was there partly to learn more about Marcus’ unique educational approach. As co-founder of Hack Reactor, he’s had a lot of opportunities to learn what works and what doesn’t. And what he’s discovered is that you can understand any complex subject if you break it down into bite-sized pieces that build on pieces you already understand. The goal is to find the shortest path through an infinite landscape of ideas, building each idea upon the last. Sounds pretty obvious, but it’s an art — it’s hard to design a curriculum that does this well. (On some nights I glimpsed the curriculum team furiously refining the next day’s slides, trying to get them just a little bit more elegant and digestible.)</p>The curriculum team refining tomorrow’s slides<p>Back in June I asked Marcus about the core of his approach. He said it boiled down to two rules:</p>  Never introduce a new concept until the concepts it builds on are thoroughly understood.  Move from understanding to experience as quickly as possible, because success is a great motivator.  <p>I found rule 1 particularly compelling. It naturally leads to the bite-sized pieces approach I mentioned before. The curriculum team — Marcus, Muhammad, and Guillem Cordoba — applied this rule rigorously to every concept, shaping and reshaping each slide until it was brief yet thorough.</p><p>It’s also what led Marcus to make the bold but comforting statement that in your learning journey you will get it wrong — and that’s okay. In fact, he encouraged us to get it wrong as often, as quickly, and as publicly as possible, because that’s the fastest way to explore every nook and cranny of our understanding. Once we were even told to “think about all the possible ways that [this concept] could be misunderstood” and share them.</p>Marcus walking students through a challenging distributed computing concept<p>Underneath this, of course, was the understanding that this was a safe place to get things wrong. This was something that the entire team established early on — not just at the beginning of the course but during intake interviews too. And I saw my fellow classmates practicing this, in their respectful listening during lectures and in spontaneous mutual support sessions with each other during free time.</p>Students discussing the finer points of Holochain in the evening<p>It was only when we all felt comfortable with a concept and had no more questions that we moved on to the next concept. Interjections were encouraged. The facilitators asked us to reflect back what we heard, then worked with us to refine our understanding. We didn’t have to go over every detail, but we did get the chance to grasp the basics well enough to be able to fill in the blanks for ourselves later.</p><p>This seems counterintuitive. You might think that this process would slow the whole thing down. But it really works. Instead of taking four days to learn Rust, we finished in only three — which left us more time to learn Holochain! And that’s what everyone was there for anyway.</p><p>Many developers are already familiar with other ‘slowing down to speed up’ techniques. Test-driven development, pair programming, agile development, and Git workflow policies sometimes feel like speed bumps in the moment, but they streamline our processes and avoid catastrophic problems later on. I think this was similar; it’s much easier to untangle a small misunderstanding now than a big one later.</p>Guillem explaining the Holochain host API Capstone project: Holochain hackathon <p>After all the lectures and exercises, it was time to build something. After all, the goal of the course was to get people proficient in hApp development. The facilitators invited students to share what they wanted to work on and join projects that they found interesting.</p><p>And there were some pretty interesting projects:</p>  Łukasz G, Matthias M, and Thomas S created <a href="https://github.com/matthme/ephemeral-chat">Burner Chat</a>, a hilarious but fully working prototype of an ephemeral chat application. Its tag line is ‘no privacy, no encryption, just signals’, and as you could imagine, it uses signals rather than the DHT to send messages between nodes. As you type, each character is sent individually to the other participants — but your chat window is only so large, so the oldest part of the message progressively disappears. There were a lot of laughs and emoji confetti.  Wesley F <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks/pull/1">added internal linking</a> to Lightning Rod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a>, a collaborative text editor built on Holochain. This effectively turns Notebooks into a real-time wiki or a multi-user knowledge manager. This is a project of particular interest for Wesley — he’s passionate about knowledge management apps, which help him organise his thoughts and uncover new insights. The DNA plumbing is in place and the UX is basic but functional; I’m excited to see what he and others build on top of this!  Loren J, a Holo alumnus currently working on a popular social app for communities called <a href="https://hylo.com/">Hylo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-communities/pull/14">updated</a> the Holochain-powered <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-communities">Hylo Communities</a> app to work with the most recent version of Holochain. Holo acquired the Hylo codebase before open-sourcing it and <a href="https://holo.host/wp-content/uploads/Holo-Terran-Collective-Partner-on-Collaborative-Software-.pdf">handing</a> <a href="https://medium.com/terran-collective/in-partnership-with-holo-terran-collective-is-building-hylo-the-collaboration-platform-for-a-224dd6d1be1e">over</a> stewardship to the <a href="https://www.terran.io/">Terran Collective</a>, a software dev shop in San Francisco. Given this history, it’s great to see Hylo getting some Holochain love once again. Loren has more plans to integrate Hylo with Holochain; I’m looking forward to seeing what emerges in the coming months.  Duke J shared his recommendations and vision for an ideal suite of Holochain developer tools. This may not have been his first choice, but it became his focus as he faced challenges getting started on his hApp. As frustrating as it was for him, it did lead to great insights into how to improve the experience for new Holochain app developers. I’m hoping we’ll see his feedback make its way into our scaffolding and build tools in the future.  Abdoulaye D and Ryan L started work on a browser extension to add Holochain functionality to existing web apps. It loads Holochain’s <a href="http://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript client</a> into the current web page, allowing it to access your local conductor if it has permissions. This led Ryan to start work on another project: a tool to generate a JavaScript API that’s tailored to a specific coordinator zome. It will be able to read the zome’s public functions and call signatures, then create function stubs in JavaScript that call the conductor’s app API and handle serialisation and deserialisation of parameters and return values.  Guillem shared his plan to upgrade <a href="http://github.com/holochain/syn/">Syn</a>, a low-level toolkit for building real-time collaborative apps like Notebooks, to use <a href="https://crdt.tech/">conflict-free replicated data types</a> (CRDTs). Syn currently uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational transforms</a>, which work great when everyone is online but are clunky when people have patchy internet connections.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

<p>Frankfurt, 16th of August 2022</p>

<p>IDunion, the consortium created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, has reached the next stage in building a productive, cross-border ecosystem by founding a European cooperative with limited liability (Sociedad Cooperativa Europea, or SCE for short). </p>

<p>Founding meeting of the IDunion SCE on 20.07.2022 (from left to right: Mirko Mollik/TrustCerts GmbH, Markus Sabadello/ Danube Tech GmbH, Dr. Carsten Stöcker/ Spherity GmbH)</p>

  With the spin-off into the SCE, the infrastructure for verifiable credentials, which was researched and developed in the research project can now go live into production.   The European cooperative will be deploying and operating the necessary technical network to provide the operations.  This will allow citizens, private-sector organisations and government institutions to augment the digital identifications (eID) provided by governments with use of secure digital credentials for  identity attributes required across a wide range of use cases.   The legal form of the SCE was chosen as it offers a legally secure basis for the operations of an independent infrastructure for digital credentials.  While the IDunion research project was initiated with funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK), the European cooperative aims to secure private sector funding to provide a stable, non-profit business operation.   The decision to use the legal form of a Sociedad Cooperativa Europea was driven by IDunion’s core principles of neutrality and openness. It allows all legal entities that adhere to the community values to apply for membership to the SCE. Furthermore a future takeover or control by a single entity is prohibited by this legal form. The guiding principle of the cooperative is the joint establishment of the ecosystem – a task that no individual member can achieve on its own.  
<p>On 20.07.2022, the founding members Spherity, Danube Tech and TrustCerts signed the articles of association of the SCE in Essen. “We are very pleased to have achieved this milestone for the IDunion project,” says Helge Michael, consortium Leader of the IDunion research project. “With the IDunion SCE, we have created the ideal basis for building a future-proof identity ecosystem for Europe in which all members can work together as equals. Special thanks goes to the BMWK for providing the funding support as part of the research project ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’, which was an essential prerequisite to this next stage,” Michael continues. Dr. Carsten Stöcker, Managing Director of Spherity GmbH, adds: “IDunion SCE provides the legal basis for a cooperative governance structure, which strengthens the interests of individual participants in the interplay of decentralisation and cooperation without allowing a central platform operator to exploit its users economically.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>IDunion: The IDunion research project is a European network that brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organisations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields. Its aim is to develop a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE: IDunion SCE is a cooperative (European Cooperative Europea) with limited liability that will operate the production network for credential verification, based on the findings of the research project. The SCE and the network are subject to the community governance of its members. Initial founding members of the SCE are:</p>

<p>TrustCerts GmbH: The cyber security start-up TrustCerts from Gelsenkirchen focuses on verifiable credentials and digital identities. TrustCerts’ solution is based on a specially developed blockchain that is compliant with German data protection and security requirements.</p>

<p>Danube Tech GmbH: One of the first companies supporting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, the Vienna-based Danube Tech specialises in interoperability between different SSI networks across national borders. Among the products developed by Danube Tech are the Universal Resolver and godiddy.com.</p>

<p>Spherity GmbH: The German software provider Spherity provides secure and decentralised identity management solutions for companies, machines, products, data and algorithms. Spherity provides the enabling technology to digitise and automate compliance processes in highly regulated sectors. Spherity’s products strengthen cybersecurity and create efficiency and data interoperability between digital value chains.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel is an engineering team lead at Indicio and has been an active contributor to the decentralized identity space for over three years, as a maintainer of multiple projects in Hyperledger Aries and a contributor to Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One claim to fame is that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; one of the original members of the&nbsp; Hyperledger Indy Agent Working Group and continued contributing to it as it grew and into the Hyperledger Aries project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to contributing code to DIF, he is also the original author of the DIDComm-js library that’s been in use for the past few years. One last feather in his cap we will mention —although there are many more — is that he was the lead engineer on the Indy DID Method implementation effort, which represents a critical step forward in Hyperledger Indy interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting challenges for Daniel is finding ways that allow multiple different technologies&nbsp; to interact and work together at the same time – which is exactly what the team working on Hyperledger Aries has been striving for. For example, Aries agents have agent-to-agent communication taking place over DIDComm protocols, which enables implementations from different vendors and communities to interact. To enable the full verifiable credential/decentralized identity ecosystem, we also need ledger-to-agent communication in addition to agent-to-agent communication. As the community continues to build, Daniel is excited to shift his focus to more interoperability with ledgers outside of the Hyperledger ecosystem, such as Cheqd, Ion, EBSI, etc.</p>
<p>Being an experienced contributor to Aries and DIDComm, Daniel is well equipped to help represent that community in interoperability discussions and he looks forward to the opportunity:</p>
<p>“I am passionate about interoperability and believe it is key to adoption of decentralized identity and, by extension, a future where everyone’s privacy is better protected online. I look forward to getting more involved at the DIF! :)” —Daniel Bluhm</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon an article titled “<a href="https://amp-insurancejournal-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2022/07/12/675516.htm">Travelers Wants Out of Contract With Insured That Allegedly Misrepresented MFA Use</a>” and I was immediately intrigued. Since I work at an organization that solves MFA problems for organizations my first thought was, why would this happen?</p>
<p>I’m not going to call out the organization in question here, you can read the article for yourself to learn more about that. But let’s uncover what happened:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The cyber policy application signed by the CEO and “a person responsible for the applicant’s network and information security” that the company used MFA for administrative or privileged access.&nbsp; 
 However, following the May ransomware event, the insurer first learned during an investigation that the insured was not using the security control to protect its server and “only used MFA to protect its firewall, and did not use MFA to protect any other digital assets.” 
 The organization was the victim of a ransomware attack in December 2020 when hackers gained access using the username and password of an administrator, the organization told the insurer of the attack during the application process and said it improved the company’s cybersecurity. 
 
<p>Let’s quickly discuss cyber insurance:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sure you all have a policy, even if you’re not sure. Cyber insurance (also referred to as cyber liability insurance or data breach insurance) provides insurance coverage for events including data breaches, downtimes, and cyberattacks. Cyberattacks may include malware, ransomware, phishing, DDoS, hacking, insider threats, and more. Offerings and coverage will vary depending on the policy issuer.</p>
<p>So while the organization did have MFA in place, they did not fully commit to using it even after they experienced a previous breach. To me there are a couple of issues:</p>
 
 If an organization puts an MFA solution in place why not use it?&nbsp; 
 In this case, it feels like the organization brought in MFA just to meet a requirement, not for actual security needs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When organizations focus on checkbox compliance, they get into trouble, case in point. It’s important for organizations to build a culture of security, not one based on checkbox compliance. I know I’m stating the obvious, but breaches are real and will happen to you if you’re not prepared. An insurance policy should not be the fallback.</p>
<p>We all have insurance policies in our personal lives. I’m pretty confident that very few people leave their keys in the car and unlocked and when the car was stolen, then be surprised if the insurance company did not pay the claim. There is a level of responsibility required of the policyholder to do what they can to prevent an incident that would lead to a claim. Unfortunately for Travelers, it looks as though their client did not take any responsibility to protect their environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core values here at 1Kosmos is to make authentication easy AND secure for end users. So for organizations that may not have the best security practices, they can at least implement a technology that improves security and is very easy to use. That usability will go a long way toward protecting the environment because users will be more inclined to use it, making the environment more secure. Make your insurance your MFA, and leave the policy for when things happen beyond your control.</p>

<p>We have heard a lot about Decentralized Identity in the last few years. For both Spruce and TBD, Decentralized Identity and user control are at the center of both our missions, and we are excited to announce that we achieved another milestone towards interoperability.</p><p>We can only leverage the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we have a heterogeneous network (or network of networks) of issuers and verifiers that can produce and consume each other's data.

<p>Registering aspects of your identity on an inherently public and immutable medium such as a blockchain is risky, and needs to be done with care. As discussions around Soulbound tokens and the concept of a wider web3 identity layer become more common, more mechanisms for tokenized identity are emerging, some thought-through, some more ad-hoc. We at Civic believe there is a right way to do this (for details about why we do it at all, see <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/why-we-issue-identity-tokens/">here</a>), and propose the following pillars of tokenized identity. If you are considering integrating tokenized identity into your protocol, seek out a model that meets these requirements.</p>



 1. Privacy 



<p>There is a strong tendency when integrating a token-based identity system to simply tokenize all the things. If privacy (and gas) were not a concern, the inclination would be to register every possible atomic claim about an identity on chain. Consumers would pick and choose which claims to be interested in and which claimants to trust, in order to derive the ideal cocktail to obtain the result that they want.</p>



<p>Even without storing personally-identifying information (PII) directly on-chain, and instead storing a hash, there are still significant privacy concerns. Firstly, hashes are “pseudonyms” and therefore fall under the auspices of GDPR and similar regulations (see <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/papers/introduction-hash-function-personal-data_en">here</a>, <a href="https://www.gtlaw-dataprivacydish.com/2021/03/what-is-hashing-and-does-it-help-avoid-the-obligations-imposed-by-the-new-privacy-regulations/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/insights/is-it-possible-for-data-that-has-undergone-hashing-to-still-be-considered-personal-information.html">here</a>) and secondly, the more fine-grained and specific a token type is (think “age token” or “gender token”) the more information it can contribute to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_correlation"> identity correlation</a> and the more information it can betray publicly, purely by existing.</p>



<p>This is an issue that web3 will have to come to grips with either way, whether tokenized-identity mechanisms are used or not, as long as it maintains its stance on full public transparency. If someone interacts publicly (e.g. by voting) with one DAO that limits access to over-35s, another that limits access to women, and trades on a DEX that is only available to people in the EU, all under the same wallet, then it does not matter how those constraints are implemented, the information that this wallet belongs to an over-35 European woman is discoverable purely through that wallet’s interactions on-chain. Add to that the increasing trend of issuing NFTs for attendance at events, membership in real-life clubs, etc, and suddenly even things that are not intended as identity tokens become identity tokens.</p>



<p>At Civic, we take the position of being as broad as possible with Civic Pass, while allowing for flexibility and fine-grained access control via off-chain Verifiable Credentials. We are circumspect about which pass types we choose to issue, and in general, steer clear of issuing identity tokens based on specific claims or aspects of an owner’s identity, in favor of broader access-control-like passes such as proof of uniqueness/humanity, or simple CAPTCHA-based bot-resistance.</p>



 2. Decentralization 



<p>In any token-based gating mechanism, the token issuer, the “mint key”, holds the power. If a platform is gated by an NFT, the issuer of an NFT holds the power to allow or deny access to a platform. If that key holder is a single individual or organization, then it is not decentralized. You have a single point of control, a single point of trust, and a single point of failure, if that key disappears.</p>



<p>The mint key needs to be a multisig controlled by a DAO of some kind. The Gateway Protocol used by Civic Pass includes this decentralization layer directly through the “gatekeeper network” pattern. Each pass type is its own network, and each network is a separate DAO. Tokens issued by members of the network are indistinguishable and interchangeable. When you trust a Civic Pass of a particular type, you are trusting the network, not simply Civic itself. A network is bootstrapped by Civic but not owned by Civic.</p>



 3. Interoperability 



<p>One of the drivers of success in Web3 so far has been the emergence of standards, allowing clients and smart contracts to be based on generic tools rather than being bespoke to individual projects. ERC20 is a perfect example of this. While not perfect, its presence and almost ubiquitous adoption (in the Ethereum space) has enabled, from a technical perspective, practically all of DeFI.</p>



<p>The NFT space is somewhat more fragmented, with standards such as ERC721 and ERC1155 meeting different use-cases, and in fact, we are often asked whether Civic Passes could be issued as NFTs.</p>



<p>While there are similarities, we believe an identity token or pass spec requires features that NFTs typically do not include, such as the ability to expire or freeze, as well as a “DAO by default” component (see “Decentralization” above), and the <a href="https://github.com/identity-com/gateway-whitepaper/blob/main/gateway-whitepaper.pdf">Gateway Protocol whitepaper</a>, to which we contributed, has these features built in.</p>



<p>However, diversion and fragmentation of standards leads to interoperability problems, until clear winners emerge, and reduce the reusability of tokens and tools built to handle them. This is why we are working on a “derivation tool”, to allow Civic Pass holders to convert their passes to other standards (such as NFTs) in a secure and trustless way, in the spirit of the fifth law of <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">“The Laws of Identity”</a>, the prescient canon of digital identity.</p>



<p>Another aspect of web3 interoperability is cross-chain support. The future of multichain one, and a user should be allowed to take their identity with them across chains that they interact with. Likewise, if they have the pass allowing them to interact with a DeFi protocol on chain 1, they should be allowed to interact with an equivalent one on chain 2. If they have outstanding loans against their identity on chain 1, they should not be allowed to take out more on chain 2.</p>



<p>Civic Pass is built from the ground up to be multichain, and as we build out support for various chains, we are working on cross-chain mechanics in the following ways:</p>



  Reusable credentials: We issue reusable verifiable credentials, which allow a user to associate a wallet on a different chain with their identity, by re-presenting their credentials.  DIDs: We allow a user to add keys from multiple chains to their decentralized identifier (DID) on-chain, so that passes can be trustlessly reissued on new chains.  



<p>The first option maximizes privacy, ensuring that only the pass issuer, Civic, knows about the connection between the wallets. The second option maximizes trustlessness, as the user can essentially self-serve their pass on the second chain, by virtue of linking their wallets to one identity. The second option is also more suitable for cases such as proof of uniqueness, where linking multiple wallets to a single pass requires that link to be discoverable on-chain in order to trust it.</p>



 4. Pluralism of Identity 



<p>A user should not be tied to a single public key. Among the many reasons for this are security (key recovery, avoiding the need to carry around and sign with cold wallets) and privacy (users may want to present a different aspect of their identity to different audiences, or may not want to correlate their activity on one protocol with their activity on another.<br>As described in Interoperability, Civic uses DIDs and reusable Verifiable Credentials, to allow a user to associate their passes with multiple keys, or recover their identity if they lose wallet access. In general, Civic is committed to the idea that your Web3 identity is more than just your public key and is building the Civic Pass infrastructure based on DIDs.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenization is an important part of Web3 identity, but digital identity must ensure that the core values of human beings are respected. While many challenges may be addressed as the industry develops the technology (see e.g. <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/self-sovereign-identity-with-zero-knowledge-proof-9a05f36f16da">zero-knowledge proofs</a>), the biggest challenge of all is to set up a system that can be as flexible and nuanced as we need it to be, so that humans may be protected both in the real world and within Web3. By setting forth these pillars of tokenized identity, we hope to draw attention to a bigger and better vision of a system that protects humans while offering the best of the digital world.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The Human Factor 
<p>Cybercriminals often exploit our human vulnerabilities and psychological elements to steal credentials and gain unauthorized access. Since phishing and social engineering attacks are primarily targeted at people, the human factor continues to be an important element CISOs need to consider in order to protect their organizations from cyber-attacks. Most data breaches are caused by human error, negligence, or lack of awareness, for example, by simply clicking the wrong link. So, it is common for employees to increase their digital footprint without being aware of the risks involved.</p>
<p>We hear this repeatedly: “Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity.” This negative characterization of human nature is deeply ingrained in the cybersecurity industry. As a result, it prevents us from talking about how to better involve people in cybersecurity processes. In contrast to technology and technical processes, however, people are inconsistent and unpredictable. The human factor problem is complex because, by its nature, it involves a serious sociological, psychological, and philosophical discussion. Unfortunately, this conversation is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
 Fostering a cybersecurity culture 
<p>In the fight against cyberattacks, human intuition and creativity will always be crucial. During times of geopolitical tensions, for instance, security analysts can predict human behavior, anticipate criminal activities, and understand why threat actors target specific organizations. However, cybersecurity cannot and should not be the responsibility of a single team or department. It must be a shared responsibility across the entire organization, as well as its extended ecosystem of partners, suppliers, and customers.</p>
<p>As organizations embrace hybrid work models and accelerate cloud adoption, they have become more susceptible to account takeovers and other types of fraud. Therefore, it is important for employees to understand how cyberattacks can impact their businesses and how to protect themselves from day one. New employees should receive cybersecurity awareness training as part of their recruitment and onboarding process. In addition, security awareness training should be an ongoing process that must cover a wide variety of topics and examples of phishing, ransomware, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Although security training is useful and imperative, employees do not always use this knowledge without an incentive to do so. Some see gamification as a potential mean to promote active participation in cybersecurity activities, but that alone won’t be effective if there are no actual tools in place that will enable it. The modern cybersecurity landscape has become too broad and complex to be understood by individuals alone, so employing a defense-in-depth strategy may prove essential. By modernizing and automating IT processes, perhaps we can reduce and improve the human factor impact on cybersecurity.</p>
 Modernizing and automating IT processes 
<p>Instead of teaching people not to click on unsafe links, you might consider installing a mail security gateway that will block unsafe links. Instead of worrying about data loss when working from home – deploy a zero-trust access solution that will make those losses impossible. Instead of trying to prevent rogue administrators from destroying your infrastructure – use solutions that don’t need an administrator. Let users do what they are best trained for – earn profit for your business.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this does not imply that security training and awareness programs should be abandoned, since awareness already stops a number of attack vectors and lowers the need for expensive tools. Thus, implementing automated solutions and cultivating a cybersecurity culture simultaneously can help your organization stay safe from cyberattacks. While the human factor continues to be a major problem in cybersecurity, it is essential to implement the right tools. It is much easier to blame the end user for a data breach than to address the bigger and more challenging problem of modernizing and automating IT processes.</p>
 Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2022 
<p>The agenda of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> includes keynote presentations and panel discussions on a variety of topics including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5177/2">Building Resilience after a major Incident</a> which will explore resilience measures to be taken immediately after a major incident; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5185/2">Lessons Learned: Responding to Ransomware Attacks</a> which will discuss how managing ransomware attacks requires significant patience and foresight; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5211/1">Human Factors in Cybersecurity</a> which will dive deep into the role of humans at the center of cybersecurity; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5214/2">Overcoming vulnerabilities around Human Factors</a> which will focus on the vulnerabilities around human factors and the importance of security initiatives; and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5211/2">Rethinking cybersecurity from the human element point of view</a> which will present a comprehensive view of what happens when humans are at the center of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>CIP and KYC are vital procedures and guidelines to help keep customer data secure while also verifying a customer’s identity.</p>
<p>What is KYC CIP? Know your customer and customer identification procedures both relate to identifying someone based on their activities or information.</p>
 What Is Know Your Customer? 
<p><a href="http://irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/list-of-approved-kyc-rules">Know your customer</a> laws are requirements around customer identification and verification imposed on financial institutions to address fraud issues. Several laws intersect customer identity and verification, leading to KYC. KYC laws were initially part of anti-money laundering laws, put into place to mitigate laundering and fraud in investment firms and other high-value financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal? To ensure that financial institutions know who their customers are, follow reasonable procedures to verify their identities, assess their suitability and trustworthiness, and continue monitoring their behavior for any warning signs of malicious or fraudulent activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that “customers” here does not refer to day-to-day consumer interactions. Rather, it refers to businesses, investment firms or other individuals/organizations (fertile grounds for fraud and money laundering) looking to open business or investment accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/kyc-software/">KYC programs</a> contain three core components:</p>
 Customer Identification Program 
<p>Customer identification programs are a way to use customer documentation to verify that the customer is who they claim to be—a process defined and mandated by law. We will go into more detail about CIP in the next section.&nbsp;</p>
 Customer Due Diligence 
<p>Once the customer has been verified, the financial institution must perform due diligence to determine the trustworthiness of that individual. More specifically, the institution will perform background checks and verifications with professional references to determine that the customer isn’t a criminal or politically exposed person.</p>
<p>There are three different levels of due diligence:</p>
 
 Simplified Due Diligence: When the risk of fraud or theft is low, the organization may perform SDD. At this level, there is no required identity document verification required. This approach will only be used when the customer poses little or no risk of fraud. 
 Basic Customer Due Diligence: At the level of CDD, your organization must collect some basic forms of information from the customer to compare against criminal databases or other third-party sources of information.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: Some customers pose heightened risks for fraud—they may have a criminal background or they may be a PEP potentially vulnerable to bribery or blackmail.<br>
In this case, banks must conduct EDD procedures that could include collecting more background information, verifying their source of funding, requesting documentation on their wealth and its structure, or researching media reports and interviewing third parties.&nbsp; 
 
 Ongoing Monitoring 
<p>Just because the customer passes the initial screening doesn’t mean they will remain honest forever. Financial institutions must implement continuous monitoring activities around their customers to ensure the bank’s security and prevent future incidents of bank fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the factors that the organization may monitor as part of such a program include the following:</p>
 
 Unusual expenditures or transfers, typically much larger than average 
 An increased volume in transactions 
 Transfers or deposits to or from foreign banks&nbsp; 
 Transactions with anyone on a criminal or sanction list 
 
<p>Such activity may trigger filing a suspicious activity report. At a bare minimum, banks should have regularly updated risk reports to demonstrate the financial and legal risks they are taking and the steps they’ve taken to mitigate unlawful activities.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Customer Identification Procedures? 
<p>Customer identification procedures are internal procedures that financial institutions implement as part of their verification process under KYC. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 officially stated that financial institutions must maintain an internal CIP to aid the government in stopping money laundering. The U.S. The Patriot Act of 2001 expanded and codified the law for banks, savings and loans, and credit unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of any CIP is to effectively and within the bounds of compliance verify a customer’s identity. This first step of the KYC process is critical for security purposes and all the steps that follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few basic steps for any CIP process:</p>
 
 Data Collection: The bank must collect, at minimum, the name, date of birth, address, and Social Security number. However, to appropriately identify the customer, the bank may (and usually will) collect other information, typically documentation with photographic identification included.<br>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/authentication-identity-verification-system/">Identity Verification</a>: The institution verifies the customer’s identity. While the specifics of this process aren’t set into stone for every organization, they must be sufficient to ensure the customers’ identity reasonably. This can include comparisons against third-party databases, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a>, document verification, and identity assurance procedures.&nbsp; 
 Record Authorization: In addition to document verification and identification, the bank should compare the customer against government databases, no-fly lists, or known terrorist lists to determine criminal culpability. 
 Record-Keeping: The bank must document all their procedures for document verification and authorization. This means maintaining documents of records requests, secure storage of identifying information, explanations of discrepancies of data collected, and steps made towards resolution.<br>
 
 Record Retention: Banks must store and keep customer records for five years after the date the account or accounts are closed or, in the case of credit cards, after the account becomes dormant. 
 Customer Notice: The bank must provide adequate notification to customers about their document collection and identification processes, including the information they are collecting.&nbsp;

  <p>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) are essential practices for modern software development. In this post we cover the basics of how to add CI/CD for a JHipster microservices architecture and Kubernetes as the target cloud deployment environment.</p>

<p>Briefly, continuous integration is the practice of integrating code into the main branch of a shared repository early and often. Instead of integrating features at the end of a development cycle, code is integrated with the shared repository multiple times throughout the day. Each commit triggers automated tests, so issues are detected and fixed earlier and faster, improving team confidence and productivity. The chosen continuous integration platform is from CircleCI, a company founded in 2011 and headquartered in San Francisco. They offer a free cloud to test their services.</p>

<p>Continuous delivery is the practice of releasing to production often in a fast, safe, and automated way, allowing faster innovation and feedback loops. Its adoption requires the implementation of techniques and tools like Spinnaker, an open-source, multi-cloud, continuous delivery platform that provides application management and deployment features. The intersection between CI and CD is not always clear, but for this example, we assume CI produces and validates the artifacts and CD deploys them. The CI/CD workflow for the exploration of the proposed tools is illustrated below.</p>

 Create a Java microservices architecture 

<p>If you haven’t tried JHipster yet, you can do the classical local installation with npm.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.9.2
</code>   

<p>If you’d rather use Yarn or Docker, follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">jhipster.tech</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use the example <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">reactive-jhipster</a> from GitHub, a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring WebFlux, Vue as the client framework, and Gradle as the build tool. You can find the complete instructions for building the architecture in a previous post: <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.
Create a project folder <code>jhipster-ci-cd</code>.</p>

   <code>cd jhipster-ci-cd
http -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/bc7cbeeb1296bd0fcc6a09f4e39f4e6e472a076a/reactive-jhipster/reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl
</code>   

<p>After the generation, you will find sub-folders were created for the <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> services. The <code>gateway</code> will act as the front-end application and as a secure router to the <code>store</code> and <code>blog</code> microservices.</p>

<p>The next step is to generate the Kubernetes deployment descriptors. In the project root folder, create a <code>kubernetes</code> directory and run the <code>k8s</code> JHipster sub-generator:</p>

   <code>mkdir kubernetes
cd kubernetes
jhipster k8s
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You must set up the Docker repository name for the cloud deployment, so go ahead and create a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> personal account, if you don’t have one, before running the k8s sub-generator.</p>

<p>Choose the following options when prompted:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Root directory: ../ 
   Which applications? (select all) 
   Set up monitoring? No 
   Which applications with clustered databases? select store 
   Admin password for JHipster Registry: (generate one) 
   Kubernetes namespace: demo 
   Docker repository name: your-dockerhub-username 
   Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code> 
   Enable Istio? No 
   Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer 
   Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes 
   Use a specific storage class? (leave empty) 
 

 Configure Okta for OIDC authentication 

<p>One more configuration step before building the applications, let’s configure Okta for authentication. You must run the commands at the root folder of the project.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Add the settings from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> to <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Enable the OIDC authentication in the <code>jhipster-registry</code> service by adding the <code>oauth2</code> profile in the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>We are going to build the <code>gateway</code> and <code>store</code> in a continuous integration workflow with CircleCI.</p>

 Set up CI for JHipster with CircleCI 

<p>First, create the CircleCI configuration for the <code>store</code> microservice and the <code>gateway</code>. “What about the <code>blog</code> app?”, you might ask. I’m not including it in this example to streamline this tutorial. You should be able to configure it similar to the <code>store</code> if you want to deploy everything.</p>

   <code>cd store
jhipster ci-cd
</code>   
   <code>cd gateway
jhipster ci-cd
</code>   

<p>For both applications, choose the following options:</p>
 
   What CI/CD pipeline do you want to generate? CircleCI 
   What tasks/integrations do you want to include? (none) 
 

<p>You must tweak the generated configuration at <code>store/.circleci/config.yml</code>, as the following changes are required for successful execution:</p>
 
   Change the execution environment of the workflow to a dedicated VM, as that is required by the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/continuous_integration/circle_ci">TestContainers</a> dependency in tests. The chosen environment is <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/ubuntu-2004">LinuxVM</a>, a standalone Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine. 
   As the dedicated VM includes Docker, the Docker installation step in the configuration must be removed. 
   Add a conditional step for building and pushing the image to Docker Hub, only if the branch name is <code>main</code>. 
 

<p>Note: You can also configure the job to only build specific <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#branches">branches</a>.</p>

<p>The final <code>config.yml</code> must look like this:</p>

   <code>version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    environment:
      DOCKERHUB_USER: your-dockerhub-username

                    -Djib.to.auth.password=$DOCKERHUB_PASS          
</code>   

<p>Do the same updates to the <code>gateway/.circleci/config.yml</code> file. Additionally, the following change is required:</p>

 
   Add <code>~/.cache/Cypress</code> as a cache path 
 

<p>Be sure to replace <code>your-dockerhub-username</code> and set the correct <code>IMAGE_NAME</code>.
The final <code>config.yml</code> for the <code>gateway</code> must look like this:</p>

   <code>version: 2.1

</code>   

<p>To take advantage of the one-step GitHub integration of CircleCI, you need a <a href="https://github.com/signup">GitHub</a> account. After signing in to GitHub, create a new public repository <code>store</code>. Follow the instructions to push the existing repository from your local machine to GitHub using the command line. Do the same with the <code>gateway</code> project.</p>

<p><a href="https://circleci.com/integrations/github">Sign up</a> at CircleCI with your GitHub account, and on the left menu choose Projects. Find the <code>store</code> project and click Set Up Project. Configure the project to use the Fastest option (Use the <code>.circleci/config.yml</code> in my repo) and type <code>main</code> for the branch. Click Set Up Project to continue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Do the same for the <code>gateway</code> project. The configuration triggers an initial pipeline execution that will fail, because you still must set up Docker Hub credentials for both projects, allowing CircleCI to push the container images. At the <code>store</code> project page, on the top right, choose Project Settings. Then choose Environment Variables. Click Add Environment Variable. and set the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>DOCKERHUB_PASS</code> 
   Value: your Docker Hub password, or better, a Docker Hub access token if you have 2FA enabled. 
 

<p>NOTE: For creating a Docker Hub access token, sign in to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, and choose Account Settings in the top right user menu. Then, on the left menu, choose Security. Click New Access Token and set a description for the token, for example, circleci. Then click Generate and copy the new token. You can use the same token for both projects <code>store</code> and <code>gateway</code>.</p>

<p>Once a project is set up in CircleCI, a pipeline is triggered each time a commit is pushed to the configured branch. The pipeline in execution appears on the Dashboard page. You can also manually trigger the pipeline from the Dashboard if you choose the project and branch from the pipeline filters, and then click Trigger Pipeline. Before moving on to the next section, manually execute the store pipeline and the gateway pipeline once, to push the first image of each to Docker Hub.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: If you modify the configuration, and encounter CircleCI cache errors, the only way I found to recreate the cache is to update the version prefix, for example:</p>

   <code>v2-dependencies-{{ checksum "build.gradle" }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
</code>   

 Install Spinnaker on Google Kubernetes Engine 

<p>Although CircleCI supports deployment for common targets, Spinnaker is a deployment manager that supports multiple cloud providers, promoting artifacts through stages (dev, staging, UAT, production), and creating continuous delivery workflows. Spinnaker does not support CI, but it can listen to events and collect artifacts produced by external CI systems.</p>

<p>You can choose among the following installation environments for Spinnaker:</p>
 
   Distributed installation on Kubernetes 
   Local installation of Debian packages 
   Local git installation from GitHub 
 

<p>For this example, the distributed alternative was selected. But before the installation, learn about some key concepts in Spinnaker configuration.</p>

 Understand Spinnaker artifacts and accounts 

<p>A Spinnaker artifact is a named JSON object that refers to an external resource, for example, a Docker image or a file stored in GitHub. In a pipeline trigger, you can specify an expected artifact, and Spinnaker will compare the incoming artifact from the trigger and bind it to be used by the trigger or another stage in the pipeline.
Also in Kubernetes, the deployed manifests can be provided statically or as an artifact. In this example, manifests are provided as artifacts stored in GitHub.</p>

<p>For Spinnaker to access and act on resources, like Docker registries, cloud providers, and code repositories, different types of accounts must be enabled in the Spinnaker configuration, along with the credentials. In addition, the configuration has the optional step of associating Spinnaker with a Kubernetes service account, allowing you to restrict permissions over the cluster resources granted to Spinnaker.</p>

 Install Halyard 

<p>As described in Spinnaker <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/">docs</a>, the first step is to install <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/halyard/">Halyard</a>. For a local install in MacOS:</p>

   <code>curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/macos/InstallHalyard.sh
sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh
</code>   
<p>Verify the installation with:</p>

   <code>hal -v
</code>   

<p>You must also install <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/"><code>kubectl</code></a>, the Kubernetes command line tool, to run commands against the clusters.</p>

 Choose GKE for Spinnaker deployment 

<p>The second step is to choose a cloud provider for the environment in which you will install Spinnaker. For Kubernetes, Spinnaker needs a <code>kubeconfig</code> file, to access and manage the cluster. For creating a <code>kubeconfig</code> for a GKE cluster, you must first create the cluster. Google Cloud provides a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">free tier</a> of their services that grants you $300 in free credits if you are a new user.</p>

<p>After you sign up, install <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install"><code>gcloud</code> CLI</a>. When you reach the end of the process, the last step is to run <code>gcloud init</code> and set up authorization for the tool. Also install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke">Kubectl authentication plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Create the cluster for the Spinnaker deployment with the following line:</p>
   <code>gcloud container clusters create spinnaker-cluster \
--zone southamerica-east1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade
</code>   
<p>Then fetch the cluster credentials with:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials spinnaker-cluster --zone southamerica-east1-a
</code>   

<p><code>get-credentials</code> will update a <code>kubeconfig</code> file with appropriate credentials and endpoint information to point <code>kubectl</code> at a specific cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine.</p>

<p>Create a namespace for the Spinnaker cluster:</p>

   <code>kubectl create namespace spinnaker
</code>   

<p>The Spinnaker <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2/#optional-create-a-kubernetes-service-account">documentation</a> recommends creating a Kubernetes service account, using Kubernetes role definitions that restrict the permissions granted to the Spinnaker account. Create a <code>spinnaker</code> folder in the root folder or any other location. Add the file <code>spinnaker-service-account.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: spinnaker-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources:
      [
        'namespaces',
        'configmaps',
        'events',
        'replicationcontrollers',
        'serviceaccounts',
        'pods/log',
      ]
    verbs: ['get', 'list']
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['pods', 'services', 'secrets']
    verbs:

        'create',
        'delete',
        'deletecollection',
        'get',
        'list',
        'patch',
        'update',
        'watch',
      ]
  - apiGroups: ['autoscaling']
    resources: ['horizontalpodautoscalers']
    verbs: ['list', 'get']
  - apiGroups: ['apps']
    resources: ['controllerrevisions']
    verbs: ['list']
  - apiGroups: ['extensions', 'apps']
    resources: ['daemonsets', 'deployments', 'deployments/scale', 'ingresses', 'replicasets', 'statefulsets']
    verbs:
      [
        'create',
        'delete',
        'deletecollection',
        'get',
        'list',
        'patch',
        'update',
        'watch',

<p>Then execute the following commands to create the service account in the current context:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

kubectl apply --context $CONTEXT \
    -f ./spinnaker-service-account.yml

TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret --context $CONTEXT \
   $(kubectl get serviceaccount spinnaker-service-account \

       -n spinnaker \
       -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') \
   -n spinnaker \
   -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)

kubectl config set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-token-user --token $TOKEN

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT --user ${CONTEXT}-token-user
</code>   
<p>Enable the Kubernetes provider in Halyard:</p>

   <code>hal config provider kubernetes enable
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You will see warnings related to missing configuration. Be patient, in the following steps all will be solved.</p>

<p>Add the service account to the Halyard configuration:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

hal config provider kubernetes account add spinnaker-gke-account \
    --context $CONTEXT
</code>   

 Choose the installation environment 

<p>The Distributed installation on Kubernetes deploys each Spinnaker’s microservice separately to a remote cloud, and it is the recommended environment for zero-downtime updates of Spinnaker.</p>

<p>Select the distributed deployment with:</p>

   <code>hal config deploy edit --type distributed --account-name spinnaker-gke-account
</code>   

 Choose a storage service 

<p>Spinnaker requires an external storage provider for persisting application settings and configured pipelines. To avoid losing this data, using a hosted storage solution is recommended. For this example, we use Google Cloud Storage. Hosting the data externally allows us to delete clusters in between sessions, and keep the pipelines once the clusters have been recreated.</p>

<p>In the <code>spinnaker</code> folder, run the following code:</p>

   <code>SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=spinnaker-gcs-account
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST=~/.gcp/gcs-account.json

gcloud iam service-accounts create \
    $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --display-name $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME

SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
    --filter="displayName:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
    --format='value(email)')

PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
    --role roles/storage.admin --member serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL

mkdir -p $(dirname $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST)

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST \
    --iam-account $SA_EMAIL

BUCKET_LOCATION=us

hal config storage gcs edit --project $PROJECT \
    --bucket-location $BUCKET_LOCATION \
    --json-path $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST

hal config storage edit --type gcs    
</code>   

<p>The last <code>hal</code> commands edit the storage settings and set the storage source to GCS.</p>

 Deploy Spinnaker 

<p>You can verify the deployment configuration with:</p>

   <code>hal config deploy
</code>   

<p>And the storage configuration with:</p>
   <code>hal config storage
</code>   

<p>List the available Spinnaker versions:</p>

   <code>hal version list
</code>   

<p>Set the version for the deployment with:</p>

   <code>hal config version edit --version 1.27.0
</code>   

<p>Deploy Spinnaker to GKE:</p>

   <code>hal deploy apply
</code>   

<p>Even if <code>hal deploy apply</code> returns successfully, the installation may not be complete yet. Check if the pods are ready with <code>k9s</code>:</p>

   <code>k9s -n spinnaker
</code>   

<p>A healthy Spinnaker deployment will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can connect to the Spinnaker UI using the following command:</p>

   <code>hal deploy connect
</code>   
<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:9000</code> and the UI should load. The Projects tab should look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up CD for a JHipster microservices architecture 

<p>Spinnaker is multi-cloud because it can manage delivery to multiple cloud providers. Some companies use different platforms for production and test environments. In this example, the same cloud provider (GKE) was chosen both for Spinnaker deployment and for the application test deployment.</p>

 Use GKE for Kubernetes deployment 

<p>Now I’ll show you how to add a new Kubernetes account for a different cluster, which will be used for application deployment.</p>

<p>Create a cluster for the JHipster microservices architecture:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters create jhipster-cluster \
--zone southamerica-east1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade
</code>   

<p>Fetch the cluster credentials:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials jhipster-cluster --zone southamerica-east1-a
</code>   

<p>Create the namespace <code>demo</code> for your microservices:</p>

   <code>kubectl create namespace demo
</code>   

<p>In the <code>spinnaker</code> directory, create the file <code>jhipster-service-account.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: jhipster-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources:

</code>   

<p>Notice there are some differences with the Spinnaker service account. The k8s manifests generated by JHipster include the creation of <code>secrets</code>, <code>configmaps</code>, and <code>persistentvolumeclaims</code>. The management of those Kubernetes resources must be granted to the service account used for deploying the JHipster k8s manifests.</p>

<p>Create the Kubernetes <code>jhipster-service-account</code>:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

kubectl apply --context $CONTEXT \
    -f ./jhipster-service-account.yml
TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret --context $CONTEXT \
   $(kubectl get serviceaccount jhipster-service-account \
       --context $CONTEXT \
       -n demo \
       -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') \
   -n demo \
   -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)

kubectl config set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-token-user --token $TOKEN

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT --user ${CONTEXT}-token-user
</code>   

<p>Add the account to the Halyard configuration:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

hal config provider kubernetes account add jhipster-gke-account \
    --context $CONTEXT
</code>   

 Add a Docker registry account 

<p>As the goal is to trigger the pipeline execution when a new image is pushed to Docker Hub, you need to configure a Docker Registry provider with Halyard.</p>

<p>First, enable the Docker Registry provider:</p>

   <code>hal config provider docker-registry enable
</code>   

<p>The following <code>hal config</code> line will prompt for your password (or access token if you have 2FA enabled). Make sure to replace <code>your-dockerhub-username</code>.</p>

   <code>ADDRESS=index.docker.io
USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username

hal config provider docker-registry account add docker-account \
    --address $ADDRESS \
    --repositories $USERNAME/store $USERNAME/gateway \
    --username $USERNAME \
    --password
</code>   

 Add a GitHub artifact account 

<p>The pipeline will deploy k8s manifests from a GitHub repository, so you must also configure a GitHub artifact account. First, enable the feature:</p>

   <code>hal config artifact github enable
</code>   
<p>Generate an access token on GitHub. Sign in, and in the user menu choose Settings. Then on the left menu choose Developer settings. On the left menu choose Personal access tokens. Click Generate new token and copy the token.</p>

<p>Then add your GitHub username and set the new token when prompted:</p>

   <code>ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_NAME=your-github-username

hal config artifact github account add $ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --token
</code>   

<p>The new GKE, Docker, and GitHub account configurations must be applied to the deployment before starting the pipeline design:</p>

   <code>hal deploy apply
</code>   

 Create the store microservice pipeline 

<p>The pipeline is the central concept in deployment management with Spinnaker. It is compounded by a sequence of actions, named stages. A pipeline can be triggered manually or automatically, and have an execution history. Connect to the Spinnaker UI again to create the first pipeline.</p>

   <code>hal deploy connect
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>https://localhost:9000</code> &gt; Applications. Click Create Application and just set the application name and owner email. The repository type and additional fields are not mandatory and you can leave all blank for this test.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, on the left menu, choose Pipelines and click Configure a new pipeline. Set a name for the pipeline, for example, store-cd.</p>

 Configure the Docker image triggers 

<p>In the pipeline configuration, click Add Trigger. Set the following configuration for the trigger:</p>

 
   Type: Docker Registry 
   Registry Name: docker-account 
   Organization: your-dockerhub-username 
   Image: your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Artifact Constraints: Choose Define new artifact 
 

<p>In the Expected Artifact form, set the following values:</p>

 
   Display Name: store-image 
   Account: docker-registry 
   Docker image: Fully qualified index.docker.io/your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Use prior execution: yes 
   Use default artifact: yes (set the same account and object path as before) 
 

<p>Click Save Artifact.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Spinnaker provides a mechanism to <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/#override-artifacts">override</a> the version of Docker images, Kubernetes ConfigMaps, and Secrets in manifests, injecting new versions when one of these objects exists in the pipeline context. However, Spinnaker documentation does not have a clear example of the trigger configuration for the Docker image to be available in the pipeline context. To make it happen, you must set it as an artifact constraint in the trigger. If the artifact constraint is not defined, the original image version in the manifests will be deployed, instead of the new image that triggered the pipeline. If no version is in the manifests, <code>latest</code> will be the default.</p>

<p>Add a second Docker registry trigger for the gateway image pushes and click Save Changes.</p>

 Configure the deployment stages 

<p>The store pipeline will execute the following stages:</p>

 
   Deploy the application ConfigMap 
   Deploy the JHipster Registry 
   Deploy the gateway database PostgreSQL 
   Deploy the store clustered database MongoDB 
   Deploy the gateway microservice 
   Deploy the store microservice 
   Enable the gateway service 
   Enable the store service 
 

<p>The Kubernetes configuration created in the folder <code>jhipster-ci-cd/kubernetes</code> must be pushed to a GitHub repository, so Spinnaker can access it using the GitHub artifact account created earlier. But before you push, edit <code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code> and set the image name with the fully qualified address:</p>

   <code>- name: store-app
  image: index.docker.io/indiepopart/store
</code>   
<p>Do the same for <code>kubernetes/gateway-k8s/gateway-deployment.yml</code>. This is also required for the artifact substitution to work.</p>

<p>Sign in to GitHub and create a public repository <code>jhipster-k8s</code>. Follow the instructions to push the existing <code>kubernetes</code> folder from your local using the command line.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: At this point, you will be pushing plain secrets contained in the application and Kubernetes configuration. To avoid this insecure anti-pattern, you can run the JHipster registry locally to encrypt application configuration, and also set up <code>kubeseal</code> for Kubernetes secrets encryption. The process is described in a previous post: <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

<p>Go back to Spinnaker UI, and in the pipeline configuration choose Add Stage and set the following values:</p>

 
   Type: Deploy (Manifest) 
   Stage Name: deploy application-configmap 
   Account: jhipster-gke-account 
   Override Namespace: yes 
   Namespace: demo 
   Manifest Source: Artifact 
   Manifest Artifact: Define a new artifact 
 

<p>In the artifact fields, set the following values:</p>

 
   Account: your-github-username 
   Content URL: https://api.github.com/repos/your-github-username/jhipster-k8s/contents/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml 
   Commit/Branch: main 
 

<p>Click Save Changes.
 Repeat the process for adding stages to deploy <code>jhipster-registry.yml</code>, which must depend on the previous manifest. Also repeat for <code>gateway-postgresql.yml</code>, <code>store-mongodb.yml</code> manifests, which both should depend on the <code>jhipster-registry</code> stage. Make sure to set the correct Content URL for the GitHub artifact. It must have the form <code>https://api.github.com/repos/&lt;your-github-username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;/contents/&lt;path&gt;</code>. If you open the URL in a browser, it should render a JSON response.</p>

<p>Add a stage for the <code>store-deployment.yml</code> manifest, it must depend on the <code>store-mongodb</code> stage. For this manifest, you must bind the Docker image from the context. In the deploy manifest configuration, in Required Artifacts to Bind, choose store-image. The option must be available, as the image was set as an artifact constraint in the trigger configuration, making the artifact available in the pipeline context.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Also add a stage for the <code>gateway-deployment.yml</code>, binding the <code>gateway</code> Docker image. It must depend on the <code>gateway-postgresql</code> stage.</p>

<p>Finally, add a stage for <code>store-service.yml</code>, which must depend on the <code>store-deployment</code> stage, and a stage for <code>gateway-service.yml</code>, which must depend on the <code>gateway-postgresql</code> stage. Notice that Docker images have to be bound only for the manifests that contain a reference to the image.
The complete pipeline must look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Test the pipeline manually once. Go to Pipelines and select Start Manual Execution for the store-cd pipeline. Set the following options:</p>

 
   Trigger: leave docker-account: your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Type: Tag 
   Tag: latest 
 

<p>Successful execution will show all stages in a green state:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Get the external IP of the gateway:</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc gateway -n demo
</code>   

<p>Update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the gateway address as a valid redirect. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, edit, and add:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080</code> 
 

<p>Navigate to <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080</code> and sign in to the application with your Okta credentials. Then try creating a <code>Product</code>:</p>

<p></p>

 Trigger the CI/CD pipeline with a GitHub push 

<p>For testing the workflow, make a code change in the gateway. Edit <code>src/main/webapp/content/scss/_bootstrap-variables.scss</code> and update the following variable:</p>

   <code>$body-bg: steelblue;
</code>   
<p>Also, the pipeline under test will only trigger if a new image tag is detected. So edit <code>.circleci/confg.yml</code> and update the image name:</p>

   <code>IMAGE_NAME: indiepopart/gateway:v1
</code>   

<p>Commit and push the change to the <code>main</code> branch, and watch the CircleCI CI pipeline triggers. After the new gateway image is pushed to Docker Hub, watch the Spinnaker CD pipeline trigger and deploy the updated gateway. On the left menu choose Clusters, and verify the active gateway deployment now has a V002. If you click over the V002 box, you can also verify the image tag that was deployed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can delete clusters in between sessions to save costs with the following <code>gcloud</code> commands:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters delete &lt;cluster-name&gt; \
  --zone &lt;cluster-zone&gt;
</code>   

<p>The cloud storage used by Spinnaker for pipeline persistence generates some costs, you can also delete it with the CLI or using the web console.</p>

 Inspect Spinnaker logs 

<p>For pipeline and trigger debugging, the Spinnaker services <code>spin-echo</code> and <code>spin-igor</code> inform Docker monitoring events and indicate the reasons why an execution was skipped.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n spinnaker
kubectl logs spin-igor-7c8bdd94f5-lx5dl -n spinnaker | grep v1
</code>   

   <code>Found 1 new images for docker-account. Images: [{imageId=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1, sendEvent=true}]
New tagged image: account=docker-account, image=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1. Digest is now [null].
Sending tagged image info to echo: account=docker-account: image=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1
</code>   

 Spinnaker features and best practices 

<p>When implementing continuous delivery, here are some best practices and key features to be aware of:</p>

 
   Deploy Docker images by digest: Spinnaker documentation recommends deploying images by digest instead of tag, because the tag might reference different content each time. The digest is a content-based hash of the image and it uniquely identifies it. Spinnaker’s artifact substitution allows deploying the same manifest, with the image digest supplied by the pipeline trigger. Using the proposed trigger and a free Docker Hub account as the registry, the digest data seems not to be available. It is also recommended to trigger a CD pipeline off of a push to a Docker registry instead of a GitHub push or Jenkins job, allowing development teams to choose their delivery process without more constraints. 
   Rollbacks: Just as there is a stage for deploying manifests, there are also stages for deleting, scaling, and rolling back manifests. Spinnaker also supports automated rollbacks, as it exposes the Undo Rollout functionality as a stage, which can be configured to run when other stages fail, and to roll back by a number of revisions of the deployed object. ConfigMaps and Secrets must be versioned for the automated rollback to actually roll back code or configuration. 
   Manual judgments: The pipeline can include a manual judgment stage, that will make the execution interrupt, asking for user input to continue or cancel. This can be used to ask for confirmation before promoting a staging deployment to production. 
   Pipeline management: Spinnaker represents pipelines as JSON behind the scenes, and maintains a revision history of the changes made to the pipeline. It also supports pipeline templates, that can be managed through the <code>spin CLI</code>, and help with pipeline sharing and distribution. 
   Canary: You can automate Canary analysis by creating canary stages for your pipeline. Canary must be enabled in the Spinnaker installation using <code>hal</code> commands. The Canary analysis consists of the evaluation of metrics chosen during configuration, comparing a partial rollout with the current deployment. The stage will fail based on the deviation criteria configured for the metric. 
   Secrets management: Spinnaker does not directly support secrets management. Secrets should be encrypted at rest and in transit. Credentials encryption for application secrets and Kubernetes secrets was covered in a recent post: <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. 
   Rollout strategies: The Spinnaker Kubernetes provider supports running dark, highlander, and red/black rollouts. In the Deploy Manifest stage, there is a strategy option that allows associating workload to a service, sending traffic to it, and choosing how to handle any previous versions of the workload in the same cluster and namespace.

<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re excited to introduce Stefanie van Dyk, People Operations Manager at GlobaliD. Stefanie has been working in customer success and people operations roles for about ten years. She earned an undergraduate degree in sociology from San Jose State University.</p><p>Now, Stefanie is helping build our culture and team here at GlobaliD. During our conversation, Stefanie discussed her role leading the People Operations team, the challenges of operating during a global pandemic, and how she’ll further establish company values that motivate our team members to be the best versions of themselves.</p> Meet Stefanie <p>I’m Stefanie and I’m the People Operations Manager at GlobaliD. I’m in charge of everything that’s HR related from onboarding and recruiting to establishing security protocols and updating company policies. I originally joined the team as an Operations Manager before being promoted to my current position earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>My main focus right now is trying to grow and enhance the company culture here at GlobaliD, which can be tricky since we’re a fully remote company with employees located all around the&nbsp;globe.</p> What attracted her to&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>Previously, I was working in the legal cannabis industry for about two and a half years. I was thrown into that world and had a very eye opening experience where I was able to learn a lot, but I felt I needed to do something that was a little more&nbsp;stable.</p><p>I enjoy the startup space and I had a connection to Margaret Slemmer, who is a partner at Hard Yaka and an initial investor in GlobaliD. Our conversation about the business made me interested because I thought it would be a fun opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company and see how it&nbsp;grows.</p><p>As I learned more about the identity industry and how we can potentially solve so many problems throughout the world I became even more intrigued. Now, I’ve been here a little over a year and a half and I’ve really enjoyed my time at the company so&nbsp;far.</p> On the People Operations team <p>The People Operations team touches everything across the organization including recruiting, onboarding, culture, performance reviews, compliance, etc. We’re responsible for making sure new employees are properly introduced to their team and set up with all of the necessary equipment or software they need. We also assist with insurance questions, 401ks, equity/options and any other benefits employees want to&nbsp;access.</p> Establishing culture and company&nbsp;values <p>We’re really focused on establishing a great company culture. We’re taking strides to ensure that everybody feels they’re part of a team and playing a part in building something really great. We want our team members to feel excited when they begin work every day, and part of that is providing fun and interesting things for them to do outside of their day-to-day roles. Since we’re a fully remote company it’s even more important that we find ways to gather employee feedback, and then we try to implement those things as soon as possible.</p><p>We’re also working on establishing clear and concise company values. We’re asking employees to think about what we believe in and what we want to live and breathe as an organization. At the end of the day, it’s really important that everybody is on the same page about what we’re actually trying to accomplish.</p> The challenges of operating during a&nbsp;pandemic <p>We prioritize mental health and wellness, and I believe this was especially important during the pandemic when we are all working remotely. When you’re not spending time with people in person it can be harder to identify if they’re going through something they may need help&nbsp;with.</p><p>As part of these efforts, we’re creating a wellness program to combat inactivity and remind people to take a break from their computers. Many people have said they don’t know when to “turn it off” so we’re exploring different platforms that challenge people to get outside for 30 minutes, stretch or just a simple reminder to drink some water. We wake up and go into auto-pilot when we start our day, so six hours can go by and you realize you haven’t had lunch yet. The goal is to create a fun way to remind people to move away from their desks and ​​find a way to have the “water cooler chat” in a remote world and across time&nbsp;zones.</p> On the importance of sharing successes <p>Celebrating each other more often, including some of the small wins is important because it shows how we’re making progress.</p><p>We started a new program where Kevin, our CEO, has started accepting nominations for employees who have gone above and beyond in their role and made a positive impact on the organization. Nominees will be recognized during our bi-weekly team meetings in order to excite and encourage each other to keep working hard. He’s also going to begin sending emails to the entire company to announce big wins — when we gain a new client, secure more funding, release new product updates, etc. We want to be very open and vocal about our success with all of our employees.</p> On her background and career before joining&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>I graduated college with a degree in sociology because I’ve always enjoyed people. After college, I moved to San Francisco and accepted a sales position with a startup company that was a marketing sales enablement platform. It was a small team that included myself and only three other colleagues, but we were very close and one of them is still a mentor to me to this&nbsp;day.</p><p>Eventually, I moved into a customer success role and ended up working in that position for about five years. I liked working with customers, understanding their pain points and developing solutions to try and solve their problems.</p><p>Then I was recruited by a former colleague to work in the cannabis industry. He asked me to be an account manager at a company called Eaze, a cannabis delivery company. My job was to manage all of the company’s partners in Northern California. However, because the industry is so highly regulated and nobody had tried building a cannabis delivery service at the time, there was a lot of uncertainty. Then I got pregnant with my daughter and I decided it was time to find a more stable opportunity.</p> Standout moments or experiences she’s had so&nbsp;far <p>When I first joined the company I met up with a handful of folks from the operations team who lived in the San Francisco Bay area. We took a day off and had a wine tasting adventure. It was a great way to meet some of my new colleagues and learn about the business directly from them. They shared a lot of fun stories and memories about the business and talked about how they’ve already seen the organization come so far from where it started. It really got me even more excited to work at GlobaliD and I started to think about all the possibilities for growth that we&nbsp;had.</p> Her hobbies and interests <p>I’m a big outdoors person and a huge animal lover. I just got back from a camping trip and I’m going to hike half dome for the third time this month, which I’m excited about because it’s a challenging but amazing experience. I enjoy traveling and exploring which is something you can do more of when you’re living the remote work life. It’s a great opportunity to get out there and discover things you couldn’t with a traditional office&nbsp;job.</p><p>After getting married in Mexico earlier this year, I decided that I want to start taking Spanish lessons again soon. I understand Spanish relatively well but would like to be able to have a conversation in another language.</p> What she’s looking forward&nbsp;to <p>I’m very excited about new meetings we’re going to start having called Lunch and Learn’s. They will be quick and simple half-hour meetings where a team member will share information about something they’re working on, or provide more details on their role and day-to-day work life. We’ll encourage everybody to relax, grab a bite to eat and learn more about each other. The meetings will be a great way to gain more insight into what everybody does and create some transparency into each other’s worlds outside of the bi-weekly meetings.</p><p>Another thing we aim to implement later this year is a management training solution. We want to empower our teams and leaders with tools to have effective one-on-one meetings, promote team growth, create a rich feedback culture and more. We want GlobaliD to be a place that encourages everyone to challenge themselves and others and a place where everyone is excited about the opportunity and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, sign up for the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter.</a> You’ll get monthly updates on digital identity, company news and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Also, ICYMI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-meaghan-decorpo-191c9d6ba00b">Meet the Team- Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care&nbsp;Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Erik Westra, Head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-stefanie-van-dyk-3af2016568e1">Meet the Team: Stefanie van Dyk</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>“Multi-cloud” is a tricky term. At its face value, it simply means that your organization is using cloud services from more than one provider, right? But if it’s that trivial, why are so many people talking about “multi-cloud strategies” and why do entire market segments exist only to make managing your multi-cloud deployments slightly less unbearable?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/">Flexera</a>, over 90% of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, and on average, a business is using the services of 2.6 public cloud providers. But of course, the number alone is not what matters. For example, here at KuppingerCole Analysts, our developers actively consume various cloud infrastructure and services from all the top cloud providers and several smaller ones as well. A more interesting question is why multi-cloud has become such an important strategic driver for so many organizations.</p>
 What is Multi-Cloud Anyway? 
<p>Back when the competition in the public cloud market was just getting started, the selection of services offered by CSPs was quite narrow and focused mainly on infrastructure, such as virtual machines or storage. Choosing a specific cloud was primarily a matter of cost and availability, and there were few reasons to use multiple clouds other than redundancy. In the later years, however, most cloud providers have realized that competing with the market leader on its own terms is not a feasible strategy, and offering unique services that nobody else has is how you attract new customers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even though everyone agrees that cloud infrastructure has become a commodity, we do know that major cloud service providers are definitely not interchangeable. On the contrary, every cloud has its own set of unique services, which everyone would love to use, even if it means the additional effort of going properly multi-cloud.</p>
<p>Sure, AWS perhaps still has the most varieties of hardware, but Google Cloud might appeal to developers with its powerful app modernization capabilities, while Microsoft Azure has great analytics tools, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers very popular database services. Your choices might vary, of course, but the point still stands — if you are designing a perfect cloud-native application, you would want to combine building blocks from different service providers.</p>
<p>However, even though in theory this has been possible for years, in many aspects, “proper multi-cloud” development is still in its infancy. There are so many challenges developers must solve to make it possible, and even after that, compromises must be made as well.</p>
 The Infantile Disorders of Modern Multi-Cloud 
<p>The most obvious problem is interoperability (or rather the lack thereof). Every cloud comes with its own technology stack — products, data structures, APIs, security, and even identity and access models. This means that to develop a multi-cloud application, you have to learn almost (but not quite) the same things many times over and then make sure they remain compatible with each other as clouds upgrade their services.</p>
<p>Another major challenge is cross-cloud connectivity. Even though it is usually expected that within a single cloud’s infrastructure the traffic is fast and secure, letting your data flow to a different cloud goes against the provider’s business interest. This is why in most multi-cloud deployments, organizations must deal not just with large data egress fees, but with high latencies and the necessity of moving sensitive data over the less than secure public internet.</p>
<p>You should not forget the operational effort, either. Each cloud has not just its own administrative UI, but a whole set of processes, tools, and workflows associated with it. This means that an organization essentially has to hire a separate team to operate each cloud and then somehow ensure that they can work together in a meaningful way. With the growing shortage of skilled IT professionals, you’re looking at the prospect of additional investments not just into your employees, but into third-party tools and services to enable efficient cross-team collaboration. Of course, you can always outsource the project to one of the well-known global consulting firms, but that also requires additional investments.</p>
<p>With limited visibility and disjointed security across different clouds, multi-cloud deployments might lead to misconfigurations, compatibility issues, increased attack surface, and in the end, serious compliance violations and even data breaches. We have extensively covered the risks of migrating sensitive data and business-critical workloads to the cloud <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">in our research</a>, but for multi-cloud deployments, these risks are multiplied, and the native security controls built into every cloud cannot help deal with them efficiently.</p>
 Multi-Cloud 2.0 – What Should We Look For 
<p>The most trivial way to avoid all these problems is by avoiding multi-cloud completely. For example, you can absolutely run SAP on AWS or Oracle on Azure. But this approach is not ideal because it won’t be a fully managed service.</p>
<p>Another very common way to deal with the lack of interoperability is to introduce an additional layer of abstraction, the multi-cloud lowest common denominator, if you will. The most successful example of this is the Kubernetes platform for orchestrating containerized applications. And while Kubernetes is perhaps one of the best things that has happened to the cloud lately, it has its limitations. Containerization does make your application cloud-agnostic to a large extent, but it cannot magically address connectivity and data egress issues.</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve all these issues and finally allow “multi-cloud” to fulfill its original promise? Well, first, this relies heavily on the cloud providers’ willingness to cooperate instead of competing. If you want your data to flow freely between clouds, their operators must agree to establish fast, low-latency interconnects between their data centers first. And, of course, to stop hoarding customers’ data using exorbitant egress charges. Without this necessary step, the rest is just fantasy…</p>
<p>Still, wouldn’t it be great if we could just mix and match native cloud services from different providers and design our applications from these building blocks without the need to resort to some additional layer of compatibility? Or even better, to make native cloud services aware of other clouds and their data models, identities, compliance controls, etc.? Or, if I may dare to dream big, even manage all those services from the same administrative console and enjoy consolidated support or even billing across clouds?</p>
 Oracle and Microsoft Announce New Multi-Cloud Capabilities 
<p>Well, we might not be quite there yet, but Oracle and Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-service-for-microsoft-azure-2022-07-20/">made a big first step</a> toward this multi-cloud future. In fact, the companies have been collaborating on multi-cloud deployments for years already: for example, fast private interconnects between Azure and OCI were launched in 2019 and are now available in 11 regions around the world. With 1.5 ms latency and no ingress/egress charges between the two clouds, customers can achieve the performance and flexibility of their multi-cloud deployments that is comparable to “single cloud” architectures.</p>
<p>But now the companies have gone even further and announced the first fully integrated multi-cloud service: the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-for-azure/">Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure</a>. Now it is possible to run an Oracle Database in the OCI cloud but utilize it directly from any application running on Azure without any connectivity issues. Oracle databases running in OCI now have a completely native look and feel for Azure customers. They can be provisioned and managed directly from Azure or using Azure native APIs. They are fully aware of Azure identities and integrated into Azure networking and monitoring. And at the same time, they offer the full range of Oracle Autonomous Database and Exadata platform capabilities that were previously only available to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, but not on Azure.</p>
<p>The only step customers have to perform is to link their Azure and OCI accounts—the rest is fully transparent. A growing number of Azure’s native services (Power BI, Cognitive Services, Kubernetes, etc.) are already fully aware of and compatible with the new database service. This makes it much easier to develop true cross-cloud applications. Database observability data is also constantly fed into Azure, providing customers with visibility into their infrastructure across the two clouds. Finally, both companies offer a consolidated support model, where you only need to create a single ticket to resolve any issue related to the new services.</p>
<p>This is, of course, just the beginning. Additional Oracle services will be added later and &nbsp;more Azure services will be made “multi-cloud-aware”. Another thing I’d love to see implemented is the integration with Azure security analytics services… But the Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure is definitely a big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>When I heard the announcement, my first thought was that people will inevitably refer to the new service as “multi-cloud 2.0”, just as they did with Kubernetes years ago. However, it would be fair to say that this is actually how people have expected multi-cloud to work from the very beginning. So, if you will, multi-cloud is finally out of beta and ready to unlock its full potential.</p>

<p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology.</p><p>Web3 is a space with tremendous nuance. The revolution that was spawned by DeFi to advance financial sovereignty has taken on a much bigger meaning. People want to make an impact in ways that are meaningful to them, and they want to do so with value aligned individuals.</p><p>DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), for over a year now, have proven they are a good mechanism for bringing people together along shared values and purpose. People with a shared mission have organized around those beliefs, powered by a variety of tools and methodologies to solve complex challenges together.</p><p>Most DAOs can be categorized in the following groups: Service, Protocol, Investment, Grants, Collector, Social, and Media DAOs. As DAOs continue to grow and mature, so do the categories that wish to organize them in neat little&nbsp;boxes.</p><p>DAO tools have also evolved from where they were only a year ago. Interacting with a DAO has become more complex; going from simple web3 wallets and social platforms to include multisigs, operating systems, p2p compensation, voting platforms, and more recently task and bounty management tools. Standout tools like Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, CollabLand, and Coordinape are leading the DAO tooling revolution.</p><p>It doesn’t seem as if DAOs can be stopped. Quite the opposite actually. The demand for new, novel DAOs is accelerating. Projects like ConstitutionDAO have sparked the imagination of many would-be DAO founders, and accelerated ideas by people who share the same enthusiasm, commitment, and desire to make an impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>As the types of DAOs and tooling evolves, so too does the demand from communities that comprise DAOs to create more robust mechanisms to manage and support the project and their contributors.</p><p>A few areas in which DAOs are hoping to improve is onboarding, incentives, and governance</p><p>Member onboarding has for some time been a product of tokens, which DAOs use to govern, and incentivize members. Many DAOs also use tokens to gate communities. To distribute these tokens, DAOs usually perform airdrops to users of their platforms and value-aligned projects and protocols, thus aiming to onboard these individuals to their DAO to participate in community building and governance. A practice that is not perfect but has worked for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>Recently, there has been an evolution in the way airdrops are used to onboard DAO members. More comprehensive “checklists” are used to quantify an airdrop recipient’s interaction with a project or protocol. Additional steps are sometimes taken to introduce them to the governance process of the project and begin participating in it prior to accepting the airdrop. The goal is to find individuals who will more likely align to the DAOs mission and become active, valuable contributors.</p><p>Once onboarded, a DAO must find ways of retaining high-impact contributors. Whether through grants, bounties, or role-based pay, DAOs incentivize contributors to create value and grow the ecosystem. This process usually allows for anyone that is interested in participating in the DAO to do so without too much effort. Generally, this is a process that works well for accelerating contributions from early contributors. However, as a DAO matures, the incentives are often misaligned to veteran contributors who have generated tremendous value to the ecosystem. Longtime members can find themselves competing with new members for bounties and roles that value their contributions as the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Governance in DAOs oftentimes, if not always, is performed through token holdings. The more tokens you own, the larger your voice in a DAO. This process tends to work well in the early days where everyone should have similar footing in a DAO. However, as individuals contribute to a DAO, the value they generate may differ from others. This is especially true with regard to large token holders that may join later and who don’t frequently contribute, or at all. The voices of those avid, frequent contributors who may be more in tune with the needs of the DAO may be drowned out by those with token wealth. This can skew outcomes in favor of those who may be interested in shaping a DAO in ways that are misaligned to the values of the DAO and those who are building&nbsp;it.</p><p>What is next for&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>The future is bright for DAOs. Recently, much attention has been brought to self-sovereign identity and reputation as it relates to decentralized communities through articles, blogs and papers written by highly-influential personas. This has spawned a new wave of development using Decentralized Identifiers (DID), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and non-transferable NFTs&nbsp;(SBT).</p><p>Projects are experimenting with these novel technologies to identify their use case in DAOs. The promise is that one, or all, of these can unlock an individual’s reputation and create more dynamic and fair onboarding, incentives, and governance practices.</p><p>This clearly marks the beginning of something new and exciting in DAOs, and web3 in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Personally, I am excited for the opportunity to explore and build in this emergent space that continues to evolve before our very own&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more.

<p></p>
<p>The theme behind our product work in the first half of 2022 has been around Interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a company, Northern Block believes in enabling digital identity data for any entity to be exchanged and verified using any platform of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence we have committed ourselves to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>It’s very important to us that we continue aligning our product suite against the many existing and emerging technical standards.</p>
<p>As we build in new features in NB Orbit, we want to continue sharing these updates with the community.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2021, we demonstrated AIP 1.0 Compliance of our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet</a> against the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>). Our work since then has been to move the needle towards AIP 2.0 Compliance for both our Mobile Wallet and <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Enterprise SSI Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Since our <a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-platform-release-notes-q4-2021/">last product release notes were from Q4 2021</a>, we’re overdue in providing you all with an update.</p>
<p>So here it goes..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; Added Support for Connectionless Exchanges 
<p>We’ve enhanced the types of verifications that are possible by adding support for Connectionless Exchanges.</p>
<p>For those interested, we wrote about how we look at connection-based vs connectionless interactions in a recent blog post titled “<a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">Why credential issuance should be holder-driven</a>”.</p>
<p>One of the areas in which we demonstrated connectionless exchanges is through the way passwordless authentications are done to gain access to Orbit Enterprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users of Orbit Enterprise are people that are acting on behalf of an organization. They will manage connections, credential schemas and various functions relating to the issuance and verification of credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To act on behalf of an organization, people must have previously established a relationship with the organization, and have had the organization provision them with certain access rights through credential offers.</p>
<p>This means that the person has credentials in their Edge Wallet (or any other AIP compliant wallet) that they must present to Orbit Enterprise to access their organization’s control panel.</p>
<p>Even though the Orbit Enterprise platform verifies the passwordless access credential, we didn’t want to force a connection between NB Orbit platform and mobile holder – hence a connectionless verification is performed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our previous architecture, we would force a connection between the individual and the platform (NB Orbit) so that the connection-based proof request could happen. We have now changed this process and dropped the forced connection to avoid any federation.</p>
<p>This means that a connection to NB Orbit isn’t necessary for the proof presentation to be verified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2&nbsp; Upgraded Mobile Agent to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) 
<p>We upgraded our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet agent to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).</p>
<p>We did this to ensure we move towards AIP 2.0 compliance with our mobile agent.</p>
<p>AIP currently has two versions:</p>
 
 AIP 1.0, defines how Aries agents communicate with each other using a single type of verifiable credential, and 
 AIP 2.0, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials. 
 
<p>We recently wrote a blog post about <a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">the main reasons for which we chose AFJ and what excites us about AIP 2.0</a>.<br>
</p>
 3&nbsp; Upgraded Enterprise Cloud Agent to ACA-Py 0.7.4&nbsp; 
<p>We upgraded our Orbit Enterprise cloud agent to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases">ACA-Py 0.7.4</a>.</p>
<p>We always want to ensure we’re providing the latest agent versions to our customers. This move also gets us to AIP 2.0 compliance on the cloud agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4&nbsp; Added Multi-ledger Support on Enterprise 
<p></p>
<p>We already had existing support for multiple Indy-based ledgers on our Orbit Edge mobile wallet – and we’ve now introduced the same for Orbit Enterprise.</p>
<p>Our enterprise customers can now become credential issuers, holders and verifiers on networks such as NB Orbit TestNet, Sovrin, BCovrin and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5&nbsp; Interoperate with Other SSI Platforms&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>To make our platform as open as possible to interoperate with other SSI platforms, partner organizations (cloud agent and wallets) are free to choose the SSI platform of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schema and credential definitions created by partner organizations in other SSI platforms are available on the NB Orbit enterprise App to create credential definitions and generate proof requests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the added support for multiple ledgers and the enhancements in our B2B invitation process (mentioned in section 7), our customers can have their platform sit independent of any ledger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 6&nbsp; Orbit Enterprise Customization Enhancements 
<p>We have done a lot of upgrades when it comes to the internationalization and localization architecture of our Orbit Enterprise to allow for easier branding and language customization.</p>
<p>For our customers who create new networks and/or wish to onboard subsidiaries or partners on their network, they can now easily brand Orbit Enterprise with their colour schemes, style guides, logos, language, etc.</p>
<p>This is useful for our customers who want their partners to experience their branding rather than NB Orbit branding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 7&nbsp; General Wallet &amp; Platform Upgrades&nbsp; 
<p>There are a few general upgrades that are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>Credential and Connection Management in Orbit Edge Wallet – users can now delete connections and credentials.</p>
<p>Accessibility Support – we’ve added accessibility support in the Orbit Edge Wallet. This is important to ensure our wallet has equal access and participation for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Support for Multiple Organization Administrators – organizations can now add more than one administrator to govern their cloud infrastructure and cloud wallet.</p>
<p>Improve B2B Connection Invitation – with the improved support partner organization (cloud wallets) onboarded in NB Orbit can connect with partner organization (cloud wallets) whether they were onboarded in NB Orbit SSI platform or other SSI platform.</p>
<p>Toolkit / Guides Support – we added a tooltip feature within Orbit Enterprise to make it simpler for non-technical users to navigate the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 8&nbsp; Operational Upgrades&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve worked on enhancing our operations so that we can now scale our customers’ infrastructure as they scale the use of credentials within their ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>I hope this summary was helpful for everyone who’s reading.</p>

<p>Remote onboarding is becoming the new normal, and if your company doesn’t adapt to the new work environment, your company will be left behind.</p>
<p>What is remote onboarding? Remote onboarding is the process of assimilating a new employee into the company and teaching them corporate policies but doing so over technology, whether that be video, phone, or chat.</p>
 Remote Onboarding and Modern Workforces 
<p>A remote workforce is a norm in many industries and job markets rather than the exception. More people work from home than ever before. Many enterprises are learning that supporting a remote workforce, once the right technical infrastructure is in place, can be cost-effective and responsive to modern challenges.</p>
<p>The challenges that arise from such a workforce, however, come in a few critical areas:</p>
 
 Paperwork: Employers must obtain specific employee documentation, including tax forms, waivers, and identification documents. In person, this isn’t a problem, but remote document exchange and verification can prove difficult in many cases. 
 Training: Employees often undergo on-site training with a mentor they shadow throughout the day. With a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/remote-workforce/">remote workforce</a>, making sure your people have the right hands-on training can be tricky. 
 Resources: Outside of hiring paperwork, employees should have the resources they need to do their job, such as documents, records, or tools. They should have access to these resources when they start. 
 
<p>By far, remote onboarding ranks as one of the most challenging aspects of modern business. <a href="https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-statistics-you-must-know-in-2022">According to a survey from Sapling HR,</a> employees must complete, on average, 54 onboarding activities.</p>
<p>These tasks involve critical document exchanges and administrative tasks, tasks that count toward areas like tax and compliance reporting, payroll and HR documentation, and just basic training for the job.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these tasks will often pertain to security: creating identities for cloud platforms and HR services, signing up for MFA, and onboarding on to any compliant security measures, like identity proofing or document verification.</p>
<p>With that said, it’s critical for enterprises to make remote onboarding easy and effective so that security and efficiency are maintained at every step.</p>
 Remote Onboarding and Security 
<p>Perhaps the most critical part of the onboarding process is worker identification, verification, and security onboarding.</p>
<p>The details of this fact may change depending on the company or industry, but generally speaking, employers are required to confirm worker eligibility and tax documentation. On top of that, any additional security or compliance requirements will invariably include additional authentication steps.</p>
<p>To support remote onboarding, several technologies can come into play:</p>
 
 Document and Identity Verification: An employer expects to have several documents completed during onboarding, including proof of eligibility to work. This includes several steps of identification and verification—prospects that can prove difficult in remote settings. That’s where automated documents and identity verification come into play. 
 
<p>These technologies can help you ensure that a contractor or full-time employee provides accurate and truthful documentation, whether it’s in the form of a driver’s license, passport, or social security card.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these technologies can help enterprises with specific security needs verify identity through images, video chats, and other verification methods.</p>
<p>Finally, self-serve onboarding helps you scale the process without devoting more work hours and technology to it.</p>
 
 Authentication Onboarding: Remote workers will need to access company resources—which means that authentication is critical. HR or the IT department will onboard employees into a multi-factor authentication system by providing credentials, but it’s up to the employee to set up one-time passwords or biometrics from wherever they are at. 
 Liveness Testing and Identity Proofing: Spear and whale phishing are more and more common, with many cases stemming from poor <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/identity-authentication">identity authentication</a> of contractors. Liveness testing can force users to authenticate alongside video confirmation of their presence, while identity proofing can leverage documents and other artifacts to ensure that whoever accesses system resources is who they say they are. 
 
<p>These technologies all refer to specific challenges related to fraud, misidentification, and noncompliance—all of which can be addressed with the right tools and practices.</p>
 What Are Some Best Practices for Onboarding Remote Employees? 
<p>Even with the right technologies, it’s critical for an enterprise to practice strong, secure onboarding for all remote workers and contractors. These practices complement secure technology to provide an organization easy onboarding and to protect company resources.</p>
<p>Some best practices include the following:</p>
 
 Allow Self-Service Onboarding: Depending on your platform, self-service onboarding may be an option. This can include using mobile devices to perform identity proofing and liveness tests, scanning documents for automatic <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/authentication-identity-verification-system/">identity verification</a>, and streamlining authentication credential setup. 
 
<p>With a streamlined onboarding process, you remove the chances that information is lost during communication or that workers will use substandard practices due to the difficulty of the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as onboarding technologies improve, verification’s effectiveness, security, and accuracy will just make the process easier.</p>
 
 Assign Dedicated Staff to Onboard: If workers are currently in the onboarding process, ensure that you have a dedicated person assigned to help them. This includes answering questions, directing information to the right people, and ensuring that workers always send information where it should go. 
 
<p>This goes beyond orienting the employee. It helps minimize confusion in setting up critical functions like technology and services and avoids problems that IT would otherwise have to dedicate time to deal with.</p>
 
 Create Easy-to-Follow Task Lists and Expectations: A simple and effective onboarding task list could live in your project management tool. Give access to this list to workers and allow them to work on the items as they will, check items they complete, and communicate via comments or direct messages to streamline the process. 
 Create Community: Remote work can be isolating, and onboarding often serves as the primary way that workers get to know their colleagues. Even if you use remote, self-serve onboarding tools, make sure to create open spaces of communication for new workers through remote events and interactive activities. This can help make those workers feel invited and welcome and reduce levels of isolation that can come from the nature of remote employment. 
 
 Streamline Remote Onboarding with 1Kosmos 
<p>At the heart of onboarding is verification and security, which doesn’t change when workers are remote. Employees must be able to set up secure credentials from wherever they are for a host of services, and employers must have the ability to verify the identities and documentation of those workers.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides a distributed, streamlined, and secure platform to support remote <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/employee-onboarding/">employee onboarding</a>. With advanced self-serve features to ease administrative workloads, you can make onboarding easy for both the employee and your organization. Furthermore, with security standards meeting NIST 800-63-3, IAL2, and FIDO2 certifications, you can guarantee the identity of the worker, the authenticity of their documents, and the security and compliance of your system.</p>
<p>1Kosmos includes the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Identity-Based Authentication Orchestration: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK.

 Mattereum’s “Million Dollar&nbsp;Quartet” <p>As the dust of the latest ‘Crypto Winter’ settles and the panic subsides, the question being asked is ‘What next?’ and it seems the answer that is beginning to condense out of the fog is “connecting physical assets to the blockchain!”. This makes a lot of sense, cryptocurrencies and NFTs as they have been used up to now only have a tenuous connection to the physical world and while for a relatively small group of blockchain fundamentalists this is just fine, for the rest of the world it makes them a niche interest, albeit one that has generated an insane amount of headlines.</p><p>Most physical NFT transactions rely on the truthfulness of the information they are using being baked in already, but what happens when someone is slipping counterfeit items into your supply chain, or is selling things they don’t actually&nbsp;have?</p><p>For the blockchain to achieve the ubiquity it has the potential to, it needs to do something for the real world and make the leap to connecting to the physical. We can see it coming, once <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> was pretty much alone in this space, apart from a few companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/BosonProtocol?s=20&amp;t=IIj1vPuIAFAdvvShGVJP6A">Boson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/4KProtocol?s=20&amp;t=G-Ncks7zWZIBslbyeo0xSw">4K,</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SolidBlockCo?s=20&amp;t=Tjai85B4TtuqJDlK4LIC-Q">Solidblock</a> who may have been inspired by Mattereum’s initial White Paper, but now we can see other start-ups such as <a href="https://twitter.com/LabsAspen?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">Aspen Labs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stockx?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">StockX</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanaNFT?s=20&amp;t=IVjPeJEQcKuVpy57sjDOPg">Americana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">Origin Trail</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rollapp_store?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">RollApp</a> catching on and doing things like using the blockchain to bring transparency to supply chain management or providing marketplaces for niche products like collectables. While these are all good ideas, they rely on the truthfulness of the information they are using being baked in already, but what happens when someone is slipping counterfeit items into your supply chain, or is selling things they don’t actually have? It all gets a bit messy and expensive as the lawyers get involved and courts have to work out the <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/04/29/nfts-recognised-as-legal-property-in-landmark-case">legal aspects of the blockchain on the fly</a>. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>, though, nailed down all the legals before ever starting to do anything on the blockchain, so with our Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) that combines <a href="https://mattereum.com/#:~:text=This%20certification%20legally%20binds%20the,protect%20against%20theft%20or%20fraud.">warranties and NFTs</a> to create the Mattereum Trustable NFT, every transaction comes with a simple and effective legal framework for dealing with any disputes that arise, and it is applicable in over 160 jurisdictions, so there doesn’t need to be costly court cases in every single country to establish the case law for items on the blockchain, it’s just plug and&nbsp;play.</p><p>It has to be said that this kind of thing is something that companies now entering the real world NFT space are only promising for a remote future, so when <a href="https://mattereum.com/">we</a> go out there and say ‘we’ve got this — we can do physical assets connected to the blockchain with all the legals in place and working now’ it’s not entirely surprising that some people think it’s a scam, it’s so far ahead of what anyone else can do. We feel a bit like the Wright brothers; when they first flew, no one believed them; for a year after their first flight the only place you could read about it was in a <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/wright-brothers/online/artifactgallery/?id=5747">beekeeping journal </a>because the editor went to Kittyhawk to see them fly with his own eyes, while other journalists dismissed it as impossible out of hand. We have not been featured in beekeeping journals, but we do have the equivalent — clients who have been willing to look at what<a href="https://mattereum.com/explore/"> Mattereum</a> do for themselves and bring their physical objects to the blockchain through the <a href="https://mattereum.com/#:~:text=This%20certification%20legally%20binds%20the,protect%20against%20theft%20or%20fraud.">Mattereum system</a></p><p>We started with things like Star Trek collectables, which are a lot of fun, but now <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> has stepped up to a new level, with its “Million Dollar Quartet”&nbsp;.</p><p>OK, we haven’t got Elvis and Johnny Cash back from the dead (Jim Morrison, though…well, watch this space), but what we do have is serious clients willing to bring physical assets worth a million dollars or more to the table and put them on the blockchain through the Mattereum system, allowing these high value items to to be bought and sold as Trustable NFTs at the click of a button. Our Million Dollar Quartet features:</p>  Real Estate — <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1bOGR7knhhS9dMNxmyjCxZDw1Fo_2fnp5xkgMBi_gBzc/edit">West London Lets</a> have a £1.6million plot of land for sale as a Mattereum Trustable NFT. You know what a pain it is to buy and sell houses and land using the current system, but with <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> all that paperwork can be rolled up and put into a MAP to make the deal a simple blockchain transaction. We are doing this now and expect to do many more real estate deals in the&nbsp;future.  <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/05/26/lohko-and-mattereum-launch-groundbreaking-verifiable-gold-bullion-nfts/">Gold Bars</a> — We have gold bars available as Trustable NFTs with our partners Lohko. These remain vaulted at an internationally renowned gold vault while the ownership can be bought and sold to anyone anywhere in the world via an NFT, with title to the gold legally enforceable. If you really want, you can actually go to the vault and take out your gold bar using your NFT as proof of ownership.  <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220624005079/en/IG-Wines-Partners-With-Tech-Firm-Mattereum-to-Disrupt-Fine-Wine-and-Whisky-Trading-on-the-Blockchain">Fine Wines and Whisky</a> — through our partnership with IG Wines we have investment grade wines and shares in barrels of whisky that are together worth over £1million available. The wines remain in their cellars and the whiskies in their vaults, while the investment in them can be bought and sold as Mattereum Trustable NFTs (unless you want to claim the bottles and drink them!). We hope to bring more wine and whisky companies to the blockchain very&nbsp;shortly.  <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/24/real-world-asset-nft-auction-for-million-dollar-trumpet-goes-live/">Historic instruments</a> — Mattereum have an incredible Stradivarius family violin created by Giuseppe Guarneri, valued at $1.6million available as a Trustable NFT through our <a href="https://matterfine.art/">Matterfine </a>partnership with renowned luthier Robert Brewer Young and have already sold a more modern treasured instrument, DJ<a href="https://mattereum.com/explore/"> Timmy Trumpet’s custom trumpet</a>, valued at $1million. These instruments are vaulted too, although with Mattereum’s system it is possible to have warranties that could require them to be played a certain number of times a year by specific kinds of performer, setting out the exact terms and conditions under which they could be unvaulted for that&nbsp;purpose.  <p>One of the prominent advantages of the Quartet is stability. These aren’t stable in the way that stablecoins were meant to be stable <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/11/cryptocurrencies-pose-financial-risk-ecb-report-defi-stablecoins-contagion/">(until they weren’t</a>), by being pegged to a currency or asset, they are stable in the way that actually owning the gold bar or a bottle of investment-grade wine is stable, because that is what you are doing. Owning a Mattereum Trustable NFT bound to a gold bar means you actually own that gold bar, the value of the NFT is the value of the gold bar, and that is the very definition of stable. Owning one of the Quartet NFTs insulates you from the fluctuations of the Crypto world, because their value is the value of the real world asset they connect you to, but they still give you the convenience of trading them as&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Owning a Mattereum Trustable NFT bound to a gold bar means you actually own that gold bar, the value of the NFT is the value of the gold bar, and that is the very definition of&nbsp;stable.</p><p>This Million Dollar Quartet is just the start; our system is not tied to any specific asset class and can be used to bring literally anything to the blockchain. Things like gold and whisky are scalable — millions and millions of dollars could be added without any real complexity, at the same time it’s also entirely possible to create MAPs for things that need individual attention, like the violin or real estate, we’ve done <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">fine art and jewellery </a>too; the Mattereum system is effective and flexible. It can even be used in concert with other organisation’s real world NFTs to support them with Mattereum’s legal guarantees, making it unnecessary for every company bringing physical assets to the blockchain to have to reinvent all the legals, they can just buy into&nbsp;ours.</p><p>Owning one of the Quartet NFTs insulates you from the fluctuations of the Crypto world, because their value is the value of the real world asset they connect you to, but they still give you the convenience of trading them as&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>While our Million Dollar Quartet of high value items are a great proof of concept, demonstrating that the <a href="https://mattereum.com/#:~:text=This%20certification%20legally%20binds%20the,protect%20against%20theft%20or%20fraud.">Mattereum system</a> is trusted and works, it isn’t just about vaulted items. In the near future we’ll be adding functionality that makes it possible for any item to be permanently connected to the blockchain out in the physical world, opening the door to a mechanism that makes the circular economy a potential reality.</p><p>Picard, if that was the man’s name, was speaking with a broker in New York, arranging the purchase…it was almost certain that Picard would never see the works he was purchasing. If the artist enjoyed sufficient status, the originals were very likely crated away in some vault, where no one saw them at all. Days or years later, Picard might pick up that same phone and order the broker to sell. — William Gibson, Count&nbsp;Zero</p><p>The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed. — William&nbsp;Gibson</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-physical-assets-on-the-blockchain-a-reality-942e965032ce">MAKING PHYSICAL ASSETS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN A REALITY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Dock is now an Associate Member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). The Decentralized Identity Foundation is an engineering-driven organization that represents a diverse, international collection of organizations and contributors working together to establish an open ecosystem of decentralized identity that is accessible to all.</p><p>As a decentralized identity management platform that complies with internationally-recognized technology standards, we are continuously keeping up to date with key discussions and updates in the industry which is why we joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> What Is Decentralized Identity? <p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">Decentralized identity</a> is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider. The term “decentralized identity” is often used interchangeably with “Self-Sovereign Identity” (SSI). </p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity has 3 main pillars: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information. A blockchain is designed in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Globally unique identifiers made up of a string of letters and numbers that are generated and completely owned by the user.  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can show to verifiers to prove claims about themselves.  The 3 pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and decentralized identifiers The Importance of Decentralized Identity Standards <p>DIF is continuously working to get global standards in place for decentralized identity technology so stakeholders can use similar standards for future interoperability. Interoperability is the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or products to connect and communicate in a coordinated way without effort from the user. </p><p>Right now, a big challenge with blockchains and Self-Sovereign Identity technology is that many systems are not interoperable. Having a standard practice of how we build decentralized solutions is extremely beneficial for individuals and organizations because it means that they don’t get locked into limited solutions. They can move in and out of platforms as they please because the technology has been built in the same way. </p><p>For example, let’s say there are two <a href="https://www.dock.io/">decentralized digital credential companies</a> that both offer a platform to create DIDs and issue Verifiable Credentials. If they both follow the same DID and VC standard, a user could conveniently transfer their data from one company to another and everything would just work because both platforms are interoperable. In other words, someone could take their Verifiable Credentials from Company A’s wallet and transfer it to Company B’s wallet. A lot of work needs to be done for the industry to get to this level of interoperability, but that is what organizations like the Decentralized Identity Foundation are working towards. &nbsp;</p><p>To give an example, if someone built an app that integrates a decentralized identity wallet on one blockchain, they couldn’t just take that app and transfer it to another network for the app to work. The major problem is being able to look up DIDs on different platforms. For example, Dock DIDs can’t be resolved in an app that is only supporting did:sov or did:ion. To support interoperability, they would have to implement a Dock DID resolver that must be able to get the DID document from wherever it is stored, which could be on a blockchain, the DID key or some other storage. Basically, the resolver retrieves the public keys. </p><p>Right now, there are also no widely accepted wallet specifications, but people are still working on it. Dock is currently using this <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/">W3C wallet specification</a>. </p><p>To give another example of the importance of interoperability, think about how Wi-Fi and bluetooth work. No matter what country you’re in and regardless of the differences in laws, culture, and government structures, Wi-Fi and bluetooth work everywhere. It’s because the technology is implemented the same way anywhere in the world. </p><p>Bluetooth works using short-range radio waves and will work anywhere you have two compatible devices. You don't need any data plan or even a cellular connection. Wi-Fi revolutionized how data is transferred as it connects devices to send data over the air. </p><p>Similarly, with <a href="https://www.dock.io/technology">decentralized identity technology</a>, as we move towards developing global standards that more stakeholders adopt, the more benefits there will be for people and organizations. Having standards will improve the user experience as people can securely take their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials anywhere with their phone with a digital identity wallet. Interoperability will allow people to move platforms conveniently as they please. </p><p>For organizations, having standards will make it easier to efficiently issue, manage, and verify credentials. Decentralized identity technology can drastically reduce costs and resources compared to traditional, manual verification, management, and issuance processes.</p><p>Dock’s decentralized digital credentials technology complies with World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which provides a standard to express credentials on the web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable. W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. The organization also created standards for Decentralized Identifiers, URL, and others.</p> Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation was founded in 2018 to support the emergence of an ecosystem of technologies around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaYYQLDnS6s&amp;t=51s">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs). DIDs are globally unique identifiers made up of a string of letters and numbers that enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. Unlike user names, passwords, emails, and other centralized identifiers that people use to sign into websites and apps, DIDs allow people to authenticate their identity securely while fully owning and controlling their digital identity. </p><p>Here is an example of a Dock DID:</p>A DID is made up of a string of letters and numbers that allow people to authenticate their identity securely.<p>An individual or organization can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. DIDs are like different personas that people can create. For example, someone may want to use a DID just for online shopping and use another DID for professional purposes like showing their educational credentials like their degree or program certificates.</p>People can create as many DIDs as they want for different purposes like a DID for professional purposes or a DID for online shopping. How the Decentralized Identity Foundation Works <p>DIF is committed to working across the ecosystem with organizations while trying to get companies to work together to develop open source and standards to shape the future of decentralized identity. There are a variety of working groups focused on specific projects such as security or DIDComm, a cross-community effort to standardize common DID-anchored capabilities.</p> Decentralized Identity Foundation Groups <p>The main terminology used to organize DIF are working groups, special interest groups, and open groups. Many groups can be working on a few projects at the same time such as advancing specifications and code. An organization has to be a member of the group in order to contribute to the work item. Members often contribute to DIF groups that relate to research and projects that they are working on as an organization.</p><p>Working groups</p>  Standing long term groups like DID Authentication, Identifiers and Discovery, and Claims and Credentials  Scoped by functional areas and designed to drive emerging standard specifications backed up by open source code  <p>Open groups</p>  Lower barrier for membership entry because people don’t have to waive patents to participate  Non-patent relevant deliverables are produced   Examples of DIF Working Groups   <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Authentication Working Group</a>: Design, recommend, and implement authentication and authorization protocols (a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices) that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols using DIDs and DID Documents. &nbsp;<br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials</a>: Defining the specs, protocols, and tools to help ecosystem participants and their customers easily integrate DID-signed claims into their apps and services. &nbsp;<br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID communication</a>: Produce one or more high-quality specs that embody a method (“DIDComm”) for secure, private and (where applicable) authenticated message-based communication. <br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet security</a>: Define a common terminology for understanding the security requirements applicable to wallet architectures as well as wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-issuer/verifier protocols. This group also works to produce guidelines on how to classify and specify the security capabilities of Verifiable Credential wallets such as key management, credential storage, backup, and the portability of wallets.   Conclusion <p>As an Associate Member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, Dock will continuously be engaged with key developments in the decentralized identity space. The organization has a variety of working groups to solve diverse problems. </p><p>DIF is continuously working to get global standards in place for decentralized identity technology so stakeholders can use similar standards for future interoperability. Interoperability between decentralized identity platforms is very important as it will allow people to conveniently move their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials between platforms and enable companies to grow their network usage if developers have the option to move their applications from one platform to another. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

 A total of almost 2.2 million votes were cast by SHFT token holders on the matter; and 100% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposal. <p>The Shyft DAO Business Development Committee submitted <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth/proposal/0x047ceda5147b5c9203d93e4564d81458bcca88268ad3ef6adefbd139d3d3eca9">a proposal</a> to the Shyft community on August 3, 2022, to grant an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT tokens to crypto exchanges and custodians who integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022, in order to facilitate a period of free transaction processing to meet Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requirements.</p><p>The voting process began on August 4, 2022, and ended on August 9, 2022. A total of almost 2.2 million votes were cast by SHFT token holders on the matter; and 100% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposal. The offer will remain valid until 31 December 2022 or until the VASPs exhaust their SHFT token&nbsp;grant.</p> Where will the grant be put to&nbsp;use? <p>The grant will enable exchanges and custodians (more formally known as Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs) to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope, a Travel Rule Solution that focuses on a frictionless implementation with minimum impact to users, whilst ensuring user data privacy and security is maintained.</p><p>VASPs use Veriscope by posting requests for information, known as attestations, to the Shyft Network in order to automatically discover counterparty VASPs to a crypto transaction. This enables them to comply with the Travel Rule, which mandates that both the originator and beneficiary VASPs must share personally identifiable information (PII) of their users involved in the respective crypto transactions. When posting a request, VASPs pay the Shyft Network a small fee using Shyft’s native token,&nbsp;SHFT.</p><p>The grant will act as a catalyst to accelerate the adoption of the Travel Rule among VASPs on a global basis. This is a significant factor as both the FATF and regulators have raised concern on the slow adoption of the Travel Rule among&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>The automatic discovery process is an underlying Travel Rule infrastructure to solve the current interoperability issues between various Travel Rule Solution Providers. By providing a universal and global way of locating and communicating with VASP counterparties, it is then possible for a VASP to select the appropriate Travel Rule protocol to conduct the PII transfer.</p> What’s in it for Shyft&nbsp;Network? <p>Shyft Network exists to provide an infrastructure that promotes trust on the blockchain. This grant will expedite the resolution of a significant industry issue where non-compliance remains of significant concern and accelerate the ability for VASPs to comply whilst ensuring the data privacy and security of users are not compromised. The network effects should naturally benefit Shyft Network as it proves its usage as a secure and trusted compliance and security infrastructure.</p> About Veriscope <p>Veriscope is a community-led FATF Travel Rule infrastructure and protocol built on top of the Shyft Network. The solution comprises DISCOVER and&nbsp;SHARE.</p><p>DISCOVER allows for secure, frictionless, automated discovery of verified counterparty VASPs with address control proofs. The infrastructure is available to all VASPs and all travel rule solution providers.</p><p>SHARE allows for secure, peer-to-peer sharing of originator and beneficiary information between VASPs. No transfer or storage outside the VASPs. It is optimized for data security, privacy, and operational efficiency.</p><p>Veriscope was built with input from over 30 VASPs, including Binance, Bitmex, Bitfinex, Coinhako, Deribit, Huobi, and Tether, with advisory and governance leadership from Rick McDonell (Former Executive Director of the&nbsp;FATF).</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks. By encouraging individuals and enterprises to collaborate, Shyft Network successfully adds a layer of context on top of data, ultimately turning raw data into meaningful information.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a> | <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-dao-approves-veriscope-vasp-grant-proposal-to-enable-free-fatf-travel-rule-transactions-77e51d735cd6">Shyft DAO Approves Veriscope VASP Grant Proposal to Enable Free FATF Travel Rule Transactions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<p>Making self-sovereign identity (SSI) more adoptable has always been our North Star at Trinsic. It was in 2019 when we made SSI accessible to the everyday developer through an API. And it was when we <a href="https://trinsic.id/introducing-trinsic-ecosystems/">announced</a> Trinsic Ecosystems, a product that enables developers to implement SSI within entire ecosystems, networks, or marketplaces at enterprise-level scale and performance.</p><p><br>Driven by our motivation to make SSI more adoptable, we built the world’s first turn-key, open source trust registry solution. This work was sponsored by the <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab</a> (eSSIF-Lab), which is an EU consortium that provides funding for projects that build SSI open source tools. Any ecosystem provider can use the trust registry implementation to enable governance in their verifiable data ecosystem.</p><p><br>Below, we dive more into the what and why of trust registries, what we delivered to eSSIF-Lab, and how it all relates to SSI adoption.</p>

				<p>Imagine a scenario where a person is trying to open a bank account with an online bank. To open the account, the bank must verify the person’s identity. This is done by asking to see an identification credential, like a driver’s license. How can the bank trust that the driver’s license came from an authorized issuer and is not fake? The bank could keep and maintain a list of all the DMV office issuers, but that would be impractical. Additionally, how does the prospective bank member trust the bank is only asking for the information that it is authorized to ask for and is not a bad actor?</p><p><br>The scenario above can be boiled down into two questions:<br><br></p>  How does a credential verifier know that the issuer of the credential is trustworthy?  How does a credential holder know that a verifier is trustworthy?  <p><br>To answer the questions above, governance must be established in a verifiable data ecosystem, and trust registries make that possible.</p>

				<p>A <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> is a list of approved issuers and verifiers within an ecosystem and the types of credentials they are authorized to issue and verify. Trust registries are basically a way of saying, “yes, these issuers can issue these credentials (these schemas)” and “yes, these verifiers have the authority to verify that credential” in an ecosystem. Trust registries are created and maintained by a governing entity (or entity groups), which at Trinsic is called an ecosystem provider.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					An ecosystem’s provider creates and maintains the trust registry.
										
								 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the banking example above, instead of the bank having to maintain its own list of hundreds of authorized issuers of driver’s licenses, the bank would only need to trust one DMV trust registry which the ecosystem provider would maintain. If the issuer of the credential is not listed in the trust registry, the verification will not be successful. Similarly, the trust registry would provide the prospective bank member the assurance that the bank is an authorized verifier and is only asking for the information it is authorized to verify.<br><br></p><p>Here is an example of how a trust registry can be expressed in the ‘issuer’ field in a verifiable credential:</p>

				<p>Trinsic was sponsored by eSSIF-Lab to create an open source trust registry solution that integrates with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>.<br><br></p><p>This was delivered in the form of:<br><br></p>  Application Service  Infrastructure and deployment  Reference implementations  <p><br>We based the solution on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> Foundation <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf">specification</a> for interoperable trust registries. Because of this, the trust registry implementation we built is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.</p><p><br>The solution is open source and ready-to-build, so anyone can start using it today to add governance regulation into their ecosystem. To get started and to see the trust registry in action, visit the project’s <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_3/trinsic/trust-reg">GitLab page</a>.</p>

				<p>Trinsic applied to work on this trust registry project with eSSIF-Lab (and luckily got selected!) because we believe that solving governance in verifiable credential ecosystems is crucial for SSI adoption. Without governance, anyone in an ecosystem would be able to issue or verify credentials even if they didn’t have the authority to do so, discrediting the data exchanged within the ecosystem. Trust registries are one way to solve this problem, and we are committed to continue working with the community as other governance solutions are identified.</p><p><br>At this time, the two main community efforts that tackle the problem of verifiable data governance are:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a>: Incubated at the Trust over IP Foundation, this is the specification that our implementation is based on.  <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">Trust Establishment</a>: Incubated at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, this is an early stage effort to standardize trust establishment by providing ‘trust lists’ of authorized issuers and verifiers. It is conceptually and functionally almost identical to trust registries.

<p>Web3 decentralized applications (dapps) are in many ways superior to Web2 services. DIDsign, the digital signature service built on KILT, is a sign of what corporates and consumers can expect in a Web3&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> provides a way to sign any digital file directly in your browser. The DIDsign signature is uniquely linked to the person signing as it is based around an industry-standard decentralized identifier (DID). This is a string of numbers and letters that forms a “digital fingerprint”, allowing users to build a digital identity by adding <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">credentials</a>, a unique <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/introducing-web3name-your-unique-digital-name-for-web3-the-internet-of-the-future-c301a18f75e8">web3name</a> and any other <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/looking-forward-web3name-7af74469043b">information they wish to make&nbsp;public</a>.</p><p>DIDsign offers several advantages over similar Web2 services:</p> Privacy <p>Web2 signing services require the user to upload the documents they want to sign to a server. With DIDsign, files remain under the user’s control on their&nbsp;device.</p><p>The user opens the DIDsign website on their computer and adds the file/s they wish to sign either using the drag &amp; drop function or by selecting from their files. They then sign via their Sporran wallet, a browser extension on their device. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of their signature. Once they have signed, they need to save the signed files and signature (usually as a zipfile) to their device. When the browser is closed, all data is deleted. That means the user’s data is never transferred or monetized.</p><p>Web2 signing services require registering with the service, giving personal details such as name, email address, etc. DIDsign requires no sign in or user&nbsp;details.</p><p>To sign via DIDsign, the user enters their password in their private Sporran wallet when prompted — DIDsign doesn’t need to know anything about them. The recipient also doesn’t need to provide any identifying details: they simply add the signed file into the Verify area on the<a href="https://didsign.io/verifier"> DIDsign website</a> to validate the signature.</p> Security <p>Web2 signing services check only the email of the person signing, which can be hacked. DIDsign allows the signer to add additional verified credentials to their signature, which show their email, social media handles, GitHub account, etc., in both private and public&nbsp;formats.</p><p>These credentials can be generated and verified for free via another Web3 dapp created by BTE, SocialKYC, and are stored privately in their Sporran wallet. The user can choose to make their credentials public via a service endpoint, or can selectively choose to add any or part of them to their signature as extra identity verification. They may also add a unique web3name to their DID. When the recipient checks the signed file in the DIDsign verifier tab, they can see this additional verification.</p><p>Any change to any of the files will invalidate the signature, so the recipient can be sure that the files they receive have not been tampered with. If the files match the signature and have not been changed since they were signed, the signature shows a green check mark next to each file, and next to “Verification” under the list of files. If any of the content of the files have been altered, or if the signature wasn’t included in the zip file, verification will&nbsp;fail.</p> Flexibility <p>Web2 signing services are limited to certain data types (PDF, etc.). DIDsign allows the user to sign any kind of digital&nbsp;file.</p><p>DIDsign allows signing text, image, video, audio, or software files. These may be signed individually, or combined in one&nbsp;file.</p><p>Web2 signing services require signed files to be sent by email only. DIDsign allows sending the signed file by a variety of communication methods.</p><p>The file can be shared via the user’s preferred method (email, Telegram, WhatsApp, via memory stick,&nbsp;etc.).</p> Cost Efficiency <p>Web2 signing services require the initiator to pay. DIDsign is free to use, both for those signing and for those verifying the signature.</p><p>Signing with DIDsign requires the user to pay a once-off deposit and a small transaction fee for their on-chain DID. Currently, deposits and fees in DIDsign are paid in KILT tokens, but the option to pay with fiat (for instance, euro or dollar) will be available soon, making enterprise adoption even easier. Once users have their on-chain DID, they can sign as often as they like (and receive the deposit back if they don’t need the DID any more). Verifying a signed file is always free — the recipient just drops the file into the Verify area on the DIDsign&nbsp;website.</p> Trustless Timestamps <p>With Web2 signing services that offer timestamps, the time of signing is centrally stored by the service or marked on the document. Timestamps with DIDsign are “trustless” as they are recorded on the decentralized KILT blockchain.</p><p>Once the file has been signed, DIDsign offers the option to <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign_Timestamp.pdf">add a timestamp</a>. This is added to the KILT blockchain as a permanent record via the user’s cryptographically-protected Sporran&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>When verified via the DIDsign website, the signed file shows the date and time (local and UTC). Note, because it’s written to the blockchain, it requires a small transaction fee (around 0.004 KILT), and the timestamp is the time it was recorded to the blockchain.</p><p>To reiterate: the user’s data is never saved — instead, a unique hash (a series of letters and numbers) representing the user’s data is written on the KILT blockchain.</p> DIDsign in the Real&nbsp;World <p>Along with individual use, DIDsign can be used on a large scale by institutions such as hospitals, governments or banks, allowing staff to sign, timestamp and send reports. Any fees required for deposits or transactions that require payment can be paid by the institution.</p><p>DIDsign also allows several people to sign the same document separately and confirm that it was signed. For example if a contract needs to be approved by several parties, each party can sign it and send their signature to the others. The document can then be checked against each signature, showing that each party signed the document in its original&nbsp;form.</p><p>See more about how it works in the <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign.pdf">DIDsign How-to&nbsp;guide</a>.</p> Enabling Web3 <p>DIDsign was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE). BTE is a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized identity blockchain protocol with a mission to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. DIDsign is another step towards achieving this.</p><p>We are only at the beginning of mainstream adoption of decentralized blockchain-enabled applications, but already there are several Web3 dapps “built on KILT” that are available and ready to be used. Try them for yourself now and start building your own decentralized digital identity, under your&nbsp;control.</p><p>Even if you have no blockchain experience or KILT tokens, you can set up a Sporran and create credentials for free.

  Holistic Screening provides new capabilities such as multi-asset screening, cross-asset tracing and cross-chain tracing&nbsp; - revealing risk that first-generation blockchain analytics cannot detect.<br><br>  
  Holistic Screening is powered by Nexus, Elliptic’s new blockchain analytics engine, which allows complex, manual cross-chain investigations to be replaced by API calls and automated risk-scoring - driving greater efficiency within compliance teams.  
  
  
  
  
<p>Elliptic pioneered crypto compliance in 2015, with the launch of Elliptic AML, the world’s first Bitcoin transaction screening tool. It eliminated the complexities of blockchain analytics by providing compliance professionals with a single, actionable risk score. Since then we have expanded our offering, providing a comprehensive suite of crypto compliance solutions with the broadest coverage of cryptoassets and blockchains available on the market.</p>

</p><p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the market leader in developing Trusted Digital Ecosystems to verify and exchange high-value information, has been named a finalist in the 12th annual <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova Awards.</a> Hosted by Silicon Valley research and advisory firm Constellation, the SuperNova Awards “recognize individuals and teams who are prioritizing disruptive technology and transforming their organizations with digital initiatives.” Indicio was chosen as a finalist in the Digital Safety, Governance, and Privacy Category.</p>
<p>Indicio is being recognized for the company’s ground-breaking work with SITA, the world leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, and the government of Aruba. Together they developed a complete Trusted Digital Ecosystem for using decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials to create a seamless travel system for visitors to the island. This enabled people to share their personal health data — in this case, Covid-19 testing and vaccination — in a privacy-preserving way. </p>
<p>“Savvy digital leaders from all industries have made the move from digital channels to digital business models. Despite a high level of uncertainty, rampant inflation, rising interest rates, uncertain inventory and a massive labor shortage, this year’s SuperNova Award winners have made a significant impact to their businesses,” said R “Ray” Wang, founder and CEO of Constellation Research. “The lessons learned from these organizations provide a strong template and great inspiration for other leaders looking to pave the way in their organizations.”</p>
<p>“This technology lays the foundation for being able to authenticate and share any kind digital data in an immediately actionable way — it’s the verification layer that’s missing from the internet and it comes with a meaningful, powerful ability to deliver personal privacy,”said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “Obviously, both the Aruban government and SITA saw how this could solve the challenge of reopening tourism safely during a pandemic: The technology eliminated fraud and it solved the tricky problem of sharing private health data by removing the need for a direct integration with a person’s health provider or a third party. But they also saw how this solution could transform how we travel, how we work, and, ultimately, how we live in a post-pandemic world. They were visionaries in an incredibly tough time for the tourism and travel sectors — and just as we are honored to be nominated for this award, we honor them for giving us the opportunity to realize their vision.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>Matthys Serfontein, SITA President, Americas, said: “We need to open up the world of travel, safely and securely, by moving ahead in terms of digital credentials to automate and simplify the passenger experience. Working with Indicio, the trial with Aruba is a huge step in showing we can achieve digital travel, making the journey convenient, safe and stress-free for passengers, while at the same time saving airlines and governments considerable valuable time in verifying credentials.”</p>
<p>Indicio is now working with the Aruban government and SITA to pilot an implementation of the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) Digital Travel Credential (DTC), which would create seamless travel for US citizens to Aruba. ICAO is the UN Agency responsible for global air transport standards. In addition, the SITA and Indicio, contributed the custom healthcare elements of the open source codebase used in Aruba <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) where, in 2021, it became the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a> project, a complete open-source code repository for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital health credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“If data can be reliably authenticated without having to check in with its source or cross-check with a third party then that data can be immediately actionable in any kind of context. It’s no longer constrained by the traditional, siloed architecture of the internet,” said Dahl. “And if that data can be shared in ways that allow consent, protect privacy, and deliver security, then that data can be trusted. We say what we’re doing is building Trusted Digital Ecosystems, but that’s a shorthand for rewriting the structure of the internet, the web, digital interaction, and digital relationships. Imagine data being able to instantly prove it is what it says it is and where it came from. That’s a new kind of digital freedom — an open digital landscape that benefits everyone and creates new opportunities.”</p>
<p>In addition to the travel and health sectors, Indicio is building Trusted Digital Ecosystems for climate auditing, for connected devices, for fintech, the metaverse, and supply chains — each a case where identity and data need to be proven in a privacy-preserving way. All of these solutions draw on Indicio’s leadership in the open source community for innovative solutions, and benefit from Indicio’s business experience and field-leading technical expertise.</p>
<p>The 2022 SuperNova Award judges, composed of technology thought-leaders and journalists, selected finalists who demonstrated success in implementing cutting-edge business models and emerging technologies for their organizations. Finalists achieved remarkable results, including competitive advantage, cost savings and quantifiable improvements in agility.</p>
<p>Public voting for the SuperNova Awards will take place online from August 8 – September 2, 2022. The winners will be announced at the SuperNova Awards Gala on October 26 in Half Moon Bay, California, during Constellation’s Connected Enterprise.</p>

As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Huobi Research released the latest survey report “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”. It mentioned: Web3 middleware, including decentralized identity (DID), reputation systems, node services, databases, and Oracles, will solve the problems related to the inability of blockchains to be implemented, and become the “protagonists” of the next round of ecological explosion. It introduced ONT ID, ONTO Wallet, OScore, and believed that these products can promote the prosperity and development of the Web3 ecosystem.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in the interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6EEMswsxwg">Benzinga Crypto</a>, a well-known YouTube channel, talking about self-sovereign identity, its opportunities and potential pitfalls, and sharing the suite of decentralized identity products that Ontology has developed.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Huobi Research — “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”</p><p>“The middleware playbook could be the long term goal for crypto gem hunting. Despite the six years of blockchain development along the likes of decentralized infrastructure and GameFi, there remains roadblocks that hinder blockchain utility. The solution lies with middleware. Middleware connects users, institutions, developers and real world off-chain data all together with different dAPPs. Connecting the world to Web3, users possess decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to prove their identities in metaverse games.”</p><p>Mass adoption of Web3 requires infrastructure that removes barriers to development. DID forms a key part of that infrastructure and Ontology has created a suite of protocols around ONT ID to make development as easy as possible. With a single ONT ID in ONTO, users can control their on-chain assets, manage their identity data, and access various dApps and the wider Web3 ecosystem.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-august-1-8-2022-c4dbdb680a28">Ontology Weekly Report (August 1–8, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">Trend Report: Identity Fraud 2022</a> – IDnow’s annual report into the challenges and trends from the seedy underworld of identity fraud – is out now, and ready to be downloaded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As everyone’s online presence continues to increase, along with their reliance on digital services, identity fraud has never been a more pressing concern, for consumers and for businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-28-million-fraud-reports-consumers-2021-0">Federal Trade Commission</a> reveals a 70% increase in fraud losses (US$5.8 billion) in 2021 compared to the previous year, resulting in US$5.8 billion in lost funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation in Europe fared no better, with the British public exposed to several Covid-related identity fraud scams involving <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/nhs-covid-test-scam-exposed-aQBcr0c6Q374">fake PCR tests and vaccine passes</a> throughout the year. Meanwhile, in Germany, financial supervisory authority, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin</a> identified an increasing number of cases involving <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2022/fa_bj_2204_vorsicht_betrug_en.html">fake job offers</a>, where ‘recruited employees’ were asked to open bank accounts for test purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud has become digital, behind a screen and remote; the work of fraudsters has been greatly facilitated through advanced technology. It is no longer necessary to physically fabricate fake documents, as the resources needed for digital usurpation, such as photos or videos of identity documents, or stolen official documents, are available and accessible with a few clicks on the Dark Web.</p> Lovro Persen, Director Document &amp; Fraud at IDnow Group </blockquote>



<p>“To prevent these frauds, the requirements for remote identity verification need to be further harmonized and standardized on an institutional level, for example European Telecommunications Standards Institute, across Europe. This will allow identification verification (IDV) providers such as the IDnow Group to leverage state-of-the-art IDV technology combined with the expertise of fraud experts,” Persen added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Download the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">Trend Report: Identity Fraud 2022</a> to learn all about the newest fraud and identity theft trends. Thankfully, the report also contains invaluable information on how, using high assurance verification solutions, organizations can protect the identity of their customers, thereby preventing fraud, whatever the industry, whether finance, insurance, mobility, gaming, esports, travel, or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">crypto</a>.&nbsp;Check out the report today to discover the benefits of IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, which offers seamless online identification via expert-assisted video chat.  </p>

 by Li Jun, Founder of&nbsp;Ontology Image Credit: Yuichiro Chino/Getty<p>Every time we unlock our phones or open our laptops, we are prompted to enter passwords, codes and captchas to access our data held in servers far away. Within our increasingly interconnected world, everything relies on our identity. For this reason, we are always asked to verify who we really are — both in the physical world and on the web. Traditionally, we do this by typing in passwords online or flashing our passports and licenses to government officials. We surrender our personal information in exchange for services and permission to do certain activities, online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Web2 has forced us to accept that the cost of using so-called “free” services such as Google and Facebook comes at the expense of exposing our identity. Once we agree to the privacy policies of websites, our data gets stored in centralized centers owned by a handful of institutions.</p><p>Most of us accept that giving these companies access to our identity is preferable to not having access to the majority of the internet. This means not being able to access social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, book concerts and events online at Ticketmaster and Eventbrite, make travel plans on TripAdvisor and Booking.com, or shop online through Amazon and eBay. Especially in our web-reliant world, this would heavily limit services we can access — or at least make our lives inconvenient.</p><p>Although we have become all too aware of the inherent risk of storing information in a centralized data storage system, the majority of us have simply accepted the fact that our data could be (and has been) compromised at any given time. Moreover, despite legislative breakthroughs such as <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/25/gdpr-4th-anniversary/">GDPR</a> in Europe and CCPA in the U.S., it could be argued that globally we have become increasingly flippant about <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/13/report-multiple-data-breaches-common-in-past-year/">data breaches</a> because such news is so constant; it merely exists as a buzz in the background.</p> Web3 and decentralization — what it means for&nbsp;you <p>Now, imagine not having to log in every single time you move between different apps and platforms. Imagine not checking your phone for two-factor authentication. Imagine not worrying about the inevitability of a data breach. As we move from Web2 to Web3, decentralized identity solutions provide a gateway for a seamless experience where users can easily and safely traverse between different platforms.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/22/the-state-of-data-in-2022-decentralization/">decentralization</a> is a core tenet of Web3 technology. Decentralization provides users with ownership, access and control of their own data without relying on Big Tech intermediaries.</p><p>This concept of decentralization can also be applied to how identity is stored and verified. Instead of relying on third-party servers, users have complete control over their personal information stored only in their&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets built on blockchain technology provide a secure way to upload verified information confirmed by trusted authorities on your device without relying on third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Besides being encrypted securely on blockchain, additional information about the user is not relayed to others when proving something is true — a concept known as zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). With such technology and security, users will be able to access goods and services in the click of a button that previously required stacks of paperwork.</p><p>Determining your eligibility for a loan or a mortgage will be made easier through seamless verification of your credit history and proof of employment stored in your digital wallet. Getting reimbursed by insurance providers will be made simple through digital receipts and medical records. Applying for college will be made faster with your education history and extracurricular achievements stored in your digital wallet. These are tangible, real-life use cases that will deliver more efficient and effective processes.</p> Bringing trust back to the internet by eliminating bots <p>Not only will the concept of decentralized identity make the user experience of Web3 streamlined, it will also make it a more authentic place. In a Web3 world, fake, spam and bot accounts could be confined to the past. At least, they may decrease if sites require their users to authenticate themselves using the information attached to their digital wallets to prove their identity.</p><p>This might lower cybercrimes and other serious issues online such as catfishing, financial scams and intentionally spreading misinformation, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Although the industry is making history and taking strides in creating Web3, there are still issues the industry has not quite yet figured out. We must be realistic and acknowledge the ample room for improvement that exists when addressing ethical challenges and the lack of regulatory frameworks, among many others. Trailblazers of Web3 and its users should be consulted by lawmakers and lobbyists to create laws applicable on Web3 and in the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/04/24/the-metaverse-is-a-transformational-opportunity-for-the-business-world/">metaverse</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, the possibilities for Web3 are endless. The convergence of the physical world and Web3 would create an immersive virtual-reality experience supported by decentralized identity. Decentralized identities could make our digital and physical world much safer and more convenient, providing an immersive space for all, free from the negative externalities presented by big tech&nbsp;giants.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/decentralized-identity-may-be-critical-for-the-success-of-web3-b7eb704feb5f">Decentralized identity may be critical for the success of Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We get a lot of questions about Civic Pass and its relationship to KYC/AML from companies looking for a Web3 native solution. If this question describes you, then you’ve come to the right place. Typically, the companies we talk to fall into a few different categories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a look to see which category might suit your needs.</p>



<p>1. Your company is required to meet KYC/AML regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>If your company needs to meet KYC/AML regulatory requirements, then you likely need an in-house compliance program that follows guidance of local laws. DeFi and institutional investors fall into this category.</p>



<p>Civic Pass enables Web3 smart contract access management and offers identity verification services that can be deployed as part of your compliance program. Our tools and services do not replace the need for maintaining an in-house compliance program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic verifies the following credentials, which may serve as inputs to your compliance program:</p>



  Government-issued identity documents (driver’s license, passport)  Biometrics (video selfie)  Age&nbsp;  Location (ensures IP address is accurate and whether a VPN is being used)  Liveness (determines whether user is a human or a bot)  Perform sanctions screening (OFAC, UN, HMT, EU, DFAT, and more)  



<p>Most regulated companies are required to have full control over user access rights. This means your company must keep track of which users have permission to use your services, and your company should also retain a full record of work performed, including all supporting documents, for their compliance program files.&nbsp;</p>



  Civic Pass is a token-based on-chain gatekeeper that your company can use to control user access rights. We offer the ability to fully control the issuance and status of the Civic Pass. For example, a Civic Pass may be active, frozen or revoked.  Civic can provide the source documents and other evidence required to your company for long term storage to help satisfy your compliance with regulatory requirements.  



<p><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1gb6opBXtRN6_YFdVnC26vwbzn0a">Contact us here</a> to start an introductory conversation with Civic, if you have an in-house compliance program to meet KYC/AML regulatory requirements. You may also <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">get started now</a> by visiting our Developer Hub.</p>



<p>2. Your company needs to verify certain identity information, such as age, and needs to keep a copy of the documentation.</p>



<p>Some companies do not need the ability to control the status of their users’ Civic Pass to be compliant with their local laws. However, these companies may also need to store a copy of the identity documentation either for compliance reasons or for purposes of best practices. If your company falls into this category, Civic can help by issuing and controlling the status of the Civic Pass, while also providing a data verification input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One example of a company in this category is an NFT launchpad that needs to verify personal information of their creators and store the documents as a best practice to protect NFT buyers. Another example is a company that services individuals who are verified to be at least 18 years of age.</p>



<p><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Z4QgWNh0RN2-81jJDcrN2Qbzn0a">Contact us here</a> to start an introductory conversation with Civic, if this description fits your company.</p>



<p>3. Your company needs to verify certain identity information, for example that a user is human and not a bot, and does not need to keep a copy of the documentation.</p>



<p>We talk to many companies that need basic information checked, but do not need to store any documentation, nor do they need control over the status of the Civic Pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples of this include companies that simply want to verify that a user is a human with liveness verification or that an individual is not using more than one account with uniqueness verification. Both NFT marketplaces with live mints and DOAs with voting processes typically fall into this category.</p>

<p>Wondering about private vs. public blockchains? Do you need a permissioned blockchain, or is permissionless the way to go? We’ve covered everything you need to know.</p>
<p>What are the four types of blockchain? The four types of blockchain are as follows:</p>
 
 Public Blockchain: permissionless, anyone has access 
 Private Blockchain: closed network 
 Permissioned: private, open, or closed networks 
 Hybrid Blockchain: combination of private and public blockchain 
 
 What Is the Blockchain? 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/blockchain-authentication/">Blockchain</a> technology is a new Web 3.0 technology that serves as a decentralized, irreversible ledger for record-keeping that doesn’t require the participation or management of a central entity or organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blockchain was invented as part of Bitcoin. The whitepaper, written by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, defined the ledger as a system of cryptographically signed blocks of data that the collective computing power of the network would verify and place into an immutable ledger. This was perceived as the solution to the “double spend” problem hindering the development of digital cash and served as the basis for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the original blockchain, the process of exchange was relatively simple:</p>
 
 One user transfers a set number of bitcoins to another user. 
 The information related to this transaction (the users, timestamps, wallets addresses, etc.) are bundled together into a “block” that is encrypted and cryptographically signed.&nbsp; 
 Blocks are bundled together, and nodes in the network (called “miners”) donate CPU power to solve the equation confirming those blocks’ signatures.&nbsp; 
 Once the blocks are verified, the transactions are considered legitimate and are appended to the end of the ledger.&nbsp; 
 The update is pushed to each network user (all of which carry their own copy of the ledger).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hence, the blockchain is literally a chain of blocks representing data about network activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain offers a few critical benefits:</p>
 
 Decentralization: The blockchain removes the need for maintaining centralized servers to store data. Instead, that data is collectively stored by the blockchain users and the ledger, providing more resilience from attacks against central weak points and control over that data. 
 Immutability: The blockchain ledger cannot be changed without the collective work of the network or (in the case of private chains) the permission of a governing organization. This means that the blockchain is even more resilient, especially against fraud.&nbsp; 
 Extensibility: The original blockchain was intended to govern the exchange of tokens, and many crypto chains still essentially support this function. Modern innovations in blockchain technology, like smart contracts, have allowed for the decentralization of automated agreements and even code to run underneath applications.&nbsp; 
 
 What Are the Different Types of Blockchain? 
<p>While there are general similarities between different implementations of blockchain technology, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t differences and, in some cases, improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the different types of blockchain include the following:</p>
 
 Public: The most well-known type of blockchain. Public blockchains are 100% decentralized and user-operated. Furthermore, they are “permissionless,” meaning that anyone can join at any time without needing the authorization of a governing body.&nbsp; Bitcoin is the most widely used form of public chain in that it is completely decentralized and maintained through the nodes’ systems. There are no centralized entities and no party that can control the blockchain.&nbsp; 
 Private: The opposite of a public chain, private chains require that users have access to the network, usually through <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-on-blockchain/">identity authentication</a>, and that they follow specific rules to that chain to participate. Private chains also rely on a governing body or managing organization to dictate the terms of the protocol and access to the system, mining capabilities, or even what the blockchain event stores.&nbsp; 
 Permissioned: Permissioned chains are a sort of hybrid of public and private. There is a control mechanism in place, but additional controls around roles and permissions exist so that different users can perform different types of actions on the chain. 
 
<p>These chains aren’t necessarily exclusive—for example, your app could use a private, permissioned chain to maintain security while leveraging different permissions for the system.</p>
 Benefits of Private Blockchain Technology 
<p>As more businesses adopt blockchain technology, they are finding that there are some key benefits that these technologies bring. Because of this, the creative use of these technologies have found purchase in industries like finance, cloud computing, and identity management.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of a private blockchain include the following:</p>
 
 Decentralization: Central servers can serve as points of failure and attack for hackers. If a server of passwords is hacked, then all those passwords are compromised. With a private blockchain, there isn’t a central location where a hacker can steal every single password; no single node is a central point of failure.&nbsp; 
 Development and Extensibility: With smart contracts and other emerging technologies, as well as the fundamentally open-source nature of the underlying tech, it’s relatively easy to modify blockchain systems to fit a company’s specific needs.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: Any transaction, user activity, or attempted breach is automatically appended to the ledger—recorded forever in that blockchain. Because these systems are immutable and irreversible, they serve as an effective backbone for systems that have strict auditing requirements.&nbsp; 
 Ownership: Private, permissionless blockchains can be configured as such to leave the ownership of data out of the hands of central businesses and in the hands of users. Data, like personally identifiable data, can be left in the hands of the user, who can only share what’s needed minimally for processes like authentication or authorization. Not only is this an attractive concept for users, but it helps both users and companies address some of the real concerns around third-party data collection. 
 
 Utilize Decentralized Identity Management with 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the challenges of enterprise identity management systems is that they rely too much on centralized servers that serve as honeypots while removing control of identity information from users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages a permissioned blockchain that decentralizes identity management to your users so that information is stored in devices, not central servers. This approach, alongside a focus on identity proofing, passwordless login, and streamlined user experiences.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get the following features:</p>
 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.&nbsp; 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp; 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp;

<p>Experience is everything these days. When customers interact with a brand digitally, they expect the entire journey to be easy, personalized, and friction-free. Plus, in an ever more privacy-conscious climate, people expect companies to keep their personal data private and secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These seem like pretty reasonable expectations—but many businesses still struggle to meet them when they’re trying to build great digital experiences. That’s because moving from expectation to reality means balancing the tension between three seemingly conflicting priorities: convenience, security, and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses tend to do really well with one aspect while falling short on the other two. Their security might be top-notch, for example, but the user experience really isn’t convenient and data privacy is an afterthought. This often results in digital experiences that satisfy neither customers nor the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to optimize all three in your digital experiences, identity orchestration offers an effective way to help you achieve that goal. It can help you remove complexities and friction across the entire customer journey and shape seamless digital experiences without sacrificing convenience, security, or privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explore what identity orchestration is all about, and how it contributes to designing digital experiences that have it all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global internet revolution was always considered to be an outcome of perpetual innovations. From Web1 to Web3, the way web and computer systems have evolved in the last two decades has set an unprecedented example of changing functionalities, communication protocols, interactivity, and user experience. There was a time when people were staring at a few static pages on a computer screen, and now they are having a real-life experience with a VR headset entering a Metaverse to shop for their favorite NFTs. Web3 is the third generation of the World Wide Web that is open-source and supported by decentralized networks using blockchain. What started as a military operation and what it has transformed into are completely different. </p><p>Did the internet start as a military operation?</p><p>Let’s start by learning how the whole global web revolution started and what initially it stood for.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  The Invention of the Internet <p>The current revolution of decentralizing the web roots back to the time of when and how the internet was invented. The story of the origins of the internet goes back to the 1950s when the cold war with the Soviet Union was at its peak and both the superpowers possessed deadly nuclear weapons. US’s defense department funded research called Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa). In 1969, Arpa created an immobile wired data communication system that was centralized and hence, could be easily disabled by a fragile attack. The whole of Arpanet’s infrastructure evolved into a decentralized system of many computers (with no central command station) distributed across the country. These computers can easily communicate with each other wirelessly. </p><p>A distributed set of computers communicating with each other? </p><p>Have we heard this in the definitions of blockchain?<br></p><p>In 1974, Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf, two Arpanet researchers solved the biggest problem of that time of making two networks communicate with each other. This solution was a set of guidelines that led to the emergence of ‘internetworking’ and with their invention, we saw TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol presented before the world for the very first time.</p> Web1: Read-only <p>Fast forward 15 years to the year 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berner Lee researching at ​​the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, created a protocol that could link hypertext documents into an information system. By October of 1990, Tim wrote 3 fundamental technologies that constitute the web even today - HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).</p><p>After this, Tim wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”), and right here, the World Wide Web (WWW) was invented. By the end of 1990, the first web page was presented and visible to the world.</p><p>*Important - The Internet and World Wide Web are often mistaken for each other. The World Wide Web is a way of accessing information using the internet and the internet is the networking infrastructure between nodes or computers. </p><p>Source - <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/</a> <br></p><p>From 1991, the whole revolution of the internet to be used by anyone across the world started to grow like wildfire. In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international community devoted to developing open web standards.</p><p>New web browsers like Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator came that made internet surfing mainstream. The whole Web1 movement was powered by regular computers. You could read data on your computer ‘boxes’.</p><p>There were a few thousand web pages created by technically-experienced ‘content creators’ and if you would want to download an image or a video from the internet, it was taking forever.</p><p>However, anyone was free to build on it. Clearly, Web1 was decentralized, open-source, and slow. It’s open-source nature enabled major corporations like Goodle and Amazon to start building their colossal empires, however, things took a different turn.</p> Web2: Read and Write (The Web of Today) <p>The early emergence of Web2 is accredited to the rise of commerce on the internet. Companies started to sell goods and services on the internet. This massive boom of ‘e-commerce’ platforms led of the early 2000s led to the .dotcom bubble. </p><p>E-commerce platforms made interactions with the website possible. Many businesses failed in this debacle although, they laid the foundation for enormous possibilities web was capable of. </p> The Magnificent Rise of Social Media <p>The very first possibility that revolutionized the internet era was to make everyone in this world capable of creating their own webpage without writing a single line of code. Everyone was capable of becoming a content creator and interacting with each other instead of only interacting with the website.</p><p>Platforms like Friendster, Friendfeed, and Myspace were developed by the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, California, and users around the world were able to share anything they wanted on the internet. For the first time, anyone in the world was able to have a social network on the internet. By 2006, we had Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, the three current giants of social media and the rest is history.</p> Users Became the Products <p>Both e-commerce and social networking platforms made their users have two fundamental requirements to interact with their platform:</p>  An identity to interact on the platform  Blind trust on the platforms  <p>Web2 began the era of centralized technologies and data storage centers where an enormous amount of data started to be stored in a few warehouses owned by a few giants. Censorship, surveillance, and practices like deplatforming were standardized for disagreeing with the platform’s terms and conditions. </p><p>These giants were, and are still able to, influence the data shared with the users, use it effectively to place ads for their advertisers or sell it to other companies to improve their products and their placements.<br>Users’ own data is no more in their own control. Data has now become an asset that is continuing to make the giants richer. As Tim ‘O’ Reilly <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/22823381903">once tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Yes! RT <a href="https://twitter.com/bryce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bryce</a> love this quote "If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." http://bit.ly/93JYCJ</p>— timoreilly (@timoreilly) <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/22823381903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2010</a></blockquote>

 Identity and Ownership <p>In Web2, you have numerous digital identities on a myriad of platforms. Most of them are connected to a single account that can be your email id. When you sign up using your Gmail on any website, your email account becomes a point of contact as well as a source of your digital footprint that records each and every online activity connected to your account. </p><p>The most important question of this whole centralized shift again arises:</p><p>Do you control what you can do with this data and who you can share it with?</p><p>In simple words, do you completely ‘own’ and ‘control’” your digital footprint?</p><p>Over the years, we have seen data breaches consistently proving that the new Internet or Web2 has failed to protect user privacy. Global regulations like GDPR are not proving to be enough to protect users’ rights. Billions of dollars have been lost and spent to give the current users of Web2 this one fundamental right they rightfully deserve.</p><p>The debates around data and digital identity to be self-sovereign and privacy-preserved began and this whole movement started to take a new shape - Web3.</p> Web3 Explained <p>Web3 is the next evolution of a blockchain-based Word Wide Web that is decentralized, democratized, and more interactive. With the help of blockchain, developers will be able to build websites, platforms, and applications that are more secure, privacy-preserved, and censorship-resistant.</p><p>Web3 wants to change how you trust a website, how you connect your identity to a website, how your data is stored, and who possesses the control of your data. Web3 wants to make the web a space that is built by the people and for the people.</p> The Origins of Web3 <p>The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was coined by Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama, in 2014. By bringing a group of friends, developers, and pioneering entrepreneurs in the blockchain space together, in 2017, Gavin Wood also set up Web3 Foundation, an organization that rewards grants to innovative projects that are building decentralized web applications and protocols.<br></p><p>The whole Web3 movement gained tremendous popularity as the popularity of blockchain protocols and its products like NFTs, tokens, and Metaverse grew. The movement is joined by the Ethereum Foundation, Mozilla, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Dock, and many more.</p> Has Web3 Transitioned from AI-based to Blockchain-Based? The Role of Blockchain<br> <p>The definition that was describing Web3 evolved over time and due to the popularity of blockchain since the invention of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it was no longer limited to a ‘smart internet’.</p><p>Tim Berner Lee proposed the first concept of Web 3.0 in 2006 which is different from the meaning it has obtained today. He thought ‘Semantic Web’ driven by emerging technologies like AI and Machine Learning are going to play a pivotal role in this evolution. The goal of this Web extension was to make data machines readable. His vision was to make the internet more dynamic, open-source, interactive, and intelligent.</p><p>Was it the shift in the popularity of technologies or the shift in the paradigm, Web3 (Gavin Wood’s iteration) became more popular than Web3.0 (Tim Berner Lee’s interaction), and now, in all the definitions across the Google searches, Web3 is defined as a form of ‘decentralized internet’.</p><p>The primary objective Web3 is now focusing upon is users should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only when they choose to do so.</p> Web3 - More Than Crypto <p>Web3 has often been mistaken for cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It is true that in the future, they may form a crucial component of Web3. But to limit the scope of Web3 to only tokens and NFTs will be an understatement of this vast technology.</p><p>Since Web3 is based on blockchain technology, we will need tokens to facilitate transactions between 2 users. For any type of content (art, text, image, audio, or video) to have value, they will be needed to convert into NFTs and then transacted for a price agreed between the buyer and seller. Adding to this, Web3 will have numerous incentive and reward mechanisms for user participation, governance, and other technical and non-technical operations.</p><p>However, cryptocurrencies and NFTs constitute only a small part of Web3. Web3 encompasses an extensive range of sectors, industries, and applications. </p> What Makes Web3 Important?  Ownership <p>Ownership of data is the core objective of the Web3. This means users will be able to grant, revoke or modify access to their data anytime. This also means users will no longer need to disclose each and every data related to their online digital identity. Users will have features like ‘selective disclosures’ using which they will be able to disclose only the portion of their information that is requested by a third party.</p><p>Web3 repairs the deepest damage caused by Web2 on the idea of Web. Blockchain-based sign-in systems like Web3 ID become all the more more essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity.</p> Decentralization <p>Web3 is going to be powered by blockchain and tokenized assets (cryptocurrencies and NFTs). Decentralized technologies will enable peer-to-peer interactions between individuals, witnessed and verified by a decentralized network of nodes.</p><p>The P2P and decentralized capabilities of blockchain and Web3 fundamentally change the Web2 data infrastructure. Blockchain has the capability to decentralize storage, governance, and data authentication. Public blockchain infrastructures are open-source, permissionless, and trustless. With no single point of failure and a global community participating in the ecosystem at different levels, Web3 is more secure, dynamic, and interactive.</p> Reputation <p>All the content, texts, audio, images, or videos will be created with a cryptographic signature signed by the public key of the user. Every content will have the stamp of its creator. There can be a voting mechanism to review the content. Reviewers can be rewarded for their reviews and creators can be rewarded based on the impressions and response on their content.</p><p>In Web3, users will carry a reputation based on the content they have created and reviewed. A reputation-based system will influence users to stay honest in the ecosystem and produce good-quality content.</p> Identity <p>A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. On the web, it can be your emails, user names, and passwords, social media profiles, platform accounts, etc.</p><p>Web3 is going to change how your digital identity is created, authenticated, and linked to your online activity. Subsequent to this, Web3 authentication systems like <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a> (by Dock) let users or owners of the IDs to control the data linked to their digital IDs.</p><p>With the help of Web3 ID, how you will be able to authenticate your identity and sign in to websites and platforms is going to completely change. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/web3-identity/">See more details here</a>.<br></p> Security and Privacy <p>Web3 is capable of leveraging the most powerful features of blockchain to secure data breaches and user privacy. Each asset, financial transaction, or message can be encrypted using cryptographic algorithms. Encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling its contents so only certain people (with a key than can decrypt)can look at your message. </p><p>Asymmetric encryption or Public-private key cryptography can be used to encrypt our online activity and make it secure and tamper-proof. Asymmetric encryption is when the encryption key (also called the public key) and the corresponding decryption key (also called the private key) are different. </p><p>No data is stored on the blockchain. Blockchain only maintains an online register of all the identities created on it. Blockchain also maintains the proof of verification of all online transactions. Zero-knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) can be deployed to provide extra layers of security for data authentication, verification, and disclosures.</p> Censorship Resistance <p>When Elon Musk proposed to buy Twitter, the very first ecosystem he was willing to create on it was of “Free Speech.”</p><blockquote><p>🚀💫♥️ Yesss!!! ♥️💫🚀 <a href="https://t.co/0T9HzUHuh6">pic.twitter.com/0T9HzUHuh6</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518677066325053441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>The ability to censor content, webpages, apps, websites or users is a power that comes with tremendous responsibility.</p><p>There will be no corporate censorship. User data is no longer controlled however, decentralized voting mechanisms can be in place with the help of governance tokens whether to continue keeping the content on the web or burn it. Interoperability of platforms will allow users to migrate content from one platform to another if the content is negative or does not contribute to the platform’s nature. </p> Automation (DAO) <p>Ethereum brought smart contracts to blockchain and since then, it came to be known as the first decentralized computer. Smart contracts enabled any business model to induce automation from a basic transaction facilitation to building an entirely automated organization like DAOs where each and every operation is automatic and conducted based on the user’s interaction. <br></p><p>Web3 technology stack with developer-friendly APIs and smart contracts can help engineering teams enhance their technical functionalities and migrate to Web3 applications easily. Rewards, passive incomes (staking, interest, etc.), real-time analytics, payments, and many more operations can be automated which can make the business processes flow more efficiently, remove middlemen, and reduce costs.<br></p> Examples of Web3 in real-world <p>NFT marketplaces and DeFi platforms are seen as the two most successful use cases of Web3 apps where the apps are completely automated, open-source, and blockchain-based, and all activity can be traced on the explorers of the blockchain protocols they are built upon.<br></p><p>Currently, all the Web3 and blockchain-based applications want you to attach a wallet like MetaMask to enter the decentralized marketplace and interact on the platform. Other than these two, we have seen dApps experimenting with use cases in all sectors but not all have succeeded. </p><p>When we look at crypto projects that are in the Web3 space, the two most widely categorized use cases are decentralized storage and decentralized identities. <br></p> Wallets vs Web3 ID Sign-In System <p>Web3 IDs provide a lot more functionalities and features than wallet-based authentication. With crypto wallets, developers can verify publicly available data on the blockchain. With Web3 ID, developers can verify private user data.</p><p>With both wallets and Web3 IDs, you truly own what is stored or attached to them. With wallets, you in self-custody of your assets, with Web3 IDs you are in complete control of your data as all your data will be stored in your wallet only. </p><p>Your Web3 ID or DID doesn’t contain any wallet information and your wallet only stores the public keys of your Web3 ID and nothing else. This disconnect between the two helps verifiers to verify your private data with your consent. You will not need to connect the wallet to the platform. You will only need to scan a QR code on the login screen using your Wallet app and that’s it! You have signed in using your Web3 ID.</p>Difference between the sign-in process in Web1, Web2, and Web3 Conclusion <p>Web3 still has a long way to go to get an overarching worldwide adoption. Major corporations are still in their experimental stage and so are startups that are building innovative solutions. All these solutions are agreeing on a common ground of bringing the control of users’ digital identity and data back to who it belongs to the users.</p><p>Web3 is no more a radical concept. Since now Nike and Adidas are ready to sell Steph Curry’s sneaker NFTs on a blockchain and Dock’s Web3 IDs are allowing you to sign in using a blockchain-based identity system, it is not in theory anymore. The practical applications are available that are ready to use or integrated.</p><p>We are still in the early stages of this evolution. In the coming years, we will see new solutions targeting existing challenges with Web3 like security, easy and client-friendly accessibility, usability, and interoperability. Additionally, we will also possibly see how Web3 can be used with other emerging technologies like AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Biometrics. </p><p>What developers can create with Web3 is limitless. Seeing what we have already created, it is clear at this point that it is the Internet’s future.</p>

<p>Is a decentralized web the way to go, and is it the future of the world wide web? Should your business be preparing for this transition to decentralization?</p>
<p>What does a decentralized internet mean? A decentralized internet means that many people and devices control the web, and no single person can own or control it.</p>
 What Is “Decentralization”? 
<p>Decentralization is moving away from central resources, access points, or systems. Unlike more typical centralized infrastructure, the goals of decentralization are to reduce or eliminate reliance on centralized actors or technologies subject to corruption or failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we think of the internet, we may automatically think of it as “decentralized.” The original specifications and implementation of the initial Internet Protocol (IP) infrastructure were decentralized in that it defined a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where individual network nodes handled routing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many applications, however, thrive on a centralized model. The most prevalent organizational model on the internet is the client/server model, where a single server serves multiple clients who connect to upload or download data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In normal operating conditions, this isn’t a huge problem. With the rise of massive cloud infrastructure, mega-platforms, and social networking, however, users and developers alike began to see some potential issues with this model:</p>
 
 Security: Centralized servers, while secured, are honeypots for hackers, and even the most secure server can have vulnerabilities. With all-important application or service data housed on a server, one breach can be fatal to the privacy of user data or the operation of the app. This is especially problematic when it comes to protected information or data related to our identities.<br>
 
 Monopolization: As large tech companies grow larger and larger, it becomes much more difficult for smaller competitors to enter the market. Following this, centralizing features and functionality is seen as a path that removes user choice and limits a free market.&nbsp; 
 Ownership: One of the larger technical and political concerns of the decentralization movement is the ownership of data, software, and other intellectual or digital property. In centralized resources, most of our data is owned by companies or governments, and it is difficult to claim ownership. Furthermore, traditionally stable objects like money or art don’t translate well to the digital space without a decentralization mechanism that controls immutability.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While there are many good and productive things to come out of centralization, many developers, scientists, and security experts see decentralization as a worthwhile goal.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Web 3.0? 
<p>Experts break down the evolution of the web into three phases:</p>
 
 Web 1.0: The initial internet was birthed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. People may&nbsp; remember static web pages with functional, if clumsy, multimedia capacities. Rich with information and potential, Web 1.0 is defined by a lack of interactivity and simple, if useful, editing tools in the form of HTML.&nbsp; 
 Web 2.0: The next stage of the web’s development is often known as the “social” era of the internet. Developments in client-side scripting (CSS, JavaScript), server-side scripting (PHP, Python, Ruby), and APIs built for interactivity allow users to post and chat with one another in real time.<br>
These developments led to the rise of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Additionally, as the first generations of digital natives began coming of age on the internet, eCommerce and advertising skyrocketed, and the Google search engine industry was also born.&nbsp; 
 Web 3.0: Web 2.0 relied heavily on the client/server model, with real-time queries to databases providing critical interactivity for social media. Web 3.0 takes these advances and attempts to push them into increasingly decentralized contexts. Users are looking for new P2P technologies that give them freedom and security from monolithic systems.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The onset of Web 3.0 as the new paradigm for connectivity, data sharing, and app development has come as a response to the massive “mega-platforms” like Google, Facebook, and Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users and enterprises alike are looking for ways to decouple their infrastructure in part or in whole from these massive tech giants without sacrificing features. Likewise, users want more options to control their data and how it is shared and used in their professional and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Some Examples of Decentralized Web Projects? 
<p>While Web 3.0 is a relatively new technological paradigm, there are rarely clearly defined boundaries between eras. As such, some of the technologies discussed here may have come years ago while still applying to the spirit of decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some technologies pushing the Internet towards decentralization include the following:</p>
 
 Blockchain: The invention of Bitcoin in 2009 seemed to be a massive leap forward in the potential of digital currency. While that potential has yet to be fully realized, it also brought a major, unexpected technology into the public space: blockchains.<br>
These distributed, immutable ledgers promise the ability to manage record-keeping systems without a centralized authority. Or if a central authority existed, distribute day-to-day operations to the network.&nbsp; 
 BitTorrent: Even before Bitcoin, there was BitTorrent. This file-sharing technology used metadata (torrents) to segment shared files. Rather than expecting users to download a single file from a single server, they could instead download different segments from different peers on the network.<br>
This distributed both the network burden of uploading and downloading and the responsibility of keeping the file available to share. BitTorrent made the sharing of large media files, software, and documents a reality—and it did so by eliminating the need for a central server.<br>
 
 Diaspora: This nonprofit, distributed social network uses independent “pods” as the core of a larger decentralized network of social interaction and sharing. They rely on regional pods to serve local users for tighter and more niche community formation. It also allows end users to download the open-source software and host their own pods.&nbsp; 
 Blockstack: Blockstack uses blockchain technology to provide a decentralized computing and internet platform. This means that users can develop apps on the platform with a data-ownership mentality in mind. The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission approved Blockstack to sell digital tokens on the exchange—the first company to receive such approval.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The goal of decentralization is to help users and businesses take back control of computing and the internet, from data to app development and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
 Leverage Decentralized Identity Management with 1Kosmos 
<p>Decentralization brings some key benefits for users—namely, with the right setup, they allow them to maintain ownership over their private information. 1Kosmos BlockID takes advantage of this functionality to provide decentralized, private, and secure identity management services for enterprise users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With BlockID and our private, immutable blockchain, you remove the threat of hacks against a honeypot identity server while placing ownership of identity information back in the hands of the users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With BlockID, you can enjoy the following features:</p>
 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp;

<p>One thing I’ve been hearing recently is that decentralized identity is the "next cycle" to continue to drive the adoption of Web3. Decentralized identity is not “the next cycle” following the whole “DeFi season, NFT season, DAO season” narrative. Rather, it’s the continual catalyst that will unlock a new set of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms that were previously unavailable. </p><p>In short, decentralized identity adds the following in a trust-minimized and user-centric manner:</p>  Who you are - which is a core set of claims about a person or entity.  What you can do - which are any available actions based on those claims, which are verified and originated from a relevant source.   <p>We can illustrate this with our good friend Steve:</p>We like Steve<p>In this case, we have a core set of claims that unlock different things for the subject, including physical access, group memberships, and more. </p><p>With current technologies, we can have a user sign-in using their keys (e.g. <a href="https://login.xyz">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>), have <a href="https://spruceid.dev">credentials issued</a> to their identifier (and store them), and use capabilities to retrieve and present those credentials. In a future post, I’ll break down the core basics of decentralized identity – everything from DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and more. The use-cases that these types of workflows empower will really be what drives the space to another level during the next cycle. </p><p>To start with the basics, we need to set the stage with how the web3 space operates now, and then how it can operate in the future.</p> The Future is Now Blockchain 1.0<p>Our current scope with no external verifiable data deals strictly with asset exchange. Two parties can trustlessly transfer assets with no intermediary, based on a particular time (whether immediate, within a certain amount of blocks), or confirmation thresholds (enough signers to send from a multisig). </p><p>We’ve been able to reinvent an entire set of financial interactions, making them trustless by using this type of exchange, and it’s quite incredible. But beyond that, it becomes difficult to have more meaningful interactions because the more we trust the other side of the trade without additional verifiable information, the more counterparty risk we incur. How do we know <code>0xaLiCe</code> is who they say they are? </p>Exclusively Available on OpenEden&nbsp;<p>Let’s take this a step further by now introducing a case where a form of authenticity is required in some way about one of the counterparties. </p><p>This wonderful painting of Steve requires a bit of provenance tracing in order to be sold, and with that, knowing that the artist is the seller, and was responsible for creating the work. This is because we want a first edition copy of Steve sold directly by the artist (who wouldn't). Adding additional information such as some basic facts about a counterparty reintroduces trust in the transaction. </p><p>This comes with the correlation risk that there is now a name attached to a public key. However, the seller here has taken on this risk because the asset in question is worth more than the cost of the trust portion of this transaction. </p><p>Now with the additional context we’ve added, this interaction becomes safer due to Bob knowing that he’s buying this original Steve from the artist. Bob in this case may or may not associate his name with his public key, as he doesn’t require any form of authenticity. The trust portion of the transaction typically falls on the originator. Alice just needs to know that Bob has the money to pay for the art. Other than that, she couldn't care less who the buyer is. </p><p>That’s the beauty of this space: both counterparties don’t necessarily need the same assurance levels.</p><p><a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/levels-assurance-loas#:~:text=A%20level%20of%20(identity)%20assurance,the%20claimant's%20%E2%80%9Ctrue%E2%80%9D%20identity.">Levels of assurance</a> (LOA) represent the trust cost based on the stakes of the transaction itself. For example, if Alice has a name and a few social media handles tied to a public key, she may be able to prove authenticity when it comes to selling NFTs – a low assurance use case. </p><p>We’ve introduced some risk with these forms of personally identifiable information (PII), but as we go up the chain in information sensitivity requirements, unfortunately, it requires much more risk on Alice who has to meet some criteria for the transaction and disclose information. </p><p>A case where a government-issued identifier might be required would be a scenario in which Alice wants to participate in a permissioned DeFi protocol with KYC [customer/counterparty] requirements. Thankfully are ways in which Alice can prove her identity without having to publicly disclose any of this information:</p>Blockchain 10.0<p>In the case above, Alice can have a credential issued for a particular purpose, store it in a personal data vault, and only authorize access to that credential when she consents to the interaction. Additionally, Alice controls this credential at all times and can present it to any requesting platform: it isn’t limited to a single platform because it’s a credential she owns and controls. </p> What Comes Next  <p>With these kinds of interactions now possible, there’s a lot more we can do in the space, and plenty of new avenues unlocked:</p> DeFi   Currently, lending in DeFi is mostly overcollateralized so there’s a backstop in case of any market uncertainty. With credentials gained from a variety of on-chain and off-chain sources, undercollateralized lending with richer credit histories used as evidence is now possible. With additional information, risk can now be accurately assessed.  Additionally, permissioned trading and lending pools in DeFi are now possible for institutions, as you can accurately identify counterparties with enough assurance through credentialing.   NFTs and DeSoc   Currently, you have limited assurance levels on who you’re interacting with when buying NFTs. By assembling just the right amount of information through credentialing (such as social media accounts and other art-related connections), you know exactly who you’re buying from without having to solely rely on centralized platform verification processes.  Decentralized knowledge bases are now possible, as you can accurately assess the fact that a reputable author or creator is the one producing specialized content.  Decentralized identity and data also open up the possibility of exporting one’s social graph, including all connections, followers, posts, and more that can be portable and travel with users from platform to platform. &nbsp;   DAOs   Decentralized Identity will dramatically change the way DAOs operate, especially in the context of delegation. Your steward won't just be a public key, but a mix of on and off-chain information that makes them both qualified and trustworthy to earn your voting power.  DAO members would now also be able to demonstrate skills and earned certifications that travel with them to different DAOs. For example, in the case of a worker collective, each worker can attest to certifications that they’ve earned in order to assert that they are the most qualified for a job to be done.   <p>Decentralized identity isn’t the next big thing - but instead, it’s the necessary component in order to power a new future. </p><p>However, the future is quite closer than it seems.</p> <p>If you want to chat about decentralized identity or any related use-cases, check out our Discord server:</p><a href="http://discord.gg/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

             August 2022   
	 
		 
			 Tokenization is the first step for real-world assets in DeFi 
<p>Before delving into our newsletter, I would like to share with you a great announcement from our team:&nbsp;We are pleased to have integrated our solutions with Fireblocks&nbsp;– an enterprise-grade platform for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets, who serves over 1,300 financial institutions.&nbsp;This integration will enable Fireblocks to provide a turnkey tokenization solution for its customers&nbsp;with the ability to deploy and manage permissioned tokens such as digital securities, stablecoins and loyalty tokens.</p>
<p>We’re very excited about this partnership as tokenization continues to storm into the financial and business development strategies of financial institutions, and this kind of ready-to-use solutions will be the catalyst for the tokenization prosperity. However, while more financial instruments and real-world assets are being brought to blockchain,&nbsp;the full potential of tokenized securities lies post-tokenization.</p>
 Collateralization is currently the main DeFi use case 
<p>It allows users to easily obtain a loan with their cryptocurrency as a collateral from someone else in an investor pool. The whole process takes place on a DeFi platform, run via smart contracts, without any intermediary. However, the same can not be said for tokenized securities yet, due to compliance, valuation, and liquidity issues.</p>
<p>While the traditional finance concept of allowing borrowers to use something valuable as the guarantee to obtain a loan remains the same,&nbsp;in DeFi the trustee is replaced by smart contracts.&nbsp;Instead of middlemen performing manual operations, the codes themselves will execute actions when all conditions are met.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Collateralization of tokenized securities is coming<br>
 
<p>The pledge of tokenized assets is possible but more complicated, which explains why it is little used at the moment: These&nbsp;crypto-lending protocols work well because cryptos are very liquid, and the market prices are well known. It enables DeFi protocols to efficiently calculate the LTV (loan-to-value), and to automate liquidations in the event of nonpayment by the borrower or loss of value of the pledged asset. Indeed, even though cryptocurrencies have high liquidity, they are also volatile.</p>
<p>With security tokens, it is currently more difficult to determine the value of the token, and to get enough liquidity to reach the same automation level of the process. For sure, we have a type of token that is usually backed by the value of real-world assets, so they are less likely to fluctuate as much as they do with cryptos. As a result, liquidations should be less frequent. However, they will still need to be enforced if the borrower doesn’t pay back the debt.</p>
<p>Calculating net asset value (NAV) can be costly, lengthy, and difficult for issuers&nbsp;due to the nature of the underlying assets in general. Valuation service providers, such as our partner Inveniam, are needed in this case so that issuers can adequately and accurately assess their valuation and link this pricing data to their tokens. This will drastically help to use tokenized securities as collateral.</p>
<p>The other problem is the lack of liquidity. Liquidators will only guarantee that they will buy the assets if they get a good price, and if they can resell the tokenized asset on the secondary market. In the crypto market, these liquidations can be fully automated. For digital securities, there is no venue with enough liquidity yet. That is why&nbsp;Tokeny is working actively to interconnect liquidity providers, whether it is decentralized exchange protocols, regulated exchanges or digital trading desks.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Permissioned lending protocols to make DeFi compliant 
<p>Last but not least, it is mandatory for issuers to apply compliance rules in any operations with their tokens. As compliance rules are embedded in the token, the lending protocol will only work with eligible token holders and may also want to restrict its access to certain types of investors. For this, Tokeny already leverages the digital identity system&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_YIFjJk8kF0VZRWfj0LQ5EH-Ez9iFGtRmyvTvhmBYjKhoB-w0bszdfB9iSm4iD_ujP3Lh">ONCHAINID</a>&nbsp;to whitelist users. By using such a digital identity system, lending protocols can provide DeFi services to qualified users in a compliant manner, attract institutional investors, and increase the liquidity of tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The tokenization of assets is the first step in bringing more assets on-chain, leading to greater benefits and more use cases. Our vision is to see tokenized securities at the center of all value chains in the financial market. Isn’t it exciting?</p>

<p>Blockchain and mutual funds: the choice is about to explode</p>
<p>The use of blockchain technology is potentially set to challenge and have a far greater impact on the asset management industry than cryptos ever will. Investors’ savings and pensions will also be impacted, although many mutual fund holders will not even realise it.</p>

<p>Spring is a long-time friend to enterprise companies throughout the world. When Spring Boot came along in 2014, it greatly simplified configuring a Spring application. This led to widespread adoption and continued investment in related Spring projects.</p>
 
 
<p>One of my favorite Spring projects is Spring Security. In most cases, it simplifies web security to just a few lines of code. HTTP Basic, JDBC, JWT, OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0, you name it—Spring Security does it!</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice I didn’t mention SAML as an authentication type. That’s because I don’t recommend it. The specification for SAML 2.0 was published in March 2005, before smartphones or smart devices even existed. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is much easier for developers to use and understand. Using SAML in 2022 is like implementing a web service using WS-* instead of REST.</p>
 
 
<p>My recommendation: just use OIDC.</p>
 
 
<p>If you must use SAML with Spring Boot, this tutorial should make it quick and easy.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> (for Java 17)</p>

 What is SAML? 
 
 
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based way of doing web authentication and authorization. It works cross-domain, so SaaS applications and other enterprise software often support it.</p>
 
 
<p>Nick Gamb has an excellent overview in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6QSEqDJPo">A Developer’s Guide to SAML</a>.</p>
 
 
            
         
 
<p>If you want to learn how Spring Security implements SAML, please read its <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/login/index.html">SAML 2.0 Login docs</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add a SAML application on Okta 
 
 
<p>To begin, you’ll need an Okta developer account. You can create one at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com/signup</a> or install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, log in to your account and go to Applications &gt; Create App Integration. Select SAML 2.0 and click Next. Name your app something like <code>Spring Boot SAML</code> and click Next.</p>
 
 
<p>Use the following settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single sign on URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/okta</code></p>
 
 
<p>Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL: ✅ (the default)</p>
 
 
<p>Audience URI: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Then click Next. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app</p>
 
 
<p>This is an internal app that we have created</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Select Finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Okta will create your app, and you will be redirected to its Sign On tab. Scroll down to the SAML Signing Certificates and go to SHA-2 &gt; Actions &gt; View IdP Metadata. You can right-click and copy this menu item’s link or open its URL. Copy the resulting link to your clipboard. It should look something like the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https://dev-13337.okta.com/app/&lt;random-characters&gt;/sso/saml/metadata</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Go to your app’s Assignment tab and assign access to the Everyone group.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot app with SAML support 
 
 
<p>Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17. You can install it with SDKMAN:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The easiest way to do this tutorial is to clone the existing <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">Spring Boot example application</a> I created.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather start from scratch, you can create a brand-new Spring Boot app using <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a>. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Project: Gradle</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: 3.0.0 (SNAPSHOT)</p>
 
 
<p>Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Thymeleaf</p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also use <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=17&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.example.demo&amp;dependencies=web,security,thymeleaf">this URL</a> or HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==3.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
  dependencies==web,security,thymeleaf type==gradle-project \
  baseDir==spring-boot-saml | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you created a brand-new app, you’ll need to complete the following steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Add <code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HomeController.java</code> to populate the authenticated user’s information.</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.saml2.provider.service.authentication.Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", principal.getFirstAttribute("email"));
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/templates/home.html</code> file to render the user’s information.</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org"
      xmlns:sec="https://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Spring Boot and SAML&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are successfully logged in as &lt;span sec:authentication="name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your email address is &lt;span th:text="${emailAddress}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your authorities are &lt;span sec:authentication="authorities"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Your Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl th:each="userAttribute : ${userAttributes}"&gt;
    &lt;dt th:text="${userAttribute.key}"&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd th:text="${userAttribute.value}"&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;form th:action="@{/logout}" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;button id="logout" type="submit"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file to contain the metadata URI you copied in <a>Add a SAML application on Okta</a>. This value should end with <code>/sso/saml/metadata</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-metadata-uri&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, change <code>build.gradle</code> to add Spring Security SAML’s dependency:</p>
 
 
 <code>implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-saml2-service-provider'</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If you cloned from GitHub, you only need to update <code>application.yml</code> to include your metadata URI. You can remove the other properties as they may cause issues.</p>
 
 
 Run the app and authenticate 
 
<p>Run your Spring Boot app from your IDE or using the command line:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootRun</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and log in with the credentials you used to create your account.</p>
 
 
<p>You should see a successful result in your browser.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you try to log out, it won’t work. Let’s fix that.</p>
 
 
 
 Add a logout feature 
 
<p>Spring Security’s SAML support has a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/logout.html">logout feature</a> that takes a bit to configure. First, edit your application on Okta and navigate to General &gt; SAML Settings &gt; Edit.</p>
 
 
<p>Continue to the Configure SAML step and Show Advanced Settings. Before you can enable single logout, you’ll have to create and upload a certificate to sign the outgoing logout request.</p>
 
 
<p>You can create a private key and certificate using OpenSSL. Answer at least one of the questions with a value, and it should work.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout local.key -x509 -days 365 -out local.crt</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the generated files to your app’s <code>src/main/resources</code> directory. Configure <code>signing</code> and <code>singlelogout</code> in <code>application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              ...
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Upload the <code>local.crt</code> to your Okta app. Select Enable Single Logout and use the following values:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single Logout URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo</code></p>
 
 
<p>SP Issuer: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Finish configuring your Okta app, restart your Spring Boot app, and the logout button should work.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Customize authorities with Spring Security SAML 
 
<p>You might notice when you log in, the resulting page shows you have a <code>ROLE_USER</code> authority. However, when you assigned users to the app, you gave access to <code>Everyone</code>. You can configure your SAML app on Okta to send a user’s groups as an attribute. You can add other attributes like name and email too.</p>
 
 
<p>Edit your Okta app’s SAML settings and fill in the Group Attribute Statements section.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Name: <code>groups</code></p>
 
 
<p>Name format: <code>Unspecified</code></p>
 
 
<p>Filter: <code>Matches regex</code> and use <code>.*</code> for the value</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Just above, you can add other attribute statements. For instance:</p>
 








Name
Name format
Value




<p><code>email</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.email</code></p>


<p><code>firstName</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.firstName</code></p>


<p><code>lastName</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.lastName</code></p>



 
<p>Save these changes.</p>
 
 
<p>If you cloned the repo earlier, restart your app and log in to see your user’s groups as authorities.</p>
 
 
<p>If you created a Spring Boot app from scratch, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class that overrides the default configuration and uses a converter to translate the values in the <code>groups</code> attribute into Spring Security authorities.</p>

                groups.stream().map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new).forEach(authorities::add);
            } else {
                authorities.addAll(authentication.getAuthorities());
            }
            return new Saml2Authentication(principal, authentication.getSaml2Response(), authorities);
        };
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 






You might be able to remove <code>permitAll()</code> on the favicon because that was <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/11657">recently fixed in Spring Security</a>.



 
 
<p>Finally, modify your <code>build.gradle</code> file to force the latest version of Open SAML that works with Spring Security 6.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases/" }
}

dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-core:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-api:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-impl:4.1.1"
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now, if you restart your app and log in, you should see your user’s groups as authorities. Huzzah!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Add support for Auth0 
 
 
<p>Did you know Auth0 provides support for SAML apps too? Auth0 makes it even easier to configure because its default web applications support OIDC and SAML.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Sign up for an Auth0 account</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/api/auth/login?redirectTo=dashboard">log in</a> with your existing one. Navigate to Applications &gt; Create Application &gt; Regular Web Applications &gt; Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the name to <code>Spring Boot SAML</code>. Add <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/auth0</code> as an Allowed Callback URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom, expand Advanced Settings, and go to Endpoints. Copy the value of the SAML Metadata URL. You’ll need this soon. Select Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>If you configured your app to use these values, authentication would work, but you wouldn’t be able to log out. Scroll to the top of the page, select Addons, and enable SAML.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the (commented) JSON to be as follows:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "logout": {
    "callback": "http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo",
    "slo_enabled": true
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Enable.</p>
 
 
<p>Change your <code>application.yml</code> to use <code>auth0</code> instead of <code>okta</code> and copy your SAML Metadata URL into it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          auth0:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-auth0-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, and you should be able to log in with Auth0.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You might notice that the email and authorities are not calculated correctly. This is because the claim names have changed with Auth0. Update <code>SecurityConfiguration#groupsConverter()</code> to allow both Okta and Auth0 names for groups.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>private Converter&lt;OpenSaml4AuthenticationProvider.ResponseToken, Saml2Authentication&gt; groupsConverter() {

    ...

    return (responseToken) -&gt; {
        ...
        List&lt;String&gt; groups = principal.getAttribute("groups");
        // if groups is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (groups == null) {
            groups = principal.getAttribute("http://schemas.auth0.com/roles");
        }
        ...
    };
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make Auth0 populate a user’s groups, navigate to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules and create a new Rule. Choose the Empty rule template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Groups claim</code>, replace the <code>Script</code> content with the following, and Save.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify <code>HomeController</code> to allow Auth0’s email attribute name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        String email = principal.getFirstAttribute("email");
        // if email is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (email == null) {
            email = principal.getFirstAttribute("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress");
        }
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", email);
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, log in, and everything should work as expected.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Support Okta and Auth0 
 
 
<p>You can also support both Okta and Auth0! Modify your <code>application.yml</code> to be as follows, and Spring Security will prompt you for which one to log in with. The <code>&amp;name</code> and <code>*name</code> values are used to set and retrieve blocks of YAML to avoid repetition.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          auth0:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-auth0-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials: &amp;signing-credentials
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout: &amp;logout-settings
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-okta-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials: *signing-credentials
            singlelogout: *logout-settings</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you restart your app with these settings, you’ll be prompted for both when you first hit <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy to production 
 
 
<p>One quick way to see this app working in a production environment is to deploy it to Heroku. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Install the Heroku CLI</a> and create an account to begin. Then, follow the steps below to prepare and deploy your app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new app on Heroku using <code>heroku create</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a <code>system.properties</code> file in the root directory of your app to force Java 17:</p>
 
 
 <code>java.runtime.version=17</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>Procfile</code> that specifies how to run your app:</p>
 
 
 web: java -Xmx256m -jar build/libs/*.jar --server.port=$PORT 
 
 
 
 
<p>Commit your changes:</p>
 
 
 git add .
git commit -m "Add Heroku configuration" 
 
 
 
 
<p>Set the Gradle task to build your app:</p>
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set GRADLE_TASK="bootJar"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy to production using Git:</p>
 
 
 <code>git push heroku main</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>For authentication to work with SAML, you’ll need to update your Okta and Auth0 apps to use your Heroku app’s URL in place of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, wherever applicable.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about Spring Boot and Spring Security 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to use Spring Security to add SAML authentication. Integration was as simple as configuring a metadata URI and only became more complicated when you added a logout feature. The ability to convert groups from your identity provider to authorities is pretty slick too!</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">@oktadev/okta-spring-boot-example</a> repository. You can find the Auth0 example in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/auth0">auth0</a> branch. See the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/okta+auth0">okta+auth0</a> branch for the example that uses both identity providers.</p>

<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> 's expert team has been building cutting-edge Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity technology. We created this complete guide on decentralized identity to explain what it is, how it works, and its many benefits to organizations, individuals, and developers. </p><p>TL;DR</p>  Certificate fraud, fake credentials, slow verification processes, and data breaches are just some of the problems associated with our current centralized digital identity systems that decentralized identity technology can solve.  Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that has the following benefits for:  <p>1) Organizations: Issuing organizations can provide fraud-proof credentials and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity of credentials. &nbsp;</p><p>2) Individuals: Fully own and control their digital identity and credentials without relying on any third party to prove their claims.</p><p>3) Developers: Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and inefficient authentication processes.</p>  A decentralized identity system is made up of 3 pillars: blockchain, Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and decentralized identifiers (DIDs).  Decentralized identity technology can be applied to a growing number of use cases including supply chain traceability, issuing fraud-proof certifications, and managing employee IDs.  <p> Introduction</p><p>Not-so-fun facts: </p>  In 2021, almost 1 in 10 qualified nurses who were issued new licenses last year <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1084897499/nurses-are-waiting-months-for-licenses-as-hospital-staffing-shortages-spread">waited six months or longer</a> before they could start working. More than a third of these 226,000 registered nurses and licensed practical nurses waited at least three months.  Supply chain fraud is an increasingly global business risk for organizations. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners say that <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/Markets/supply-chain-fraud.pdf">83.5% of fraud cases</a> it surveyed in 2016 featured asset misappropriation schemes including fraudulent billing and disbursements.  <a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/">71.1 million people</a> fall victim to cyber crimes every year and individuals lose an average of US$4,476  <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">96% of baby boomers, 94% of Gen X, and 93% of Gen Z</a> don’t trust social media platforms to protect their data  <p>But don’t get too down because there’s hope! As decentralized identity technology gains more adoption, people and organizations will be able to share data securely.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What is a Decentralized Identity? <p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.</p><p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity include: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  <p>How decentralized identity benefits organizations</p>  Allows organizations to verify information instantly without having to contact the issuing party, like a driver’s licensing organization or university for example, to ensure that IDs, certificates, or documents are valid. Traditional, manual verification processes take weeks to months which slows down recruitment and processing times while using a lot of financial and human resources. Imagine being able to instantly verify someone’s credentials in seconds by scanning a QR code or running it through a user-friendly <a href="https://verifier.dock.io/">credential verifier tool</a>.  Enables issuing organizations to conveniently provide Verifiable Credentials to people and prevent fraud in a way that greatly reduces costs and increases efficiency.   <p>How decentralized identity benefits individuals</p>  Because the user has full control and ownership of their identity and credentials, they are able to prove their claims without depending on any party.  People can decide which information they want to reveal to specific parties, such as a government or employer.  No party can take away people’s ID once they are stored on their mobile digital identity wallets.  People can easily create and manage their decentralized identity with user-friendly platforms like Dock.  <p>A verifiable proof of existence is often needed for us to exercise our right as citizens to access essential services like healthcare, banking, and education. Unfortunately, 1 billion people in the world <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">don’t have an official proof of identity</a>. With decentralized identity systems, all you need is an internet connection and a smart device which are becoming more accessible in emerging economies.</p> Issue Fraud-Proof Credentials Efficiently at Lower Costs <p>If an organization like a university or training program is issuing credentials, they can do so securely by making credentials fraud proof. Fake diplomas are a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/diploma-mills-marketplace-fake-degrees-1.4279513">billion-dollar industry</a> and it’s very easy for people to forge a certificate. This creates many risks for companies and impacts people’s safety as many people who get fake credentials work in health care or more risky field work operating heavy machinery. Even back in the 80s, there were approximately <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">5,000 fake doctors</a> in the US and it is now believed that there will be many more. </p><p>By using decentralized identity technology, organizations help prevent fraud to ensure that you are hiring qualified people with authentic credentials. Let’s say a company is looking for a project manager and they have a practice of hiring efficiently to get the best candidates. Many organizations take a long time to recruit and verify the credentials of candidates resulting in them losing out on great prospects as high-quality applicants often get multiple offers. </p><p>Here is how the company leverages decentralized identity technology to hire efficiently:</p>  Mary, the job applicant, manages her decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials on her phone with a Dock Wallet and wants to apply for the company looking for a project manager.  A school issues her a project management certificate as a Verifiable Credential that she stores on her digital wallet and this credential can’t be faked.  The company makes a job offer and they just need to check that her certificate is authentic.  The company requests her data and she is prompted on her phone to give authorization to the company to show her certificate  The company receives a QR code and simply scans it to instantly confirm that her program management certificate is authentic.  They offer Mary the job.  <p>The traditional, manual verification process would normally take weeks to even months.</p> What Is Self-Sovereign Identity? The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are Verifiable Credentials, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identifiers.<p>The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with <a href="https://blog.dock.io/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity are: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personally identifiable information.   <p>A growing number of organizations in government and in the private sector around the world are leveraging decentralized identity technology, including <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">the EU</a>. As the world moves more and more towards Web3, which is the next evolution of the internet, an increasing number of people will take back control of their data through decentralization and blockchain.</p><p>Problems and Risks With Centralized and Federated Digital Identity Systems</p>3 models of ID management: centralized identity, federated identity, and Self-Sovereign Identity<p>Centralized Identity Management: Administrative Control by a Single Authority or Hierarchy</p><p>Almost all of our digital identities are connected through services, devices, and apps.</p><p>Our personal information like our credit card, name, and address is being stored and shared on an increasing number of websites while our data is often used by websites to track people to display targeted content and advertise. As people access more websites and apps, the more accounts they have to create and manage, which creates a bad user experience. </p><p>Centralized systems often make digital identities vulnerable to cyber attacks and privacy breaches, including identity theft. Because so much user data is stored in one place, hackers could access a large amount of confidential information. </p><p>Federated Identity Management<br>Because of the problems that resulted from the centralized digital identity model, federated identity was developed. A federated identity allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps. Signing in this way is also referred to as &nbsp;“single sign-on” tools.</p><p>While this method of signing in is more convenient for people because they don’t have to create a whole new account, the main downside is that if your password gets stolen, all of the other sites you used with that single sign-on account <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/single-sign-on-facebook-google-apple/">could be exposed</a>. You would have to trust both companies that offer single sign-on to protect your privacy and security as well as all of the third-party websites that offer these options to implement them correctly. In recent years, there have been several cases of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gk73/google-fired-dozens-for-data-misuse">Google</a> misusing information, including Facebook user data to manipulate people’s moods and Google employees leveraging their positions to steal, leak, or abuse data they may have access to. </p><p>More aspects of our lives require verification of our identities in order to apply for a mortgage, buy a car, or sign up for a new service. People have little to no choice but to surrender their privacy to use the things they want.</p><p>Thankfully, decentralized identity solutions can effectively solve many of these privacy and data breach problems. Decentralized identity gives people full ownership and control of their personal information and credentials.</p> Centralized Identity vs. Decentralized Identity Management <p>Centralized Identity Management</p><p>Decentralized Identity Management</p><p>Increased risk of data breaches from storing data in a centralized system</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets, which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Data may be collected, stored, and shared with other parties without your knowledge</p><p>Data is only shared when you give authorization</p><p>Data is owned and controlled by organizations, apps, and services</p><p>Data is fully owned and controlled by the user</p> Establishing Standards for Decentralized Identity <p>There are many organizations working to standardize and shape the field of decentralized identity. These are the key organizations: </p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>: An engineering-driven organization focused on developing the foundational elements necessary to establish an open ecosystem for decentralized identity and ensure interoperability between all participants.  <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>: The mission of the W3C Digital Identity Community Group is to identify and resolve real world identity issues, to explore and build a more secure trusted digital identity ecosystem on the internet for people, organizations, and things. Their work focuses on the ecosystem’s scalability, interoperability, mobility, security, and privacy.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>: An open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet.   Key Benefits of Decentralized Identity Solutions<br> You can sign in securely without a password for platforms that use Web3 ID technology.<p>These are the key advantages of decentralized identity for: </p><p>Organizations: Issue and verify fraud-proof credentials and documents instantly and reduce the risk of data breaches by storing less user information </p><p>Individuals: Own and control your digital identity with more privacy</p><p>Developers: Secure authentication sign-in for app users that eliminates the need for passwords and privacy-preserving user verification is used</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>Decentralized identity solutions come with many advantages for organizations including: </p>  Speed up the verification process at a much lower cost  Prevents credential fraud  Improved data security with public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt information safely  Reducing the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less user data  <p>Being able to verify credentials instantly is beneficial for a variety of use cases including speeding up the hiring process and reducing the risk of hiring someone without the appropriate credentials. </p><p>Many organizations around the world must follow regulations on how they collect, store, and use user data. If they don’t follow the regulations, they can face penalties and sanctions for breaking the rules or data breaches. </p><p>The impact of data breaches on organizations:</p>  The average cost of a data breach for a small business is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$108,000 a year</a>  The average time to identify a data breach inside an organization is <a href="https://telecoms.com/498656/206-days-ibms-estimate-on-how-long-it-takes-to-find-a-security-breach/">206 days and another 73 days</a> to fix it  Small businesses are the victims of<a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/10-small-business-cyber-security-statistics-that-you-should-know-and-how-to-improve-them/#:~:text=43%25%20of%20all%20data%20breaches,attack%20during%20the%20previous%20year."> 43% of data breaches</a>  For large corporations, the average cost of a data breach is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$204 per employee</a> while for SMBs it costs an average of US$3,533 per employee   Benefits for Individuals <p>Decentralized identities enable people to:</p>  Fully own and control their data  Prevent device and data tracking as they browse websites  Choose who they want to share their relevant information to  Prevent the spread of their data without their knowledge   <p>A decentralized digital wallet can be used on a phone to securely store your digital identity and credentials with encryption. This approach conceals data which greatly reduces the risk of credential tracking, hacks, and gaining unauthorized access to steal or monetize people’s data. With a decentralized identity, someone has to give authorization to share information when it is requested. </p><p>Verizon’s email hacking statistics show that phishing attempts are responsible <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">for 80% of malware infections and almost 95% of all espionage attacks.</a> Also, Facebook has had many data breaches since it was launched. In one instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/facebook-records-exposed-server/#:~:text=In%20the%20researchers'%20write%2Dup,anyone%20to%20access%20the%20data.">540 million records were exposed in a Facebook data leak</a>, which included Facebook IDs, passwords, Facebook friends, photos, and check-ins. This data is a gold mine for hackers planning phishing scams and social engineering attacks.</p><p>With a decentralized identity, passwords don’t exist. Rather cryptographic keys are used to authenticate users when they sign in. You could sign into a website with your Decentralized Identifier data instead of a user name. Basically, you only need to share the information that’s relevant and necessary to access each service. </p> Benefits for Developers <p>Decentralized identity solutions help developers by: </p>  Creating opportunities to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and an inefficient authentication process that will enhance the user experience  Being able to safely request data directly from users while maintaining their privacy  <p>Imagine shopping on sites that don’t need to build up and store personal details including credit card information. Instead, your verified payment and shipping information is securely transmitted from your decentralized identity wallet. </p><p>Or if someone wants to apply for a loan application, instead of finding all the paperwork, they can give permission to the bank to instantly receive all of the relevant information to show that they are eligible for a loan, including their salary, address, and name. </p> How Decentralized Identity Works<br> <p>A decentralized identity system has these main elements: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. <br>  Decentralized Identity Wallet: An app that allows users to create their decentralized identifiers and manage their Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Decentralized Identifier (DID): A unique identifier on the blockchain made up of a string of letters and numbers that contains details like the public key and verification information. <br>  Verifiable Credential (VC): A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. These are the main parties in the VC system:    Holder: A user who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives the Verifiable Credential.  Issuer: The organization that signs a Verifiable Credential with their private key and issues it to the holder.   Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.  The main parties in the Verifiable Credentials system are the holders, issuers, and verifiers.<p>Let’s go into more detail about how each of these elements works individually and then how they all work together. </p> Decentralized Identity on Blockchain <p>Blockchain is a digitally distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. Blockchain’s design allows everyone in the network to know that the information contained is true and valid. Each block has unique data and the blocks combine to complete a chain. The nodes execute functions like sending and receiving information. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p>  Decentralized: Public permissionless blockchains use a peer-to-peer network that anyone can join. No one can change or manipulate the way a blockchain should act. <br>  A blockchain acts as a distributed ledger: The digital database runs on a distributed network of computers around the world which makes it hard for someone or an organization to change or manipulate information. In contrast, centralized systems make it easier for someone to change or manipulate information without anyone else knowing because they are the only ones who have access to the records.   <p>But with blockchain technology, every node in the network gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that it hasn’t been tampered with. When the data is verified, every node adds this information to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p>  Immutable: Each block on a chain contains information from the previous block and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. There is a hash on each block that acts like a digital fingerprint. If the hash changes, the network will know it has been tampered with.<br>  Robust security: The blockchain enables digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions to protect people’s identities from breaches and thefts.  <p>It’s important to note that anyone can join public permissionless blockchains. Permissioned blockchains don't allow anyone to join without authorization because some use cases require that only specific people should access the network. With a permissioned blockchain, a user would need permission from the network owner to become part of the network to access, read, and/or write information on the blockchain. </p><p>Here is how each party uses the blockchain in a decentralized identity system: </p>  Holder: Owner of the Verifiable Credential (e.g. driver’s license) has their public DID on the blockchain.  Issuer: The issuer’s public DID and associated public key is on the blockchain. When an issuer, like a licensing organization, provides a credential to a holder like a driver’s license, the issuer signs the credential with their private key.  Verifier: A verifier like an on-demand driving company can check the blockchain to ensure that the licensing department that they trust did in fact issue the license and who it was issued to. <br>  <p>The blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. The blockchain establishes a basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry (or records) of:</p>  All DIDs  Proof of credentials issued (if the credential is anchored to demonstrate proof of existence and authenticity)  Public cryptographic keys  Revocation registries  <p>The identity information is not stored on the blockchain but rather on the holder’s digital wallet. The credentials issued using the Dock blockchain are stored off-chain, usually in someone’s decentralized digital wallet app.</p> What Are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?<br> <p>Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work and their importance.</p><p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID): </p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored on the blockchain and independent of any organization  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over them  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Does not contain personal data or wallet information  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is a decentralized identifier example that can be managed in a Dock wallet:</p><p>A DID can be used to find connected DID documents that contain relevant information to enable use cases like sign-in, data encryption, and communication. </p><p>Right now, most of us use information like emails, passwords, and user names as identifiers to access websites, apps, and services. But these identifiers have often resulted in: </p>  Our personal information being hacked  Identity theft  Our data being shared with other parties without our knowledge  Making it harder for someone to manage all of the logins  Being at the mercy of service providers who can revoke these identifiers at any time  <p>But DIDs solve many of these problems. They enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. A party, either an individual or organization, can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. DIDs are like different personas that people can create. </p><p>Right now, many people use LinkedIn to show their professional experience and information. But because they don’t want employers to see their personal photos and interests, they make a separate Facebook profile. A DID is similar in that you can make different profiles for different purposes.</p><p>For example, you can have a DID for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in to shopping websites or showing you are of legal age to buy alcohol  Professional purposes where you can use this DID to show educational or professional credentials to an employer  Accessing different cryptocurrency-related apps and services that need to verify your identity for your trading and investment activities  You can create as many decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as you want and manage them in your digital identity wallet. How Do You Create Decentralized Identifiers? Mike explains how to use Dock Certs to create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential.<p>With a Dock Wallet and Dock Certs, you can create a DID by following these steps:</p>  <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Create an account on Dock Certs and login</a>. If you’re just getting familiar with the platform, you can use Test mode.  <p>2. Click Create Verifiable Credential on the top right.</p><p>3. Create the issuer profile (a university for example) and you can leave the Key Type to the default setting. Then select Create a DID.</p><p>4. Choose among the basic template options, select the DID, click Continue on the top right. </p><p>5. You can add credential recipients manually one by one or in bulk with the Import CSV option.</p><p>6. If you add someone manually, you will enter details like this example below where we are identifying someone by their employee number. Once you fill in all of the details, click Add Recipient.</p><p>7. The information will appear like this:</p><p>8. If you want to do bulk issuance, you can also import a CSV file. Download the sample template, fill it in, and upload it.</p><p>9. The next option is to Persist the credential which means that Dock will securely store the credential on our database (but NOT on the blockchain).</p><p>If you persist the credential, there will be a QR code that shows up on the PDF where the recipient can simply scan the QR code with their Dock Wallet app to import the credential in their wallet.</p><p>10. There is an option to add a registry (record) on the blockchain allowing this credential to be revoked.</p><p>11. You can anchor the credential which will add a hash of the credential (like a digital fingerprint) you issue on the Dock blockchain. This allows someone to verify when and who created it. </p><p>12. &nbsp;Next click Issue Credentials on the top right and you will be able to download the credentials in JSON and PDF formats. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.</p><p>The Basic PDF credential will look like this:</p><p>It’s important to know that if you don’t persist or download the credential, you can’t get it back. </p><p>13. The issuer can email the PDF and JSON files to the recipient. Soon we will be releasing the Relay Service to automatically send the credential to the recipient's wallet.</p><p>14. If there is no QR code on the PDF file (because the credential wasn’t persisted), then the recipient has to download and import the JSON file. To do this select Credentials, click on the + sign on the top right corner, and select the JSON file.</p><p>15. The credential will immediately appear in the Dock Wallet.</p> Difference Between Public Key and Private Key Cryptography With an Example Every newly created DID comes with one or many private key and public keys.<p>Each DID comes with one or many private and public keys: </p>  Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign documents. It is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.  Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.   <p>You can have multiple private-public key pairs, and it’s good practice to generate new public keys when sharing information with a different party. This can be compared to using the same password for 10 different websites. It’s not safe to do this for security reasons. It’s better to have different and long complex passwords for all sites. Similarly, it’s better to generate a new public key for each party you share information with. </p><p>Example of how private and public keys would be used</p><p>Let’s say there’s a health and safety training organization that provides certification for construction safety and this course is a requirement for workers to get a job with a construction company. Here is how decentralized identity helps prevent fraud and enables organizations to save a lot of time and resources issuing and verifying credentials:</p>  Carl finishes the program and the training organization requests to connect with his digital identity wallet  When Carl authorizes the training organization to connect, the wallet shares his public DID in order for them to issue the credential.  The training organization signs the digital certificate of completion with their private key and issues the credential. Their public key is stored on the blockchain. The organization can easily and efficiently issue many credentials at the same time with a decentralized identity platform like Dock.  Carl would hold his credential on a digital wallet on his phone that he can bring everywhere.  Carl gives the construction company authorization to see his credentials without showing any unnecessary information about himself like his address and date of birth.  The company instantly verifies the authenticity of his credentials by scanning a QR code and not having to contact the issuer at all because the training organization’s public key is on the blockchain.  <p>Traditional certification verification processes would normally take a few weeks before he can start working because the construction company would have to manually contact the issuer. The previous verification process would be time-consuming and expensive. </p> Layers in the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem  Verifiable Credentials Nick explains the benefits of Verifiable Credentials.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. A few of many examples of information that can be issued as Verifiable Credentials:</p>  Driver’s licenses  Passports  Professional certifications  Employee status  <p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials.</p>An example of a university degree issued as a Verifiable Credential that is stored on a Dock wallet.<p>Examples of Decentralized Identity Verification</p><p>Maintaining privacy is a major benefit of Verifiable Credentials. Let’s say there’s an on-demand food delivery company that requires applicants to have a valid driver’s license. The company can instantly check the Verifiable Credential to confirm that an applicant has a valid driver’s license. A verifiable presentation would allow an applicant, the holder, to show their license number without sharing unnecessary information like their full name or address. </p><p>In another example, a club’s staff member can scan the QR code of the holder’s Verifiable Credential to ensure they are at least 18 years old. The public DID of the government’s licensing department is on the blockchain which allows the club to verify the authenticity of the Verifiable Credential because the club trusts the department that issued the credential. The Verifiable Credentials create trust between the parties and guarantee the authenticity of the data and claims without actually storing data on the blockchain. &nbsp;</p><p>In another situation, Sofia just moved to Canada without a physical copy of her university degree and she needs to prove her field of study to receive a job offer. Her university then issues her a Verifiable Credential, which is the degree, that is associated with her DID and she can store this in her digital wallet. Sofia then presents the credential to the employer who can instantly verify its authenticity.</p><p>4. Decentralized Digital Identity Web3 Wallet</p><p>A decentralized digital identity wallet enables people to securely store, manage, and share DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. It’s comparable to a physical wallet that holds various IDs and claims about yourself like service cards, bank cards, and licenses. The Web3 wallet will store verified credential details like citizenship, employment, name, and address to prove eligibility, identity, or complete a transaction.</p><p>A mobile identity wallet stores information on the phone rather than a browser’s storage or cloud. The digital wallet allows people to access apps and services without revealing personal information. DIDs also prevent your devices from being tracked and correlated (data may be traced back to someone's identity or online behavior). Verifiers can connect to the user’s Web3 wallet and request data while the user always chooses when to give permission to share data. </p><p>Let’s say Anna wants to sign up for a cryptocurrency trading platform that requires a legal ID to access the site. </p>  The trading platform uses <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Dock’s Web3 ID</a> which allows users to sign into the platform in a way that preserves their privacy  <p>2. Anna uses her decentralized identity wallet, Dock’s wallet, to sign in and the platform requests a credential</p><p>3. Anna scans a QR code and authorizes the website to instantly verify her credential</p><p>4. Once she is verified, Anna can simply sign in with Web3 ID rather than having to create a new account and save another user name and password</p><p>A decentralized identity wallet allows you to have full control over who can access your data without providing any more details than necessary.</p> Decentralized Identity Use Cases <p>Here are just a few of many examples of how decentralized identity technology can solve many problems that result from traditional verification processes and centralized identity management systems in a variety of industries. </p><p>Use case</p><p>Current problem</p><p>Decentralized identity solution</p><p>Health and safety training</p><p>People can easily make fake certificates and in many cases this puts other people and organizations at risk when you have workers in jobs that they aren’t qualified for, especially medical doctors or jobs where that require heavy machinery operation.</p><p>Certification organizations can conveniently issue fraud-proof digital credentials at a lower cost than current traditional, manual processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Enhancing traceability in the food source supply chain</p><p>There are recurring foodborne illnesses that are hard to contain when contaminated food can’t be traced back to its origin.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Regulators are requiring more and more proofs about the origin of products, carbon footprint, use of polluting materials, and not using slave labour, which is very difficult to do.</p><p>Improving traceability in the food supply chain with decentralized identity technology can help prevent the spread of foodborne illness as the data of the contaminated food batch is tracked on blockchain and can be easily traced back to its origin.</p><p>Reducing counterfeit products</p><p>Companies lose a lot of money from product knock-offs and many customers are unknowingly buying fake products&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors join a platform where product data are tracked on the blockchain. Customers can use an app to scan a product QR code to verify that they’re buying an authentic product.</p><p>Financial services</p><p>The verification process to determine eligibility for a loan is time-consuming for the financial institution and the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine applying for a loan and quickly being vetted by banks by only sharing the information that is relevant and removing the majority of manual verification. This could reduce costs and the application time from weeks to days. The bank <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/universal-ledger-agent.md?mc_cid=6984003f25">Rabobank is&nbsp; exploring decentralized identity</a> to reduce mortgage application times.</p><p>Employee ID management</p><br><p>Organizations could issue digital credentials around a person’s role and department that are saved in an employee’s Web3 wallet on their phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Online shopping</p><br><p>Someone could verify their identity on an online store with their DID, which contains the necessary data to buy online including the shopper’s address and credit card information.&nbsp;</p> Summary of Key Terms<br> <p>Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.</p><p>Centralized identity management: Administrative control by a single authority or Hierarchy.</p><p>Decentralized digital identity wallet: Enables people to securely store, manage, and share DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personally identifiable information.</p><p>Decentralized identity: A type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.</p><p>Digital identity: The body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online, including search history and user names.</p><p>Federated identity management: ​​Allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps.</p><p>Holder: A user who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives the Verifiable Credential.</p><p>Issuer: The organization that signs a Verifiable Credential with their private key and issues it to the holder.</p><p>Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign documents.

This term is often used interchangeably with the term “decentralized identity.”</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.</p><p>Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.</p> Conclusion <p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to own, and control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.

 The Central Bank of Ireland Publishes AML Bulletin, Highlighting the Mistakes VASPs Make While Registering  The Bulletin primarily covers the critical issues with VASP registrations in Ireland and the bank’s expectations with VASP applications. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- In its recent AML Bulletin, the Central Bank of Ireland highlighted several issues with the VASP registration applications.</blockquote><blockquote>- VASPS that are offering or planning to offer services to Irish customers, both individuals and institutions, have been required to register with the Central Bank of Ireland since April last&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Central Bank also made it clear that it only ensures AML/CFT compliance among VASPs and plays no role in consumer protection.</blockquote><p>On July 11th, the Central Bank of Ireland <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/regulation/how-we-regulate/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism/legislation/anti-money-laundering-bulletin-on-virtual-asset-service-providers-july-2022.pdf">issued a bulletin</a> outlining anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) rules for the virtual asset service providers (VASPs).</p> What’s the Bulletin all&nbsp;About? <p>The Bulletin primarily covers the critical issues with VASP registrations in Ireland and the bank’s expectations with VASP applications.</p> Guide firms <p>It is meant to guide firms to strengthen their VASP application by avoiding the common AML/CFT pitfalls.</p> Prevent financial crimes <p>The regulation set forth by the Central Bank aims to prevent financial crime while supporting innovation in the virtual assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>“We seek to regulate for a rapidly evolving financial system so that the opportunities presented by the current unprecedented period of change and innovation can be realized for citizens and the economy,” said Tommy Hannafin, Head of Anti-Money Laundering Division Central Bank of&nbsp;Ireland.</p> The Key&nbsp;Issues <p>Since April last year, VASPs wishing to offer services in Ireland must comply with the relevant AML/CFT obligations and apply to the Central Bank for registration.</p><p>Currently, the Bank assesses the registration application and provides feedback on the applicants’ proposed AML/CFT frameworks.</p><p>With the “Anti-Money Laundering Bulletin,” the Central Bank aims to assist VASPs in strengthening their applications and frameworks by outlining the critical issues identified during the assessment process.</p><p>The Central Bank identified that several VASP registration applications have insufficient information.</p><p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of applications had a lack of understanding and compliance with essential AML/CFT obligations.</p><p>This, coupled with significant control weaknesses, meant many applicants couldn’t meet their AML/CFT obligations.</p><p>And a firm will “only” be registered when the Bank is satisfied that the firm can meet its AML/CFT obligations on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</p><p>The Bank also reminded that a failure to register by firms undertaking VASP activities might result in significant criminal and administrative sanctions.</p><p>Furthermore, registered VASPs will be subject to a supervisory levy, in line with what other financial institutions have to face in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>When it comes to developing AML/CFT policies, controls, and procedures, the Bank pointed to several recurring issues, including:</p><p>1. Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”)</p><p>2. Transaction Monitoring</p><p>3. Suspicious Transaction Reporting</p><p>4. Financial Sanctions</p><p>5. Record&nbsp;Keeping</p><p>6. Assurance Testing</p><p>According to Buletin, Customer Due Diligence involves more than just verifying a customer’s identity.</p><p>Firms are also required to collect and assess all relevant information to ensure they know their customers, if the customer is a Politically Exposed Person (“PEP”), and understands the purpose of their&nbsp;account.</p><p>However, the Central Bank clarified that it only supervises VASPs for AML/CFT purposes, and its mandate “does not extend to consumer protection.”</p> Gemini — First to Receive Authorization After Bulletin was Published <p>About a week after the Bulletin was released, the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini became the first VASP to receive approval from the&nbsp;bank.</p><p>The authorization allowed Gemini to offer crypto trading services in the Irish market to individuals and institutions.</p><p>The Bank’s approval means Gemini meets high compliance standards for AML and&nbsp;CFT.</p> Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing <p>The Central Bank of Ireland is a gatekeeper in Ireland’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF).</p><p>It seeks to ensure that regulated financial service providers have the necessary risk and control frameworks in place in order to minimize the risk of the use of their products or services by criminals for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-central-bank-of-ireland-publishes-aml-bulletin-highlighting-the-mistakes-vasps-make-while-e41c16850f9f">The Central Bank of Ireland Publishes AML Bulletin, Highlighting the Mistakes VASPs Make While…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Contractor Fraud and the Rise of Remote Work 
<p>Many organizations require the use of contractors, known as third parties. Managing these non-employees through the HR system, the authoritative identity source for their IT ecosystem can be burdensome. In addition, third-party individuals often require access to organizational resources such as shared tools, applications, or data sets to provide critical services.</p>
<p>The issue is that this access is usually for a limited period. Third parties present challenges and bring additional risks, such as ensuring that access is managed correctly and, when required, deprovisioned quickly. With the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerns have only been exacerbated.</p>
<p>Many companies assume that virtually checking a photo of a new contractor’s driver’s license and passport ensures that they are always the person logging in and working from home every day. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily the case. The increase in remote work in the last year has made it easier than ever for fraudsters to attack your organization.</p>
 How Does Contractor Fraud Happen? 
<p>Let’s look at how identity fraud happens in an organization: When a new contractor gets hired, they receive access to numerous company resources like email and Slack. To gain access to these resources, they will likely use an active directory username and password as well as 2FA like a one-time code tool.</p>
<p>What happens if this contractor decides to outsource some or all of their work? The employee will provide a third-party outsourcer with their usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes. This can be done in seconds on collaboration tools like Whatsapp and Slack. Whether this person simply found someone cheaper to do their work, or they are getting paid by a third party to let them into the organization to steal intellectual property, this could have detrimental security consequences for your organization.</p>
<p>For example, your company likely did a thorough background check of your current employees and contractors. However, you did not do a background check of the subcontractor. This means that this individual could have a questionable background that is not suitable to work at your company. Your company resources and knowledge are now vulnerable to the will of the subcontractor.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Improve Third-Party Access Governance? 
<p>The reality is that nearly all organizations have a variety of these third-party individuals who need access to infrastructure, applications, and data. 1Kosmos improves the security of third-party access with our distributed digital identity platform that is both <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> certified.</p>
<p>The benefit of onboarding contractors with 1Kosmos BlockID is the highest degree of identity assurance. When contractors are bound to their proofed identities with 1Kosmos, they have identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. In practice, contractors can utilize their secure mobile device for physical or logical authentication and step-up authentication required for privileged access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity. Overall, organizations will eliminate the risk of contractor fraud and extra security exposures contractors introduce.</p>

<p>Grazie all’innovazione delle proprie soluzioni di firma, anche quest’anno InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” pubblicata a luglio 2022. Questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader internazionali nel segmento di Firma Digitale.</p>



<p>La firma elettronica si sta avvicinando sempre di più al concetto di Commodity ed è sempre più spesso offerta come funzionalità di base nelle piattaforme di gestione documentale e workflow approvativi. Molte organizzazioni che in passato hanno acquistato e implementato la firma elettronica all’interno dei loro processi stanno rivalutando l’investimento fatto a favore di soluzioni in grado di garantire maggiore affidabilità, sicurezza e compliance. </p>



<p>In Europa, l’adozione di questo tipo di soluzioni è stata maggiormente complessa, soprattutto tra il 2020 e il 2022, in quanto le organizzazioni sono diventate più sensibili ai requisiti legali e normativi per ridurre i rischi di frode e hanno avuto la necessità di integrare le applicazioni precedentemente implementate con fornitori di servizi fiduciari specifici per ogni Paese.</p>



<p>Tra le maggiori complessità va citata quella di avere la certezza rispetto all’identità degli interlocutori di business nei processi di approvazione e firma dei documenti: le funzioni legate all’identificazione degli utenti sono sempre più importanti in quanto spesso richieste dal punto di vista normativo nei casi d’uso B2C e per le transazioni ad alto rischio. Queste funzioni possono includere l’autenticazione forte degli utenti, la verifica dell’identità, l’integrazione di Digital Identity Wallet o l’uso di certificati digitali emessi dauna Certification Authority. In questo scenario la rilevanza strategica dei Qualified Trust Service Provider (qTSP) e delle piattaforme di onboarding è aumentata considerevolmente, rendendo player come InfoCert il naturale interlocutore per la realizzazione di progetti di digitalizzazione dei processi.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/it/soluzioni/transazioni-e-flussi-approvativi-digitali/">GoSign</a>, la piattaforma di firma InfoCert ha, presentato nel 2022 numerose novità che hanno valso alla società il riconoscimento di “Representative Vendor” da parte di Gartner nel Global Market. In particolare, fra le innovazioni recenti è utile menzionare i processi di identificazione “On the Fly” di utenti esterni ad una organizzazione, che possono essere coinvolti in un processo di firma anche senza aver alcun certificato, e che vengono identificati in pochi minuti tramite VideoChat o SPID, e dotati di una firma digitale OTP che garantisce pieno valore legale alle transazioni.</p>



<p>Un altro elemento introdotto recentemente, che fa di GoSign una piattaforma sempre più scalabile e versatile a livello globale, è l’adeguamento agli standard della normativa descritta nel Titolo 21 CFR Parte 11 della Food and Drug Administration, la quale rende la soluzione competitiva per tutte le aziende e multinazionali del mondo Pharma che devono rispettare i requisiti della norma.</p>



<blockquote><p>Nonostante la proliferazione delle funzionalità di firma elettronica, i complessi requisiti normativi possono complicare alcuni casi d’uso. Security e Risk Manager devono trovare un equilibrio tra identità, conformità, sicurezza dei dati, strategia aziendale e IT nella scelta delle soluzioni.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Grazie alla Market Guide for Electronic Signature di Gartner, orientarsi fra le diverse soluzioni ed esplorare il mercato della firma elettronica è alla portata di tutti; Il report è ormai un punto di riferimento per professionisti e aziende del settore IT e soluzioni tecnologiche, con lo scopo di guidare professionisti e imprese nella valutazione delle soluzioni presenti sul mercato offerte dai diversi provider in ambito Firma Digitale e Servizi Fiduciari.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> è una società per azioni multinazionale che si occupa di consulenza strategica, ricerca e analisi nel campo della tecnologia dell’informazione con oltre 15.000 clienti nel mondo, opera da oltre 40 anni, e come IT Advisor anche quest’anno ha rilasciato la sua guida per il mercato della Firma Digitale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anche quest’anno, InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” uscita a luglio 2022, questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader del settore Firma Digitale.</p>

<p>Thanks to the innovation of its signature solutions, once again this year InfoCert has been recognized among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors&nbsp;in the July 2022 Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature. This important quote consolidates InfoCert as a leader in the Digital Signature market.</p>



<p>The market of electronic signature has become largely commoditized, and simple electronic signature is increasingly offered as a basic feature in most document management and approval workflow platforms. Many organizations that have integrated electronic signatures in their processes in the past are re-evaluating their investment in solutions that provide greater&nbsp;reliability, security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe, the adoption of these kind of solutions was more complex, especially between 2020 and 2022, as organizations became more sensitive to legal and regulatory requirements to reduce fraud risks and needed to integrate applications previously implemented with local trust service providers for each country</p>



<p>One of the major complexities is to be sure of the identity of recipients within an approval workflow and signing process: these features are increasingly important as they are often required by regulations in B2C use cases and for high-risk transactions. Certainty of identity can include strong user authentication, identity verification, integration of Digital Identity Wallet, or the use of digital certificates issued by a Certification Authority. In this scenario, Qualified Trust Service Providers (qTSP) and onboarding platforms are becoming more and more important, and players like InfoCert are now the right partner to implement digitalization projects.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">GoSign</a>, the InfoCert signature platform, introduced in 2022 several innovations that made it possible for the company to be designated “Representative Vendor” by Gartner on the global market. Among these innovations, we can mention the&nbsp;“On the Fly”&nbsp;identification process of a stranger or external user, who can now be involved in a signing process even without any signature certificate: GoSign let these recipients be identified in a few minutes through Video Chat or eIdentity and provided with an OTP based e-signature that guarantees full legal value to transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new version, GoSign became, even more, a scalable and versatile platform at a global level, thanks to the adaptation to the requirements described in Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the Food and Drug Administration, which makes the solution competitive for all Pharma companies at global level which must comply with the requirements of this regulation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Despite the proliferation of e-signature capabilities,&nbsp;complex regulatory requirements&nbsp;can increase the complexity of some use cases. Security and Risk Manager must reach a&nbsp;balance&nbsp;between identity, compliance, data security, business strategy, and IT in choosing solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;The Gartner’s Market Guide for Electronic Signature, support you finding your way through the different solutions and exploring the electronic signature market ; The report is&nbsp;a point of reference for professionals and companies in the IT sector and technological solutions, with the aim of guiding professionals and companies in the evaluation of the solutions on the market offered by the various providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services.</p>



<p>Gartner is a multinational joint-stock company that deals with strategic consulting, research and analysis in IT sector with over 15,000 customers worldwide, has been operating for over 40 years, and as IT Advisor also this year has released its guide for the Digital Signature market. InfoCert was named &nbsp;among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors in the “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” released in July 2022,&nbsp;this important mention consolidates infoCert’s positioning among the leaders in the Digital Signature sector.</p>

<p>Understanding the semantic web can be confusing, so we break it down to help guide you through its technologies, history, and importance to the future of the web.</p>
<p>Why is the semantic web important? The semantic web is important because it provides a structure for web content to facilitate machine-human interaction and decentralized development.</p>
 Web 1.0 and the Static Web 
<p>While a colloquial (rather than technical) name, Web 1.0 refers to the collection of basic internet technologies that served as the web’s foundation at the start of the internet.&nbsp;</p>
 Web 1.0 Technologies 
<p>Some of the primary technologies that supported Web 1.0 are as follows:</p>
 
 Uniform Resource Locators : We all know URLs, also known as internet addresses, that uniquely identify content and resources on network servers using a hierarchical domain structure to point to particular files.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The basic structure of a URL is an identifier of the protocol used to transmit the requested information (HTTP or HTTPS). This domain name includes a domain type (.com, .gov, etc.), an optional port number, the path to the desired file, and optional parameters.<br>
</p>
 
 Hyperlinks: The underlying decentralized nature of web pages generally calls for a form of connectivity between the pages and that mechanism is the hyperlink. Website creators can mark text or images with markup that anchor them to a URL so that they are taken directly to that address when the user clicks it.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of hyperlinks to the web. They are what connect pages and sites and create the fabric by which natural navigation can take place.&nbsp;</p>
 
 HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the metadata used to format content on the web for presentation in a web browser. Everything from font, colors, arrangements, links, images, and structure are laid out in HTML (and, following that, CSS). 
 
<p>The original infrastructure of the web is, in fact, decentralized. IP routing and URLs create a metaphorical web of content users can access. However, the centralizing force of centralized servers and service providers also gives the web context and meaning, where well-known locations and trustworthy sources of content can draw in users.&nbsp;</p>
 Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the Semantic Web 
<p>One challenge of the old web is that it is static and decontextualized. As far as internet protocols are concerned, data is simply data, and all that matters is how it fits into the network model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reality limits the flexibility and responsiveness of the web because it requires human users to ascribe meaning to any piece of data manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next evolution of the web, according to Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium), is a web that allows machines to understand what data means rather than just what it is, and thus work better for and with human users. He dubbed this evolution “the semantic web.”</p>
<p>The more technical underpinnings of the semantic web, as conceived by Berners-Lee, include the following:&nbsp;</p>
 The Semantic Web 
<p>Metadata is, per its name, data about data. HTML is a good example of metadata—through the use of clearly defined tags, the writer of HTML can signal to a web browser how to format content. That formatting information isn’t visible to the reader, but it fundamentally shapes the user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of semantics and meaning, metadata can provide a structure to data so that it is meaningful to machines. Much like HTML, metadata languages signal to programs that certain pieces of content fall into certain patterns, categories, and structures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the more prevalent forms of metadata languages include the following:</p>
 
 eXtensible Markup Language: XML is much like HTML, but instead of providing formatting, it provides semantic information. For example, if you structure an eBook in chapters, chapter sections, and paragraphs, you can express those sections into XML so that an application can structure or transform them.&nbsp; 
 Yet Another Markup Language: Similar to XML, YAML uses section declarations to separate sections of data, to provide a metadata document that is more readable for humans as compared to XML.&nbsp; 
 JavaScript Object Notation Language: Superficially, JSON resembles the nested tagging structure of XML, but it is specifically useful for processing web data objects into JavaScript objects for web programming.&nbsp; 
 
 Organization and Web Ontology 
<p>If metadata languages express structure, then ontology languages define that structure for machine consumption. For example, an ontology language can serve as the underlying structure of an eBook or define how CMS systems format URLs by drawing data from a piece of content as it is created. If metadata languages are, in fact, languages, then ontologies are the vocabulary.</p>
<p>Some of the common ontology specifications are as follows:</p>
 
 Resource Description Framework: RDF uses the concept of “triples” to create a flexible data model that can be used by the languages and applications that build on it. These triples are like that of a simple vocabulary: (Subject →Verb→Object). A subject performs or is connected to an object by a verb. An example of this might be “Apple is Fruit,” where every piece of data defined as an apple is, through the ontology, assumed to be a fruit.<br>
 
 
<p>This might seem incredibly simple—but remember that machines aren’t as intelligent as we often think. They need to be told things. So, with an ontology that defines references of “apple” data objects as “fruit,” the developer can deploy and transform apple objects based on their fruit-ness.<br>
</p>
 
 Web Ontology Language: OWL is a more expansive, and in some cases more restrictive, extension of RDF that supports more complex relationships and operations, making it easier to create complex ontologies. If RDF is a vocabulary, OWL is a more flexible dictionary with more rules for using those expanded terms.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note that metadata languages and ontologies aren’t opposed. Languages like XML will express ontological definitions for higher-level applications, making creating and modifying user-level applications easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While having central vocabularies seems restricting, the purpose of creating these semantics is to improve development and decentralization. With a common standard to build on, developers can create a network of related but independent systems that integrate without requiring a central organization to provide resources for planning.</p>
 Join Web 3.0 Functionality and the Semantic Web with 1Kosmos 
<p>The semantic web isn’t just about metatextual data. It’s about robust and decentralized systems that can securely store and serve information from multiple sources meaningfully so that machines and people can work together better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially useful in authentication and identity management. The move away from centralized servers is a question of both security and ownership. Central servers are honeypots that draw in hackers, and decentralized systems can replace them without sacrificing speed or reliability. Perhaps more importantly, people want more control over their data, and the semantic web in authentication is a start towards that goal.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can support Web 3.0 and the semantic web with the following features:</p>
 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.&nbsp; 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp; 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure that there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp;

				 By Tim Spring<p></p>
<p><a href="https://fcw.com/congress/2022/07/digital-id-bill-sees-action-house-and-senate/374552/&nbsp;">Digital ID bill sees action in the House and Senate</a></p>
<p>FCW reports that a bill focused on increasing federal government participation in the digital identity ecosystem has been reintroduced in&nbsp; the House and a counterpart has been&nbsp; created and introduced to the Senate. The goal of these bills is to “set up a task force on digital identity and establish a grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to support the creation of interoperable identity credentialing systems for digital identity verification on the state and local level.” The original bill was drafted in 2020, spurred by the increase in identity fraud that has occurred during the COVID 19 pandemic, but was never voted out of committee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/will-eu-digital-identity-drop-the-unique-identifier&nbsp;">Will EU digital identity drop the unique identifier?</a></p>
<p>As reported by Biometric Update, the European Union has been working on a digital ID system that would allow member states to issue digital identification to their citizens for travel across borders or proving their identity in general across the EU. However, it appears that EU officials are having second thoughts on a key element of the proposed ID system — a mandate for all EU members to incorporate unique identifiers in their digital IDs. As privacy advocates have pointed out, a unique identifier for each person would mean they could be tracked across any government database.</p>
<p>Such a tracking device would be currently illegal in both the Netherlands and Austria, and unconstitutional in Germany. New language in a proposed amendment from the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy opens the door to technical solutions that secure personal data and ensure trust, such as “cryptographically verifiable identifiers, unique user-generated digital pseudonyms, self-sovereign identities and domain specific identifiers using state of the art encryption technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2022/07/why-digital-identity-will-make-or-break-the-metaverse/&nbsp;">Why digital identity will make or break the Metaverse</a></p>
<p>In a comment piece in Engineering and Technology, Onfido’s Matt Peake argues that with marquee brands like Coke and Nike creating experiences in the metaverse, verified identities are critical to preventing fraud:</p>
<p>“Without verified identities in the Metaverse, anonymous bots can wreak havoc. For businesses, business people and celebrities, impersonators can cause damage to their brand and reputation, not to mention the new opportunities it creates for scammers and fraudsters. Ensuring trusted identity will therefore be fundamental to the safety and success of the Metaverse.”</p>
<p>While anonymity is ok, there must be a real person behind the avatar, says Peake. Age verification is critical too — in fact, all the problems we have with identity online are likely to cause havoc in this emerging virtual space. While Peake says the time to address this is now, as the Metaverse is being created, he is short on actual solutions to verify identities. Not so at Indicio, we’re working with Bonifii and Liquid Avatar Technologies to implement privacy-preserving verifiable credentials and decentralized identity in the Metaverse now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digit.fyi/young-people-at-greater-risk-of-falling-victim-to-identity-fraud/&nbsp;">Young people at greater risk of falling victim to identity fraud</a></p>
<p>GBG, a UK-based identity verification, location intelligence and fraud prevention company, has released its <a href="https://www.gbgplc.com/en/identity-verification/the-state-of-digital-identity-2022/">State of Digital Identities 2022 report</a>. Key findings: Mobile business is increasingly conducted through smart phones, with 67% of decision makers at companies saying that they conduct business this way. And — contrary to what one might expect — young people are more likely to be the victims of digital fraud than those aged over 55: 13% of people aged 18 to 24 across Europe have been victims in the past 12 months, 12% for 25 – 34, and 9% for 35-44, compared to only 4% for 55 and older. One possible reason—younger generations may expect security to be built into the tech they use, with only 62% of young adults responding that it’s their responsibility to protect their information (in contrast to the average of 76% that said it was the user’s responsibility across all age groups).</p>
<p>“Young adults are often labeled by businesses as the most tech-savvy demographic. But there is a large section of this age group who believe dealing with online security should be companies’ responsibility, rather than them looking after it themselves.”</p>

<p>Buy and sell data with H2O, a stable asset backed by&nbsp;OCEAN</p><p>H2O can now be used as a base token on Ocean Market, allowing data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability. Let’s dive deep into what H2O is and what benefits it brings to the whole Ocean ecosystem.</p> What is Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is a decentralized data marketplace that enables publishers to monetize their data and/or algorithms through <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/">Compute-to-Data</a>, Ocean’s latest privacy-preserving approach.</p><p>Ocean Market allows access to data, algorithms, and compute services via datatokens and offers monetisation opportunities for stakers who provide veOCEAN to promising data assets. Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p><a href="https://www.h2odata.xyz/">H2O</a> is an OCEAN-backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, H2O is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and also H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for H2O this has been&nbsp;~$1.60.</p><p>One can get H2O by either (a) locking OCEAN to mint H2O, <a href="https://app.h2odata.xyz/#/">via the H2O dapp</a>, or (b) by buying H2O in an exchange such as the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x0642026e7f0b6ccac5925b4e7fa61384250e1701&amp;outputCurrency=ETH&amp;chain=mainnet">Uniswap H2O-WETH&nbsp;pool</a>.</p> How is H2O Used in Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p>A “base token” in Ocean Market is a token that can be used to price data for buying and selling and to stake on data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Prior to this integration, only OCEAN was available as a base token in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>With this update/integration?, Ocean Market has added H2O as a base token. Upon publishing a data asset, the publisher can choose whether to use OCEAN or H2O&nbsp;[1].</p><p>This means that H2O can be used to price data in fixed-rate exchange.</p> What are the benefits? <p>Since data can be priced in H2O, and H2O fluctuates far less than OCEAN, then H2O in Ocean Market mitigates the volatility of the price of the data, since H2O fluctuates far less than&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>First, data sellers get more predictable revenue. Revenue is no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price.</p><p>Second, data buyers have more predictable costs. Costs are no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price</p> Conclusion <p>H2O, the OCEAN-backed stable asset, is now available in Ocean Market! This means better data pricing stability: data sellers get more predictable revenue, and buyers get more predictable costs.</p> Notes <p>Ocean Protocol backend components allow for any token as a base token, not just OCEAN or H2O. It’s the frontend — Ocean Market — that only explicitly supports the usage of OCEAN or&nbsp;H2O.</p><p>Builders of third-party marketplaces powered by Ocean (e.g. forks of Ocean Market) can readily pick other tokens for their market. E.g. their own token, WETH, DAI,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>In my last blog,<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title=" vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,"> vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,</a> I spoke about the potential of the vLEI. In the brief outline of the wider vLEI eco-system we saw that there were a number of types of Verifiable Credential:</p>
 
 LE-vLEI: a credential providing LEI data for the organisation 
 LE-OOR: a credential providing information about an individual holding a specific formal role within the organisation 
 LE-ECR: a credential providing information about an individual who has a ‘user defined’ role in relation to an organisation. 
 
<p>The credentials are issued by a Qualified vLEI Issuer, a QVI, and stored in a wallet. Let’s look at that in a bit more detail to understand what is going on.</p>
 The role of the QVI 
<p>We started off our last blog assuming a basic understanding of the LEI. The LEI is a 20 digit code that identifies a legal entity and can be used to look up data in real time from the GLEIS, a public database managed by the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a>. The LEI itself is issued by an ‘LEI Issuer’ known as an LOU. LOUs are entities that are accredited by the GLEIF and audited yearly to ensure they are perform inline with the defined frameworks.</p>
<p>It is very similar for vLEIs. vLEIs are issued by a ‘Qualified vLEI Issuer’, known as a QVI. An organisation wishing to become a QVI must define processes and systems that adhere to the vLEI governance framework and pass an initial qualification from the GLEIF, and then undertake yearly audits by the GLEIF.</p>
<p>The QVI has to follow a precise process to issue any of the previously listed credentials, which involve the checking of the LEI, the identity assurance of individuals involved and finally the technical issuance process itself.</p>
<p>The GLEIF is still finalising the process definitions but we expect to see initial QVIs launching within the next 6 months or so.</p>
 What does an issued credential look like? 
<p>As we discussed previously, credentials are designed to be understood by computers. This allows the holder of the credential to present the credential during a transaction to make a statement that can be understood by the ‘computer’ processing the request.</p>
<p>The issued credential is a machine readable format, typically in a json format. They are not meant to be directly read by the holder, instead credentials are accessed, displayed, and ‘used’ by an application, a ‘wallet’.</p>
<p>It should be noted there are a few different formats of credentials which means there are different wallets. On top of this, there are many different ways in which a computer can check the credential and so the wallet must present the credential in the right format for the intended end use, and this can mean a different wallet per use case.</p>
 The credential wallet 
<p>The various credentials, that you might have, are stored in a wallet. This is an application, often residing on your mobile device, that securely holds the credential data, provides a user interface so you can examine the contents of the wallet, and provides functionality for using the credentials stored within.</p>
<p>Wallets on mobile devices are not new, the iPhone provides a wallet for a variety of items, such as payment cards and boarding passes. The idea is the same, but the iPhone wallet is not a Verifiable Credential wallet.</p>
<p>The wallet residing on your mobile device is actually a significant concept. In ‘classical’ identity systems the claims about ‘you’ are held by an Identity Provider, and when someone wants to access one of those claims they contact that (central) identity provider for the details. This means that the identity provider knows who you are sharing claims with, and in many cases the level of data shared is greater than the need of the person asking. The typical example here is sharing your date of birth as proof you are over 18.</p>
<p>The alternative to this centralised identity is a system where you hold all the information about you and get to decide what information to share in response to any given request. This is known as Self Sovereign Identity and is enabled by the credential wallet.</p>
<p>When a service needs to know some information about ‘you’ it will generate something called a Presentation Request. This is often in the form of a QR code that you scan with the wallet app. The App will decide the request, see what claims are being asked for and then present you with that information and let you choose how to respond using the various items of information you have in the wallet. You are now in control of who is being told what, and you are the central store of the claims. Your bank might have generated the credential you will use, but it has no connection to whoever or whatever you are now sharing that information with, so the recipient cannot track your usage of that information.</p>
<p>All of this is well and good, however there is a challenge here. The credentials are all using strong cryptographic techniques to secure and protect the data, and to give service providers confidence that the claims are un-altered and issued by trusted parties. This strong cryptographic protection requires some complex management to take place, and in the wallet system, as described, this also falls to you, the user, as you are managing your attributes. There is a solution to this, the custodial wallet.</p>
 Custodial Wallet 
<p>A custodial wallet is where a third party provides a hosted wallet for you and takes care of the cryptographic management. Of course, this ease of maintenance comes with a slight reduction in overall security – another party is controlling your cryptographic keys, but in many instances that trade off is for the best.</p>
<p>This extra dimension increases the number of wallets available; not only do you have differing credential types, differing verification methods, but now also differing providers of wallets.</p>
 Wallets Everywhere 
<p>In the short term you should expect to see a number of wallets appearing, both on your mobile and through cloud services. Over time, the differences will be incorporated, and wallets will become more general purpose and there will be consolidation.</p>
 Wallets and vLEI 
<p>The vLEI is no different to any other credential and requires a wallet to be issued into. GLEIF are building the wallet capability following the pilot issuance project for the signing of the 2021 accounts. It is likely that the first wallets will be custodial (hosted) and provided by the QVIs to simplify the overall process for the legal entities who are obtaining vLEIs.</p>
<p>In my next blog we will look at how the wider issuance process for the vLEI credentials works.

</p><p>Paper-based IDs have long been a globally accepted standard mode of identity presentation. However, it is vulnerable to high risks of loss and fraud, in addition to being largely irrelevant in digital domains. With the recent digitization of many services, there are increasing number of opportunities for our personal identities to be used online in our daily lives. Personal identities and related information has importance in fintech platforms, healthcare systems, e-commerce, and social networking. To connect digitally, we must provide personal information such as our name, date of birth, address, credit card number, and other details.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is increasing concern about the privacy implications of using personally identifiable information online. The current digital identification architecture is primarily centralized, meaning identity information is stored on centralized servers owned by specific entities, resulting in an entirely different paradigm of concerns. By doing so, we are trusting external entities to maintain the privacy of our data.</p>



<p>Individuals do not have meaningful ownership of their credentials in the centralized model and have no security of their personal data. Although internet users can be confident that the websites they visit are legitimate, there is no reliable way of determining the identities of individuals, organizations, and other entities that govern those websites or with whom users interact and trade. Despite superior security, the use of centralized servers makes digital identity management systems vulnerable to multiple cyber attacks. Entities may be bound by legal agreements such as data privacy agreements but technically it is still possible for them to misuse information. . Also, there is a big question mark on the privacy of data stored on servers of the platforms. Planform can use this data for monetization by sharing it with others.</p>



<p>When it comes to making digital identities more secure, a global public utility approach is preferred. That's where Decentralize Identity comes into the picture. It is based on the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) means giving complete control to individuals over their identity and credentials without any dependency on the administrative body or third party. The SSI has the concept of verifiable credentials to store and share the identity and other data in which the individual is the ultimate owner of their identity and has complete control over its storage, distribution, and third-party access.&nbsp; SSI is not a new concept however combining it with blockchain brings transparency and trust in data ownership. Above all, the SSID ecosystem eliminates centralized storage, instead relying on Blockchain technology and cryptography to ensure trust, transparency, and integrity of data.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity implementation</p>



<p>There are three entities involved. The Issuer issues the verifiable credentials to the user via its own verification process, the User with an identity stored in the SSI Wallet APP, and the Verifier who verifies the presented credentials by the user. Users can acquire different credentials from different issuers using the keys stored in SSI wallet APP. These credentials can be securely shared while using platforms that trust the issuer. The features like selective disclosure, Zero-knowledge proof gives complete control of privacy to users over their data while sharing it with a verifier.</p>







<p>This solution can be utilized in various domains including Healthcare applications, Fintech, Educational records, Document management, and so on. SPARK has a decentralized identity solution &amp; various pluggable components ready to Whitelabel for businesses. Feel free to comment with your thoughts and reach out to us to know more.

<p>In this Voices of the Data Economy episode, we spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikanth-kaja-6a335789/?originalSubdomain=sg">Srikanth Kaja</a>. He is the General Manager of Emerging Technologies in <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com.sg/?group=all&amp;subgroup=see-all&amp;view=BODYTYPE">Daimler South East&nbsp;Asia.</a></p><p><a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik </a>is a decentralized data marketplace by Mercedes-Benz, powered by Blockchain Technology. During our conversation, we spoke about how enterprises can use blockchain technology to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner and the road ahead for enterprise adoption of web3. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;episode:</p><p>What is Acentrik? And what problem is it&nbsp;solving?</p><p>Acentrik is a B2B data marketplace powered by blockchain technology, built using the Ocean stack. It has two strong use&nbsp;cases</p>  To enable companies to buy and sell data over the blockchain  To enable companies to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner.  <p>This is done by enabling data consumers to run algorithms on data behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“Data availability and quality is important to scale enterprises, not just within Mercedes-Benz, but also in every enterprise out there. This is why we developed Acentrik, materializing the concept of digital assets representation on the Blockchain. Our aim is to build one horizontal technology across multiple different verticals that maintain data sovereignty. This means that the ownership and storage of the data stays with the data owners and not on the platform. The role of Acentrik, as a marketplace, is to enable the monetization of the data and ensure that data providers are easily connected with consumers in various industries while maintaining data sovereignty.”</blockquote><p>Enterprise data sharing: How can it be optimized?</p><blockquote>“There are multiple reasons and issues that prevent enterprises from sharing data. Enterprises have very different requirements around who should be able to publish, view or buy datasets. They fear the threat of losing control on their data or they chose not to monetise their data because of the value and sensitivity of that data (particularly in the context of GDPR). But these issues can be tackled with the right blockchain solution.”</blockquote><p>For instance, Acentrik veers away from the traditional centralized data management model of enterprises, providing more reasons for them to monetize data as they do not face the threat of losing control of their data. Monetization is now an option for enterprises, as in the past they held data without the consideration of unlocking the value of data in their data. With that, there is a potential loss of revenue for themselves and the industry. Secondly, Acentrik as a data marketplace is domain agnostic, which as part of data monetization, offers a strategic advantage to tap on data across industries, directly to the data&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>“Acentrik ensures data sovereignty with the Compute-to-Data feature. Privacy-preserving compute jobs run in the data owners’ premises behind a firewall, without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. It is a win-win situation, data consumers get insights by running algorithms on the data, building towards a better business case for their enterprise, while data providers monetize their data and stay in control of their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://acentrik.medium.com/acentriks-enterprise-release-new-features-revealed-20dac67825a">You can read more about Acentrik’s enterprise release and its new features&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>How Ocean Protocol is supporting Acentrik</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> has joined forces with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, on its recently launched Enterprise Release. Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. As part of the collaboration, the most important Ocean features have been leveraged and integrated into Acentrik V1.0 and key adaptations for enterprise users.</p><p>Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>How to make your blockchain solution enterprise-ready?</p><blockquote>“For enterprises, data often needs to be kept private. The Compute-to-Data feature means that private data isn’t directly shared but rather specific access to it is granted. Algorithms are able to be run on the data behind a firewall without the raw data ever being revealed.”</blockquote><p>By opening up this possibility, private data can now help enterprises in their research, leading to more significant innovation. For example, more data improves the predictive accuracy of modern AI models. Private data is also often considered the most valuable data because it’s so hard to discover, and using it can lead to potentially big&nbsp;payoffs.</p><p>Concepts like Compute-to-data, Asset Management Token and Fine-grained Permissions may appear abstract to enterprises who are new to the Web3 world — but it is important to ensure these concepts are broken down and translatable to applications in the business world. This is seen in use cases for enterprises across industries.</p><p>A case-in-point is a cross-domain use case of harnessing data from the healthcare and insurance industries to shape clinical research and care. Through data points from outpatient medical treatments, paired with algorithms derived from past insurance claims over a period of time, this presents analysis and derivations to precise medical supplies for pharmaceutical companies. This example by itself is achieved by Compute-to-Data, where data is kept on the premise of the hospitals, clinics and insurance companies. Algorithms are brought to the data and compute jobs run on the premise of the data&nbsp;owner.</p><blockquote>“Being enterprise-ready also meant that access and control to multiple users are important factors to actors on Acentrik. Through our tokens like our ERC20 datatoken, which represents the access to a particular asset on the marketplace and ERC721 token which is Acentrik Asset Management Token, representing the control of a specific asset on Acentrik. Fine-grained permissions are live at various levels such as at a role-level of publish and consume, and also at an asset-level of delegating roles such minter, editing, publishing etc. There are simply many combinations that can be configured for enterprises based on their permissions required for individual users”</blockquote><p>A large part of being enterprise-ready is to have the right level of access control and publishing restrictions within Acentrik. Datatokens primarily control access, but enterprises often need more precise ways to specify and manage access, and fine-grained permissions need to be introduced for these use cases. Fine-grained permissions mean that access can be controlled precisely at two levels: Marketplace-level permissions for browsing, consuming, or publishing within a marketplace frontend. This is handled by our role-based access control server. Asset-level permissions on a specific asset is controlled by two credentials, email domain and/or wallet address, to add to allow/deny lists, maintained in the asset’s metadata.</p><blockquote>“Blockchain will likely shift from concept to necessity — which is inevitable for enterprises to embrace this technology for systems and business models. The Web3 world is a community-focused one that enterprises will realize and contribute towards the same in different forms”</blockquote><p>What next?</p><p>Acentrik is now in Enterprise Release! Experience the new line-up of features on the marketplace, which are implemented to answer to pilot customers’ needs. Acentrik is now ready to onboard companies with data products, creating a supply and demand and implementing use cases. While this is being planned, further scaling of the product is ongoing, with plans to deploy to other blockchain networks and stabilize the whole production platform.

Digital ID&nbsp;Wallet<p>So far in the GlobaliD 101 series, we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <p>Now, we’re getting to the exciting part. We know identity is broken. We also know what great digital identity that works for you, the individual, looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>But how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The first step is to make digital identity incredibly convenient, fun, and useful for end users. These are the people who will go out and interact with their communities, purchase goods and services, and build businesses.</p><p>In the physical world, we rely on identifying documentation. That might be your driver’s license, your insurance card, or your passport. In our daily lives, we’ll keep the most commonly used forms of ID in our&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In the digital future, things won’t look all that different. You’ll keep digital forms of relevant documents in your digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>It’s easy to understand the benefits of digitization:</p>  It’s convenient. All your relevant documents are in one accessible place. The only thing you’ll need to keep in your actual wallet is cash. As the digital identity ecosystem develops, your interactions and transactions will become seamless.  It’s yours. This is your ID wallet. You own and control your identity and your&nbsp;data.  It’s secure. If you lose your wallet, it’s gone, and your information is out there. That’s not the case with a locked smartphone. Plus, you’ll have a backup. Another aspect is the ability to selectively share only relevant data. If you’re buying a bottle of wine, you don’t need to share your entire driver’s license. You don’t even need to share your actual date of birth. You only need to share the fact that you’re over 21 (for those in the&nbsp;U.S.).  <p>Big Tech companies like Apple are already making progress on this front, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-launches-the-first-drivers-license-and-state-id-in-wallet-with-arizona/">piloting a program</a> that allows users to keep their driver’s license in their Apple Wallet. The difference with Apple’s approach, of course, is that their solution isn’t portable or interoperable. In regular person terms, it just means that you’re stuck on Apple’s closed ecosystem — no surprise.</p><p>While progress is being made, these are still early days. Apple’s pilot, for instance, will be rolled out in a limited number of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All of which means that people are still sending photos of their driver’s license to their AirBnb host for identity verification.</p><p>That’s crazy insecure!</p><p>What if instead, you could securely and selectively share your ID with an expiring link? Your name and photo will be visible but other private details will be blurred out. Your Airbnb now believes you are who you say you are because they also trust the issuer of your digital credential. Likewise, you don’t have to worry that a copy of your full license is on a stranger’s phone forever. Everyone rests easy, and you enjoy the heck out of your vacation.</p><p>Need to provide a copy of your ID to an AirBNB host? Just send them a link to your driver’s license which you’ve stored in your ID wallet. You can make your name and photo visible, while everything else is blurred out. That way the host only sees what you want them to. You can also set a time limit for how long your ID is available. That way nobody has a copy of your license indefinitely.</p><p>The same applies across all your online interactions and transactions. No more taking photos of your ID for each new platform or service. No more digging through the safe for your passport. No more calling the customer support because you lost your insurance card.</p><p>Life is just easier with a digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> Venture into the digital future confidently <p>What’s even more exciting is where we go from here. With people using a trusted ID wallet, businesses (verifiers) can rethink how they manage identity and trust in the context of their customers, an effort that costs businesses $592 trillion per&nbsp;day.</p><p>The World Wide Web Consortium (w3c) also reached <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/w3c_overrules_objections/">a major milestone</a> this month around digital identifier (DID) standards, which will become a formal recommendation despite pushback from Big Tech. Just like the internet, open and interoperable protocols will allow any company or project to easily integrate these digital identity standards, paving the way toward mainstream adoption and far-reaching accessibility.</p><p>Since your digital identity is built on open standards, your identity will also be portable like your mobile phone number is today. Rather than being stuck with a certain provider or platform, you’ll be able to easily transfer your identity from one ID wallet to another. Software developers will compete for your patronage by developing the best possible products.</p><p>Imagine a world where you own your identity and your data rather than corporations or the government. You finally hold the keys to your own destiny. You share only what you need to in a secure and private fashion. Rather than logging onto your Facebook account, you log on as&nbsp;you.</p><p>And unlike your Facebook account, which isn’t all that credible, you’ll be able to do important things with your digital identity, such as remotely opening up a bank account. Since digital formats are far more flexible in the context of expressing trust and reputation, this will have a profound impact on financial inclusion for the billions of people who lack traditional identifying documentation.</p><p>In the future, we’ll see a convergence between our physical and digital identities with everything easily managed in one place. With one identity, you’ll be able to purchase celebratory drinks with your friends or hang out in the Metaverse.</p><p>It all starts with your ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.

<p>I have been working on an Android library project which didn’t have any unit tests implemented. It is quite a small library, with only five classes. However, some of those classes have vital roles and directly impact the library’s output, such as generating file metadata depending on another file by doing some mathematical operations. Changing a single line or even a single integer value might break the whole functionality. I was&nbsp;like:</p>Bubbles Girl, origin&nbsp;unknown<p>I wanted to implement unit tests for the library to mitigate the risk of breaking existing functionalities while adding new ones or fixing bugs. At first, it looked like an “easy job” since there was a limited number of classes, but once I started writing unit tests, I realised that the code was not testable.</p><p>In this article, you will read my experience on how I managed to refactor that library code so that it became testable and what my learnings were on this&nbsp;journey.</p> Prerequisite <p>This article doesn’t focus on a specific platform or a programming language but on concepts. However, I believe it is always helpful to provide some examples. That is why I added example code pieces in Kotlin. I tried to keep them as simple as possible, and I am pretty sure they are easy to understand, whether you are familiar with Kotlin or&nbsp;not.</p> Why unit&nbsp;testing? <p>Generally, testing helps software companies deliver quality software and reduce development costs. Specifically, unit testing helps to find the bugs easily in every stage of development in a fast and reliable way. Yet the most valuable benefit of writing unit tests is that it forces developers to write testable&nbsp;code.</p> Unit Testable&nbsp;Code <p>We usually don’t realise how bad the code is until we start writing unit tests. Even though the code is easy to understand, we might overlook its cyclomatic complexity as it might hide its dependencies. As a result, we fail to realise how complex the code&nbsp;is.</p><p>Writing unit tests forces us to refactor our code to have single-responsibility and dependency inversion. These are already two of the five SOLID principles. That is why having unit testable code makes writing tests painless and makes the codebase less complex, easier to understand and more maintainable.</p> Deterministic Code <p>Writing unit tests is pretty straightforward, but testing non-deterministic code is impractical. Functions should produce the same output for the same input every time so that the unit tests can test their behaviour correctly. Otherwise, you would have either no unit tests or non-deterministic ones, which are not ideal as tests should be deterministic by definition.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the example code below. “shuffleQueue” function takes one argument, a one-dimensional integer array and returns a shuffled&nbsp;version.</p><p>Testing it should be pretty straightforward, right? Not. Because each run would produce a different result for the same inputs. However, this is something expected. Given the shuffling nature, the function should create kind of random results. So then, how can you test it? The first thing that comes to mind is checking whether the output differs from the input, as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>However, we don’t have control over the implementation of the “IntArray.shuffle” function, and technically the output might be the same as the input at a random time. This makes the test unstable and non-deterministic. Even worse, you can’t ensure that the “shuffleQueue” function shuffles the queue and does not just return a static value. You can try different approaches to unit test this function, such as running it for million times and then checking whether the results differ or not. It might work, but the test execution would take too much time. The other, probably better approach is delegating the non-deterministic part of the code to another component, which I will explain in the following sections.</p> Single-Responsibility <p>The process of unit testing is quite simple. First, you set the preconditions; then invoke the tested unit; last, check the generated output against the expected one. It sounds simple; however, complex functions require complex preconditions and inputs, and generate complex results. As a result, the complexity of the unit test grows exponentially as the tested unit’s complexity grows because unit tests have to check every possible use&nbsp;case.</p><p>There are many ways to determine a function’s complexity, such as nested block count, lines of code or cyclomatic complexity. Small functions with fewer lines of code usually result in a cleaner and more understandable codebase. However, it is possible to make a small function very complex by poisoning it with multiple responsibilities. And worse, the code gets unstable when it has multiple responsibilities because updating a single functionality might break another&nbsp;one.</p><p>Let’s imagine writing unit tests for “logToFile” function below. You need to test three different functionalities:</p>  Log line generation  Opening the correct log&nbsp;file  Writing the log line into the&nbsp;file  <p>While the output of the function changes regarding the inputs, the unit tests for the log function should test three different cases:</p>  With zero&nbsp;args  With only one&nbsp;arg  With multiple&nbsp;args  <p>However, for each case, the unit tests should also check if the function generates the correct log line, if it writes the log line into the correct log file, and if it appends the log line at the end of the log file. Imagine getting a change request about updating the timestamp in the log lines to include the minutes and seconds. The function changes as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>The unit tests would now fail and should be updated to check the new format of the log lines. However, not one but three unit tests should be updated as we need three unit tests to test the log function, which costs time and money. This is an excellent example of the functions with multiple functionalities requiring more complex unit&nbsp;tests.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is not the biggest problem. As you might have noticed, changing the timestamp broke the log file names. Instead of creating a log file per hour, the function now creates a log file per second. If the existing unit tests don’t check the file names, your software will have an evil bug. If they check, you must also update those parts, which means spending more time and&nbsp;money.</p><p>A better way to reimplement this log function and make it easily testable is by distributing these three functionalities into different components; one for generating a log line, one for getting the log file, and one for appending the line into the file. So the function becomes as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>We can now test the new implementation of the function with only one unit test. The unit test should&nbsp;check:</p>  If the function is passing its arguments to “logLineGenerator.generate” function to generate the log&nbsp;line  If it calls “logFileStorage.getCurrentLogFile” to get the current log&nbsp;file  If it calls “fileWriter.appendText” with the current log file and the generated log&nbsp;line.  <p>As we revisit the requirement of updating the timestamp in the log lines, it would be enough to update “logLineGenerator” class and its unit tests. There is no need to update the actual log function. Moreover, there is no risk of breaking another functionality while updating&nbsp;it.</p> Dependency Inversion <p>Let’s recall our log function. The latest version delegates some functionality to other components, such as generating the log line. We talked about how testing this function would be easy as we only need to check if the log function calls the others correctly. However, there is a technical challenge. We don’t know how the log function accesses “logLineGenerator”, “logFileStorage” and “fileWriter”. Moreover, we don’t have any control over them, so we can’t easily test whether the log function calls the other components correctly or&nbsp;not.</p><p>The class above is one of the possible implementations of the log class. It creates instances of subcomponents, and the log function uses them. However, if you want to test this function, there is no way to interact with those subcomponents. You can’t check whether the log function invokes the subcomponents correctly or not. Luckily, we can break the strong relation between the log class and its subcomponents by moving the instance creation somewhere else and sharing those instances with the log&nbsp;class.</p><p>The new version of the log class allows us to modify the implementation of subcomponents and inspect them effortlessly while running unit tests. We can mock subcomponents or replace them with the test implementations which produce predefined outputs. However, some of the subcomponents might be closed for inheritance, so you can’t create a test implementation class replacement. With the help of Dependency Inversion, we can overcome this problem. Dependency Inversion is one of the SOLID principles stating that modules shouldn’t depend on implementations but should depend on abstractions. Having abstraction lets us create whatever implementation we want for any subcomponent and use those implementations for unit&nbsp;tests.</p><p>Finally, the test for the log class is now all clear. It injects the test implementations of subcomponents and checks if the log function calls them with the correct parameters.</p><p>As the new log function requires us to provide the subcomponents, we need a pattern to do it conveniently in our code. Some software patterns, frameworks and libraries provide easy-to-use APIs to apply dependency inversion. For example, you can look up dependency injection and service locator patterns.</p> Sum up <p>The limitations of unit testing force us to write better code as we saw that making our code unit testable makes it easier to understand, more flexible, and more maintainable. That is why I believe in always thinking about testability and asking the question, “How can I test this?” while coding or following a test-centric process such as test-driven development helps us to have clear visibility of the code complexity and reduce&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/how-to-write-unit-testable-code-and-how-it-improves-code-quality-8c2e26bed55a">How to write unit testable code and how it improves code quality</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in Nasdaq’s <a href="https://twitter.com/TradeTalks/status/1544382285654507523?s=20&amp;t=wUrIdqIDs6_7hNn9yeajOg">TradeTalks</a>&nbsp;, which focuses on investment trends, market structure, and was interviewed by Nasdaq global markets reporter Jill Malandrino on “Should We Trust a Centralized Tech Superpower With Sensitive, Personal Data?”. He shared his views and detailed how Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) solution solves the existing trust pain&nbsp;points.  The third OWNInsights “People, Platforms, Web3” was released, written by Ge Li, Ontology Business Development Manager. From the perspective of Web3 participants, it analyzes how individuals can control their own datasets to expand their influence through DID, and effective ways to build Web3 based on the OWN infrastructure. This article was first published on the well-known Chinese blockchain media Cointelegraph Chinese, and was recommended by the platform.  Ontology and the cross-chain Swap project StealthEX held an AMA event. While introducing the project and development to the community members, it also answered questions for the community members. The selected questions were rewarded with&nbsp;ONT.

<p>I came back from the Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive to find a big pile of interesting things to write about. One, of course, was the Immersive itself, which I’ll share about next week. But for this week, here are the usual weekly release changelogs for the last six releases (there are some important changes in there) and notes from around the ecosystem.</p> Holochain 0.0.146: Zome IDs re-added to types <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139</p><p>As I mentioned in the Dev Pulse that introduced the HDI, zome IDs were removed from entry and link types (and their action headers) but would be reintroduced later. This is the release that reintroduces them, and we’ll have some ergonomics improvements to help you write more concise validation functions in the future. This has resulted in a number of changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1453">#1453</a>), some of which are very important and others of which are unlikely to be noticed unless you’re bypassing the HDI and HDK and creating your own interfaces to the host.</p>  Breaking: The <code>id</code> field has been added back to the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/action/struct.CreateLink.html"><code>CreateLink</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/action/struct.AppEntryType.html"><code>AppEntryType</code></a> action structs. This is what causes all the following changes.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a> and path manipulation functions now take any link type value that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/info/type.ScopedLinkType.html"><code>ScopedLinkType</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/entry/fn.create_entry.html"><code>create_entry</code></a> similarly takes any entry type value that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/info/type.ScopedEntryDefIndex.html"><code>ScopedEntryDefIndex</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/struct.LinkTypeRanges.html"><code>LinkTypeRanges</code></a> is removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a> take any filtering strategy that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/trait.LinkTypeFilterExt.html"><code>LinkTypeFilterExt</code></a> rather than <code>TryInto&lt;LinkTypeRanges&gt;</code>. This allows you to <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/link/enum.LinkTypeFilter.html">filter</a> by individual or multiple link types across multiple zomes, or all link types from a single zome.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.try_from_local_type"><code>try_from_local_type</code></a> is removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.try_from_global_type"><code>try_from_global_type</code></a> becomes <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.11/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.deserialize_from_type"><code>deserialize_from_type</code></a> with an extra parameter for zome ID.  Breaking: The <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/link/trait.LinkTypesHelper.html"><code>LinkTypesHelper</code></a> trait is removed.  Breaking: <code>GlobalZomeTypeID</code> and <code>LocalZomeTypeID</code> are removed.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_global_link_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_global_link_types]</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_global_entry_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_global_entry_types]</code></a> are removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_local_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_local_types]</code></a> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.38/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_coordinates.html"><code>#[hdk_to_coordinates]</code></a> with an added zome ID.  Breaking: Links from integrity zomes that are not part of a coordinator zome’s dependency list (specified in the DNA manifest) are no longer accessible to that zome when it calls <code>get_links</code>.  <p>There are other unrelated changes:</p>  Breaking/New: <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.11/holochain_deterministic_integrity/x_salsa20_poly1305/index.html"><code>x_salsa_poly1305_*</code></a> functions have been properly implemented! As a consequence, any <code>KeyRef</code>s previously stored in the Lair keystore will no longer work. This means that the conductor now uses Lair keystore 0.x.x (currently 0.2.0 at time of this release). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1446">#1446</a>)  Breaking/New: In preparation for rate limiting, the action structs that support app-defined weights now have a <code>weight</code> field. While the conductor doesn’t currently use this field, in the future you’ll be able to use it to write deterministic validation functions that turn DHT spam into a warrantable offense.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220629012044">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.147: Quantised Gossip <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.147</p><p>This Holochain release was a quiet rollout of a change we’ve been working on and getting excited about for a while: a new syncing strategy for rrDHT called Quantised Gossip. It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holohost/comments/vruaqb/todays_update_july_5_2022_new_quantized_gossip/">patent application</a> for it.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.</p><p>Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.</p><p>But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.</p><p>So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">intro to rrDHT</a>, the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">Core Concepts article on the DHT</a>, and this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/developers-developers-developers-developers/#holochain-00132-unidirectional-arcs">small Dev Pulse section</a> about a recent change to arcs.</p><p>Previously, we were using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>. It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.</p><p>The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.</p><p>Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.</p><p>Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.</p><p>[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.] rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.</p><p>There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://docs.rs/kitsune_p2p_dht/0.0.1/kitsune_p2p_dht/index.html">fantastic documentation on Quantised Gossip</a> and the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220701181019">changelog</a> (note: doesn’t contain any notes, just links to the list of versioned crates in the release).</p> Holochain 0.0.148: Enzymatic countersigning functional <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.148 and above</p><p>Holochain 0.0.145 introduced changes to ‘enzymatic countersigning’ (explained below), including the ability to add optional signers. At that point it wasn’t yet operational — the required data structures were simply ready for future functionality — but now the networking layer fully supports it. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1472">#1472</a>)</p><p>So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.</p><p>But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#fork-source-chain">forked</a>’ their chain.</p><p>Enzymatic countersigning partially solves this problem. In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.</p><p>Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing. Some signers can be offline and the session will still complete — as long as the enzyme is online. That’s because an enzyme is a necessary participant when optional signers are involved; they’re the one who determines exactly which optional signers get recorded as counterparties, so that everyone can validate the transaction in a consistent manner.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220706013407">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.149: Documentation <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12, 0.0.13<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140, 0.0.141</p><p>This release added top-level crate documentation for the HDI library <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.13/holochain_deterministic_integrity/"><code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code></a> and a section on <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.141/hdk/#integrity-zomes-">integrity</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.141/hdk/#coordinator-zomes-">coordinator</a> zomes in the HDK documentation.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220710155915">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.150: holochain_deterministic_integrity → hdi <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12, 0.0.13, 0.0.14<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140, 0.0.141, 0.0.142</p><p>Breaking: The <code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code> crate’s name has been shortened to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdi"><code>hdi</code></a>.

This better reflects its purpose. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1493">#1493</a>)  New: The <code>genesis_self_check</code> callback now has access to <code>dna_info()</code> and <code>zome_info()</code>. As this callback is an opportunity to ‘prevalidate’ a membrane proof before trying to join a network, it’s crucial for it to have access to things like the DNA’s <code>properties</code> block which may have information necessary for membrane proof validation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1491">#1491</a>)  Breaking/New: The payloads of the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.13/holochain_integrity_types/op/enum.Op.html">Op</a></code> enum variants have changed; now they are all tuples that contain a single struct. There are also some new op helpers available in the HDI to make validation callbacks nicer to write — specifically, it gives access to the most common bits of an operation as well as your defined entry and link types, making it faster to get to the thing you actually want to validate. Check out the documentation for <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.15/hdi/op/trait.OpHelper.html">OpHelper</a></code> and <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.15/hdi/prelude/enum.OpType.html">OpType</a></code>, as well as the tests, to see how you can structure your match arms for ops. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1488">#1488</a>)  Bugfix: DNAs are now bundled deterministically, which means that a collection of zomes and a DNA manifest file will now always result in the same DNA hash when <code>hc dna pack</code> is run. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1479">#1479</a>)  As always, there are more documentation updates for the <code>hdi</code> and <code>hdk</code> crates. Dear reader, I know that I mention this in every release announcement and you may be getting bored, but the developer experience advocate in me gets a little thrill every time I see that a new component gets more thorough documentation.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220728122329">changelog</a>.</p> Some notes on how we name and number our SDKs <p>Since we’ve changed the name of the HDI crate, I thought I’d review what the two core SDKs for writing hApps are about.</p>  Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) is an SDK that lets integrity zomes interface with the conductor that hosts them. Integrity zomes are the packages of code that define rules of valid behaviour in an application’s network, including the shape of public DHT data. It only gives code access to purely deterministic functions — the minimum required to get the job of validation done.  Holochain Development Kit (HDK) is a more full-featured SDK that gives coordinator zomes access to everything in HDI plus functions that have side effects, such as writing to a source chain or pinging another participant, and non-deterministic functions, such as generating a random number or querying the DHT for a collection of links.  <p>I’ve always been a bit uncomfortable with the name HDK, because there’s already a perfectly good name for that sort of thing: an SDK (and besides, ‘HDK’ already means <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22hardware+development+kit%22&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">‘hardware development kit’</a>). So while the HDK’s crate will still be named <code>hdk</code>, we’re going to call it the Holochain SDK whenever we’re speaking about it to general audiences. That should make it clearer to new developers what it’s about and what it’s used for.</p><p>Additionally, some people have pointed out that we promised that HDI 0.1, the ‘Stable Validation’ milestone, was going to be ready in time for the Developer Immersive, and we’re still only at version 0.0.14. It is indeed true that we didn’t bump the version number to 0.1, but the core devs did meet their target: a stable, feature-complete, relatively frozen HDI ready for course participants to start hacking on and using long-term.</p><p>We still have some more changes to make (partly based on feedback from course participants), and then we’ll likely cut a 0.1 release. In the meantime, the HDI’s API isn’t likely to receive any breaking changes — only updates.</p> electron-holochain and holochain-runner updates: Holochain 0.0.149, Lair 0.2 <p>electron-holochain and holochain-runner, two projects from dev shop <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> that bundle up the conductor, Lair keystore, and your hApp into a single binary, have received updates that bump the supported Holochain version to 0.0.149 and Lair 0.2.0. If you’re using either of these projects in your development workflow, you can now update to newer Holochain support.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain">electron-holochain on GitHub</a>  <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/holochain-runner">holochain-runner on GitHub</a>   Holochain Launcher: Two releases  0.4.9: Get your hApp into the hApp store! <p>This release updates the bundled version of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a> hApp, the “distributed app for distributing distributed apps”, to 0.7.1. In addition to various <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas/compare/v0.7.0...develop">data model changes</a>, this version sets the foundation for reviews, reactions, and ratings. And the Launcher now recognises when you tag your hApp release with the <code>app-store-ready</code> tag and will display it in its built-in App Library. The App Library already made it as easy to install a hApp as it is to install an app on your smartphone; now you can easily publish your production-ready hApps too!</p><p>Note: There are no new conductor, Lair, or HDK releases supported in this version.</p> 0.4.10: Bump Holochain support to 0.0.150 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.10">This release</a> adds support for Holochain 0.0.150 / HDK 0.0.142, and removes support for everything older than Holochain 0.0.143 / HDK 0.0.136.</p> Q&amp;A with hREA project <p>This is a project I’m very excited about. It’s hard to explain exactly what it is, so I’ll just call it a toolkit for building applications that support cooperative economies that are rich with information beyond mere price. I think it has the capacity to redefine our view of the economic world, which could also shape our relationship with the world outside of economics and lead us into a more respectful, regenerative presence in this planet. (If you doubt that accounting systems can have an impact on the world, consider how double-entry bookkeeping, with its isolated entities receiving inputs and producing outputs — its rejection of every uninteresting effect as ‘externalities’ — has caused us to overshoot our planet’s capacity to sustain us.)</p><p>hREA is gearing up for a major milestone release, likely sometime this fall, so they’re deep in development. Their team is expanding and I’m seeing design and engineering discussions flying around left and right.</p><p>The hREA team recently invited the world to join them in a Q&amp;A session about the project. If you’re interested in using software for building sustainable marketplaces and economies, check out this video to learn what they’re about:</p> But what about the Developer Immersive? <p>It was amazing. Powerful instruction, rapid learning, wonderful people, beautiful scenery, good food. I’ll share a lot more next week.

			  Héctor Castro Mateos is a QA Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you?  
<p>I am Héctor. I was born in Cartagena, a small city in the south of Spain. My family and I moved to Sevilla when I was very young, so all my memories are from there. I grew up and studied in Sevilla, spent one year in Milan as an exchange student, and eventually decided to move to Barcelona.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Ever since I finished my studies, I have been working as a QA engineer. I worked for different companies, both large and small, with various working styles. For a long time, I have been interested in crypto and blockchain technologies, and after working at my last company, I felt that it was the right moment to join this industry. I truly believe that it has the potential to change the world in many ways. I soon found Tokeny and, in my opinion, it was a perfect match for me. I like the technology, the amazing team, and their vision for creating something tremendously innovative. Now that I’ve joined the team, I am very glad to have this great opportunity.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Definitely as the best place I have worked at until now. The team is truly amazing. Everyone is very committed and there is a strong sense of belonging to a community. I also highly appreciate the fact that we can work flexibly and remotely.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Sports! I’ve been learning about training and nutrition for years and I love going to the gym and pushing myself to my limits. Also, I like trying out all kinds of new sports. As a result, I can now proudly say that I am an amateur in a wide range of sports including skiing, surfing, and boxing (but I am not an expert in any of them yet!).</p>
<p>My second passion is traveling. I try to do one or two big trips every year to get to know new places and countries. I love exploring new cities as well as getting lost in nature.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live a happy long life and be able to stay active and travel as much as possible. There are so many things to experience and places to explore. I want to look back at my life and feel that I had so many good experiences and that I made a positive impact on the ones around me.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>If you want to be part of the new blockchain era and contribute with your experience, this is your place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing how we will grow together and become a leading company in this industry.&nbsp;</p>

Sovereign Wallet, expanding the CBDC business with key partners in the Nordic&nbsp;regions<p>Greetings all,</p><p>Sovereign Wallet(SW) has opened its subsidiary office, SWN Global Sweden, in Stockholm, Sweden, to expand the CBDC business and networks throughout the Nordic&nbsp;region.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet chose Sweden as a strategic base for expanding the CBDC business among other Nordic countries because Sweden is considered one of the world’s most innovative nations, especially for the first pioneer of developing its digital currency, ‘e-Krona.’ Also, last year,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/16/bis-launches-innovation-hub-with-nordic-central-banks-focusing-on-cbdcs/"> the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) established a regional innovation hub in Stockholm with four Nordic central banks</a> (Danmarks Nationalbank, Central Bank of Iceland, Norges Bank, and Sveriges Riksbank) focusing on central bank digital currencies, so Sweden became one of the hottest and most attractive places for CBDC developing companies to open their CBDC research labs and business&nbsp;offices.</p><p>Since last year, SW has contacted and had many meetings with financial institutions, companies, and blockchain associations in the Nordic regions for CBDC cooperation. SW initiated <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/partnership-between-nordic-blockchain-association-and-sovereign-wallet-global-df7988066986">a partnership with Nordic Blockchain Association(NBA)</a> as the first partner and had another following <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/sovereign-wallet-metamui-partners-with-iamtn-to-revolutionize-cross-border-payments-cf25892cfda6">partnership recently with the International Association of Money Transfer Networks(IAMTN)</a> for collaborating business in&nbsp;Nordics.</p>Cizar Bachir Brahim, CSO of Sovereign Wallet, is doing a company presentation at Epicenter Stockholm<p>SW also started co-working with <a href="https://weareepicenter.com/stockholm/">Epicenter Stockholm</a>, one of the most vibrant and active accelerating companies in Sweden, and<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_se"> Ernst &amp; Young Sweden</a>, one of the world’s top four consulting firms, to set KPIs and goals for the Nordic CBDC business and other possible cooperations including Digital Stock Exchange and Digital Tokenization. SW has received regular consulting services from both of the companies since the end of last&nbsp;year.</p><p>During the consulting sessions, SW decided on market strategies and future road maps for the Nordic markets with the guidance of Ernst &amp; Young and Epicenter. For a smooth and flexible landing into the Nordic markets, <br>SW decided to establish a CBDC consortium with CBDC technology consultants and financial institutions to approach the Nordic central banks and commercial banks.</p><p>SW is now seeking partners, CBDC technology consulting companies, and financial institutions, who wish to work with us for CBDC and other business cooperation. SW started contacting some of the Nordic banks and financial institutions to showcase our CBDC demo in physical meetings this year. We are gradually upgrading our MetaMUI mainnet and CBDC platform to their needs and demands, and we are on the way to making the CBDC platform the final product&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>Please click the social channels below to catch up on our past and upcoming&nbsp;news.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

Enterprises need a way of governing end users wherever they are working and protecting a growing number of endpoints.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and ARCON as they discuss the security implications of hybrid IT and hybrid working, and how these risks can be mitigated. They will also explore the extent to which Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) solutions provide the capabilities required to manage privilege-related risk and improve IT security.</p>
<p>Paul Fischer, Lead Analysts at KuppingerCole Analysts will explain how modern compliance and security requirements demand that EPM should offer data governance capabilities and analysis in addition to traditional capabilities such as whitelisting and blocking file execution.&nbsp;Anil Bhandari of ARCON will explain the role of ARCON Endpoint Privilege Management in reinforcing endpoint security and how it uses User Behavior Analysis and Data Leakage Prevention features, including Data Intellect, to build a contextual security layer.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/security-benefits-endpoint-pam"></a>

<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re proud to introduce Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care Manager at GlobaliD. Meaghan has been working in the technology industry for twelve years, with about eight years of experience at startup companies. She holds undergraduate degrees in psychology and gender studies, and a Masters in Business Administration.</p><p>Now, she is helping us deliver a positive customer experience to GlobaliD users and partners. During our chat, Meaghan discussed her passion for customer support, how she’s built the customer care team at GlobaliD, and why customers are everything to a business.</p> Introducing Meaghan&nbsp;Decorpo <p>I’m Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care Manager. My team and I manage all customer-facing interactions at GlobaliD.</p><p>We’re responsible for all inbound customer queries and making sure they are set up for success. This includes things such as onboarding, restoration of account access, migrating accounts off the GlobaliD platform, and answering any other general questions customers may&nbsp;have.</p> What attracted her to&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>I chose to join the GlobaliD team because I wanted to be able to do more for customers than my previous position allowed me to do. I wanted to be able to have a direct impact on them and build foundational blocks for what the customer experience should be. I love being apart of the growth stage of a company and having the opportunity to build relationships directly with customers.</p><p>I also believe we have a truly impactful product. People want to be able to click a button and share their vaccine card or their insurance card. They don’t want to have to shuffle through their wallet or their purse. I can’t even tell you where my health insurance card is. Having something like the GlobaliD app when I go to the doctor’s office would be a monumental thing.</p><p>So the whole concept of identity that we’re building at GlobaliD, our values, and the ability for me to build from the ground up again in this role were the things that brought me&nbsp;here.</p> Why customers are everything <p>In my opinion, customers are everything to a business. Without the customers, we have nothing. So, it’s always been my goal to make sure that my support team or my customer success teams have put their best foot forward, because we are a reflection of the business and we need these customers. We need a backbone, and they are the backbone. That’s why I’ve always focused on building my teams around how we’re gonna best service our customers and their experience.</p> On the Customer Care team structure <p>Our team includes the solutions engineering team, which is responsible for our proof of concept post- or pre-implementation. Not only do we handle all of the outbound customer requests after they become a customer but before they become a customer, as&nbsp;well.</p><p>We’re in charge of the <a href="https://care.global.id/hc/en-us">GlobaliD Care Center</a>, which is a database of FAQs and articles, where our customers can find answers to common issues or requests. They can also submit a help ticket in the Care Center and receive support directly from one of our team&nbsp;members.</p><p>We also manage the GlobaliD Support Twitter account, where users can reach out to us directly with questions, concerns, and feedback.</p> The importance of community <p>I’m a huge proponent of being interactive within our user community. Connecting directly with the community gives us chances to drive home what GlobaliD is all about, provide real-time advice, and most importantly, truly understand what our customers’ needs&nbsp;are.</p><p>That was actually one of the driving factors behind us launching <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalidSupport">our own support account on Twitter.</a> It gives us a way to promote some of the fun stuff that the support team is working on for them, and the community knows there is a specific place on Twitter where they can reach&nbsp;us.</p> Providing a human&nbsp;touch <p>Our customers love that they’re able to interact with a real person. They appreciate the fact they’re not talking to a bot and that we constantly follow up with them. We recently updated our application so that if somebody wants to discontinue their account, all they have to do is click a button, and then one of our team members reaches out to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Customers said, “Oh, I didn’t think I would get a response from someone.” Well, we’re real people. We manually take care of this for you, and we manually follow up to make sure everything is complete. For them — to know we’re doing the right thing as a company and as a team — it really drives home the fact that we’ve built a top tier customer experience.</p> Her education and early career background <p>I have undergraduate degrees in psychology and gender studies, and I have a Masters in Business Administration. While they seem kind of random to me now, everything I’ve learned has helped me become a better leader and customer advocate.</p><p>I’ve worked in technology for about twelve years in a variety of different industries. Around eight years ago, I joined the startup world and just fell in love with the chaos. I found that I really loved the ability to leave my mark and build a strong foundation for customer support teams and businesses. Customers make me happy. Whether they’re mad or happy, being able to make an impact on a customer base has always interested me.</p> Her hobbies and interests <p>I have a puppy who we call Turbo — although that is not her actual name.

 IDnow’s recently-released ‘Crypto in KYC – Growth through trust’ ebook helps organizations to better understand the unstable market, and drive customer adoption while complying with regulations. 



 



<p>The unruly world of cryptocurrency could very well rewrite the future of global payments as we know it. As a still largely untapped market, it offers organizations an almost limitless number of opportunities to increase revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as an unpredictable frontier, cryptocurrency also offers its fair share of dangers and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">hurdles to overcome</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though there is no shortage of brands that are <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/what-brands-need-to-know-about-accepting-cryptocurrency-payments/">accepting payments in cryptocurrency</a> (Think the biggest: from Gucci to KFC), there are many more that are hesitant to enter the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But organizations that do not leave any room in their business strategies for launching a Crypto KYC solution are probably missing out on millions in revenue. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty of the last few months, the global cryptocurrency market is still worth around <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-market-value-slumps-below-1-trillion-3062569">€2 trillion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although still in its infancy, the cryptocurrency market is already showing signs of rapid maturity. Download the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-in-kyc-growth-through-trust/">‘Crypto in KYC – Growth through trust’</a> ebook to learn what the emergence of new services like Staking (letting users earn rewards for verifying transactions) and Lending (collecting interest from borrowers) means for the future of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Regulating Opportunities&nbsp; 



<p>With mature markets comes regulations and laws to govern use. There are also significant differences in regulation across regions and countries, according to a country’s rate and approach to regulatory adoption. Some countries like USA, Canada, and Germany have already started to integrate cryptocurrencies and virtual assets into their financial and anti-money laundering regulations. There are many, such as Malta, which have neither regulations nor restrictions regarding crypto trading, that have not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>La transizione energetica ha portato a un forte aumento della produzione di energia elettrica distribuita proveniente da fonti rinnovabili.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per far fronte alla crescita di risorse distribuite e alla conseguente esigenza di una rete sicura e stabile, <a href="https://www.arera.it/it/index.htm">ARERA</a>, l’Autorità di Regolazione per Energia Reti e Ambiente ha stabilito con la delibera 540/2021/R/eel che tutti i produttori di energia connessi in Media Tensione e che hanno una potenza nominale d’impianto pari o superiore ad 1MW devono installare presso i propri impianti un Controllore Centrale di Impianto (CCI).&nbsp;</p>



 Cosa sono i controllori Centrali di Impianto?&nbsp; 



<p>I controllori centrali di impianto (CCI) sono dei dispositivi che consentono lo scambio di dati, nella fattispecie misure e stati dell’impianto, attraverso il protocollo IEC 61850, tra:&nbsp;</p>



  gli impianti di produzione elettrica&nbsp;  



  il DSO (Distribution Systems Operator – Azienda per la Distribuzione dell’Energia Elettrica) e il gestore di rete.&nbsp;  



<p>Come previsto dalla delibera i CCI devono essere installati sia su impianti già esistenti che impianti di nuova realizzazione:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“il CCI debba essere presente alla data di entrata in esercizio per gli impianti di produzione di nuova realizzazione, mentre, per gli impianti di produzione esistenti, sia definito un percorso di adeguamento ad hoc”&nbsp;</p>



 Contributo forfettario ARERA per l’adeguamento degli impianti, come funziona?&nbsp; 



<p>Mentre per gli impianti di nuova realizzazione non sono previsti contributi per l’adeguamento, per chi si trova ad adeguare un impianto di produzione esistente, e quindi entrato in esercizio entro il 30 novembre 2022, ARERA ha previsto l’erogazione di un contributo forfettario, che varia in base alle tempistiche di adeguamento. Il contributo è pari a:&nbsp;</p>



  10.000 €, nel caso di invio entro il 31 marzo 2023 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento;&nbsp;  



  7.500 €, nel caso di invio entro il 30 giugno 2023 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento;&nbsp;  


 
 5.000 €, nel caso di invio entro il 30 settembre 2023 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento;&nbsp; 
 
 
 2.500 €, nel caso di invio entro il 31 gennaio 2024 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento.&nbsp; 
 


 InfoCert MID PKI per abilitare comunicazioni certificate dei Controllori Centrali di Impianto&nbsp; 



<p>InfoCert, grazie al suo ruolo chiave nella definizione delle regole tecniche di comunicazione tra CCI, è in grado di offrire a tutti i produttori una soluzione già pronta e conforme ai requisiti di sicurezza descritti nell’allegato T (CEI 0-16; 2021-06) in grado di abilitare i dispositivi alle comunicazioni in rete: MID PKI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MID PKI è una soluzione basata su PKI che consente di emettere certificati a un’entità (persona fisica o macchina) dopo un’adeguata fase di identificazione anche automatica (utilizzando protocolli come EST e SCEP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Utilizzando il certificato, l’entità può avviare un dialogo sicuro con qualsiasi sistema abilitato alla PKI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nel caso dei Controllori Centrali di Impianto, InfoCert è in grado di certificare gli apparati rilasciando loro una vera e propria identità digitale e abilitare comunicazioni sicure e certificate con la rete.&nbsp;</p>

  In the modern world of working, organizations need to digitally verify and secure identities at scale. But traditional IAM and CIAM strategies can’t identity-proof people in a meaningful way in the digital era. Finding an automated digital identity proofing system that is passwordless and provides strong authentication, is essential.

 Balance, cooperation and opportunity <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Raindy Lu, Head of Marketing at Ontology.</p><p>Web3, a familiar and unfamiliar word, has recently appeared repeatedly in major media reports and corporate publicity. However, how many people have really entered the world of Web3, and what are the things that are not accessible without&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>I believe that the first step for most people to enter Web3 is to use a CEX to create their first Bitcoin trading account, or to use the Metamask wallet to create their first Ethereum address, thereby opening their own BTC and ETH story. After that, they slowly touched more digital currencies, began to pay attention to their price movements and felt ready to hold them. We hope to realize the dream of financial freedom through such an emerging market. Some speculators who have tasted the sweetness have begun to publicize their belief in Web3, hoping to influence more people around them to join this “game”. However, this is by no means&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>If you want to explain Web3 in the simplest language, I think it is a decentralized collaboration model. This model completely subverts the traditional time rules and gameplay, enabling everyone to remove the shackles of centralized institutions and truly control their own data and identity, thereby promoting the development of a value-driven economy. Although many people still have reservations about the necessity of blockchain and Web3, it is undeniable that there are indeed many scenarios that cannot be separated from the necessary elements of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Decentralized storage ensures information security</p><p>Since the advent of the ARPANET in 1969, the Internet has enabled the interconnection of the global world. At the same time, tens of trillions of data information are also generated. It is increasingly difficult for personal PC devices to support the storage of these data, and hardware devices with powerful storage capabilities are often difficult to carry. Cloud storage emerged as the times required, providing a shared data storage platform for all kinds of users to manage and use their own data through uploading and downloading. Google Drive has reached 120 million users. Moreover, with the diversification of user needs, these cloud storage services have further expanded their business scope, such as Google Cloud, AWS, etc., by providing customized SaaS services to help enterprises achieve business transformation, improve agility, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation. While fully enjoying the convenience brought by these services to individuals and enterprises, various information leakage incidents are emerging one after another, and personal data trafficking has even become an industry.</p><p>The rise of major public chains in 2018 also stemmed from the awakening of this problem to a large extent. Unlike cloud storage, public chains refer to consensus blockchains that anyone can read, send transactions and obtain valid confirmations. The public chain is usually considered to be “completely decentralized”, all data is open and transparent, and no individual or institution can control or tamper with the reading and writing of data. It has the characteristics of protecting users from the influence of developers, low access threshold, and default disclosure of all&nbsp;data.</p><p>These are all impossible to achieve with traditional Internet services. With the development of the past five years, from the becoming of an Ethereum killer to today’s embrace of EVM, major public chains have gradually realized that it is unrealistic for one to dominate. Contention is the choice that is conducive to the development of the entire industry. On the basis of ensuring the security of node operation and optimizing TPS and other infrastructure, it has become a consensus to consider interoperability with other chains to the greatest extent possible. On this basis, each chain must also maintain a certain degree of focus. Whether it is DeFi on BSC, NFT on Flow, or DID on Ontology, they have gradually formed their own differentiated advantages and unique brand&nbsp;labels.</p><p>Decentralized identity protects personal&nbsp;privacy</p><p>In the traditional world, passports, ID cards and other documents are the certificates to prove our true identity, and they are issued by the authoritative institutions of the country. When we need to handle some specific business, we need to provide all our information to the institution as required. Take the matter of buying a ticket for example, we need to provide the airline with information such as our name, gender, date of birth, ID number, etc., and the ticketing process will only be entered after the airline has verified that the passenger meets all the boarding conditions. This information is often stored by airlines and used in other business scenarios of the company, which is why when you haven’t gotten off the plane, you will receive all kinds of airport shuttle services and travel advertisements on your mobile&nbsp;phones.</p><p>In fact, this is not a necessary operation. What they need to know is only important information such as whether the passenger is over 70 years old and whether there is a disease that is not suitable for the flight. So how to ensure the orderly progress of people’s daily life on the premise of protecting personal privacy? Decentralized identities offer a great solution.</p><p>Generally speaking, users can choose a public chain as the carrier for creating their own DIDs (such as creating ONT IDs on the Ontology chain) according to their own preferences, and then all the information uploaded by themselves will be recorded on this chain in a decentralized manner, to ensure that your information is safe and not leaked. For some chains that do not yet support DID, the wallet address on the chain can also be used as an identity identifier under its own specific dimension. Next, users can use zero-knowledge proof technology to authorize their on-chain and off-chain information to generate different verifiable credentials (VCs), which can be customized according to different business scenarios. As a result, users are no longer disclosing their naked personal information, but only large-scale VC results. If Alice originally filled in the airline’s information of being born on January 1, 1990, it can be converted into Alice’s age of&nbsp;18.</p><p>The scene is transferred to the world of a crypto native, and DID is also an excellent tool for users to manage various on-chain addresses, assets, applications, etc. in a unified manner. With the support of decentralized domain name services, everyone can create their own domain names on platforms such as ENS in a personalized way and bind their own wallet addresses. Some new Web3 projects have also begun to extend services to Mirror blog, various on-chain DeFi dApps, and the binding and invocation of traditional Web2 social applications such as Twitter and LinkedIn. They provide users with integrated management tools that integrate Web2 and Web3, and some of them also provide various data analysis functions on this basis to optimize user experience.</p><p>In addition, all on-chain behavior records of users can also form their own on-chain reputation, which can be applied to more scenarios through KYC to open up the off-chain world.</p><p>Web3 creates a new personal income&nbsp;model</p><p>Since Web3 is a new mode of collaboration, individual contributions to collaboration also require a new mode of giving back to incentivize continuous investment. For a single blockchain platform, the individual participation method can be to operate a node in the POS network and obtain a share of the platform transaction fee. These divisions are often based on parameters such as the number of platform coins on individual operating nodes, and the operating time. Another hot scene is decentralized finance. The DeFi Summer in 2020 once triggered a wave of mining for all people, by staking their own tokens to different DeFi protocols, or through ghostwriting operations to obtain project parties. The incentive tokens provided can realize the appreciation of their own digital assets at one&nbsp;time.</p><p>When DeFi faded from the short-lived bubble, it was replaced by NFTs as the new sweet and pastry. An important concept is introduced — the creator economy. Whether it is a writer, graphic designer, any type of creator can cast their works into NFT, set their own prices or release them to the NFT market in a way that allows public auctions, buyers can buy according to their own aesthetics and preferences, and choose whether to carry out secondary circulation. In this way, it provides creators with new revenue channels and accelerates transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. On this basis, creators can also gradually build their own fan community, and these loyal fans are likely to become their regular customers and continue to buy their&nbsp;art.</p><p>Various types of X-To-Earn, which were popular some time ago, have organically combined blockchain with online games or applications, and while fully ensuring playability, superimposed various token earning modes. Then it is extended to application scenarios such as item purchase and transaction, and builds its own independent ecosystem for each application. Through cooperation with major IPs, the user interface will be expanded to non-Web3 groups. Although I don’t know what blockchain is, I want to come and&nbsp;play.</p><p>Another personal income model scenario is in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Unlike the collaborative model of traditional organizations, the biggest advantage of DAOs is their permissionless nature. In the traditional world, to join a company, an individual must prove academic qualifications and relevant experience, and then go through multiple rounds of interviews. There is no restriction on joining a DAO, it requires you to find a suitable role in the DAO, and you can get corresponding rewards according to the rules of each DAO for completing specific tasks, and this collaboration is global, not subject to physical space limits. Furthermore, this collaborative model is “bottom-up”, which avoids authoritarian problems. Each DAO member can put forward his own suggestions on DAO’s governance rules and incentive distribution methods, and make decisions through community voting. This realizes the healthy iteration of DAO to a certain extent, and encourages DAO members to contribute ideas and suggestions to the organization.</p><p>The above parts are only part of the changes brought about by Web3. With the gradual improvement of modern people’s awareness of the security of their own identity and data, the need to control their own time and space is becoming more and more intense, and Web3 will be effectively applied to more scenarios. On the other hand, the supervision of data security and privacy in various countries is also becoming more and more sound, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), and the China Data Security Law, etc. The promulgation of the bill, the big Internet companies will also face more challenges, only by embracing Web3 can they find the balance of interests between themselves and their users and achieve sustainable development.</p><p>Web3 has arrived, Let’s BUIDL together!</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications.

 The Three Core Qualities of a Cyber Leader in Our Day and Age 
<p>At the Cybersecurity Leadership Summit, we help you develop the core qualities of a digital leader. What are they?</p>
 
 Leadership: learn how to lead and manage your team members, and how to be a thought leader in uncertains times. 
 Resilience: in an era characterized by volatile situations, being protected isn’t enough. That’s why resilience is indispensable for all cyber leaders. 
 Technical: Being a good leader isn’t just about managing teams and risk. It’s also about understanding the technical underlying of all situations to be able to meet the best decisions.

<p>Penguins covered by oil, dozens of animals succumbed, more and more petroleum-yellow waves reaching the beaches. On January 15th 2022 around 40 km north from Lima the biggest ecological disaster in history of Peru happened, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/oil-spill-at-sea-who-will-pay-peru-worst-environmental-disaster">an oil spill</a>. These images caused us Peruvians indignation and I asked myself: “In 2022, why our lives still rely on extracting oil?”. This is clearly unsustainable and makes me wonder when we’ll see a world without oil.</p>
<p>Drawing a parallel with our digital lives, a lot is unsustainable too. Behind the scenes of our online shopping, digital tax declaration, chats with family across the ocean, and long hours watching videos, these delightful digital experiences can at any time turn into grey. In our digital lives such disaster is a data breach. &nbsp;The good news is that like oil spills, such misfortunes can and must be avoided.</p>
<p>Creators of digital services—which many of us are, directly or indirectly—must put their entire efforts into making our digital lives sustainable because it benefits everyone. Otherwise, we’ll see the oil spills within our digital lives.</p>
 The spill of data 
<p>From the 2010s when social networks and smartphones became ubiquitous, companies from all industries have been becoming increasingly greedy for data. With the view to gain as much data as possible from users, even if the data is not currently needed, it may be stored for later use. Many companies have followed <a href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/data-is-the-new-gold-how-and-why-it-is-collected-and-sold/">this paradigm</a> without objections. Leaving users asking why an online store needs to collect users’ gender, marital status, photo, access to your social media feed, and your location, just to name a few. With some services still collecting such data from customers today.</p>
<p>In light of this, what is the most disastrous event that happen in a company just by having stored an enormous amount of people’s data?</p>
<p>As you can now guess, the answer is simple: a data breach. A data breach is a security incident in which unauthorized people accesses sensitive, confidential, protected information stored in company’s data repositories. In practice, such information could be a person’s name, credit card information, medical records, passwords, etc.</p>
<p>A data breach is the oil spill of our digital lives. It will inevitably harm both the individuals whose personal data is now exposed, and the company that collected the data.</p>
<p>Not a single company can claim to be secure enough that a data breach will never happen within its domain. The more data a company stores and the more sensitive such data is, the bigger the disaster can become.</p>
<p>In the very recent years, you might have heard how <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3651489/ransomware-is-top-cyberattack-type-as-manufacturing-gets-hit-hardest.html">ransomware</a> has risen to the top of cybersecurity threats for organisations, but reports of data breaches have also continued growing every year. The damage for a company hit by a data breach can be devastating; both in loss of reputation and in fines paid to state regulators or as indemnification to the affected users. It’s sad to see that <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/cybersecurity-pandemic-lisa-forte/" title="healthcare institutions">healthcare institutions</a> are currently the top victim of data breaches.</p>
 How do data breaches occur? 
<p>Several aspects can go wrong and be the ignition factor for a data breach. From cloud misconfiguration to exploits in third-party software. Nevertheless, compromised credentials (mostly passwords) and phishing are the top factors for data breaches. Remote work has also increased the time to identify and contain a breach, as well as its total cost.</p>
 A broader view to prevent data breaches 
<p>Most of today’s techniques to prevent data breaches focus on advanced cybersecurity solutions, such as using artificial intelligence and endpoint protection. However, is this the first point to tackle? What if companies widen their perspective and give the individual a way to take part in the solution.</p>
<p>If we move our focus out of protecting the perimeter, how can we minimise the impact of a data breach?</p>
<p>The principle is simple: the less data, the less devastating the breach. Stop collecting unnecessary data, especially sensitive data. Eliminate the dirty practices of collecting too much data. These days any well-informed CIO would feel relieved after knowing that the organisation has stopped such practices.</p>
<p>Secondly, give people the power of self-service. Regardless of what your business calls them; customers, citizens, patients, partners, users, give them simple tools to edit their own data. Encourage them to use the tools, instead of hiding them behind dark patterns. Exercising the right to be erased should be as simple and quick as your nifty user registration process.</p>
<p>Myself I’ve collaborated with identity professionals worldwide and contributed to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/data-protection/what-is-consent-receipt/" title="Consent Receipt specification">Consent Receipt specification</a> by Kantara Initiative. Put it in short: today every time you accept privacy settings and terms, you don’t have a tool to modify those settings in the future. With consent receipts, you will be able to know exactly which consent you gave to whom, under which terms of use, and of course you will be able to revoke consent at any time. We need tools like these in people’s hands to make our digital lives sustainable.</p>
 How your company will benefit by embracing this 
<p>If your company builds great products and services that make our digital lives sustainable, you are the leaders leaving the skin in the game, and the rewards will come.</p>
<p>Benefits to companies:</p>
 
 More customers’ trust. There is no single week without the news showing that a web service has misused people’s data, whether comes from Facebook, Google, smaller tech players or from public services from across the globe. Thus, it’s not a surprise if individuals are sceptical of using a new app that the local government is launching. At the other side of the spectrum there are the services getting awarded, KBC in Belgium has been voted the most trusted brand in Belgium for the last five years, in part due to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow/" title="bank giving their customers a greater sense of that trust, privacy and control.">bank giving their customers a greater sense of that trust, privacy and control.</a> 
 More compliance. The new wave of data protection and privacy regulations led by EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is helping companies to set a higher bar for building their digital services. Your company will surf these waves no matter how high the sea rises. 
 Huge savings. What could be the biggest cost of doing this wrong? Naturally, the costs of recovering from a data breach. As you know, a data breach can have huge economic impact and even cause a company’s bankruptcy, like Finland’s <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252496227/Hacked-Finnish-therapy-business-collapses">Vastaamo</a> in 2021. 
 
<p>Finally, your employees want it too. There’s nothing more motivating for an employee, than to feel part of an organisation that cares about the human impact of its products and services. While also feeling that their own personal data as employee is well protected.</p>
<p>We can avoid oil spills, both the ones that affect our sea life and the ones that affect our digital lives.</p>
<p>Preventing a data breach—the oil spill of our digital lives—is better and less costly than trying to recover from such disaster. The fate is in our hands.</p>
<p>We can build better technology, we must do it, and we will do it.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (July 18 — July&nbsp;24)  Thailand, Japan, UK and India take strides towards crypto regulation. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly regulatory recap. Authorities continued stressing the need for tough regulatory measures against digital assets amid a considerable fall in the global crypto market cap last week, too. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Thailand Planning Stricter Crypto Regulations <p>Thailand’s Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking to tighten the supervision of crypto asset companies after a significant sell-off in the crypto market resulted in the failure of businesses, leaving retail investors with substantial losses.</p><p>Thus, the country’s financial regulator aims to modify the current rules governing the crypto industry, originally passed in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>“The extreme volatility of digital-asset prices has spurred the urgent need for improved supervision,” said Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol. “Our main focus will be to provide more protection for small investors, some of whom are putting most of their savings into these&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Plans to increase crypto oversight come as the SEC looks into potential losses among the public following Zipmex Ltd., one of the country’s regulated crypto exchanges, and its regional parent’s announcement of halting withdrawals.</p><p>Amidst the talks around the tougher stance of the country’s financial regulator towards digital assets, Thailand’s oldest lender and Siam Commercial Bank’s parent company SCB X has indefinitely delayed a $487 million bid to acquire a 51% stake in the country’s largest local crypto exchange&nbsp;Bitkub.</p><p>Visit here to read more: <a

Japanese Authorities are Seemingly Dissatisfied with Country’s Crypto Self-regulation Body <p>The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), the self-regulatory body for the country’s crypto industry, is coming under fire from Japan’s financial market regulator, the Financial Services Agency&nbsp;(FSA).</p><p>JVCEA is reportedly criticized for poor governance, lack of skilled staff, and slow implementation of crucial Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.</p><p>The FSA recently held a meeting with the association where it raised questions on JVCEA’s decision-making process and the responsibility of the board&nbsp;members.</p><p>Not long ago, JVCEA, founded in 2018 during the bear market, also came under pressure from the Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, who required the body to review its token listing screening criteria.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-s-crypto-self-regulation-experiment-not-working">https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-s-crypto-self-regulation-experiment-not-working</a></p> The UK to Boost Crypto Regulation <p>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set out to strengthen cross-border crypto asset regulation and use a data-led strategy to mitigate the risks of digital platforms.</p><p>Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the UK’s financial regulatory body, pointed to the FCA’s Digital Regulators Cooperation Forum, which plans to take a more proactive stance and intervene swiftly whenever risks related to financial crime are identified.</p><p>FCA plans to “deepen ties on crypto regulation and market developments” with US regulators as part of its regulatory approach to&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>The comments came after the UK, US, and Singapore launched the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) taskforce on DeFi and crypto market integrity risks earlier this&nbsp;month.</p><p>“We are demonstrably supporting responsible use cases for the underlying technology while ensuring it is not at the expense of appropriate consumer protection or market integrity,” said&nbsp;Rathi.</p><p>Since 2020, the FCA has only approved 35 crypto firms out of 273 that applied for registration with the agency under AML regulations.</p><p>Read more here: <a

India’s FM Calls for a Global Framework on Exchange of Information Around Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s Finance Minister, called for a worldwide framework for crypto and urged the other G20 nations to integrate crypto into the “Automatic Exchange of Information” (AEOI).</p><p>During her speech at the G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development in Indonesia, Sitharaman urged nations to look into additional non-monetary resources other than those covered by Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in the AEOI at this&nbsp;time.</p><p>She further highlighted a study by the Ministry of Finance that revealed that “tax evaders often set up numerous layers of entities to conceal their unaccounted assets.”</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://bfsi.eletsonline.com/sitharaman-calls-for-bringing-crypto-under-the-automatic-exchange-of-information-structure/">https://bfsi.eletsonline.com/sitharaman-calls-for-bringing-crypto-under-the-automatic-exchange-of-information-structure/</a></p><p>Although the crypto market was experiencing a rebound of sorts last week, surpassing one trillion market cap once again, the surge was a short-lived one as the market started reacting negatively to Tesla’s decision to offload 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, among other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>The regulatory landscape remained heated, too, with India and Thailand joining the action.

<p>Experts globally agree on one key point about decentralized identity: it will be essential to the evolving metaverse and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a>&nbsp;world. We’ll all be using personal keys, blockchains and decentralized applications to limit the amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;we expose to data brokers, data breaches and dodgy business practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts also say brands that go fast to market with this new technology will see huge&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-4-benefits-to-enterprises-from-proactively-adopting-decentralized-identity/">competitive advantages</a>. We agree.&nbsp;Discover how you can rapidly put decentralized identity solutions into your customers’ hands with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">Sudo Platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Brands should embrace decentralized identity now 



<p>We’ve been singing the praises of decentralized identity for a long time and a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/decentralized-identity-management-is-essential">Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;article backs up our view, saying companies should walk away from metaverse and Web3 vendors who don’t&nbsp;offer “a solid strategy for exploiting broadly adopted, decentralized, identity management standards and technology.”</p>



<p>Put simply, decentralized identity is the future of identity management on the internet. It&nbsp;gives a strong foundation for better user privacy, and it’s considered the most important privacy innovation of this decade.&nbsp;It’s also one of the most&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">important use cases for blockchain</a>, as our co-CEO and CTO Dr. Paul Ashley told a recent blockchain convention in Australia. Everywhere you look,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/10/how-decentralized-identity-is-reshaping-privacy-for-digital-identities/?sh=3ce8374a3226">experts</a>&nbsp;agree it’s time to get on board with decentralized identity.</p>



 Decentralized identity finally gives people control over their personal data 



<p>Decentralized identity is essential because, finally, it gives people a way to&nbsp;control what personal information they share online. It’s the answer to the greatest challenge consumers and businesses face today. Consumers are sick of trading their personal information for access, and companies are burdened by having to collect, store and protect customer data and fulfil complex data compliance obligations across jurisdictions.</p>



 Decentralized identity drives&nbsp;a new digital identity that is universal, trustworthy, and respects privacy.&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized identity puts the user in sole control of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;that forms their identity. It’s&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity allows a fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or a border crossing) so:</p>



  We don’t have to use email or usernames and passwords to login, carry paper or plastic versions of our IDs, or give out our personal information to every organization we want to access.  No central authority (e.g. bank, airline, Instagram, Netflix) needs to collect and store our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal ID information</a>&nbsp;(e.g. name, DOB, SSN, address, phone number etc.) and abuse it or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">risk losing it</a>.  We can take back control of our own IDs and personal information.  



<p>At the core of decentralized identity is the identity wallet and what’s known as verifiable credentials. The user stores their credentials and other personal information in their wallet, which is a digital app on their device. They don’t use a password for access; instead they have cryptographic keys which transparently authenticate who they are to businesses they want to interact with, and which secure their communications with those businesses.</p>



<p>The verifiable credentials are like digitally signed, digital ID documents. The digital ID documents establish trust, prove the user’s identity, and complete transactions. A trusted authority (e.g. the DMV) will sign the verifiable credential to prove its validity, and the user then stores and controls who sees their verifiable credential or part thereof, such as name, age, DOB, credit card numbers, employer, citizenship status and so on. When the user offers their verifiable credential to a business they want to interact with, that business verifies the credential to check the person is who they say they are. This signing by the initial authority and the checking by the verifying authority goes through the blockchain. Since the user is in total control of their ID information, you’ll hear DI referred to as self-sovereign identity.</p>



 Anonyome Labs is developing a wallet app and can help enterprise customers integrate the technology into their own apps.&nbsp; 







<p>So, what’s the takeaway message from experts on this new technology? This is the future and it’s time to act!&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Nasdaq&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/decentralized-identity-management-is-essential">author</a>&nbsp;puts it: “Thanks to advancements in technology like virtual reality headsets and mobile devices, we are at the cusp of the “fourth generation” of cyberspace – the cyberspace of our dreams (and nightmares). Alongside this technology refresh, we have an opportunity to a return to authenticity. As more people work, play, and hang out in virtual worlds, the digital identity management solutions of the past will no longer suffice. We’ll need new ways to ensure that identities are immutable and verifiable across the intersection of the virtual worlds of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">metaverse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>.”</p>



<p>We’re here for it. Talk to us today about how you can build&nbsp;digital products that let customers&nbsp;communicate privately&nbsp;and&nbsp;transact securely&nbsp;in an increasingly&nbsp;connected world.</p>

<p>With online gambling the preferred method for gaming in today’s society, both operators and players want to feel safe as the popularity of online betting continues to increase. However, with that comes certain responsibilities from both the operator and the player. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why does it matter?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lays at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;&nbsp;  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">online gambling</a> sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to this importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage Gambling and Fraud Prevention &nbsp; 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why countries such as Germany place heavy restrictions on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How ID Verification can assist in responsible gaming&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions, even during bigger sporting events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events, such as EURO 2020, can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planning for such events includes encouraging players to verify themselves before the event. Plus, by giving players options on how to identify themselves, as seen with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> options provided by IDnow during the EURO 2020, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/nfc-technology-for-id-verification/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. For example, during the EURO 2020, IDnow discovered that fraudsters were utilizing very well forged ID cards. The visual security features, like holograms and watermarks, were forged to perfection. And when an ID document is forged to perfection, it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>



 







 



 Preparing for the FIFA Qatar World Cup&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>With EURO 2020 having experienced high viewing figures as well as skyrocketing bets, the 2022 FIFA World Cup should be no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with the EURO 2020, operators need to be aware of increased activity and potential fraud with the prospective of increased player verifications. In order to handle such spikes in big sporting events, operators need to provide a streamlined onboarding process for players in order to smooth out the user experience and catch potential fraud risks. Focusing on fraud is vital during these busy periods because with the increase of players, comes the increase of underage gamblers and fraudsters alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back at the 2018 World Cup, <a href="https://www.casino.org/news/2018-world-cup-generated-e136-billion-in-bets-worldwide-fifa-says/">which saw an estimated €136 Billion in bets</a>, it should come as no surprise that 2022’s World Cup will be any different. The UK saw a 50% increase in betting from the 2014 to 2018 World Cup, and an average match in 2018 saw a betting turnover of €2.1 billion. With online betting rising in popularity, operators can expect rising numbers in player verifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By having a trusted digital identity verification partner, that has experience with player spikes and fraud attempts during big sporting events, online gambling operators can have full confidence in preventing such cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to prepare ahead of time, operators should encourage users to register early, just like with EURO 2020, providing their players with a more pleasant experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, with the FIFA World Cup taking place in Qatar, it is important to keep in mind that gambling is strictly prohibited in the country, but online gambling is still allowed since operators are based outside of the country. This may also have an effect on the increase of online betting, due to gambling being illegal in the hosting country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, this year’s World Cup is taking place during the winter months, instead of the summer months. Despite this change in schedule, gambling operators can still expect large numbers in players, since most people will already be indoors. Gambling online becomes even more comfortable during the winter months. </p>



<p>Plus, the Premier League season is set to start at the beginning of August and end right before the World Cup. It then picks up again right after the World Cup ends. For players, fans, and operators in the UK, it’s a continuous stretch of football mania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Leveraging IDV and KYC for Big Sports events &nbsp; 



<p>With the FIFA World Cup on the horizon, this provides a huge opportunity for gambling operators to prepare for the incoming wave.

  <p>In the face of today's uncertain world events, cybersecurity has never been more critical. With growing sophistication, cybercrime aimed at gathering consumer information continues to escalate at unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2022-consumer-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock 2022 Consumer Identity Breach Report</a> highlights that 2 billion data records containing usernames and passwords were compromised in 2021, a 35% increase over 2020<a>1</a>. And, in just the first quarter of 2022 alone, it is estimated that more than 75 million records were breached.<a>2</a>, This includes the following cases:</p>

  Hackers breached systems belonging to the International Committee of the Red Cross. They gained access to data that exceeds 500,000 people and disrupted the organization's services around the world<a>3</a>. 
	
	 A security breach at the Washington State Department of Licensing affected at least 650,000 professionals. Authorities believe Social Security numbers and some personal data were compromised<a>4</a>. 
	
	 Crypto.com incurred a breach that targeted nearly 500 people's cryptocurrency wallets. The thieves circumvented the site's two-factor authentication and stole $18 million of Bitcoin and $15 million of Ethereum. Crypto.com said it plans to move away from two-factor authentication to true multi-factor authentication<a>5</a>, <a>6</a>. 
	
	 A breach at FlexBooker, an appointment management business, affected approximately 3 million users. Confidential data, including personally identifiable information (PII), drivers license data, and passwords, was stolen by hackers and then offered for sale on popular cybercrime message boards<a>7</a>. 
 <p>Fraud is also on the rise and is extremely costly. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission data, "[U.S.] consumers reported losing more than $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021, an increase of more than 70 percent over the previous year<a>8</a>." In the United Kingdom, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) reports that between November 2020 and 2021, residents and businesses were victims of approximately 40,586 cases of fraud and cybercrime per month, totalling £2.5 billion<a>9</a>.</p>

<p>Statistics like these have cybersecurity professionals asking "What is our weakest security link?" and, "How can I best protect our customers and my organization?"</p>

 Traditional Digital Identity Is the Weakest Cybersecurity Link 

<p>In an effort to mitigate costs, many organizations have tried modifying their current employee identity and access management (IAM) systems to meet trends and demands rather than invest in a purpose-built, enterprise-grade customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution. Unfortunately, these retooled traditional digital identity systems are failing to protect consumers against the sophistication of cybercriminals and fraudsters.</p>

<p>For example, Experian states: "Our research shows that companies earning consumer trust leverage automated solutions to identify and protect customers across their online journey…" Yet, legacy IAM uses static rules to make decisions. For instance, it was not designed to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze and adjust access based on risk signals or a user's behavior. Nor was it built to scale and manage billions of consumer and internet of things (IoT) identities, and thousands of concurrent sessions without incident.</p>

<p>The consequences of organizations continuing to use traditional IAM has resulted in digital identity emerging as the weakest cybersecurity link.</p>

<p>A survey of 488 IT and cybersecurity leaders by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) shows that 45% of organizations have suffered a breach due to identity-related threats<a>10</a>. This is largely due to the fact that, for the fourth consecutive year, unauthorized access is the leading gateway for criminals to enter an organization. As detailed in the ForgeRock 2022 Consumer Identity Breach Report, unauthorized access accounted for 50% of all records breached — up from 45% in 2020.</p>

 Enterprise CIAM Is Purpose-Built to Protect Your Consumers Against Today's Cybercrime 

<p>When it comes to implementing cybersecurity that protects your consumers and your organization, it is time to be proactive.</p>

<p>The good news is that modernizing your digital identity infrastructure with enterprise-grade CIAM results in greater security for your consumers and your organization. It also improves experiences and reduces your overall costs. For example, a Forrester Consulting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-total-economic-impact">Total Economic Impact™ study</a> of ForgeRock CIAM showed a 40% reduction in security-related call center volume, resulting in a benefit of $24 million.</p>

<p>How are such benefits achieved? Enterprise-grade CIAM includes modern capabilities such as passwordless and multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-powered user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and secure impersonation (a best practice for help desk and call center security). These and much more help you support a Zero Trust security model that significantly mitigates risk and reduces the cost of fraud. In fact, thanks to ForgeRock, a large global financial services organization reduced credit card fraud by 67%.</p>

<p>With a purpose-built CIAM platform at the ready, the security risks caused by your legacy digital identity systems can quickly be a thing of the past.</p>

 Overview concepts 

<p>This section quickly covers a few key concepts.</p>

 Org URL 

<p>When you’re starting out with Okta, you’re provided an Org URL. This is what you’ll use to set up all of your applications. Think of it as a reference ID that lets Okta figure out who you are and which projects are yours. If you want to learn more about the complexities of the Org URL (it has many more features than what we’ve just described and it’s possible to have more than one depending on your needs), you can read about it here: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/#org-features">Org URL features</a>.</p>

 Tokens, client ID, and client secret 

<p>You’re also provided some information for authentication. It can get a bit confusing as there are tokens, client IDs, and client secrets. You need to use all three for the Okta application we’re working on today. Let’s quickly go over what each thing does for you.</p>
 
   Tokens - these are like an API key. You’re going to provide the token so that you can authenticate with the API. You use this for every request and it contains details about what you can and can’t access. Tokens are presented to you only once, and never shown again. However, if you forget your token but you authenticate with the CLI, you can retrieve it. We’ll go over that in a bit. 
   Client ID - this is a way to say which application you’re working with. 
   Client secret - a password that goes with your client ID and gives you permission to access a particular application. 
 

<p>Not every project needs all three of these things. You will generally need a token, you may not always need the other items. Sometimes you may require additional credentials when integrating with third party applications.</p>

 Configure the Okta CLI 

<p>Let’s get the Okta CLI installed. Okta has a great <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">resource page</a> about the CLI and it contains installation instructions. We’re going to do ours slightly differently from the instructions, so be sure to follow the steps here.</p>

 
   Install the CLI with the provided command:
       <code>brew install –cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta
</code>       
   
   Check and see if the CLI is accessible by trying out a command. If everything’s working you’ll see some information about how to use the CLI presented.
       <code>okta –help
</code>       
   
   Next, we need to log in. We already have our Okta developer account, so in the Terminal, type:
       <code>okta login
</code>       
   
   
    <p>Now we want to provide the credentials we are asked for. When asked for your organization, this is the URL that appears in your developer account in the upper right corner. Type out the entire URL, if the format is different the CLI will make you enter it again. You’ll also need an API token. In your developer dashboard, from the choices on the left, click Security and choose API.</p>
   
   
    <p>On the API screen you can see your organization URL(s) and a tab called Tokens. Click the Tokens tab.</p>
   
   
    <p>On the Token page, you can manage and see all the tokens you’ve created. You can’t see the token’s value after creating it, so save the token information somewhere secure. Click Create Token.</p>
   
   Follow the Create Token wizard to make your new token, and save the value to put in the CLI when prompted for credentials. 
 

<p>After you’ve done this, you will have a developer account associated with the CLI. If you want to change it you can wipe the file and log in with a different Org URL and credentials. For now, let’s leave it set up.</p>

 Configure the project 

<p>If you download the CLI, you can type <code>okta start flask</code> and follow the provided instructions to get the project set up. The <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-flask-sample">GitHub repository</a> will be downloaded for you and the environment variables will be configured in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

<p>NOTE: You need to enter the URIs you want to use to redirect. In the CLI these are referred to as Redirect URIs. In your developer dashboard, they’re called Sign-in redirect URIs. For this walkthrough, we’ll use: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. You can use other localhost ports, just be sure to write out the link with the <code>/authorization-code/callback</code> added at the end. You also need to add your Post Logout Redirect URIs. In the developer dashboard, these are called Sign-out redirect URIs. Since we used localhost:3000, the URI will be: <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>.</p>

 Create an application (optional) 

<p>This section goes over how you can create an Okta application yourself instead of having it automatically configured for you. You might want to learn this process for other projects, or if something goes wrong when you configure the CLI and set up the project. There’s a variety of ways to do this, since we’re using the CLI let’s create an application there.</p>

<p>NOTE: The CLI doesn’t allow you to make all kinds of applications, only some, so it is important to learn to create apps in the developer dashboard too.</p>

 
   In the terminal type:
       <code>okta apps create
</code>       
   
   
    <p>You’re prompted to name your new application. Name it.</p>
   
   
    <p>Next you’re asked what kind of application you want to make. We are making a web application, so choose 1.</p>
   
   
    <p>For framework, choose 1.</p>
   
   
    <p>You need to enter the URIs you want to use to redirect. In the CLI these are referred to as Redirect URIs. In your developer dashboard, they’re called Sign-in redirect URIs. For this walkthrough, we’ll use: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. You can use other localhost ports, just be sure to write out the link with the <code>/authorization-code/callback</code> added at the end.</p>
   
   You also need to add your Post Logout Redirect URIs. In the developer dashboard, these are called Sign-out redirect URIs. Since we used localhost:3000, the URI will be: <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. 
 

 Run the project 

<p>You can run the project now. Type:</p>

   <code>python3 -m flask run --port=3000
</code>   

<p>And try walking through hosted authentication with Okta! If all goes well, you’ll see this screen to start with:</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you click the Login button, you’re then taken to a form where you can enter your email and password:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will know you’ve successfully logged in when you see a screen displaying some information about your profile:</p>

<p></p>

 Troubleshooting - Help, it’s not working! 

<p>Never fear, the troubleshooting section is here to help you figure out what’s going wrong with your application. Look for the item that matches your problem and read on to learn how to fix it.</p>

 It says I’m not authorized to view localhost:5000 

<p>If your Mac runs Monterey or later, it uses port 5000 for the AirPlay Receiver. If you have access to the Sharing folder on your computer, you may be able to shut it off and run the application at that point. If you want to try that, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-airplay">follow these instructions</a> to turn off the AirPlay Receiver.</p>

<p>You should then be able to use <code>localhost:5000</code> again.</p>

 I tried everything and I still can’t view localhost:5000 

<p>If you cannot access the Sharing folder on your Mac due to permissions, or you tried shutting off AirPlay Receiver and it still isn’t letting you see <code>localhost:5000</code>, then change the project to use <code>localhost:3000</code>. You’ll need to do these things for that to work:</p>

 
   In your copy of the project, navigate to app.py. Change:
       <code>app.run(host="localhost", port=5000, debug=True)
</code>       
    <p>To:</p>
       <code>app.run(host="localhost", port=3000, debug=True)
</code>       
   
   
    <p>In app.py, go to where it says # get request params and in the json for query_params change the redirect_uri from <code>http://localhost:5000/authorization-code/callback</code> to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>Log in as an administrator to your Okta developer account. Your login URL for this will be your Organization URL, with a tweak to show you’re logging in as the administrator. The URL takes the form of <code>https://dev-assignednumber-admin.okta.com</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the left panel, choose Applications.</p>
   
   
    <p>Click on the application you are using for the sample.</p>
   
   At the top of the General Settings section, click Edit. Then scroll down to the Login section. For Sign-in redirect URIs make sure it says <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. For Sign-out redirect URIs make sure it says <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. 
 

<p>That should solve the issue.</p>

 My application says I can’t authenticate 

<p>Sometimes, the <code>.okta.env</code> file does not populate with the information you need. If this is the case, you will need to navigate to your developer dashboard and grab the information manually from your application. To do that, take the following steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>Log in to your dashboard.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the left panel, click Applications.</p>
   
   
    <p>Choose your application. If you used the CLI to create the app as instructed, it should be called okta-flask-sample.</p>
   
   
    <p>Get the Client ID and the Client Secret. These map respectively to CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in your <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>
   
   
    <p>If you need your Organization URL, that’s up in the right corner of your dashboard under your email address. Grab that URL and put it in the <code>.okta.env</code> file for ORG_URL.</p>
   
 

 I have the wrong credentials in the Okta CLI 

<p>If there’s something wrong with your credentials in the Okta CLI, you can try changing them in the Okta CLI. If that doesn’t work, you might need to delete your <code>okta.yaml</code> file. It’s in a hidden directory. This file is added by the CLI, and it’s usually at <code>Users/yourname/.okta/okta.yaml</code>. Delete the entire folder and try what you were doing again with the CLI.</p>

 I forgot my API token, do I HAVE to make a new one? 

<p>If you configured your CLI correctly, you can actually retrieve your API token! The CLI stores this in a yaml file that’s hidden in the <code>.okta</code> folder. Navigate to <code>Users/yourname/.okta/okta.yaml</code>. Copy the token from there.</p>

 Brainstem leverages wearable devices to collect medical-grade data, provide analytics and allow users to monetise their&nbsp;data <p>Ocean Shipyard, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, is introducing a new grantee for 2022: Brainstem Digital Health. With the goal to facilitate access to large quantities of data collected by consumer wearable devices, Brainstem has the potential to revolutionise the provision of healthcare and promote research that will lead to new discoveries which will improve health and wellbeing.</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/j6FKyTFZQJ">Brainstem Digital Health</a> provides a scalable, decentralised platform for collecting medical grade data through wearable devices, including heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, and SpO2 through inexpensive wearable devices. Its users will benefit from data analytics and monetisation opportunities via Ocean Protocol.</p><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, said:</blockquote><blockquote>“Aggregating vital health data collected by consumer wearables promise to unlock considerable value across the entire healthcare value chain. What’s so exciting about Brainstem’s decentralized approach using Ocean, is that much of the value that Brainstem aims to unlock will be shared directly with individuals who contribute their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><blockquote>Max Campbell, Founder of Brainstem Digital Health,&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“The Brainstem ecosystem is building the next generation of wearable health insights through the creation of the largest and highest quality wearable health data set available for all to leverage. We seek to redefine the way in which users interact with wearable technology so that as opposed to being a part of the product, you own the end&nbsp;product”</blockquote><p>In addition to a unique set of monitoring and therapeutic features within the Brainstem application, users will be able to publish their own data to an Ocean Protocol-powered data union in collaboration with DataUnion.app. Subscribers, including but not limited to medical researchers will, for example, be able to access data using Compute-to-Data methods that support AI modelling.</p><p>Brainstem will promote the alignment of incentives that are needed for open data collaboration. This will be done through a Data Union that will enable data providers to publish their data in an anonymised, GDPR-compliant manner and receive both economic and social rewards, which will incentivise the growth of the ecosystem. Open APIs coupled with the recycling of network revenues through a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) will help drive additional 3rd party software and hardware integrations, which we hope will drive a virtuous cycle of insight generation that will promote research and yield new discoveries.</p><p>Thanks to a $30,000 $OCEAN grant by Ocean Shipyard, Brainstem will have the initial resources to commit to transparent and clear deliverables:</p><p>By the beginning of October 2022, Brainstem will create the data union backend and have it integrated within their App for data collection, along with the Compute-to-Data functionality. They will also have their datatoken and the necessary Ethereum integration for wallet authentication and rewards distribution.</p><p>Brainstem aims to complete testing of the end-to-end application, from running algorithms via compute-to-data on the dataset to supplying data and claiming rewards for it, by the first week of November&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data economy. Applications for the next wave of Shipyard contenders are opening in September.

<p>As long as identity verification mechanisms exist, fraudsters will always find ways to circumvent these barriers. Among those techniques is facial spoofing (also known as face spoofing attacks), in which a fraudster tries to bypass a facial recognition system into misidentifying him by presenting a fake face (e.g. photograph, 3D-rendered models, 3D-printed mask) to the camera. Scammers can also use AI-assisted methods like deepfakes, presenting the biggest challenges for face recognition solution providers.</p>



<p>To protect against such threats, face spoofing detection systems such as liveness checks have evolved to mitigate emerging risks. For example, looking at the texture of the face, the density of features, and the relationship between features can all help to determine whether a face is real or not. Such technologies allow operators to gain time during the onboarding process by having a higher confidence in the true identity of their users.</p>



<p>As businesses in the EU and beyond continue to digitize and shift their customer identification methods towards remote <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">KYC processes</a>, anti-spoofing as part of facial recognition plays a crucial part in the KYC mix.</p>



<p>Let’s take two graphic examples to illustrate how big facial recognition is going to be:</p>



  More and more services involved in customer-facing activities such as finance operators, iGaming websites or public entities, have started using facial recognition systems to verify their users’ identities.  By 2023, <a href="https://www.reservations.com/blog/resources/facial-recognition-airports-survey/">97% of airports plan to roll out facial recognition technology</a>. In the U.S., 100% of the top 20 airports use facial recognition to identify international passengers, including U.S. citizens;  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/09/19/the-future-of-biometric-facial-recognition/#7d246fc73c74">And by 2025, </a>72% of hotel operators may use facial recognition systems to interact with their guests.  



<p>Unfortunately, the widespread use of facial recognition and the fact that sensitive businesses rely more and more on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/biometrics/">face biometrics</a> for customer authentication led to a further increase in facial fraud attacks involving sophisticated techniques.</p>



<p>It is therefore even more important to understand how fraudsters operate, what methods they use, and how sophisticated and multi-layered KYC processes can minimize facial fraud.</p>



 Facial Verification methods under heavy fraud attacks 



<p>As a human paradigm, protection mechanisms are always meant to be broken.</p>



<p>As such, fraudsters are now looking at ways to walk-through facial identification systems by spoofing other people’s faces. For the time being, one must admit that they are talented and creative. Between static 2D or 3D attacks, deepfakes or AI-aided attacks, facial verification mechanisms are under heavy fire.</p>



<p>However, identification service operators also started to develop counter-measures. This cat-and-mouse game led to growing research work on machine learning techniques to solve anti-spoofing and liveness checks.</p>



 What are the most common facial recognition spoofing methods? 



<p>There can be various approaches for fraudsters looking to trick identity verification systems such as:</p>



  Accessing buildings equipped with facial identification systems, hence potentially stealing sensitive corporate information located in those premises;  Creating synthetic identities to register onto a service and commit other frauds (insurance scams, iGaming fraud, etc…);  Impersonating someone’s identity (impersonation attacks);  Avoiding screening and KYC checks or more generally, avoid being recognized by the system (obfuscation attacks)  



<p>In some cases, we observed some sort of collaboration between the “victim” and the “attacker”. Thus, while being live checked, the owner of the account who did not originate the face recognition sequence let the person through.</p>



<p>In order to get past facial recognition mechanisms, scammers will use face spoofing, also called presentation attacks, which can be conducted in two ways:</p>



  Static 2D: Attackers will use any two-dimensional objects with a flat surface, like a photo or a mask, to try to impersonate a genuine user. Although the static 2D method is the most commonly used, it is also the less sophisticated, even if it is proving on a daily basis its efficiency against low-grade systems. Moreover, some found a way to mimic live movements through a sequence of pictures displayed through smartphones or tablets, and added another layer of sophistication to this attack;  Static 3D: Attacks using 3D props such as 3D-printed masks, facial reproduction, or sculptures also found out how to tackle anti-spoofing mechanisms appealing to liveness detection of data points. Yet, there are simpler methods than others. For example, the simplest method would be to print a photograph of someone, then apply it to a deformable structure. On the other hand, the most sophisticated way would be to conduct a 3D capture of someone’s face to guarantee the highest level of details and 3D acquisition. However, rest assured that such methods request specific equipment and are very hard to setup on the fly.  



<p>In both cases, fraudsters conducting these attacks will most often use biometric publicly available data such as pictures from social networks. As people now share their pictures online more easily, fraudsters can now easily collect samples to initiate presentation attacks. In some cases, biometric data is illegally acquired on specific marketplaces.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, anti-spoofing mechanisms exist and can deter most of these attacks.</p>



 What mechanisms exist to tackle facial spoofing? 



<p>While spoofers deploy massive efforts to get past facial identification systems, service providers also developed an array of methods to identify presentation attacks.</p>



<p>The basic solution to detect these attacks is to compare the face of the user against the identity document he’s submitting. However, this mechanism can be easily spoofed and more sophisticated solutions are needed.</p>



<p>Thus, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a> provides better results to detect fraudsters. Liveness detection is the computer’s ability to determine if he is interacting with a physical person, or any other prop/video or photo presentation.</p>



<p>Two main domains can be drawn from liveness detection:</p>



  Motion: motion-based methods are traditional ways to easily detect static face presentation attacks, and one of the most common methods to deter dynamic attacks.  



<p>They are divided into two sub-categories:</p>



<p>a. Non-intrusive: One efficient anti-spoofing technique is to detect any specific physiological sign of life from the person submitting his identity. Whether it is eye-blinking detection, facial expression changes or mouth movements, those elements provide good results, especially against static attacks;</p>



<p>b. Intrusive-interactive: A simple liveness detection method is to also ask the user to perform an action and to verify if it has been done in a natural way that resembles a human pattern. This method is based on the challenge-response mechanism, and is efficient against both static and dynamic attacks.</p>



<p>2. RPPg(PhotoPlethysmoGraphy): This methodology differs from motion-based methods, as it will not look for facial movement or expression but intensity changes in the facial skin, characteristic of pulsation in blood vessels. This method can determine blood flow only using RGB images from a distance. It can deter most attacks, although one reported weakness would be high-quality video replay attacks, because of their ability to capture periodic variation of a face’s skin light absorption.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, some of the liveness checks are not bulletproof, as security researchers depicted. Weaknesses have been observed during liveness detection checks, while fraudsters used high resolution monitors to present videos to low resolution cameras and fooled the identification mechanism. Therefore, it is important to carefully select a vendor complying to the highest security standards in the market.</p>



<p>With that in mind, more complex and robust methods reinforce the anti-spoofing toolbox.</p>



<p>LBP-GPM (Local Binary Pattern-Gradient Boosting Machine) and LBP-SVM (Support Vector Machine) methods can work through complex algorithms, luminance and chrominance information in order to compare two inputs. The LBP visual descriptor can also used with SVM as a classifier for quality measurement to discern between live and spoof.</p>



<p>Other mechanisms based on <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/anti-spoofing-mechanisms-in-face-recognition-based-on-dnn-586011ccc416">Deep Neural Network (DNN) models</a>, involve neural networks and several neural layers to process an image, and determine if it’s real or fake.<br><br>In recent studies, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01562.pdf">researchers started exploring video-based transformers</a> (type of DNN) for face presentation attack detection, and showed promising results. Although most approaches are binary, recent research tends to look for spoof traces by quantitatively evaluating them and reconstructing live faces. Moreover, newest trends are not focused towards presentation attacks, but are now leaning towards machine learning technologies such as Neural Architecture Search, few/zero-shot learning or domain adaptation.</p>

 How do fraudsters try to fool the most robust recognition technologies? 



<p>If you have not heard about deepfakes, now is as good a time as any. Deepfakes have become increasingly publicized as concerns have conversely grown over their usage to create fake news. Deepfakes often refer to videos where a celebrity’s face is swapped onto someone else’s body.</p>



<p>They are now making their way into the identification game thanks to the progress of machine learning and availability of large-scale face databases. Identification service providers are having a hard time developing countermeasures against deepfakes, given their fast-paced evolution and sophistication level growing each day.</p>



<p>However, most actors from the identification services ecosystem are working and developing solutions to better detect deepfakes. Whether it is through ground-breaking methods like the one from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-michigan-state-develop-deepfake-detection-technique-11623859200?mod=article_inline">Facebook-Michigan State team</a>, or through comprehensive frameworks composed of different security layers, technologies and modules, it’s always possible to prevent  deepfakes.</p>



 Why biometrics solutions should be certified via FIDO 



<p>When testing against facial recognition systems, two main protocols are commonly selected: ISO 30107 or FIDO.</p>



<p>While both are international recognized security standards, they do not conduct security testing in the same fashion. While ISO compliance testing follows a liveness-only and a full-system mode aiming at evaluating the biometric system in different settings and against different presentation attack instruments, FIDO testing aims to test systems in laboratory settings, but also against mass population in real world conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, testing through ISO standards do not offer a set of metrics that would allow to obtain a “certification”, in contrast to the FIDO Alliance Biometric Component Certification. The latter presents 15 subjects to the system tested, 14 types of attack, and a total of 2100 presentations.</p>



<p>As a member of the FIDO Alliance, IDnow offers certified biometric checks, that complies with the highest biometric standards on the market.</p>

 Acentrik, a decentralized data marketplace for enterprises, built on Ocean Protocol — is now in Enterprise Release <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> the Web3 platform to unlock data services for AI and business innovation, has joined forces with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, the decentralized data marketplace by Mercedes-Benz, on its recently launched Enterprise Release. Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. As part of the collaboration, the most important Ocean features have been leveraged and integrated into Acentrik V1.0 as well as key adaptations for enterprise users.</p><p>Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Ocean founder, Bruce&nbsp;Pon:</p><blockquote>“Acentrik is the result of two years of collaboration to help launch an enterprise data marketplace built on Ocean technology. We look forward to continuing to support Mercedes-Benz as they take ambitious steps to lead the pack and kickstart a Data Economy”.</blockquote><p>Srikanth Kaja, General Manager of Emerging Technologies at Daimler South East&nbsp;Asia:</p><blockquote>“Acentrik and Ocean have come a long way together — both teams have fostered a dynamic working relationship, which contributed to this successful collaboration. I’m excited to see what is in store in the near future, as we drive further topics to bring a much-needed decentralized data marketplace to enterprises today.”</blockquote><p>Built on the foundation of Ocean’s state-of-the-art technology, Acentrik’s mission is to make it easier for enterprises to unlock the value of decentralized data and enable greater data sharing in the community with the principle of data sovereignty at the core. The focus will be on developing two strong use&nbsp;cases:</p><p>1. To enable companies to buy and sell data over the blockchain</p><p>2. To enable companies to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>With Acentrik’s V1.0, enterprises can now publish datasets with parameters. By setting such API parameters, they can ensure more specific data is fetched from the endpoint. This allows for greater flexibility in publishing a dataset with Acentrik and setting boundaries accordingly — made possible by Ocean’s smart contracts, Compute-to-Data functionality and fine-grained permissions to better define access&nbsp;control.</p><p>Let’s dive into each of&nbsp;them.</p> Compute-to-Data <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a> is a core feature of the Ocean toolset that enables Acentrik to meet the needs of enterprises interested in sharing and monetising their data on its marketplace. Enterprises want their IP to be protected, Compute-to-Data allows this by generating a secure environment for data to be analyzed — algorithms can run on the data without the raw data being exposed. This feature resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing it whilst creating new revenue streams. By running privacy-preserving compute jobs, enterprises can benefit from data transformation across industries, with data sovereignty intact in the Acentrik marketplace.</p> Fine-Grained Permissions <p>A large part of Ocean is about access control, of the decentralized variety. Enterprises and other users often need more precise ways to specify and manage access and to address that, Ocean introduced <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/fine-grained-permissions">fine-grained permissions</a>. Acentrik leverages this feature on two main levels to establish a secure access control setup for enterprise-grade use cases on its marketplace:</p><p>1. Marketplace level restriction using role-based access controls — enterprises are empowered to grant different roles to multiple users belonging to the same enterprise to manage their assets well. There are three defined roles — user, provider and consumer. Roles are attached to both the user profile and the wallet connected. Depending on the preference of the enterprise administrator, a user can be granted multiple roles to satisfy their enterprise’s objectives.</p><p>2. Asset level restrictions using allow and deny lists — enterprises can manage access controls for each asset published. Data owners have the flexibility to allow or deny access to their assets through their email domain and wallet&nbsp;address.</p> Asset Management Token <p>Fungible ERC20 <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">datatokens</a> previously integrated on the Acentrik marketplace were built on Ocean’s data sharing infrastructure that represent a license to consume datasets on the marketplace. With the launch of OceanONDA V4 and the introduction of ERC721 <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671">data NFTs</a>, data management on Acentrik V1.0 has been made easier. Based on Ocean’s data NFTs, the Acentrik Asset Management Token functions to represent the ownership of an asset in the marketplace and support different licenses for the same base intellectual property.</p> Smart Contracts <p>The Acentrik Marketplace is driven by the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries that make it possible to publish data services, deploy and mint datatokens and Acentrik Asset Management Token, and consume data services by spending them. Acentrik V1.0 is launching on the Polygon network to ensure that customers experience cheap gas fees and fast transactions, this is one of the many EVM-compatible networks that the Ocean smart contracts are deployed&nbsp;to.</p><p>Now live in Enterprise Release, companies can onboard with Acentrik and experience the features of the marketplace.</p><p>To reach out to Acentrik’s team for collaboration opportunities, or to be involved in the product, you can reach their team&nbsp;<a href="https://acentrik.io/contact-us/">here</a>.</p><p>Explore more and register on <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements and chat directly with other developers on<a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/acentrik-a-decentralized-data-marketplace-for-enterprises-built-on-ocean-protocol-is-now-in-7fb7371e57d4">Acentrik, a decentralized data marketplace for enterprises, built on Ocean Protocol — is now in…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Christopher Schütze</a></p><p>During my studies and the subsequent first years of my career, I was already always someone who liked to share knowledge with others and present interesting topics. This is not the only reason why my profession has developed in the direction of IT consulting. In fact, in consulting, "being on stage" is part of the daily work. You present results in front of smaller and larger groups, you become more and more of an expert on a topic, and then at some point, you slide onto the bigger stage at small and large conferences. 3,5 years ago, I joined KuppingerCole and there, giving speeches on big stages is part of the job title. It is so much fun to share and discuss exciting topics at our conferences.</p>
 My personal speaking stand-out moment 
<p>A simultaneously good and bad memory for me remains a manufacturer event in Nice. A colleague and I presented our customer project at this event. Unfortunately, at the beginning, it didn't go as smoothly as one would imagine presentations to go. The clicker didn't work properly, and we had a lot of graphics with many individual elements to them. At some point, you start slipping into a certain inner turmoil. True to the motto "The show must go on", we made the best of it, and in the end managed to still win a prize with our project. Certainly, it wasn't my best presentation, but I learned a lot from it, and I would say that since then I'm much more relaxed on stage.</p>
 That one speaker that lives rent-free in my head 
<p>Of course, there are plenty of well-known personalities in the field of TED Talks. Perhaps I'll start by defining what makes a good talk for me: It's the art of presenting supposedly ‘boring’ topics in an authentic and entertaining way. This does not mean that you have to put on a show, rather that you primarily have to get away from completely overloaded PowerPoint slides. A few years ago, I had the honor of being on stage with such a person: Veit Etzold. Besides being an author of exciting thrillers, he is also an expert in storytelling. That's exactly what you notice. He can completely take over a stage with a FlipChart and his personal presentation style. Sure, it doesn't work for every IT topic, but it's still an impressive way to get your points across.</p>
 Many personal and professional advantages 
<p>Being a speaker means wanting to share knowledge and experience with others. To transport new perspectives, and to want to enter into an engaging dialogue with others. This is exactly what it means to be a speaker. This ranges from an impulse lecture for a subsequent discussion, to the presentation of the latest results from concrete technical problems. The great advantage of being a speaker is, of course, that as a technical expert you get a feeling for how interesting the topic is, whether you were able to convey it well and, of course, you very often get additional perspectives that can complete the picture in the following questions from the audience or in the subsequent conversations over coffee.</p>
 Moving Towards #CSLS2022 
<p>At CSLS, I'm looking forward to exactly what it takes to be a speaker. Meeting the cybersecurity family again, friends, colleagues, and the special opportunity to share knowledge and learn many new things in exciting workshops, talks and discussion panels. There is nothing better than being a speaker at a conference like CSLS and being able to share new trends, great solutions, and experiences with like-minded people. Only the Cybersecurity Leadership Summit in Berlin can do that.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a> is an ORM (object–relational mapping) tool for Node.js using TypeScript.  The software integrates with many of the most popular databases today, including MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MongoDB, and emphasizes a human-readable schema with a type-safe database client.  Prisma also includes other features such as migrations, seed data, and a virtual database browser.</p>

<p>In this project, you will use Prisma to connect your <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application to a database server.  You will build a schema to model a workout tracker application.  Then you’ll create some seed data and use Prisma to run migrations and seed your database.  Finally, you’ll create the web application using <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> to build the application frontend.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn’t require any prior experience:</p>

 
   An IDE for JavaScript.  I will use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> but you can use Webstorm, or any other IDE you prefer. 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 
   A database, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, or MongoDB.  In this tutorial we’ll use SQLite. 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>If you’d like to skip the tutorial and check out the fully built project, you can go <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-express-prisma-tailwind-example">view it on GitHub</a>.</p>

 Create your OAuth2 authorization server 

<p>Create a new directory for your application.  Use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to that folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your Express application 

<p>Next, you will use the <code>express-generator</code> application generator tool to quickly scaffold your application.  Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx express-generator@4.16 --view=pug
</code>   

<p>Now you can install your packages.</p>

   <code>npm i @prisma/client@3.13.0
npm i dotenv@16.0.0
npm i passport@0.5.2
npm i passport-openidconnect@0.1.1
npm i express-session@1.17
npm i -D tailwindcss@3.0.24
npm i -D prisma@3.13.0
</code>   

 
   <code>@prisma/client</code> is used to access the database from your server code. 
   <code>dotenv</code> reads configuration settings from <code>.env</code> files like the one produced by the Okta CLI. 
   <code>passport</code> is a middleware for Node.js that is flexible enough to handle most authentication scenarios, including Okta.  <code>passport-openidconnect</code> is a module for passport that lets you authenticate with OpenID Connect. 
   <code>express-session</code> is required for passport.  Express apps use this package for session support.  Your application must intiialize session support to use passport. 
   <code>Tailwind CSS</code> is the CSS framework you will use.  If you’ve never used Tailwind before, you may wonder why it’s a development dependency.  This is because Tailwind will dynamically build your CSS files from your views and configuration.  More on that later. 
   <code>prisma</code> is the ORM you are using.  This is a dev dependency because the Prisma library handles the migrations, seed data, etc., while the <code>@prisma/client</code> package is used in your application at runtime. 
 

<p>At this point, you will initialize Tailwind CSS and Prisma. You will configure them for usage later on.</p>

<p>Start with Prisma and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx prisma init
</code>   

<p>This command will add a new folder named <code>prisma</code> to your application. It also adds a file called <code>.env</code> to your project with some default configuration. Replace the contents of that file with the code below.</p>

   <code># Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema

# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB (Preview).
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
SEED_USER_NAME={yourOktaUserName}
</code>   

<p>In this example, I used SQLite because it’s easy and compact.  But one of the cool things about Prisma and most ORMs is that they can support many databases.  The boilerplate code includes comments about configuring your application for other database servers.  Feel free to use what you feel most comfortable with and use the appropriate connection string.</p>

<p>Your seed data will use the <code>SEED_USER_NAME</code> setting.  You want to ensure that it’s the same as the Okta username with which you sign in.  This will allow the application to associate your logged-in user with the data you will seed into your database.</p>

<p>Next, update your <code>package.json</code> file with the following code.</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "workout-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "node prisma/seed.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^3.13.0",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1",
    "passport": "^0.5.2",
    "passport-openidconnect": "^0.1.1",
    "pug": "2.0.0-beta11"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^3.13.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.24"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This will add the <code>prisma seed</code> command you need later.</p>

<p>Now you can initialize Tailwind CSS.</p>

   <code>npx tailwindcss init
</code>   

<p>You’ve now added a new file called <code>tailwind.config.js</code> to the root of your application.  Replace the contents of that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>module.exports = {
  content: ["./views/**/*.pug"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
</code>   

<p>In this step, you tell Tailwind CSS where to find the classes you used in your application.  You want Tailwind to look in the <code>.pug</code> files in your <code>views</code> directory.  Tailwind CSS is highly extensible, as seen by the configuration object’s <code>theme</code> and <code>plugins</code> settings.  A deep dive into this is out of the scope of this article, but I encourage you to look into Tailwind CSS’s site for more information.</p>

 Use Prisma to create your database 

<p>The next task is to create the database for your application.  Steps will involve writing the schema, writing some seed data, creating the migration, and applying the migration, which will also seed your data.</p>

<p>The <code>prisma init</code> task from above should have added a file called <code>schema.prisma</code> to your <code>prisma</code> directory.  Replace the code there with the code below.</p>

   <code>generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "{yourDatabaseProvider}"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model WorkoutLog {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    Int
  exercise  String
  amount    Decimal
  units     String
  date      DateTime
  minutes   Int
  calories  Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  id          Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String       @unique
  workoutLogs WorkoutLog[]
}
</code>   

<p>Make sure you replace <code>{yourDatabaseProvider}</code> with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource">the provider you are using</a>.  As you can see, this file defines the <code>User</code> and <code>WorkoutLog</code> objects that you will store in the database.  The <code>WorkoutLog</code> has basic information about the user’s workout on a specific day and then associates that record with the <code>User</code> object.  You can also define keys, constraints, and indices from this file.  Note the <code>user</code> property on the <code>WorkoutLog</code> has a relation defined by the <code>userId</code> to the <code>id</code> of the <code>User</code> table.</p>

<p>Add a file to the <code>prisma</code> directory named <code>seed.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require("dotenv").config();

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME },
    update: {},
    create: {
      username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME,
      workoutLogs: {
        create: [

  });
}

main()
  .catch((e) =&gt; {
    console.error(e);

  })
  .finally(async () =&gt; {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
</code>   

<p>Prisma knows to use the <code>seed.js</code> file from the command you added to <code>package.json</code>.  This file will insert the data when you run that command.</p>

<p>You can now add and apply the migration using the Prisma CLI. From the root of your application directory, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx prisma migrate dev --name init
</code>   

<p>The CLI has several ways to add and apply migrations.  I suggest you understand the best way to manage migrations for your environment.  The method above is the easiest and fastest way to prepare your database.  As part of the migration process, this command will look for the <code>seed</code> command from your <code>package.json</code> and run that as well.  Once complete, your database should be ready with a database full of seed data to work with.</p>

 Add OIDC authentication 

<p>Now that your database is ready, you can turn your attention to the core of your application.</p>

<p>First, add a new file in the root of your application called <code>ensureLoggedIn.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>function ensureLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect('/login')
}

module.exports = ensureLoggedIn;
</code>   

<p>This little piece of middleware will make sure the user is authenticated.  If they aren’t, you will redirect them to the <code>login</code> route, which you will configure to use Okta.  Otherwise, you will allow the user to reach the next screen.</p>

<p>Next, you can update your routes in the <code>routes</code> directory.  First, remove <code>users.js</code> as you won’t be using that.  Replace the code in <code>index.js</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'The Workout Tracker - Home', isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated() });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>Here you will pass a property for <code>isAuthenticated</code> so your layout page can properly display a login or logout button.</p>

<p>Next, add a file in the <code>routes</code> directory for <code>dashboard.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const ensureLoggedIn = require("../ensureLoggedIn");

/* GET home page. */
router.get("/", ensureLoggedIn, async function (req, res) {
  const username = req.user.username;

  const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: {
      username: username,
    },
    include: {
      workoutLogs: true,
    },
  });

  res.render("dashboard", {
    title: "The Workout Tracker - Dashboard",
    isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated(),
    user: dbUser
  });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>There’s a lot of magic in this route.  First, you are using the <code>ensureLoggedIn</code> middleware to protect the route.  Then you can extract the username from the request and look up the user in the database using the Prisma client.  Since the user has a property for its workout logs, you can pass the user as the model and parse the logs on the pug view you will create.  This will give view access to the user’s name as well.  Of course, you could query the <code>workoutLogs</code> table directly and include features such as pagination and search if this approach better fits your workflow.</p>

<p>Now, replace the code in <code>app.js</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>var createError = require('http-errors');
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');

var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var dashboardRouter = require('./routes/dashboard');

const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');
const { Strategy } = require('passport-openidconnect');

var app = express();

const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require('dotenv').config({path:'./.okta.env'});

// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.use(session({
  secret: 'CanYouLookTheOtherWay',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());


const {OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET, OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER} = process.env;

// set up passport
passport.use('oidc', new Strategy({
  issuer: OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
  authorizationURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/authorize`,
  tokenURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/token`,
  userInfoURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/userinfo`,
  clientID: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback',
  scope: 'openid profile'
}, (issuer, profile, done) =&gt; {
  return done(null, profile);
}));

passport.serializeUser((user, next) =&gt; {
  next(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser((obj, next) =&gt; {
  next(null, obj);
});

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use('/login', passport.authenticate('oidc'));

app.use('/authorization-code/callback',
  passport.authenticate('oidc', { failureRedirect: '/error' }),
  (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    res.redirect('/dashboard');
  }
);

app.post('/logout', (req, res) =&gt; {
  req.logout();
  req.session.destroy();
  res.redirect('/');
});

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/dashboard', dashboardRouter);

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
</code>   

<p>You updated your routes to properly use the <code>dashboard</code> routes as well as any login or logout routes that Okta will use.  You also set up passport to use Okta using the values the Okta CLI produced in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

 Add views to your Express application 

<p>By default, <code>express-generator</code> will add a few views for you.  You will need to edit them and add a new one of your own.  Start by opening the <code>layout.pug</code> file in the <code>views</code> directory and replacing the code there with the following.</p>

 <code>doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/output.css')
  body
    nav.flex.items-center.justify-between.flex-wrap.bg-teal-500.p-6.flex.items-center.flex-shrink-0.text-white.mr-6
      span.font-semibold.text-xl.tracking-tight.pr-2 The Workout Tracker
      .w-full.block.flex-grow(class='lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto')
        .text-sm(class='lg:flex-grow')
        div
          if(isAuthenticated)
            form(action="logout" method="POST") 
              button(type="submit").inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4 Logout
          else 
            a.inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4(href='Login' class='hover:border-transparent hover:text-teal-500 hover:bg-white lg:mt-0') Login
    
    block content
</code> 

<p>You’ll notice a couple of things about this file.  First, the classes are very specific and plentiful.  This is typical of Tailwind CSS.  Rather than defining how a specific element looks, Tailwind CSS strives to define how a particular style looks, then you can add and remove styles from elements to fit the desired look.</p>

<p>The other thing you’ll see is the Login/Logout button that will change based on the <code>isAuthenticated</code> property.</p>

<p>Next, your can update <code>index.pug</code> with the following.</p>

 <code>extends layout

block content
  .py-12.bg-white
    .max-w-7xl.mx-auto.px-4(class='sm:px-6 lg:px-8')

          a(href="https://www.prisma.io/") Prisma.JS 
          | for its ORM.  
</code> 

<p>There’s not much to talk about here.  Just a splash page with some more Tailwind CSS and some links to the technologies used.</p>

<p>Finally, add a file for <code>dashboard.pug</code> with the following code.</p>

 <code>extends layout

</code> 

<p>As you saw before, this page is protected.  Therefore, it requires that you have a user to access this page.  The application will pull the user details and workout logs and form them into a summary at the top of the page with a couple of tables of the logs based on the exercises the user has performed.</p>

 Create the CSS file using Tailwind CSS 

<p>The last part of this process is to create the actual CSS file that your application will use.  In your <code>public/stylesheets</code> directory, you’ll see a file called <code>style.css</code>.  Replace the code in that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

body {
  padding: 50px;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}
</code>   

<p>This is largely the same. However, you are importing the directives for each of Tailwind’s layers.</p>

<p>Next, you can compile the classes you used in your pug files and the style sheet you just modified to create a new CSS file. Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx tailwindcss -i ./public/stylesheets/style.css -o ./public/stylesheets/output.css --watch
</code>   

<p>Now you can open the <code>output.css</code> file and see the complete Tailwind CSS code.  The <code>--watch</code> parameter here is helpful for local development.  This will rebuild the <code>output.css</code> file each time you change one of your layouts.  You can disregard that parameter if you do not want to make any changes.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>You’re now ready to start your application.  Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run start
</code>   

<p>Once your application is started you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and see your home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Use the login button at the top of the screen and navigate out to the Okta login page.  Once you’ve logged in you will be redirected back to your website where you will be able to see your dashboard page.</p>

 What you learned in this article 

<p>In this article, you learned how to use Prisma to define a schema for your database.  You then learned how to create a migration from that schema and seed your database.  You saw that Prisma could be used with the most popular database options, including SQL Server, MySql, MongoDB, and more.</p>

<p>You also learned how to build a CSS file with Tailwind CSS.  We walked through a simple tailwind configuration and how the Tailwind CLI uses your code to build its CSS file.</p>

<p>Finally, you learned how to secure your express application using passport.</p>

With this move, Colombia joins the likes of the United States and the European Union in regulating digital assets amid a crypto market downturn.</p><p>The Financial Superintendence of Colombia, the country’s financial regulator, has presented the proposed regulations to the public and is seeking their comments. Currently, in the discussion stages, the proposal is open to receive suggestions until August&nbsp;12.</p> The Proposed Regulation <p>With its proposed regulations, the Colombian government seeks to clarify the definition of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and determine a set of prerequisites that banks need to verify before accepting cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers as customers.</p><p>The rules also cover general cybersecurity guidelines and set the ground for tracing crypto transactions and risk management systems to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and terrorism financing. And for this, the authorities will make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to be connected to the financial intelligence office of Colombia, the&nbsp;UIAF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The proposal also indirectly mentions the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule and states that VASPs must obtain, preserve, and transmit the information of both the originator and the beneficiary of crypto transactions.</p><p>Additionally, the proposal establishes that the VASPs must present clear information to their customers about the services they offer, the costs and risks associated with these services, and the virtual assets on their platforms.</p><p>These rules come following the launch of a regulatory sandbox (LaArenera) last year that helps crypto companies that want to operate in the country with the regulatory aspects and implementation of the technology.</p> The Popularity of Crypto Assets in&nbsp;Colombia <p>This latest move from the South American government isn’t surprising given the high interest in the asset class in the country. After all, 6.1% of Colombians own crypto, while 80% have reportedly shown a willingness to invest in digital assets. The country is also ranked fourth in the world in terms of Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin trading&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Thus, regulating this burgeoning sector will ensure that Colombian investors are protected and that no illicit activities are facilitated using&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Speaking of the Travel Rule, any VASPs that plan to offer services in Colombia must prepare for compliance beforehand. All that a VASP requires to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS), and we have an excellent suggestion: Veriscope. Interestingly, Veriscope is also the only solution against the “Sunrise Issue,” a significant problem that VASPs face during the Travel Rule compliance.</p><p>Read more about Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a></p><p>If you are a VASP and want more information on Veriscope, please contact the BizDev team here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">https://www.veriscope.network/contact</a>.</p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to remain up-to-date on all things crypto regulations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/colombias-financial-regulator-releases-crypto-regulations-draft-for-public-comments-fd6826d1754">Colombia’s Financial Regulator Releases Crypto Regulations Draft for Public Comments</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 ERC3643 Onchain Factory 
<p>One of the key principles we follow that makes our products and the blockchain ecosystem better, as a whole, is efficiency. Although the main purpose of the blockchain is to be able to share data and transact between parties without intermediaries, the speed and volume of the interactions are crucial to having successful blockchain applications via smart contracts.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we already automated a lot of operations by providing a complete system and APIs. The&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VWBdWP1fdDKbW5KPKWk7FBtkSW2NZxg54MMPx6N5bb0hG3q8_QV1-WJV7CgFTgW4Q5jB21JQpBhW225Kfd4YHk6nN3rcD4bYgrFSW1q2x6D7WxH6fW194wMD3ykmyLW8tw9C87Hk-57N8HtQ2K3SzPzW5WBDjx8tz_JsW7RBfhc8D4KyvW20HWfR4zckQFVD7qYF5TqFdxVFrXqW7scdySW7wvhhD6BQCqRF3h52-B-QgmW1_RM3Z7zFClWW7Yc9hy41J_1hW6ngV2R8_hZL4N3YFY5YnKLbcN2wBLxdSK4K_W5hSWmh3ZvtqJW3YH9Pz3HQBZTV_GnZ48fC-3q39Fj1">T-REX Factory</a>, a module of our software, triggers the right blockchain transactions at the right time, manages operations queues, etc. And for a few years already, it works great. But, it forces a wallet that Tokeny controls to be used for the deployment, and then to transfer the ownership to the issuer. Our goal at Tokeny is to empower our users and not to be a middleman.</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;with the new ERC3643 Onchain Factory, the wallet of the issuer can directly be used as a parameter in the deployment. The Onchain Factory is a smart contract that provides the automated completion of our entire ERC3643 suite. This program allows its users to deploy and configure everything from their tokens in only one blockchain transaction,&nbsp;without the need of additional configuration post-deployment.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Deployment of all smart contracts with a single transaction&nbsp; 
<p>Normally, in order to deploy the full suite of contracts of ERC3643 and configure them, at least 15 transactions (deploying the 6 main contracts and then configure them to fit the requirements of the token issuer) are required. In addition to that, there are also some transactions that can happen only after previous transactions are added in a block, as the output of previous transactions has to be consumed as an input for the next.&nbsp;Thanks to the Onchain Factory, you can have all tasks done at the same time under one transaction.&nbsp;Having the deployment process this way saves plenty of time and reduces the cost of gas fees.</p>
<p>Also, the Onchain Factory is a unique product because it&nbsp;allows the creation of the token smart contracts at predetermined addresses.&nbsp;This means that the Onchain Factory’s deployed smart contracts can have the&nbsp;same address on every EVM compatible blockchain. Thus, cross chain interoperability is possible under the Onchain Factory’s deployment. For example, if you switch from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon’s, you can keep the same token address and be able to view all future transactions on Polygonscan. Without the Onchain Factory, you would normally have two separate token addresses, so this feature allows you to view all transactions under one address.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are very proud of this deployment, with continuous updates and improvements along the way thanks to the hard work from our entire team.</p>

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley, co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, June 2022. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/download.html">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>Over the past year or so, interest in decentralized identity (also called self-sovereign identity) has surged. We’ve seen new decentralized identity blockchains created, decentralized identity companies acquired, and various real-world decentralized identity-based projects progressed.</p>



<p>You might ask then, what is decentralized identity? Definitions vary, but this is a good one:</p>



<p>Decentralized identity is an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>Let’s break it down. This definition has three important concepts:</p>



  Identity and access management (IAM)  User control of their personal information (PII)  Standards  



<p></p>



 Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 







<p>Identity and access management refers to the way you access an online service, such as a website or social media site. The first type of IAM model implemented, and the most common, is centralized. We all know this approach since it involves creating an account on a service. Typically, when you create an account you give the site a username, password, perhaps set up two-factor authentication (2FA) and give other personal information such as your mobile phone number, email address, and credit card information. When I look into my own 1Password app, I see I have more than 200 accounts that fit this model.</p>



<p>The second type of IAM model implemented is also a centralized model but is called federated. In a federated model, you create an account at a central site, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or one of the other big sites. When you go to other websites, you might be offered the option of doing a social login such as “Login with Facebook”, where you use your Facebook login to access the third-party site. This type of model relies on sophisticated federation protocols such as OpenIDConnect. The advantage for you is convenience.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity flips these centralized IAM models on their head. With decentralized identity technology, instead of entering a username and password or doing a social login, you would&nbsp;create your own identity in an identity wallet. You would bring that identity to the website or service and create a peer (also called a pairwise) connection with that service. The advantage of creating the connection is that it allows for end-to-end encrypted communication, strong authentication and so on.</p>



<p>Now let’s consider the second part of the definition:&nbsp;user control of their personal information (PII). In my view, the two centralized IAM models are designed to behave exactly opposite to this goal. Those models encourage you to disclose as much of your personal information as possible and collect even more by surveilling your activities covertly. This is particularly bad with social login, where you are actually helping the central site (e.g. Google) to get a broader view of your behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s tempting to hit the social login button to save the bother of creating yet another account and remembering or storing yet another username and password, when you do, you’re really trading your personal information for access and convenience. Unless you carefully consider and agree to the information that the third-party site is asking to access from your social profile (during the initial permissions process, which many people rush through), you can easily expose your personal data, including your gender, age, email address, phone number, relationship status, interests, and even your full list of connections. Almost everything you’ve put into your social accounts could be available to the third-party site owner. This obviously has privacy and security implications.</p>



<p>So decentralized identity also flips this broad-ranging data gathering on its head. With decentralized identity technology, you would initially disclose one of your decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to the service to set up a connection. This allows the service to identify you for subsequent accesses and authenticate you using public key cryptography. You no longer need a password.&nbsp;You then negotiate with the service what additional personal information you consent to give to the service. Technology called verifiable credentials (digital documents issued with digital signatures) makes this possible.</p>



<p>Let’s now look at the third important concept in the definition:&nbsp;standards. Arguably the most important goal of the decentralized identity community is to define a set of standards to allow interoperability for users and services—essentially, an interoperable decentralized identity ecosystem. The standards being defined are at standards bodies such as World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Linux Foundation (Hyperledger and TrustoverIP), and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</p>



<p>Now we have touched on the high level concepts, let’s dig a bit deeper into the decentralized identity technology.</p>



<p></p>



 Identity Wallet 







<p>As the user, your view into decentralized identity is via an identity wallet. The wallet allows you to create your decentralized identities and connections with other users and services, and to receive, hold and present verifiable credentials (your digitally signed digital documents).</p>



<p>First, you need to get an identity wallet. There are a few different ones out there; one example is the Lissi wallet (lissi.id/mobile), which is a mobile application purposely built to allow the user to participate in a decentralized identity world.</p>



<p>The wallet is designed to hide much of the complexity of decentralized identity, but let’s cover some detail here. When you create your first decentralized identity, you are in fact creating a private/public key pair (usually based on Elliptic Curves, e.g. ec25519) and a unique identifier called a DID. A DID is a simple text string consisting of multiple parts:</p>



<p>did:indy:sovrin:7Tqg6BwSSWapxgUDm9KKgg</p>



<p>The string above has this meaning: “I am creating my decentralized identity following the Indy DID method, and the identity is anchored on the Sovrin mainnet blockchain.” If you were to provide that DID to a service or another user, it would be resolvable to an address on the Sovrin mainnet where the DIDDoc could be returned. The DIDDoc contains your public key and an address where to reach you.</p>



<p>There is a lot to unpack in that paragraph. Sovrin is a Hyperledger Indy-based blockchain specifically built for decentralized identity. Being a permissioned blockchain, it is a network of validator nodes (twenty four for each of the three Sovrin networks: mainnet, staging, test). It is designed to support decentralized identity-based applications. Anonyome Labs is one of the founding stewards of Sovrin, meaning we have been running a validator node on the Sovrin network for over three years now. Think of a validator like a bitcoin miner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A blockchain is used for decentralized identity because it provides an anchor for trust. Not only can you write your DIDs to the blockchain, but other parties, such as verifiable credential issuers, can write credentials definitions and their own DIDs (unique identifiers) as well. Because the blockchain is immutable (can never be altered, only added to), there is no way for a hacker to modify the information on the blockchain.</p>



<p>DIDDoc is also important. The DID points to a location on a blockchain so that a DIDDoc can be retrieved. The DIDDoc gives the decentralized identity’s public key (for establishing connections) and an address that can be used to reach you as the user. A well-designed identity wallet shields you from the complex technical information I’ve described. From your perspective, you create your decentralized identity and take it out and use it. Complexities around cryptography, endpoints, and blockchains are not that interesting to the everyday user.</p>



<p>So, to answer the question we started with: can decentralized identity give you greater control of your online identity? Clearly&nbsp;yes.</p>



<p>I’ll leave it there for now. This is the first in a series of articles on decentralized identity from Anonyome Labs. In future articles I’ll discuss:</p>



  Decentralized identity focused blockchains  Decentralized identity verifiable credentials  Identity (data) hub concept  Real world projects leveraging decentralized identity  The key decentralized identity standards, and more.  



<p>Update:<br>Anonyome Labs is building a set of SDKs for&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so our enterprise customers can quickly create their own digital identity wallet. We also plan on building an unbranded identity wallet app if an enterprise customer wants to get to market faster.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">the first part of the GlobaliD 101 series</a>, we gave an overview of how our identity systems haven’t caught up to the modern world. We also provided suggestions of how digital identity should&nbsp;work.</p><p>The thing is, identity isn’t something your average person thinks about much. Typically, it’s a means to an end. If you want to take a trip to Europe, you need to bring your passport. Want to celebrate with a bottle of wine? You need to show your driver’s&nbsp;license.</p><p>In part 2 of the GlobaliD 101 series, we’re going to explain how the process of identity actually works, and we’re going to do it with a really nifty concept we call the Trust Triangle.</p><p>Here’s how the Trust Triangle works: Any identity framework is built on three pillars — issuers, holders, and verifiers. Together, these three pillars form the Trust Triangle.</p><p>Consider a real life example: The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues you your driver’s license. You are now the holder of that credential. After your big promotion, you go to the store to pick up a moderately expensive bottle of wine. The store then verifies that you are of age by checking your license. Now, it’s time to celebrate.</p><p>Let’s break it&nbsp;down:</p> Issuers <p>Issuers are simply organizations that are authorized to issue credentials. They confirm that a piece of information is accurate and then issue a credential authenticating that information. They are typically trusted authorities who want to ensure compliance and enforce standards.</p><p>The Department of Motor Vehicles is an issuer. They issue a driver’s license credential that enables you to legally operate a&nbsp;car.</p> Holders <p>A holder is the owner of a credential. They can be individuals or organizations. They are trying to do something, but need some sort of credential to do it. They also need a place to store the credentials they already have and new ones they will&nbsp;acquire.</p><p>If you want to drive a car then you would go to the DMV (the issuer), and they would issue you a driver’s license credential which would enable you (the holder) to&nbsp;drive.</p> Verifiers <p>Verifiers are entities that receive a credential presented to them from a holder, confirm the credential comes from a trusted issuer, and then use that credential to perform a service or sell a good to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>If a cop pulls you over while driving the first thing they are going to do is verify you are legally allowed to drive. To do this, the cop (the verifier) will ask you (the holder) to present your driver’s license credential that you received from the DMV (the&nbsp;issuer).</p> The Trust Triangle breaks down&nbsp;online <p>So far, everything has been pretty straightforward as this is how identity has always worked in the real world. But once we get online, things get a bit&nbsp;messy.</p><p>Consider the context of the Trust Triangle for a typical online transaction such as ordering food or&nbsp;drinks.</p><p>When ordering alcohol from a food delivery service such as Doordash, they will require you to upload a photo of your driver’s license in order to verify your age. Your ID is then kept and “stored securely by DoorDash for future alcohol purchases.”</p><p>The same problem occurs when booking a stay on the online marketplace Airbnb. In order to secure a place, hosts will often ask you to submit a photo of your government ID in order to verify you are who you claim to&nbsp;be.</p><p>This setup results in a slew of security and ownership. On the one hand, verifiers must now manage the security and privacy concerns of holding personal user information, which is now vulnerable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">data breaches</a>. On the other hand, individuals lose control of their identity once their identifying documentation is out in the&nbsp;wild.</p><p>In both scenarios, DoorDash and Airbnb hosts don’t need to hold your driver’s license. The former does it out of convenience (but with consequences). The latter does it because of the lack of a better alternative.</p><p>This breakdown of the Trust Triangle is taken to logical extremes in the context of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Consider how identity with Facebook&nbsp;works:</p><p>Facebook issues you an account, one of many fragmented identities we have online, after signing up with your email address. Facebook also holds all of your social data and personal information (username, password, first and last name, email, etc.) on their own servers. Facebook verifies your identity by confirming that you know your username and password, thus granting you temporary access to your social identity when you log onto their platform.</p><p>Something about this relationship feels a little lopsided!</p><p>The reality is that many of our online identity systems represent a complete breakdown of the Trust Triangle. What we need is a more empowering approach that preserves individual ownership of our digital identities.</p> Restoring the Trust Triangle in a digital&nbsp;world <p>The Trust Triangle is all about balance. Unfortunately, that balance skewed away from individuals when we transitioned to a digital&nbsp;reality.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we believe that people should own and control their digital identities. In the context of the Trust Triangle, it means that individuals should be holders of their identity and their credentials.</p><p>So how do we restore balance to the Trust Triangle in the digital world? Here’s how GlobaliD works in the context of the Trust Triangle:</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Is Web3 just hype or will it be integral to our day-to-day life in the future? Here’s a brief history of the web to put Web3 in&nbsp;context.</p><p>Web3 is often described in idealistic terms with the promise of freedom, democracy and a fairer internet for all. However, some users of the internet may be put off by Web3’s connection to cryptocurrencies and complicated blockchain technology. Others think it’s only for tech users or specialized use cases such as gaming, the metaverse, NFTs, or decentralized finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>But Web3 offers more practical and economical advantages than that. The new protocol layer expands the existing protocols of the internet, bringing innovation back to the web and increasing value creation — the process of turning resources into something of value for others. A look at how the web has developed so far shows how it has evolved, and puts current developments in perspective.</p> Web1 <p>The web is such an integral part of life nowadays it’s hard to imagine life without&nbsp;it.</p><p>The internet made its first appearance in 1978, when it was developed for and financed by the military. The infrastructure consisted of several protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, and SMTP, most of which are still being used today. Although these were free and unregulated, adoption was slow. It took until 1991 for the World Wide Web (www) to appear, invented by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN scientific research center <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1991/08/art-6484.txt">“to allow links to be made to any information anywhere”</a>. Two years later this version of the web became freely available for the public to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Value creation was low in Web1, which was mainly used to send data from A to B or create static websites that weren’t much more than a digital brochure. Anyone who remembers the painfully slow and pay-per-minute dial-up connection needed to connect to the internet could hardly have imagined its widespread use&nbsp;today!</p><p>Several years after its launch, many were still <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet">critical of the web</a>, exemplified by the statement in 1995 by AT&amp;T’s vice president of multimedia strategy that “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/04/bell-labs/">most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million&nbsp;people</a>”.</p> Web2 <p>But things were changing. The first <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=1654&amp;__cf_chl_tk=AeRRa5iXfwSLRqVXBhqnMeENfnfAp3UjoCKel.dVjNI-1657099045-0-gaNycGzNCOU">Web 2.0 conference</a> in 2004 highlighted developments that had started a few years previously to harness the potential of Web1. These began with the introduction of more interactive websites. Value creation increased as an explosion of useful applications was built on top of the original protocols, offering storage and computation, easy ways to search, social media platforms, and ways to buy, sell and pay for&nbsp;things.</p><p>This is the point where large monopolies began. While previously companies had a fairer playing field, in Web2 human psychology kicked in in the form of the <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1221425">Schelling point</a>, a game theory concept. The original Schelling point experiment asked participants where and when they would meet a stranger in New York, given no further instructions. The most common answer was noon at Grand Central Station. On the web, some companies started becoming the “noon at Grand Central Station” of their field. Gaining even more users with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.govtech.com/products/how-smartphones-revolutionized-society-in-less-than-a-decade.html">smartphone</a> in 2007 as increasing numbers of people started accessing the internet daily, these companies became Schelling points.</p><p>A Schelling point is a monopoly, which is very hard to replace. If it is replaced, the result automatically becomes the new Schelling point, creating a new monopoly. This monopolistic landscape of Web2 killed innovation, as it’s not enough for a new company to develop a better product, they also need significant funding and marketing to compete. In the meantime, established companies don’t need to innovate to survive as they already own the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Additionally, although Web2 services are generally “free” to use, the user pays indirectly with their data, which is often sold for targeted advertising. A company with a lot of data has a lot of control. And large companies with huge data silos are a honeypot for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Web3 evolved to address these&nbsp;issues.</p> Web3 <p>Thanks to blockchain technology, new “fat” protocols (so-called because they have much more functionality than the historical “thin” protocols, such as HTTP, IP, etc.) were added to the protocol layer of the internet.</p><p>These protocols were developed to create the infrastructure required to provide vital services needed by web users, in areas such as identity, payment, ownership, storage and computation. These new services are not companies; they are networks, usually decentralized, run on blockchain technology, and fueled by utility coins, also known as tokens or cryptocurrencies. Anyone can buy the coin and use it to pay for the transaction provided by the blockchain service. By owning the coin, the user also owns part of the network. In this way, blockchain provides the possibility to build protocols not as a company, but in a decentralized way that combines ownership and utility. These blockchain protocols can replace the Schelling points that provided vital services for web users and developers.</p><p>As these protocols are open source and permissionless, this opens the field for competition, innovation and an explosion in value creation. Once again there is huge potential for development. When essential services like payment, ownership, identity, computation and storage are provided by a decentralized network, this provides a level playing field for developers of new and useful services on top of these essentials. Web3 protocols also provide easy to use interfaces (APIs), which greatly accelerate development speed and thus lower entry barriers for creative new companies. This setting will lead to a Cambrian explosion of decentralized applications (dapps) which provide additional utility to the Web and an enormous boost in value creation, which will easily be bigger than in Web2. Decentralized applications (dapps) are being built to create new valuable services, while the protocol level breaks the Schelling point&nbsp;circle.</p><p>Just as adoption hurdles were overcome with former incarnations of the web, challenges to Web3 adoption will decrease as the newer dapps, wallets, and interfaces become more intuitive, user-friendly, and as easy to use as any other app on your phone or browser. Dapps can be created for specific projects and services, and those protocols that provide utility to the services will thrive.. And with a level playing field, dapp developers will need to keep innovating and improving to keep their market share, providing even more value for web&nbsp;users.</p> Moving forward <p>In the same way that Web1 was seamlessly absorbed into Web2, many Web2 elements will still exist in the future, running alongside a multi-chain network of Web3 decentralized services.</p><p>Even at this early stage of development, several Web3 protocols and dapps are already up and running. Along with wallets, recent years have seen real-world innovation and decentralized services grow in many areas, such as storage (<a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>), finance (DeFi and decentralized exchanges), and identity — including dapps <a href="https://www.kilt.io/built-on-kilt/">built on KILT</a> such as <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC credentials</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> (by <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/">B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH</a>).</p><p>The typical internet user is not concerned with what protocols the app they are using is based on. They are just interested in the value the app adds to their life and digital experience. As decentralization in Web3 creates value with practical things such as creating a digital identity and returning control of data to its owner, alongside newer offerings like NFTs and the metaverse, adoption will continue to grow as it has throughout Web1 and Web2. As in previous iterations of the web, the only limit is our imagination!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-history-of-web3-in-a-nutshell-68ef20df3c2f">The History of Web3 in a Nutshell</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

A Communications Problem? 
 
 
 
 
<p>Misinformation is as a growing societal topic. And in fact is a cyber security risk. </p>
<p>Over the past two years, we’ve all had the chance to witness worldwide manifestations against covid-19-related government mandates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was (and still exists) a strong rhetoric around governments implementing programs in order to increase their surveillance on citizens (e.g., vaccine passports).</p>
<p>We’ve now started seeing similar rhetorics around digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Government attempts to impose digital IDs &amp; other intrusive tracking and surveillance methods are an attack on our freedom.<a href="https://t.co/0PJRw8JOoF">https://t.co/0PJRw8JOoF</a><br><br>I will end them.<br><br>Join to vote if you agree: <a href="https://t.co/fSIdr4SUbt">https://t.co/fSIdr4SUbt</a></p>— Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) <a href="https://twitter.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1528885198980452353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2022</a></blockquote> 
 
<p><br>
 And there are more examples </p>
<p>In the past months, some petitions (<a href="https://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-9695/index.html">1</a>, <a href="https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-9473/index.html">2</a>) against government-based digital wallets were signed at the Quebec National Assembly by tens of thousands of people:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Anyone familiar with the Canadian public sector digital ID landscape knows about the Saskatchewan Digital ID program being halted in early 2022 (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-digital-id-1.6405362">3</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This came soon after a podcast episode of the Joe Rogan Experience (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM">4</a>), in which his guest Maajid Nawaz talked about governments not always having pure intentions when it comes to protecting the privacy rights of citizens.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that us folks in the user-centric digital identity space know the efforts being put into place to ensure that digital ID is a freedom-enhancing tool for citizens.</p>
<p>Digital IDs are also a choice. And when issued by governments, they’re an optional public good – just like roads are an optional public good. If you don’t like to take the highway,&nbsp; you can always take the side road to get to where you need to.</p>
<p>As a digital identity community, I’d claim that we’re very proficient at explaining all of this to ourselves, but we have difficulties explaining the benefits to the broader public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this isn’t the government’s task to do so. It’s all of our roles to educate the broader public on the pros and cons of Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the core, if done correctly, we are further <a href="https://northernblock.io/insecm-cis2022-are-we-really-committed-to-protecting-the-rights-of-people-and-democratic-societies/">protecting the rights of people and democratic societies</a>.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>This conversation is meant to generate some suggestions on how to avoid the big brother rhetoric when it comes to digital ID programs.</p>
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Imraan are:</p>
 
 The rise of Misinformation&nbsp; 
 How to “pre-bunking” certain ideas? 
 Misconceptions on Zero Trust 
 What is Canada doing better/worse in digital ID related to other national programs? 
 How can digital ID go wrong?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Software Bill of Material (SBOM) tools have come sharply into focus as a foundational component of any <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-software-supply-chain-security">Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS)</a> strategy, spurred on by the U.S. Executive Order to improve the security of the software supply chain. This was in response to a number of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/software-supply-chain-risks-and-the-kaspersky-ban">highly visible attacks</a> on the software supply chain of some well knows software products and services, such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/the-next-level-of-zero-trust-software-security-and-cyber-supply-chain-risk-management">SolarWinds</a> in 2020, as well as compromised open-source code and other backdoors embedded in routine maintenance updates. As part of the overall enhancement to SSCS, the Executive Order specifically calls out the documentation of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each software product. An SBOM creates a machine-readable inventory of the software components that make up a given software product. Software products are often a mix of custom-developed code leveraging open source and other commercially available software components, which <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/devsecops-sodas-secure-operations-development-of-agile-services">DevSecOps</a> should maintain and monitor. Having a Bill of Materials is nothing new in the traditional Supply Chain Management (SCM) process, and it shouldn’t be any surprise and makes perfect sense to apply this same concept to software.</p>
 Transparency benefits all stakeholders in the software supply chain 
<p>Transparency in the software supply chain benefits all stakeholders, from software suppliers to the software products' consumers and the providers in between, such as Managed Service Providers (MSP). It helps the software supplier to have a clear understanding of what software components make up their software product. It can also assist in monitoring software risks in their DevOps pipeline and prove software competency in case of company acquisitions or mergers. Suppliers of software products need to be assured that the software provided as an MSP is secure and can meet regulatory compliance requirements. Software consumers want to know that the software they use won't make them a target of a software attack.</p>
 Microsoft makes its own SBOM tool publicly available 
<p>Recently, Microsoft contributed its own internally used Salus tool for generating SBOMs to open source, which is publicly available on GitHub – a Microsoft company. The GitHub SBOM project page describes the tool as being enterprise-ready, highly scalable, and working across platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac, which can be integrated into build workflows. Another benefit of the tool is that it’s Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) 2.2 compatible, which is essential for companies supplying U.S. government software given its SBOM format requirements. Having an enterprise grade SBOM freely available should make it easier to meet the SSCS bar that is being raised leaving little excuse for organizations from taking a step in this direction.</p>
 Don’t stop at SBOM, take the next step in the SSCS process 
<p>Inventorying all of the pieces in a software product is a good and essential part of SSCS, but It should not stop there. For example, security must be put into place on the source control management (SCM) system and associated software repositories to ensure source integrity. Software code and other artifacts also need to be scanned for vulnerabilities. The build integrity processes must verify the build artifact's provenance and that the code has been signed and validated to detect tampering. Container artifacts such as Docker images must also be checked for vulnerabilities and compliance issues. Other vulnerability and misconfiguration scans, such as API scans, can occur along the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline. In short, when securing the Software Supply Chain, the journey starts at the security and privacy by design phase when creating the software system architecture and coding of the design begins and continues throughout software deployment and lifecycle.</p>

 The KJM confirms that IDnow’s solutions IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID are officially suitable for age verification in accordance with the youth protection treaty (JMStV) in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, July 21, 2022, IDnow, a leading European provider in the field of identity proofing and digital identities, is pleased to announce that two further solutions, specifically the IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID, have been positively assessed by the German Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM) for the use of age verification. This means that there are now five solutions from IDnow group among the <a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/aufsicht/technischer-jugendmedienschutz/unzulaessige-angebote/altersverifikationssysteme">age verification systems rated as positive by the KJM.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDnow Wallet, in particular, will allow users to confirm their age faster than ever before. With its Digital Identity Wallet, IDnow offers an innovative way to safely and securely store a person’s digital identity on their own smartphone to reuse it later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The identity is verified once – in just a few steps – using one of the IDnow identification methods. The data is saved exclusively on the user’s smartphone and encrypted with the help of the Secure Element. The data is not stored centrally. Once verified, users can then reuse their stored identity within the IDnow ecosystem for many different use cases. This saves users of the IDnow Wallet from having to repeatedly verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID, the company is pleased to offer two more solutions for online age verification, which have been rated positively by the KJM. With its broad range of identification methods, IDnow becomes a significantly stronger partner for the protection of minors in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Background: Protection of minors from harmful media&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (JMStV), certain content harmful to minors, such as gambling or pornography, may only be distributed online if the provider ensures access through closed, adults-only user groups. So-called age verification systems (AV systems) are used to ensure such closed, adults-only user groups. In order to provide legal and planning security, the KJM publishes a list of evaluated age verification systems that meet the legal requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Ankaa partners with identity proofing platform to offer digital verification for seafaring roles&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Manchester and London, July 21, 2022: Leading European provider for identity proofing, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, has announced <a href="https://ankaa.com/">Ankaa</a> as its latest UK channel partner. As one of the first fully automated solution in the maritime sector, the partnership will enable Ankaa to quickly and efficiently confirm the identities of candidates applying for jobs at sea providing comfort to operators, owners and financial compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entirely automated processes offered by Ankaa, now including identity proofing, have significantly reduced the amount of time it takes to onboard a candidate by 60%. For example, onboarding a new candidate used to take 45-50 minutes per crew member, using Ankaa this has been reduced to just 11 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with IDnow, Ankaa can now offer a holistic, end-to-end digital onboarding solution to its maritime customers, enabling them to meet the various legislative requirements and streamline typically complex processes including job advertising, documentation collation and now identity proofing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Livingstone, Founder and Managing Director at Ankaa, comments: “Ankaa has offered significant savings in manual administration and vastly improved data flows between clients, recruitment team and the employer. In recent years, the regulatory focus has widened and all entities across the maritime sector and the related supply chains, including crew providers, have been advised by regulators across the world to significantly improve their due diligence and compliance programmes to avoid breaching global sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The new feature ensures maritime employers can further enhance their substantive employment decision, whilst ensuring fiscal compliance with banks and fiduciary authorities is maintained. The feature incorporates compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF), as well as Anti-Bribery and Corruption legislation of the various jurisdictions in which our clients operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When searching for a company to partner with, we looked across the market and found that IDnow had a superior interface. The ease of use was a high priority for us to ensure a smooth user experience, and IDnow’s AutoIdent system delivered,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Via Ankaa’s platform, candidates are directed to a portal which streamlines the entire recruitment and onboarding processes; from there, they upload their locational documents, certificates and information about previous assignments needed to successfully apply for a role, which often involves more than 30 pieces of documentation. Using IDnow’s AutoIdent with an AML screening solution, Ankaa can then verify the candidate is who they say they are. These checks are also vital in order to confirm the identity of any beneficiaries of a seafarer’s pay, which can often be a spouse or family member. Via IDnow’s AML and KYC technology, Ankaa is now able to show who is on-board a vessel and where their payment is sent to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Hudson-Dale, Partnerships Manager at IDnow, adds: “We’re delighted to be partnering with Ankaa at such a pivotal time for the maritime industry as it looks to set the benchmark for digital recruitment and onboarding. Previously, recruiters would engage in complex and lengthy processes including scanning, email exchanges and paper documentation; however, Ankaa is disrupting this standard by delivering all aspects via a simple tech platform.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection 

<p>In the <a>second post of this series</a>, we presented an overview of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In summary, you learned that XSS occurs when code pollutes data and your application doesn’t provide safeguards to prevent the code from running.</p>

<p>Let’s recap the example attack vector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine an overly dramatic but otherwise innocent scenario like this:</p>
   
     A website allows you to add comments about your favorite K-Drama. 
     An agitator adds the comment <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Crash Landing on You stinks!');&lt;/script&gt;</code>. 
     That terrible comment saves as is to the database. 
     A K-Drama fan opens the website. 
     The terrible comment is added to the website, appending the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to the DOM. 
     The K-Drama fan is outraged by the JavaScript alert saying their favorite K-Drama, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850932/">Crash Landing on You</a>, stinks. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element and glossed over the steps for appending the element to the DOM. In reality, polluted data gets pulled into the application in various ways. Adding untrusted data in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#injection_sinks">injection sink</a> - a Web API function that allows us to add dynamic content to our applications - is a major culprit. Examples of sinks include, but aren’t limited to:</p>
 
   methods to append to the DOM such as  <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code> 
   approaches that load external resources or navigate to external sites via a URL, such as <code>src</code> or <code>href</code> for HTML elements and <code>url</code> property on styles 
   event handlers, such as <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onerror</code> with an invalid <code>src</code> value 
   global functions that evaluate and/or run code, such as <code>eval()</code>, <code>setTimeout()</code> 
 

<p>As you can see, there are many vectors for the vulnerability. Many of these sinks have legitimate use cases when building dynamic web applications. Since the sinks are necessary for web app functionality, we must use trusted data by escaping and sanitizing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is still a high-level summary. The fine print is that XSS vulnerabilities can be pretty sneaky in the different ways the attack can occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are different XSS attacks, each with a slightly different attack vector. We’ll briefly cover how three attacks work.</p>

 Stored XSS 

<p>In this flavor of XSS, the attack is persisted somewhere, like in a database. We recapped stored XSS in the example above, where an agitator’s terrible comment with the <code>script</code> tag persists in the database and ruins someone else’s day by showing the unfriendly comment in an alert.</p>

 Reflected XSS 

<p>In this attack, the malicious code sneaks in through the HTTP request, usually through URL parameters. Suppose the K-Drama site takes a search term via a URL parameter, such as:</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/dramas?search=crash+landing+on+you
</code>   

<p>The site then takes the search terms and displays them back to the user while calling out to the backend to run the search.</p>

<p>But what if an agitator constructs a URL like this?</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/dramas?search=&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;
</code>   

<p>You may think that you’d never navigate to a link like that! Who would?! But let’s remember, in a previous post, you did click the link in your spam email to send money to your high school sweetheart. This isn’t meant as a judgment; no one is immune to clicking fishy links. Also, agitators are pretty tricksy. They might use URL shorteners to obscure the risk.</p>

 DOM-based XSS 

<p>In this attack, the agitator takes advantage of Web APIs. The attack occurs entirely within the SPA, and it’s pretty much identical to reflected XSS.</p>

<p>Let’s say our application depends on an external resource—the app embeds an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> for showing trailers for the K-Dramas and sets the <code>iframe</code>’s <code>src</code> attribute to an external site. So our code might look like this.</p>

   <code>&lt;iframe src="{resourceURL}" /&gt;
</code>   

<p>We usually call out to the third-party service to get the URLs for the source, but agitators have infiltrated this third-party service and now control the resource URLs returned, making our code look like this.</p>

   <code>&lt;iframe src="javascript:alert('Boo!')" /&gt;
</code>   

<p>Well, darn it, we’ve got some problems.</p>

 XSS support in Angular 

<p>Fortunately, Angular has a lot of built-in security protections. It treats all values as suspicious and untrusted by default, which is incredibly helpful because the framework automatically guards us against unintentionally creating vulnerabilities in our applications. Angular automatically removes any <code>script</code> tags so we won’t have to worry about the original hypothetical example.</p>

<p>Let’s see some examples of how Angular protects us against XSS.</p>

 Angular automatically escapes values 

<p>Web applications implement comment features like in the Stored XSS example by calling an API to get a list of comments, then add the comments to the template. In Angular, an extremely simplified comments component might look something like this:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-comments'
  template: `
    &lt;p *ngFor="let comment of comments | async"&gt;
      {{comment}}
    &lt;p&gt;
  `
})
export class CommentsComponent implements OnInit {
  public comments: Observable&lt;string[]&gt;;
  
  constructor(private commentsService: CommentsService) { }

  public ngOnInit(): void {
    this.comments = this.commentsService.getComments();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The XSS attack vector works only if the web app treats all values as trustworthy and appends them directly to the template, such as when the web app doesn’t escape or sanitize values first. Luckily, Angular automatically does both.</p>

<p>When you add values through interpolation in templates (using the <code>{{}}</code> syntax), Angular automatically escapes the data. So the comment:</p>

   <code>&lt;a href="javascript:alert(\'Crash Landing on You stinks!\')"&gt;Click to win a free prize!&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>displays exactly like what’s written above as text. It’s still a terrible comment and unfriendly to “Crash Landing on You” fans, but it doesn’t add the anchor element to the app. This is awesome because even if the attack were more malicious, it still wouldn’t perform any actions.</p>

 Angular automatically sanitizes values 

<p>Let’s say we want to display the comments preserving any safe markup a user enters. We already have two malicious comments to start us off on shaky ground:</p>
 
   <code>&lt;a href="javascript:alert(\'Crash Landing on You stinks!\')"&gt;Click to win a free prize!&lt;/a&gt;</code> 
   <code>&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Then a K-Drama fan adds a new comment with safe markup.</p>

   <code>&lt;strong&gt;It's a wonderful drama! The best!&lt;/strong&gt;
</code>   

<p>Because the <code>CommentsComponent</code> uses interpolation to populate the comments, the comments will display in the browser in text like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s not what we want! We want to interpret the HTML and allow the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text, so we change our component template to bind it to the HTML <code>innerHTML</code> property.</p>

   <code>&lt;p 
  *ngFor="let comment of comments | async" 
  [innerHTML]="comment"
&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, the site displays only the second comment correctly formatted like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The first comment with the <code>anchor</code> tag doesn’t display the alert when clicked! The second comment with the attack in the <code>onerror</code> handler only shows the broken image and doesn’t run the error code! Angular doesn’t publish a list of unsafe tags. Still, we can sneak a peek into the codebase to see Angular considers tags such as <code>form</code>, <code>textarea</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>template</code> as suspicious and may altogether remove the tag or remove specific attributes/child elements.</p>

<p>As we learned earlier, sanitizing removes suspicious code while keeping safe code. Angular automatically strips out unsafe attributes from safe elements. You will see a warning in the console letting you know Angular cleaned the content up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By handling values “the Angular way,” our application is well protected against security woes! Success!</p>

<p></p>

 Bypassing Angular’s security checks 

<blockquote>
  <p>🚨 Here be dragons! 🚨</p>

  <p>Be careful about bypassing the built-in security mechanism; if you need to, read this section carefully:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you need to bind trusted values that Angular thinks are unsafe? You can mark values as trusted and bypass the security checks.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of the image with an error handler. Instead of the value coming from an agitator, let’s say there’s a legitimate need to bind the image with dynamic error handling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sidenote - there are better ways to handle images with error handling in Angular if your application doesn’t need to be quite so dynamic. Consider using an image element and bind to <code>(error)</code> instead, or even <code>HostListener</code>. Or, there are many tutorial examples of handling it cleanly using a Directive. Indeed, there are lots of better options. You should always prefer the standard Angular way using Angular building blocks. The code will be way easier to support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to the example, then. In the example above, we saw that the error handler didn’t run. Angular stripped it out. We need to mark the code as trusted for the error code to run.</p>

<p>Your component code might look like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-trustworthy-image',
  template: `
    &lt;section [innerHTML]="html"
  `
})
export class TrustworthyImageComponent {
  public html = `&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;`;
}
</code>   

<p>You see the broken image in the browser, and no alert pops up.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>DomSanitzer</code> class in <code>@angular/platform-browser</code>, to mark values as safe. The <code>DomSanitizer</code> class has built-in sanitization methods for four types of contexts:</p>
 
   HTML - binding to add more content like this <code>innerHTML</code> image example 
   Style - binding styles to add more flair to the site 
   URL - binding URLs like when you want to navigate to an external site in an anchor tag 
   Resource URL - binding URLs that load and run as code 
 

<p>To mark the value as trusted and safe to use, you can inject <code>DomSanitizer</code> and use one of the following methods appropriate for the security context to return a value marked as safe.</p>
 
   <code>bypassSecurityHTML</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityScript</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustStyle</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustUrl</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl</code> 
 

<p>These methods return the same input but are marked as trusted by wrapping it in a safe equivalent of the sanitization type.</p>

<p>Let’s see what this component looks like when we mark the HTML value as trusted.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-trustworthy-image',
  template: `
    &lt;section [innerHTML]="html"
  `
})
export class TrustworthyImageComponent {
  public html = `&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;`;
  public safeHtml: SafeHtml;

  constructor(sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.safeHtml = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(this.html);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, if you view this in the browser, you’ll see the broken image and an alert pop up. Success?? Maybe…</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s look at an example with a resource URL, such as the DOM-based XSS example where we bind the URL of the <code>iframe</code> source.</p>

<p>Your component code might look like this</p>
   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-video',
  template: `
    &lt;iframe [src]="linky" width="800px" height="450px"
  `
})
export class VideoComponent {

  // pretend this is from an external source
  public linky = '//videolink/embed/12345';
}
</code>   

<p>Angular will stop you right there. 🛑</p>

<p>You’ll see an error in the console saying unsafe values can’t be used in a resource URL. Angular recognizes you’re trying to add a resource URL and is alarmed you’re doing something dangerous. Resource URLs can contain legitimate code, so Angular can’t sanitize it, unlike the comments we had above.</p>

<p>If we are sure our link is safe and trustworthy (highly debatable in this example, but we’ll ignore that for a moment), we can mark the resource as trusted after we do some cleanup to make the resource URL safer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, we should only use the <code>bypassSecurityTrust...</code> methods if we know the value is trustworthy. You bypass the built-in security mechanisms and open yourself to security vulnerabilities!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of using the entire video URL based on the external party’s API response, we’ll construct the URL by defining the video host URL within our app and appending the video’s ID that we get back from the external party’s API response. This way, we aren’t entirely reliant on a potentially untrustworthy value from a third party. Instead, we’ll have some measure of ensuring we’re not injecting malicious code into the URL.</p>

<p>Then we’ll mark the video URL as trusted and bind it in the template. Your <code>VideoComponent</code> changes to this:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-video',
  template: `
    &lt;iframe [src]="safeLinky" width="800px" height="450px"
  `
})
export class VideoComponent {

  // pretend this is from an external source
  public videoId = '12345';
  public safeLinky!: SafeResourceUrl;

  constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.safeLinky = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(`//videolink/embed/${this.videoId}`)
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you’ll be able to show trailers of the K-Dramas on your site in an <code>iframe</code> in a much safer way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can’t be stressed enough. Ensure you trust the values before bypassing the out-of-the-box security protections you get from Angular!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! So we’re done? Not quite. There are a couple of things to note.</p>

 Use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for extra security 

<p>Angular’s AOT compilation has extra security measures for injection attacks like XSS. AOT compilation is highly recommended for production code and has been the default compilation method since Angular v9. Not only is it more secure, but it also improves performance.</p>

<p>On the flip side, the other form of compilation is Just-in-time (JIT). JIT was the default for older versions of Angular. JIT compiles code for the browser on the fly, and this process skips Angular’s built-in security protection, so stick with using AOT.</p>

 Don’t concatenate strings to construct templates 

<p>Angular trusts template code and only escapes values defined in the template using interpolation. So if you attempt something clever to circumvent the more common forms of defining the template for a component, you won’t be protected.</p>

<p>For example, you won’t have Angular’s built-in protections if you try to dynamically construct templates combining HTML with data using string concatenation or have an API whip up a payload with a template you somehow inject into the app. Your clever hacks with dynamic components might cause you security woes.</p>

 Beware of constructing DOM elements without using Angular templates 

<p>Any funny business you might try using <code>ElementRef</code> or <code>Renderer2</code> is the perfect way to cause security issues. For example, you can pwn yourself if you try to do something like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-yikes',
  template: `
    &lt;div #whydothis&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  `
})
export class YikesComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  @ViewChild('whydothis') public el!: ElementRef&lt;HTMLElement&gt;;
  
  // pretend this is from an external source
  public attack = '&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert(\'YIKES!\')"';

  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2) { }

  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    
    // danger below!
    this.el.nativeElement.innerHTML = this.attack;
    this.renderer.setProperty(this.el.nativeElement, 'innerHTML', this.attack);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Something like this might be tempting in a fancy custom directive, but think again! Besides, interacting directly with the DOM like this isn’t the best practice in Angular, even beyond any security issues it might have. It’s always wise to prefer creating and using Angular templates.</p>

 Explicitly sanitize data 

<p>The <code>DomSanitizer</code> class also has a method to sanitize values explicitly.</p>

<p>Let’s say you cook up a legitimate need to use <code>ElementRef</code> or <code>Render2</code> to build out the DOM in code. You can sanitize the value you add to the DOM using the method <code>sanitize()</code>. The <code>sanitize()</code> method takes two parameters, the security context for the sanitization and the value. The security context is an enumeration matching the security context listed previously.</p>

<p>If we redo the <code>YikesComponent</code> to explicitly sanitize, the code looks like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-way-better',
  template: `
    &lt;div #waybetter&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  `
})
export class WayBetterComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  @ViewChild('waybetter') public el!: ElementRef&lt;HTMLElement&gt;;
  
  // pretend this is from an external source
  public attack = '&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert(\'YIKES!\')"';

  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }

  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    
    const cleaned = this.sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, this.attack);
    this.renderer.setProperty(this.el.nativeElement, 'innerHTML', cleaned);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you’ll have the image without the potentially dangerous code tagging along for the ride.</p>

 Consider Trusted Types 

<p>One more built-in security mechanism in Angular is setting up and using a Content Security Policy (CSP). CSPs are a specific HTTP security header we covered in the <a>first post</a> to help set up foundational security mechanisms.</p>

<p>Angular has built-in support for defining policies for a CSP called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/trusted-types">Trusted Types</a>. Trusted Types are a great way to add extra XSS security guards to your Angular app but isn’t supported across all the major browsers yet. If you are interested in learning more about setting up the Trusted Types CSP for SPAs, check out this great post from the Auth0 blog - <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/securing-spa-with-trusted-types/">Securing SPAs with Trusted Types</a>.</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes called “self-sovereign identity,” or “user-centric identity,” or “reusable identity,” the open source technology behind Proven provides an authoritative way to authenticate any data without having to check in with the source of that data — or go through a third party.</p>
<p>“Verifiable credentials are a new foundation for trust in digital interaction,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “They are a simple, powerful solution to the internet’s missing verification layer for people — but they go way beyond that. They can be used to verify the identity of devices and digital objects; they can verify any kind of data associated with an identity. And they deliver breakthrough privacy and security features. This technology does so much that we say it creates “Trusted Digital Ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Proven is designed to be a complete starter kit for creating your own Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It contains all the components needed to create, share, and verify data through verifiable credentials, along with continuous upgrades and customer support from Indicio’s experienced engineering team from integration through implementation.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make it easy to start using verifiable credentials by giving people an off-the-shelf solution,” says Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “To do that the product had to be complete. It couldn’t leave the customer searching for components and struggling with compatibility. It couldn’t leave the customer dependent on proprietary tech or struggling to master open source codebases. As leaders in the open source community, we believe open source is critical for adoption, scale, and innovation, but an unfamiliar codebase is still going to be a heavy lift for any development team. Proven removes this obstacle, while remaining fully open source so a customer can develop on it to meet their needs.”</p>
<p>“We all believe in the power of this technology to solve chronic problems in digital interaction,” says Dahl, “but we also see Proven as a gateway to opportunity. We’ve seen our customers win awards for building Trusted Digital Ecosystems. Now, we want to seed that innovation as widely as possible. With our experience as market leaders in decentralized identity, we know what works. We know what’s needed. Proven is it.”</p>

ONTO launched a <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-is-launching-a-21-500-ong-referral-program-and-refer2earn-campaign-3a2806612b9">Refer2Earn</a> campaign and hosted various online activities with <a href="https://gleam.io/competitions/gUcw7-onto-teams-up-with-sil-finance-for-a-2000-sil-nfts">SIL Finance</a> and <a href="https://gleam.io/competitions/K59xa-onto-and-metabit-teams-up-with-for-a-500-usdt-giveaway">Metabit</a>. Earn rewards by participating with ONTO. Follow the <a href="https://t.me/ONTOAnnouncement">@ONTO Wallet Official Announcement</a> on Telegram for more&nbsp;details.   On-Chain Activity   147 total dApps on MainNet as of July 18th,&nbsp;2022.  7,097,560 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 3,925 from last&nbsp;week.  17,747,183 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 21,700 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1547649632074858496?s=20">weekly Community Call</a>, discussing why the integration of multi-chain and multi-application wallets has become the mainstream trend. It was concluded that wallets will become the gateway for Web3. ONTO Wallet is considered able to stand on its own due to the deployment of its DID and reputation system, providing security for users and projects.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. While introducing Ontology’s fourth Carnival event, he discussed with community members the role and meaning of decentralized identity: it can help users control their digital identity without the intervention of third parties, and create a seamless, accessible and verifiable ecosystem that solves many problems in fields such as NFTs and&nbsp;DAOs.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   The Ontology 4th MainNet Anniversary Carnival is still in progress. The current activities include the staking event and the joint celebration activities. Celer Network, Unifi Protocol, and Wing Finance are celebrating the 4th anniversary with Ontology, inviting global users to experience cBridge, uTrade, and the Wing FlashPool (Ontology EVM) to earn a share of the&nbsp;rewards.  The third OWNInsights “People, Platforms, Web3” was released, written by Ge Li, Ontology Business Development Manager. From the perspective of Web3 participants, it analyzes how individuals can control their own datasets to expand their influence through DID, and effective ways to build Web3 based on the OWN infrastructure. This article was first published on the well-known Chinese blockchain media Cointelegraph Chinese, and was recommended by the platform.  Ontology and the cross-chain Swap project StealthEX held an AMA event. While introducing the project and development to the community members, it also answered questions for the community members. The selected questions were rewarded with&nbsp;ONT.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-will-help-realize-the-true-vision-the-metaverse-hopes-to-achieve">AI will help realize the true vision the Metaverse hopes to&nbsp;achieve</a>”</p><p>“Many of the metaverse projects that have been launched are in the world of gaming. However, more often than not, these projects simply consist of standard gaming features combined with virtual reality and NFTs. A true metaverse, in the sense of a digital parallel universe to our analog world, a digital simulated reality in which participants can take part in diverse social, economic, entertainment and artistic activities in a variety of self-organized groupings and environments, has yet to be realized.”</p><p>Achieving this full vision requires easy portability for users, a large and diverse set of metaverse fragments, and simple user construction of new locations and spaces. Decentralized Identity (DID) technology is considered to be a more suitable technology to provide digital identity for the Metaverse — users with DID will be able to flexibly (one-stop) log in to different Metaverse scenarios without creating different identity accounts; at the same time the personal data recorded in the DID can be seamlessly ported in different scenarios without worrying about data collection or&nbsp;leakage.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-july-12-18-2022-1620cce989c1">Ontology Weekly Report (July 12–18, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kizuna empowers people to message each other completely privately, without the involvement of a central server. The app is open-source and is being developed by a non-profit group called the <a href="https://www.hcij.org/en/">Holochain Institute of Japan</a>.</p><p>This is the first article in a series of mini-spotlights on projects using Holochain. Many of these projects, like Kizuna, are quietly but busily working away towards a public product. They’re actively building, testing, and refining their prototypes as they get ready for Holochain’s beta release. You may not hear much from them, which is one reason I’ve chosen to write these updates.</p> Kizuna at a glance <p>Description: Kizuna is a messaging application for one-on-one or group conversations. Messages are kept private by high-strength encryption.</p>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna">https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna</a>  Demo videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcCJmnU5ryA">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdTac7J9s8">2</a>  Website: <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">https://kizuna.foundation/en/</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/</a>  Newsletter: <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/">https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/</a>  <p>We asked the Kizuna development team a few questions about their project, and the answers were intriguing.</p> Why is Kizuna being built? <p>You might ask, why another private messenger? There are a lot of them out there already — Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal, Viber, and so on, all give you various promises of message privacy. What’s different about Kizuna? What does it hope to contribute?</p><p>Well, all of these services have one common feature: you connect with your contacts through central servers. (<a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is somewhat of an exception; their software is open-source and you can run your own server if you like.) Sure, the server may not be able to read your encrypted messages, but it can still see who’s connecting with whom, who belongs to what group, how often you send messages, and other bits of extra information about you. This sort of data is candy for companies who build their businesses on selling insights about your behaviour to advertisers.</p><p>You may not be worried about this, but advertisers aren’t the only customers. If you live in an oppressive regime that’s secured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#State_surveillance_and_intelligence_gathering">cooperation</a> of one of these messenger services, your privacy could be a matter of survival.</p><p>But maybe you’ve found a messenger service that you trust. They’ve promised not to reveal your private metadata to anybody, and you believe them. But they can still go out of business, suffer a server crash, get hacked, or get bought up by a less honest company (along with all your data). What happens to the connections you’ve made then?</p><p>To the developers who came up with Kizuna, these compromises were unacceptable. They believed that we ought to be able to simply talk to each other. Form our own connections and take care of them ourselves. Without someone in the middle.</p><p>As Tatsuya Sato, lead developer and a faithful Holochain supporter who’s translated many of our articles into Japanese, explained to us:</p><blockquote>We believe that the conversations we have with others reflect our private lives. Messaging applications built in the last two decades allowed us to make hundreds of those conversations instantaneously. However, the messages we send in those conversations are being used as a tool for companies to sell our data, serve ads, and influence our choices. We've also seen an increase in messaging and social media applications getting hacked by attackers since they have an incentive to target applications that store millions of people's data in one place. Kizuna is a Japanese word that roughly translates in English to "deep bond" (there really is no direct translation that catches the full nuance of the word Kizuna in English) among people. We believe that humans have the innate desire to build and nourish this deep bond with others. A belief that this bond that we nurture with others should never be capitalized on.</blockquote><p>He and his colleague Nicko Pangarungan go on to say that “without the fear of data compromise, we can share our deep and intimate selves with others — which is the very nature of kizuna”. And that’s their ultimate goal — to enable deep bonds online.</p><p>On the practical level, here’s a feature-by-feature comparison to other popular private messengers.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Because the Kizuna team were committed so deeply to putting users in control, it made sense to build the service on peer-to-peer networking technology. This kind of internet communication doesn’t need servers, except in limited cases to punch through home firewalls and help people discover each other.</p><p>They could’ve designed from scratch, but that would have been a lot of work. If there were already a set of basic building blocks they could use for the networking layer, that would let them focus on the things that matter most to them — giving people a simple, reliable, private way of talking to each other. Fortunately, Sato had already been introduced to Holochain by his colleagues, and it seemed to be an appropriate starting point.</p> So, why is Holochain important for the Kizuna team? <p>Perhaps most importantly, it embodies the very principles they’re building into their product. I’ll let Sato and Pangarungan explain it themselves:</p><blockquote>Holochain is not just another development framework for making things easier (in some ways it does not 😅). But what makes us root for Holochain are the very principles it represents and the ideals of an online community that strives to realize – agent centricity, data security, peer-to-peer networks. These principles align themselves with what we believe are essential for a messaging app or any online application.</blockquote><blockquote>To put it simply, they chose Holochain because it puts users first by design.</blockquote><p>In particular, they like the fact that applications and their data are hosted by the people who use them, which means that your ability to access them can never be restricted by someone else. You and your group are in charge.</p><p>As they hinted at the beginning of that quote, it has come with its challenges. As a young technology, Holochain is still changing rapidly, which means they've had to rewrite pieces of their code. And a lot of the things that make Holochain work—for instance, the 'deterministic validation' that forms the foundation of an application's 'immune system'—have been quite a learning journey.</p><p>But through all this, they're still committed. Besides all the reasons Holochain was the right fit for their needs, they say there are other benefits. The learning they've invested in has paid off in new ways of thinking about problems. And they love the supportiveness of the community, core dev team, and learning materials (something Mike Gamble of RedGrid also mentioned in a previous article). They also love the Rust programming language and WebAssembly, and feel that they're both a good bet for future-proofing their work.</p> How are they using Holochain? <p>There are a few specific Holochain features that they're putting to good use in the design of Kizuna.</p>  As part of its deterministic validation rules, a Holochain application can add a 'membrane' that controls who can join its network and communicate with other members. The team uses this to restrict access to messages—each group conversation is a separate copy of the core messaging code with its own isolated, encrypted network. This is what lets Kizuna claim it has 'spy-proof group messaging' --- if you can't join the network, you can't access its messages. And unlike server-based private messengers, even your metadata (group membership, for instance) is safe from prying eyes.  Holochain exposes best-practice cryptographic functions to applications for further security. You may wonder, if each group's messages are encrypted as they travel, why does this matter? Well, in spite of the fact that Holochain encrypts network messages with TLS (the same protocol that secures your banking and online shopping), there's a slim chance that a session could be compromised. Kizuna uses Holochain's crypto functions as an extra layer of protection. Additionally, they plan to use Holo hosting to support web and mobile users, and this prevents hosts from reading users' stored messages.  The team appreciate how well Holochain supports inter-application interoperability. As long as the application is designed to support it, a user can access the functionality and data of any application they have installed from any of their other applications. This means that Kizuna's core could be embedded into other Holochain applications, and it also means that it could gain surprising new features thanks to the creativity of other developers.   How can I get involved? <p>If you're interested in supporting the team, the best thing to do right now is <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/">sign up for their mailing list</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">follow them on Twitter</a>. They did public release of their app in 2021 but Holochain has advanced sine then and their codebase has followed. They are preparing for a public release soon!</p><p>In the meantime, you can also check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/rqdTac7J9s8">public demos</a> they've given during <a href="https://youtu.be/OcCJmnU5ryA">Holochain Ecosystem Sessions videos</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna">codebase on GitHub</a>.</p><p>And of course, you can go to their <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">website</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">Twitter</a> to get a better picture of what they've got planned and what motivates them.</p>

 85,000 USD in OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects! And, retroactive grants are&nbsp;coming:)  1. Introduction <p>Hello, Ocean Community! <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the&nbsp;month.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 first describes key numbers and dates for round 20. Section 3 describes significant design changes to OceanDAO, including a move to retroactive grants only. Section 4 describes the rest of the OceanDAO structure, such as how voting&nbsp;works.</p> 2. Key Info for Round&nbsp;20 <p>Funding available. Round 20 has 85K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on August 8th, 2022, midnight UTC.) 75K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD via a new micro-grants allocation.</p><p>Round 20&nbsp;Dates</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is August 2 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends August&nbsp;4  Voting Starts on August 4, and Voting Ends on August&nbsp;8  Funding Deadline on August&nbsp;22  <p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p> 3. Improvements to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>This section describes some significant changes in OceanDAO, as of round 20 and&nbsp;21.</p> Goals in Improving OceanDAO <p>In round 20 and 21, we are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead   Approaches in Improving OceanDAO <p>Towards these goals, we have received feedback from the community on possible approaches. After many iterations of discussion and design, we have arrived at the following.</p><p>The main pillar will be: for R21, retroactive grants only. Here, you can only ask for a (retroactive) grant for some outcome you’ve already achieved. It’s a philosophy of “show don’t tell”: show us what you did, rather than tell what you’re going to do. Community voting then is about choosing how much they’d like to reward you for the outcome. We’re doing this for R21 not R20 to give opportunity for the community to prepare. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">Here’s a great post</a> to learn more about the “why” of retroactive grants.</p><p>Second, we have come to see that OceanDAO is better suited to earlier-stage funding of projects. As projects get stronger, they are in better shape to seek funding from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a> grants program, complementary ecosystem grants programs, investors (angels, VCs), and potentially launching their own token. Given this, we have tuned OceanDAO to give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced projects, by capping total funding amount for a project or&nbsp;team.</p><p>There is a category of experienced teams that has been using its funds to dole out micro-grants to their own sub-community. It doesn’t fit Shipyard because it’s not building-oriented; it isn’t appealing to investors because it’s grants; yet it’s of value to the Ocean ecosystem and we want to encourage this. So, we have earmarked 10K USD to the first recipient of this: Algovera.</p><p>Between retroactive grants (which help for DAO efficiency) and shifting experienced projects to Ocean Shipyard and other sources, we feel comfortable reducing the total amount available per month, from 100K USD to 85K USD (including the 10K micro-grants). We tuned the funding ceilings per tier accordingly.</p><p>The final change aims to give more breathing time to proposals, to voting, and to reduce OceanDAO ops overhead. Some related numbers are tuned accordingly.</p><p>We now summarize the changes for R20 and&nbsp;R21.</p> Round 20&nbsp;Changes   Total funding of 85K USD, including 10K micro-grants  100K USD max. per project in lifetime, and 100K USD max. per team in lifetime (not including Advisors). There may be rare exceptions for long-serving teams that aren’t meant to be investable; this includes Ocean Ambassadors and Ocean&nbsp;Pearl.  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 3K USD, existing projects tier 7.5K USD, and experienced projects tier 15K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.  We encourage everyone to start building proactively (compare Round 21&nbsp;updates)   Round 21&nbsp;Changes <p>R21 starts August 8th,&nbsp;2022.</p>  Retroactive Grants only. That is: projects apply for grants that fund outcomes of work they did, not plan to do. Projects will still submit their work via the Proposal Portal; demo videos are encouraged! Voting is still by OCEAN holders. Projects can still demo their work in Town Halls to receive voter support. We recognize no project is the same and expect Deliverables to vary across Project Categories.  Total funding of 170K USD available  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 5K USD, existing projects tier 10K USD, and experienced projects tier 20K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.   Discussion on&nbsp;Changes <p>By implementing these changes we hope to improve OceanDAO’s culture and values towards a more collaborative web3 data ecosystem. This includes helping steward and supporting projects that are actively building rather than promising future&nbsp;results.</p><p>We also want to support projects that want to build fun, constructive products around Ocean, whether that is a DeFi protocol, or a collection of t-shirts. By focusing on the work and presenting it to the DAO before entering the voting period, we hope to steward good practices for creating value in any environment.</p> 4. OceanDAO Grants Structure <p>The rest of this article describes other aspects of in round 20, with respect to the DAO’s structure and related parameters. We always include these in each round’s “announcement” blog post, for thoroughness.</p> Grant Funding Categories <p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself   Submitting Proposals <p>We encourage you to submit proposals early. Please, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for guidance.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Please do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore, as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details.and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p> Project Standing <p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> Funding Tiers <p>Teams start in the tier of “new project”, and then can achieve higher tiers by delivering on their grant promises. The higher the tier, the more funding that a team can&nbsp;request.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p> Earmarks <p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6K USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  6K USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  3K USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17.5K USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13K USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  35.5K USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There are specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-20-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R20</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>Note that R20 has earmarks for integration with Chainlink, TheGraph, Filecoin, and Arweave. (Ocean Shipyard specs for these are not quite ready&nbsp;yet.)</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p> Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features <p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the treasury.</p> Working Groups <p>Here are the&nbsp;WGs:</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ouW4oxKEgyaBeiZew4bd9HFwbNUiwReK0A2Ww7jmAik/edit#">Core Tech WG</a>.

   The 2022 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report shows that identity-based breaches are up. Again. 

 More stolen credentials, more unauthorized access, more breaches, more, more, more 

<p>Would it surprise you to know that breaches due to unauthorized access rose last year? Probably not, but I'll spare you the suspense: they did, and they now account for half of all breaches. But numbers and percentages on their own can only tell us so much. As we dug into the data, a story began to emerge that we can all learn from. And the story is exactly why we spend months each year compiling research from around the world to create these reports.</p>

<p>By the start of 2021, consumers had become accustomed to conducting much of their personal business online, from shopping and banking to paying taxes, taking classes, holding family gatherings, and conducting tele-health visits with their doctors. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail e-commerce alone grew 18.3% in 2021<a>1</a>, even after the massive, pandemic-fueled growth of 31.8% in 2020<a>2</a>. Each of these activities involves an online account that may contain a vast amount of sensitive information that is at risk of exposure or theft in the event of a breach.</p>

<p>Today, the average consumer has 100 online accounts, and, in a perfect world, each account would have unique and complex usernames and passwords. But that is not reality. Many people use simple (easy to guess) passwords and many more reuse passwords on multiple sites. To make matters worse, most people rarely change their passwords. All these practices present a huge challenge to IT and security professionals trying to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Stolen username and password combinations are regularly bought and sold on the black market. Attackers can use these stolen credentials to attempt new attacks. How many are we talking about? In 2021, more than 2 billion records containing usernames and passwords were stolen. These stolen credentials may very well be the source of new breaches that we'll have the unfortunate task of reporting on next year.</p>

<p>What else did the report reveal?</p>


			
			  The average cost of a breach in the U.S. was $9.5 million. 
				 Unauthorized access was the top vector in 2021, accounting for 50% of all breaches. 
				 In the U.S. retail sector, the average cost of a single breach rose by nearly two-thirds to $3.27 million. 
				 There was a 297% increase in breaches due to third-party or supply-chain attacks. 
			 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

 If we had no passwords, there'd be no passwords to steal 

<p>The report contains several "best practices" sections for mitigating the types of risks the report exposed. But one practice stands out in light of the relentless rise in crimes involving login credentials: Making passwordless authentication part of your MFA strategy.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication improves both the security and the ease of use for online access, while greatly diminishing the usefulness of credentials stolen by cybercriminals. Phishing and other social engineering attacks rely on users to enter their login credentials, but in a passwordless world, such attacks are fruitless. Same with keylogging, which records a user's keystrokes as a way to get account numbers and login information. And, because no credentials are sent over the internet, they can't be intercepted or subject to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.</p>

<p>The industry's biggest players — Apple, Microsoft, and Google — have announced plans to enable passwordless authentication across multiple devices, browsers, and platforms. We believe the time for passwordless is now, so we can eliminate the threat of stolen credentials. We look forward to seeing the number and severity of breaches retreat, and going passwordless is a great way to start that trend.</p>

<p>Now, I want to dive a little deeper into the vulnerabilities. In this short post, we’ll dive into Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and look at the built-in help you get when using Angular.</p>

 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection 

<p>In the <a>previous post</a>, you learned how an attack for CSRF occurs when an agitator uses your active session for a trusted site to perform unauthorized actions. We also learned there’s built-in support from browsers to mitigate attacks with <code>SameSite</code> attributes on cookies, validating the authenticity of the request on the backend, and potentially having the frontend send a CSRF token to the backend for every request.</p>

<p>The mitigation strategies primarily require server-side work, except for that game of CSRF token sending, where the client needs to send the token back in a way the backend can validate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When using CSRF tokens, it’s essential to tie the token to the user’s session so that the backend can validate the request. The most common ways are through the patterns called <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern">Synchronizer Token Pattern</a> and <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">Double Submit Cookie</a>.</p>

 Synchronizer Token Pattern 

<p>The Synchronizer Token Pattern requires the backend to store the user’s session information and match it up with the CSRF token for validity. This pattern can be used with SPAs but is a better match for web apps that use forms with post methods for requests, such as:</p>

   <code>&lt;form action="https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;label for="name"&gt;What is your favorite K-Drama?&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Save my favorite K-Drama&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt; 
</code>   

<p>Submitting this form POSTs to <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form</code> using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content type. CSRF is especially susceptible when using non-JSON data.</p>

 Double Submit Cookie Pattern 

<p>Sadly, this pattern doesn’t involve double the cookies—it’s a dual submission. Sad news indeed for chocolate-chip cookie fans. 🍪🍪 😢 But the good news is the Double Submit Cookie Pattern doesn’t require the backend to track the user’s session to the CSRF token.</p>

<p>In this pattern, the CSRF token is a separate cookie from the user’s session identifier. The client sends the CSRF token in every request, and the backend validates that the CSRF token cookie and the token in the request values match. This pattern is more common for SPAs.</p>

 CSRF support in Angular 

<p>Angular has built-in support for a flavor of the Double Submit Cookie Pattern, where the CSRF token is automatically added as an HTTP header for every backend request once you have a CSRF token in a cookie. Nice!</p>

<p>The <code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code> automatically adds an interceptor for your HTTP requests. The interceptor grabs the CSRF token from a session cookie named <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> and adds the token value to outgoing requests in the HTTP header named <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code>. Then your backend is responsible for verifying the values for the cookie and HTTP header match.</p>

<p>To add this handy helper, add <code>HttpClientModule</code> and the <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClientXsrfModule"><code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code></a> to your module’s <code>imports</code> array.</p>

<p>If you don’t like the default names, you have the option of configuring the names of the cookie and HTTP header like this:</p>

   <code>imports: [
  HttpClientModule,
  HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions({
    cookieName: 'Pecan-Sandies',
    headerName: 'Top-Of-Page'
  })
]
</code>

<p>Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID v1.0</a> as a W3C standard!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as an international standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in late 2014 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack">hack to TLS</a> that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. Around the same time, Dave Longley and Manu Sporny were exploring similar ideas around identifiers and decentralization in the <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/">W3C Web Payments Community Group</a>. Then, in 2015, Christopher began work with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network as part of the XDI Registry Working Group, whose goal was to explore possibilities for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers; a strawman was presented at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized">IIW 21</a>.</p>

<p>That presentation led to interest from Anil John of the Science and Technical Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. Christopher helped to coordinate a community effort that led to both Drummond Reed at Respect Network and Manu Sporny at Digital Bazaar submitting proposals to the Identity Management and Data Privacy R&amp;D Program. The goal was to show wide community interest in decentralized identity. Not only did both companies receive a grant, but they also both received additional funds through round two of the program.</p>

<p>Much of the community’s support for DIDs then occurred through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop</a> that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers that were published following that first workshop was the massive <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure paper</a>, which included as one of its design principles that “each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding”, but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.</p>

<p>DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e">ID2020 conference</a> at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chasen of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">Requirements for DIDs</a>, supported by that US Department of Homeland Security grant. That was also the workshop that brought in Manu Sporny’s work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which required an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.</p>

<p>Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer’s Draft 01</a> that was written at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec. Many, many more people contributed to the evolution of the design, among them: Daniel Buchner, who spearheaded Microsoft’s support of DIDs and with Microsoft’s backing created the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF); and Joe Andrieu, who led the work on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, a way to evaluate DID methods, as well as foundational use cases and engagement models for decentralized identity such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers document</a>.</p>

<p>As part of his work on the preliminary DID spec, Christopher became one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group alongside Joe Andrieu and Kim Hamilton Duffy. There, he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to be presented to the W3C. He has also been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group’s work became a “W3C Recommendation” and thus an official international standard. Our congratulations to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel, to DID editors Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, Markus Sabadello, and Drummond Reed, and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubated in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">the BTCR DID method</a>, which has been dubbed the <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/podcasts/23899/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids-didbtcr">“granddaddy of DIDs”</a>. This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, very similar to the X.509 cert revocation that Christopher was advocating back in 2014.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not published much on DIDs, except as an educational topic for our interns, it continues to be a future focus for us, with the idea of decentralized identifiers being a crucial assumption for our Gordian architecture. Christopher also continues to be an invited expert on Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and has advocated for the DID spec throughout its ratification process. Our expertise with DIDs and with BTCR leaves this all as an open opportunity for Blockchain Commons. If you’ve considered becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons and are interested in DID work, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> to discuss the topic!</p>

<p>Bringing data validation and verification to Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Shipyard, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, is introducing Athena Protocol as its first grantee of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Athena Protocol will add value to the Ocean ecosystem by developing an interface to accredit data before it is posted to the marketplace as well as bringing easy-to-consume climate datasets collected from IoT mesh networks and satellites.</p><p>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, said:</p><blockquote>“Data validation and verification tools such as what Athena are building promise to add tremendous value to the Ocean ecosystem. We are excited to support their work on this through Shipyard and look forward to bringing the results to the community.”</blockquote><p>Timothy Carter, Chief Executive Officer, commented:</p><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol Foundation and the Shipyard program go above and beyond to support the work we do to bridge the gap between the blockchain and the real world. Our tools and services will add credibility to data assets on Ocean Market, unlocking altogether new use cases like ESG asset verification and more. Shipyards support allows us to move ahead with confidence in our development.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.athena.tech/">Athena Protocol</a> is building IoT and edge computing infrastructure solutions for bridging the gap between the offline world and the blockchain world to ensure transparency, equity and algorithmic accountability in automated data collection and verification processes.</p><p>To facilitate the ethical collection of data on a global scale, Athena Protocol leverages on SolarPunk Network (SPN). The SPN provides an alternative to current architectures in that it facilitates near real-time monitoring without sacrificing privacy; securely bridging the gap between stakeholders and the decision-making processes that affect their lives, their communities, and their ecosystems.</p><p>Athena Protocol will enable data verification on Ocean Protocol and, thanks to the $50,000 in $OCEAN granted by Ocean Shipyard, they will be able to commit to transparent and clear deliverables.</p><p>By the end of September 2022, Athena will develop an interface for proposing data assets and managing asset portfolios. This will allow the team to focus on processes and procedures for Social Credentials &amp; data NFTs. On top of this, the first ESG asset verification suite v1 will be accredited and published, allowing for multi-token contracts for algorithmic consensus. The Athena team is also ready to launch 2 pilots with full-scale ESG MRV project proponents to quantify ecosystem services.</p><p>By the end of December 2022, it’s envisaged that the design and token model for $ATHENA will be finalized, and the ESG verification suite v2 will be built and deployed.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data economy.

<p>Expansion: In addition to the growing use of crypto, now asset tokenization is being adopted in many fields, such as real estate, investment funds, and artworks because of the greater agility and transparency in transactions. Alberto Fernandez, mentioned in this Spanish media, highlights that the only limitation to achieving greater tokenization of economies lies in the regulation of each country. Finance, digital assets-derived products, and sports business are now the sectors adopting tokens the most to grow and reinvent themselves. He also affirms that Ardor is the best blockchain for tokenization, thanks to its embedded advanced and predefined tools to deploy any kind of tokens, pay dividends in one single transaction, and control what users can do with the tokens to comply with the regulations.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Thales, a global provider of advanced technology solutions, with more than 80,000 employees worldwide, and an established business unit for Digital Identity and Security, has announced the acquisition of OneWelcome, one of the leading European providers of CIAM (Consumer IAM).</p>
<p>While the acquisition will provide OneWelcome with a go-to-market capability on a global scale, there are interesting options beyond that. OneWelcome delivers CIAM and B2B management capabilities, consent management, authentication support, and policy-based access control. Thales, on the other hand, has a variety of cybersecurity and identity technologies in its portfolio, including biometrics and identity verification, digital wallets, and data security and data protection.</p>
<p>The combination of authentication of customers with strong authentication technologies such as biometrics and identity verification, and consent management with data protection and data security, brings the potential for leveraging the strengths of both vendors for delivering innovations to the market.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is the question about the potential impact on existing customers. Due to the fact that the portfolios of both companies are complementary, but with almost no overlaps, the risk for existing customers of products becoming end-of-life as a consequence of this acquisition, appears to be negligible. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a strong potential for customers to benefit from improvements provided by joining the forces of these two vendors. This will depend on Thales effectively leveraging the strong potential that this acquisition holds.</p>
<p>For more information on OneWelcome’s CIAM and consent management capabilities, have a look at this Executive View report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80945/onewelcome-customer-identity-and-b2b-identity">OneWelcome Customer Identity and B2B identity</a> and this Leadership Compass report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80532/privacy-and-consent-management-2022">Privacy and Consent Management 2022</a>.</p>

 Supercharge your Job Search with Next-gen&nbsp;Tech <p>Many people are wary of looking for and applying to jobs online, and rightly so, as job scammers are on the rise, targeting their prey more creatively than&nbsp;before.</p><p>So, how can we help people quickly ascertain genuine opportunities while matching their skills and experience to suitable roles? About 70 students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore attempted to answer this question during the LemmaTree x NTU POCathon.</p><p>They came up with impressive submissions, ranging from job portals showcasing verified jobs and companies to scam alert verification features. The 17 teams that participated in this event wowed the judges with their amazing POCs, created in less than four weeks. The top 6 teams were shortlisted for an in-person demonstration in NTU, where all four judges cracked their heads to select the top 3 winning&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Here are the great ideas of the top&nbsp;6:</p><p>1235</p><p>1235 proposed a verified and optimized human resources platform for companies and applicants to create verified customizable profiles. Their POC, powered by Affinidi’s APIs, strives to help companies verify their job applicants’ backgrounds and vice versa. It was awe-inspiring for the judges to see a product coded within such a short&nbsp;time.</p><p>BYTEMASTERS</p><p>BYTEMASTERS’ proposed solution grants access only to verified companies, ensuring that job-seekers do not have to deal with any job scams while receiving a curated list of suitable roles powered by AI technologies. Although they did not manage to create a fully functional application, they made an interesting comparison of current solutions and their loopholes before crafting an all-rounded solution. Kudos to the&nbsp;team.</p><p>localhost404</p><p>localhost404 created a functional portal that accurately detects unverified companies and job postings besides curating a list of suitable job opportunities for users. The judges were impressed with the ready application.</p><p>Newbility</p><p>Team Newbility proposed a web service solution that could verify company accounts, review job posts, and provide tailored talent and job recommendations to companies and applicants. A unique feature of their proposed solution was to feature job openings from other sources instead of having the companies post their roles from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>noTurningBackSistas</p><p>One of the most out-of-the-box ideas goes to this all-women team. Their solution focused on helping remote employees, including freelancers, by creating smart contracts, a digital wallet, and automated scam detections. They even included an introductory tutorial for users — putting themselves in the shoes of users,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>ThesePeopleAreOnTime</p><p>Another all-women team, these people were not only on time but also on point. Their solution revolved around matching verified companies with verified talents, and vice-versa, to create a trusted environment for everyone involved.</p><p>These teams presented their solutions to our&nbsp;judges:</p>  Alex Albano, Marketing &amp; Ecosystem Growth,&nbsp;Affinidi  Tan Min Min, Director of Product,&nbsp;Affinidi  Duy Dang, Head of Engineering, Trustana  Dilparinder Singh, Strategy Lead, LemmaTree  <p>The winning teams to walk away with cash prizes and an exclusive internship were:</p>  Newbility  1235  ThesePeopleAreOnTime  <p>We thank all the participants of this PoCathon for their enthusiastic participation, and we hope to see these solutions launching soon.</p><p><a href="http://developers@affinidi.com">Contact us</a> if you’d like to discuss specific use cases or learn more about creating solutions using trusted&nbsp;data.</p> Join our Community today <p>Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a></p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a></p><p>Get latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing&nbsp;list</a></p><p>Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?</p><p>Start building with the <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/docs/api">Affinidi tech stack</a>&nbsp;now</p><p>For media enquiries, please contact Affinidi’s PR team via <a href="mailto:pr@affinidi.com">pr@affinidi.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/supercharge-your-job-search-with-next-gen-tech-5339e0008250">Supercharge Your Job Search With Next-gen Tech</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

             <p>Schools and suppliers of digital learning resources have taken the initiative of jointly developing further agreements that will contribute to simple, safe and trust-based data sharing. The ‘Edu-V’ programme will result in a scheme – afsprakenstelsel&nbsp;in Dutch – that will reduce the effort and risk associated with using digital applications for teaching purposes and will help schools to offer future-proof education that gets the best out of pupils and students. INNOPAY is facilitating the co-creation process.</p>

<p>Uniform agreements can help solve concrete challenges faced by schools on an everyday basis, for example by reducing the amount of time spent logging in to various systems, by giving them better visibility on individual pupils’ or students’ progress towards their learning goals or by allowing them to use digital applications in a safer and more privacy-friendly way. These are all important pillars of flexible and future-focused education.</p>

<p>Mariane ter Veen, Director Data Sharing at INNOPAY and programme manager of Edu-V, said: “"I am very happy to lead this initiative. Edu-V serves a very important social purpose, realising future-proof education that gets the best out of pupils and students.”</p>

<p>The Edu-V programme supports the education sector’s ambitions to further improve the quality of education in the Netherlands. It is partly financed by the Dutch government’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationaalgroeifonds.nl/english/government-allocates/government-allocates-%E2%82%AC646-million-to-projects-designed-to-boost-economic-growth">National Growth Fund</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock launches <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a>, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first  Organizations can request private user data in a privacy-preserving way that users can trust based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity while leveraging the security of cryptography  Developers can build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and authenticate people securely with Web3 ID  <p>Table of Contents</p>  Fully Own and Control Your Web3 Identity <p>Our team has been working diligently to keep building robust decentralized identity solutions and we are excited to announce the launch of Dock’s Web3 ID. Web3 ID is a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. It allows organizations to securely request private user data and the user has the option to give permission to reveal the information or confirm it without revealing the data at all. Web3 ID enables people to fully own and control their digital identity. </p><p>Centralized digital identity management systems are broken. Organizations storing all their users' data on centralized servers are putting it at greater risk by creating a "honey pot" where a hacker can breach and access all that information at once. These systems use centralized identifiers, like email addresses and phone numbers, that can be used to track users online, correlate their data (data can be traced back to someone's identity), and share that information with third parties without people's knowledge. Cybercrimes cost victims <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cybercrime-victims-318-billion/">$318 billion annually</a> and <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705">the average person manages between 70 to 80 passwords</a>, which creates a bad and unsecure user experience. Web3 ID solves many of these problems.</p><p>“Web3 ID is essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity. We’ve developed game-changing technology that enhances security, efficiency, and privacy for individuals, developers, and organizations.”–Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock</p> Key Benefits of Web3 ID <p>Individuals</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Developers</p><p>Sign in to websites and apps securely with blockchain-based authentication while fully owning and controlling your digital identity</p><p>Can request and instantly verify private and personal data from their users without the need to store it</p><p>Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords</p><p>Create as many Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as you want for different relationships and interactions to prevent user tracking and correlation (your data can be traced back to your identity by signing in to websites and apps with Google for example)&nbsp;</p><br><p>Creates more trust between organizations as users know that Web3 ID preserves their privacy and they are always in control of their data. Dock, as an auth provider, does not store any user data.</p><p>Removes inefficient authentication processes&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Prevent account takeover through the security of cryptography</p><p>Less stored data can help reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks</p><br><p>Easy integration with OAuth</p><br><p>Privacy is protected with the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (proving something about yourself without revealing the data that supports the proof) and selective disclosure (choosing only a specific part of a credential to share) technology</p><p>Improved security with public-key cryptography</p><br><p>Request data directly from users</p><p>People store their digital identity credentials in a non-custodial identity wallet (you have sole control of your private keys)</p><br><p></p><br><p>With crypto wallets, developers can verify publicly available data on the blockchain. With Web3 ID, developers can verify private user data.</p> What is Web3? These are the ways people sign in to Web1, Web2, and Web3.<p>Before we dive into the details of Web3 ID, it’s important to understand what Web3 is. </p><p>The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was coined by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist who is the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama. Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide increased data security, scalability, and privacy for people. A key part of Web3 is that users should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only when they choose to do so. </p> The Evolution of the Internet These are the key characteristics of Web1, Web2, and Web3. Key Differences Between Each Phase of the Internet <p>Web1</p><p>Web2 (dominant form of the internet now)</p><p>Web3</p><p>Creators were usually developers&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive and social web</p><p>Smart applications</p><p>Read-only, static websites that mainly had text or image content without much interactivity</p><p>Era of centralization where a large share of communication happens on platforms owned by a handful of corporations like Amazon and Facebook&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized internet where Web3 applications and websites run on blockchain&nbsp;</p><br><p>Anyone can be a creator with platforms like YouTube and interact with the content</p><p>People can own and prove the ownership of digital assets</p><br><p>Data is owned, shared, and controlled by third parties</p><p>People can interact with content without needing authorization from a centralized platform like Facebook that can remove content and responses posted on a platform</p><br><p>Read-write websites&nbsp;</p><p>You own your data that is securely stored in a non-custodial identity wallet&nbsp;</p><br><p>Computers retrieve and show searched information but don’t understand the meaning behind the websites</p><p>Semantic web that makes internet data machine-readable, which provides richer and more accurate search results based on someone’s intent and meaning rather than keywords alone</p> Centralized vs. Decentralized Digital Identity Management <p>A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. </p><p>The data that forms a digital identity includes: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  Social media profiles  <p>Problems With Web2</p><p>Web3 Solutions</p><p>Never-ending data breaches (when information is stolen, viewed, transmitted, copied, or used by an unauthorized person)</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by a central gatekeeper</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by users&nbsp;</p><p>Monetization of apps incentivize companies to sell information based on personal data</p><p>People are rewarded for using, building, and maintaining Web3 projects without sharing data unless the user allows it</p><p>Companies own your data and you have no control over how it is used</p><p>Full ownership and control of your data</p><p>Companies often track, store, and share user data</p><p>Prevents tracking and information is only shared when you give consent</p><p>Organizations can remove access to data and services any time&nbsp;</p><p>No central authority can take away your control over your digital identity</p> How Web3 ID Works <p>In Web2, people authenticating their identity have to manage an endless number of emails, passwords, and other login information, all of which are centralized digital identifiers, while data is being spread more on the internet. And when people log in with Google or Facebook that don’t require someone to create a new account, they are still sacrificing their privacy. But with Web3 ID, people can create their own Decentralized Identifiers to securely prove their identities and credentials to sign in to apps and websites without compromising their privacy.</p><p>Web3 ID is:</p>  A collection of the user's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Blockchain-based authentication and authorization system  <p>How people can sign in with Web3 ID:</p>  An app or website uses a QR code to request cryptographically verifiable digital identity or credential data that is securely stored in someone’s digital identity wallet app  The user scans the QR code and is prompted to confirm the specific data needed to access or use an app or website  Coming soon to Web3 ID: People will be able to use privacy techniques like Selective Disclosure (only share a specific part of a credential) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (prove something about themselves without revealing the data that supports the proof)   The Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in Web3 Identity Management <p>With Web3 authentication, a Decentralized Identifier is used. A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a digital wallet. </p><p>Here is an example of different DIDs on a Dock Wallet:</p>With Dock's Web3 identity wallet, you can create and manage as many DIDs as you want for different interactions.<p>A DID: </p>  Doesn’t contain personal data or wallet information  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Transferable across apps and websites  Can connect to multiple Verifiable Credentials that contain cryptographically secured user data  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Someone can have as many DIDs as they want which prevents correlation and tracking. Correlation and tracking are when companies like Google and Facebook track data back to a user because the same centralized identifier is used to sign in to multiple websites and apps. To enhance data security, someone can create a DID for professional purposes where they give permission to share their educational credentials while applying for a job and use another DID that’s only used to access online gaming websites.</p> The Role of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in Web3 Identity Management Conveniently manage your Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in your Dock Wallet.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. For example identity documents, certifications, licenses, and degrees can be issued as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Key points:</p>  Personal user data is securely stored as Verifiable Credentials which are kept in a digital wallet app  Multiple Verifiable Credentials can be attached to a DID  Verifiable Credentials are not stored on the blockchain   Web3 Identity Benefits For Individuals, Organizations, and Developers <p></p> Web3 ID Benefits For Individuals   Enhanced user experience: Secure sign-in with blockchain-based authentication with one digital wallet by simply scanning a QR code rather than storing an endless number of logins and passwords   Full control and ownership of your Web3 identity: People can store all of their digital identity credentials in a non-custodial mobile wallet (you have sole control of your keys)  Portability: Your digital identity can be verified anywhere, any time  Privacy and security: Prevent account takeover with cryptography and privacy is protected with the use of Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure technology  Security: Data is only shared when you give permission and is protected with cryptography &nbsp;   Web3 ID Benefits For Organizations   Request private data from users while protecting their privacy: Securely request private data to access your service, or verify eligibility  Create trust between organizations and users: Authenticate users securely with the use of DIDs to prevent tracking and data correlation that traces data back to a user  Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks: Because user data is not stored on a centralized database, organizations are less exposed to hacks and data breaches   High security: Data is protected with public-key cryptography   Improves efficiency in the verification process: Credentials can be verified instantly which reduces the cost and resources of managing digital identities   Web3 ID Benefits For Developers   Authenticate users securely and efficiently: Eliminates the need for user passwords and prevents account takeovers  Easy to integrate with OAuth: Just use your favorite OAuth library and update the domain/URLs in the configs  Open source and open standards: Web3 ID is <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/auth-server">open-source</a> and it uses the Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials W3C open standard   Industry-Leading Decentralized Identity Technology Solutions <p></p> Pioneers in Web3 Identity <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> has been a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space since 2017 and our team has some of the brightest minds in the blockchain industry. Our mission is to solve universal problems with data solutions and we have been building cutting-edge <a href="https://dock.io/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a> and <a href="https://dock.io/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> technology that will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. </p><p>We work with organizations to adapt and innovate the Web3 ecosystem by helping them make documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. </p> Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Web3 Authentication (coming soon) <p>Private user data should never be on a public blockchain. In Web3 authentication, Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic method where no passwords or identity data are exchanged. ZKPs basically allow you to prove information or identity without revealing the actual data itself, which greatly enhances online privacy and security. </p><p>Examples of how ZKPs are used: </p>  If you want to buy alcohol, you can confirm to the cashier that you are at least 18 years old without revealing your birth date by presenting the credential on the digital wallet app  Rather than typing your password to log in to a website, you can send a proof that you “know your password”  You can prove that you have a certain number of tokens without disclosing your full wallet balance   Conclusion  <p>Dock has launched Web3 ID, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. Web3 ID is a collection of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a non-custodial digital identity wallet. Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide more data security, scalability, and privacy for people. Web3 enables people to fully control and own their digital identity. </p><p>Key Benefits of Web 3 ID: </p>  For individuals: Enables secure sign in to websites and apps, full control and ownership of their digital identity, prevents user tracking, and prohibits account takeover  Organizations: Safely request private user data from users while maintaining their privacy, operate with improved security with public-key cryptography, and reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less data  Developers: Enables developers to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords, easy OAuth integration, and remove inefficient authentication processes<br>  <p><br></p><p><br></p>

   5 Reasons to Implement or Upgrade to 7.2 
<p>The online world is crowded, and organizations are focusing their attention on digital experiences to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Identity and access management (IAM) solutions have become the strategic IT tool for such organizations to deliver a personalized user experience.</p>

<p>How strategic? Gartner estimates that by 2025, organizations adopting customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions with converged fraud detection and passwordless authentication will be able to reduce customer churn by half!<a>*</a> Half! This forecast highlights the advantages a well-designed CIAM solution can bring to your business.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I'd like to introduce you to some of the features of the newly released <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.2/platform-guide/about.html">ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.2</a>. This release — like those before — supports our company's mission of enabling secure access to the connected world. For 7.2, we remained focused on making the customer experience both secure and exceptional, so you can keep customers engaged and coming back. There's a lot in this release, so we've broken it down into five ways its new capabilities can help solve some of your most pressing business challenges.</p>

  
    <p>Elevate the Customer Experience. This is really the name of the game. By providing a seamless omnichannel experience, your customers can get what they need when they need it. To this end, we extended our commitment to open standards. We've enabled extensions on top of the OAuth2 standard so you can configure more ways to authorize per application. This means users can get to what they need within their applications quickly, post login. </p>
   
 <p>Another cool feature in 7.2 is what we refer to as circuit breakers. In a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid world</a>, network latency between cloud and legacy or on-premises applications could result in a poor experience. With circuit breakers, you can reduce traffic to applications and also let users know if an application is slow or unavailable. The ability to push out a simple message, "We're running a bit slow today, be right with you," can help to reduce user abandonment and churn.</p>

  
    <p>Save Time and Improve Efficiency. Administrator time is valuable. As you scale up to support your ongoing digital transformation initiatives, it's important to ensure your IT administrators have tools that help them efficiently optimize the overall health and success of your IAM solution. To this end, we've added a couple of nodes to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> drag-and-drop orchestration engine. The Set Custom Cookie Node and Dynamic Scripting Node help to pass along stored attributes to clients and applications, easing the integration of legacy applications. Another, the Identity Management Groups (IDM Groups) Node uses group membership information to make smarter decisions about user journeys.</p>
   
   Improve Security. Everyone wants greater security, but in the identity world, security needs to be balanced and nuanced. Financial-grade API, or FAPI, has become the de-facto high-grade security and privacy standard for financial use cases, and many organizations beyond financial services are adopting FAPI. We already supported the standard, but with 7.2, we are delivering Enhanced FAPI Support, which is increasingly required with open banking standards.

   
   
    <p>Enhance Scalability, Performance, and Resiliency. IAM needs to perform at internet-scale. Users who experience slow returns due to sluggish retrieval of identity-related information will drop out of an enrollment or a transaction. For 7.2, we have optimized Big Indexes with our Directory Services. This means that as your directory grows to millions (or even billions) of consumer, workforce, and IoT identities and attributes, you can rest assured that your users and applications won't be left hanging when a big data search is required.</p>
   
   
    <p>Platform Extensibility/Low-Code/No-Code. Drag-and-drop orchestration is a game-changer. There are just too many use cases and changing business roles for developers to be intensively coding and testing every user journey. With 7.2, new nodes such as Dynamic Scripted Configuration Node, Set Custom Cookie Node, and Passthrough Authentication Node appear like magic in the orchestration library and deliver new capabilities with just a few clicks.</p>
   
 <p>In addition to those outlined here, there are many, many more features in the 7.2 release. We invite you to check out the ForgeRock Identity Platform Release 7.2, now available, by reading What's New here (<a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">AM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">DS</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">IDM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">IG</a>) and downloading the software here: (<a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/am/featured">AM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ds/featured">DS</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/idm/featured">IDM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ig/featured">IG</a>)</p>

<p>Amid tumultuous world markets, the crypto community <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/crypto-losses-hit-670m-in-q2-up-52-from-year-ago-period/">took losses of $670M in Q2</a>, up 52% from one year ago. Even through these strong headwinds, many companies doubled-down on building break-out products, including Civic. And, on the last day of the quarter, European Union regulators agreed on the long-debated Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/eu-agrees-on-landmark-crypto-authorization-law-mica/">landmark crypto authorization law</a> aimed at protecting investors and setting up stricter standards for stablecoin issuers. On their coattails, US regulators released the <a href="https://blockworks.co/us-regulators-release-first-of-many-reports-on-crypto-following-exec-order/">first of many reports on crypto</a> following the Biden administration’s executive order. As regulatory momentum gains speed, Web3 identity that is secure, private, reusable and verifiable on-chain becomes more important daily. Civic is ready to answer that call!</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>In Q2 of 2022, Civic introduced a new tool, called uniqueness verification, that determines user individuality in order to build diverse communities. When a project uses Civic Pass for uniqueness verification, each user is limited to using one wallet, making NFT drops or any other Web3 use cases a more fair and controllable experience across the board. The Ocean Explorers NFT project will be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">the first project to use</a> uniqueness verification, and NFT buyers can <a href="https://civic.me/#oe-get-civic-pass">sign up for their uniqueness verification now</a>, in advance of the mint.</p>



<p>In other product news, Civic also launched a <a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/dao-governance">Civic Pass integration for Realms</a>, the preeminent DAO governance platform on Solana, during a hackathon for AthensDAO. Civic Pass for DAO governance adds a host of new features for DAOs, including Sybil resistance, one-person-one-vote systems and quadratic voting systems. It also allows for bot resistance, and age and location restrictions. For DAOs to be successful in the real world, they must have a broader and more nuanced toolset for managing their communities. Civic Pass is designed to give DAOs the tools they need without sacrificing user privacy.</p>



<p>In partnership with the Solana Foundation, Binance.US and others, <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-trm-labs-partner-against-crypto-fraud-with-chainabuse/">Civic partnered with TRM Labs</a> to support Chainabuse, a multi-chain reporting tool that allows crypto users to report illicit activity to a public forum. Our goal with TRM Labs is to advance fraud detection capabilities.</p>



<p>We also partnered with Anchorage Digital, which provides a best-in-class custody framework. We selected Anchorage to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-taps-anchorage-digital-for-custody-of-cvc-utility-token/">help us scale</a> our growing business. We are also excited that Anchorage now offers CVC token support for any interested CVC institutional holders.</p>



<p>Civic joined the NFT community at NFT NYC with the announcement of our new uniqueness pass for the Ocean Explorers project and with the launch of Civic.me, a new consumer product for displaying digital assets, currently in alpha. Our leaders spoke at event conference panels about stopping mint meltdowns (Chris Hart, CEO) and evolving standards for NFT 2.0 (JP Bedoya, CPO). We also sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeDAO/status/1534581058641055745?s=20&amp;t=2m6NW9rw3c9JAUHiOw4ZqQ">MonkeDAO event</a> and the Superchief Gallery / Snowcrash event while we were in town. Finally, we made our entrance to the event sporting new colors, including Civic Orange, which was part of a greater rebranding effort, <a href="https://hookooekoo.co/magazine/nft-nyc-preview">in collaboration with Hoo Koo E Koo</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, we were proud to collaborate with our non-profit partner, Identity.com, on a white paper about <a href="https://github.com/identity-com/gateway-whitepaper/blob/main/gateway-whitepaper.pdf">The Gateway Protocol</a>, which outlines the technology underlying Civic Pass.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the second quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 130 million viewers, as a result of press releases and news media coverage about <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">uniqueness verification</a> and our partnerships with <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/announcing-the-launch-of-chainabuse-the-multi-chain-scam-reporting-tool-that-empowers-crypto-users-against-fraud">TRM Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/civic_taps_anchorage_digital_for_custody_of_cvc_utility_token/prweb18751345.htm">Anchorage Digital</a>, in publications such as Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch and Benzinga. Stories about the TRM Labs partnership appeared in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/147601/trm-labs-unveils-community-driven-scam-reporting-platform">The Block</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-giants-co-launch-chainabuse-platform-to-water-down-rising-scams">Cointelegraph</a>.</p>



<p>In Q2, our leaders penned several op-eds for Cointelegraph and Newsweek. Our CEO, Chris Hart, opined about <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-makes-company-web3-1718220">what makes a company Web3</a> and how to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/26/how-to-prevent-the-metaverse-from-becoming-a-nightmare/">prevent the metaverse from becoming a nightmare</a>. And, our CPO, JP Bedoya, shared a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/27/who-are-we-in-the-metaverse-and-how-do-we-prove-it/">vision of digital identity in the metaverse</a>. Our VP of Engineering, Dan Kelleher, commented on <a href="https://blockworks.co/house-of-sempronias-departure-from-dao-sparks-further-concerns-over-dao-governance/">ways that DAOs can be more successful</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>Though we’re barely into Q3, we’re already racing ahead toward our next product announcements. We are looking forward to the Ocean Explorers mint, which will use our uniqueness verification to diversify its community membership and protect against bots. And, you can also expect to see more announcements related to civic.me, which allows you to privately manage your Web3 identity, presence and reputation, including your NFTs.</p>

 Dragonfly Fintech named Finalist of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge by BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia <p>BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia have officially announced the finalists for this year’s G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge and we are delighted that Dragonfly Fintech, an innovative fintech solution provider utilizing ProximaX’s blockchain protocol, has been shortlisted as one of the finalists.</p><p>The full <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220712a.htm">press release</a> is as&nbsp;follows:</p> BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia announce finalists of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge   Twenty-one teams have been shortlisted, out of almost 100 teams worldwide.  Competition attracted proposals from a diverse range of competing organisations and&nbsp;teams.  Winners to be announced in October ahead of G20&nbsp;Summit.  <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Bank Indonesia, under the Indonesian G20 Presidency, today announced the shortlisted finalists for the G20 TechSprint challenge on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>The 2022 competition <a href="https://www.bis.org/hub/2022_g20_techsprint.htm">was launched in April</a>. The BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia published three operational challenges and invited a wide range of stakeholders, including innovators, entrepreneurs, developers, data scientists and telecommunications experts worldwide to develop innovative technological solutions to them. The problem statements prompted participants to develop solutions to build effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer CBDCs; to enable financial inclusion; and to improve interoperability and better connect payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>As part of the Indonesia Digital Economy and Finance Festival ahead of the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the shortlisted teams demonstrated their solutions to Bank Indonesia, the BIS and experts invited from central banks around the world. They also participated in a CBDC Masterclass to glean practical insights into some of the CBDC experiments under way at the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>The shortlisted teams now have until the end of August to complete their prototypes, which will then be judged by an independent expert panel convened by Bank Indonesia. Winners for each of the three categories will be announced in October ahead of the G20&nbsp;Summit.</p><p>The 21 finalists were selected from around 100 participating teams from more than 15 countries and jurisdictions. The shortlisted teams range from large global corporations to more specialised fintechs.</p><p>“CBDCs have been attracting strong interest from central banks around the world. The proposals from the finalists offer unique and innovative technology solutions that could allow CBDCs to be widely adopted. This highlights the G20 TechSprint’s role in bringing together innovators and the central banking and regulatory community. We look forward to seeing the fully developed solutions,” said Ross Leckow, Acting Head of the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>“While the need to explore CBDC is inevitably high for central banks, design choices are still unresolved. In practice, we need to understand how policy goals, practical issues and technology intersect. The best way for central banks to prepare for this future of payments is to explore, experiment, conduct proofs of concept, pilot and develop CBDCs. With this in mind, the G20 TechSprint Initiative is a great opportunity for bright and ambitious young individuals as well as mature and well-established firms to show off their best potential and bring the most innovative and applicable solutions in CBDCs,” said Juda Agung, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor.</p><p>For more details about TechSprint, see <a href="http://www.g20techsprint.id/">www.g20techsprint.id</a>.</p> Shortlisted teams <p>Problem statement 1: Building effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer&nbsp;CBDCs</p>  BitMint  Dragonfly Fintech Pte.&nbsp;Ltd.

  <p>Data is widely recognized as the lifeblood of the modern enterprise. However, the exponential rate at which it is being generated means that it is crucial that organizations have the capability to manage it effectively to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&nbsp;These requirements are instantly recognizable as the three principles of information security, which means that in the modern business context, data and security are inextricably linked. But businesses can only use and protect the data they know about, which is why Data Catalogs are becoming increasingly important in the context of optimizing the value&nbsp; of business data.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the emerging role of Data Catalogs for a variety of use cases, with specific emphasis on Data Governance and Data Privacy. He will list and explain core capabilities he expects to see in such solutions, and will talk about the trends in the market.&nbsp;Sam Gillespie, Data Governance Offering Manager at OneTrust will explain the business benefits of trust in data, how to achieve that, and how to use it to build an enduring relationship with consumers. He will also discuss why strong collaboration between data, privacy, marketing, and ethics teams is essential to building trustworthy data-driven practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/protect-govern-data-you-know"></a>

 Stakers can claim DF4 rewards. DF5 will start when veOCEAN&nbsp;ships.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to data asset stakers for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 4 (DF4) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF4 counting started 12:01am Thu Jul 7, 2022, and ended 12:01am Jul 12, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>Catalyzed by recent events, veOCEAN will replace pools as the DF staking mechanism. DF will resume when veOCEAN is launched, within 3&nbsp;months.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, details on DF4, and plans going&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF4 Input Parameters <p>DF4 is the fourth week of DF overall, and fourth week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF4 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters.</p> 4. Changes to Ocean Market and DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>Over the past weekend, Ocean pools encountered a new attack vector, where a malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools. The Ocean core team did near-term triage action to mitigate further attacks. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-changes-3384fd7e113c">This blog post</a> has details. Because of this, DF counting was paused after 5 days, not the usual&nbsp;7.</p><p>Beyond triage, the team updated its plans: Going forward, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a> will be the main mechanism for staking OCEAN, for curation of datasets, and for Data Farming. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar functionality for staking and curation.</p><p>Pool functionality will be removed from Ocean Market. Data Farming is on pause, and will resume when veOCEAN launches, within 3 months. DF will pick up where it left off: in DF5, the first week of DF&nbsp;Beta.</p> 4. DF4 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Due to the attacks over days, volume and stake were winding down. Polygon stake averaged 1,090,424 OCEAN across many pools. However just just two pools had consumes totaling 7776 OCEAN stake (total DCV of 0.216&nbsp;OCEAN).</p><p>With an upper bound APY of 125%, or weekly percent yield of 1.57%, then 122.21 OCEAN was dispensed as rewards. Put another way, the 10000 OCEAN available was not used up because there was not enough stake in the pools with volume. The rewards not dispensed remain in the OceanDAO treasury for future DF rewards or other community programs.</p><p>For more info yet, see the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:e564a527e42210bb67ab4d238de7810465fb98cd91921d9798a0c6623cc32fba">DF4 csvs</a> published as a free asset in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 8. Conclusion <p>DF4 has completed. To claim DF3 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF5 counting will begin when veOCEAN launches, within 3&nbsp;months.</p> Further Reading <p>The post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

   Forrester Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study Confirms a 186% ROI. 
	
	 Can you afford not to look at the economics of your CIAM strategy? 
	
	<p>To say that an organization's identity and access management strategy is important to its business is somewhere between a major understatement and a massive one.  Most businesses agree that if they don't pay sufficient attention to how well they manage their customer interactions, they are at an economic and competitive disadvantage.  And although many can articulate the role of customer identity and access management (CIAM) in their strategy, few have a way to analyze CIAM's benefits with data. In today's economic environment, it's imperative that organizations take a close look at their strategy and infrastructure to identify and quantify areas for improvement.</p>
	
	<p>Forrester Consulting recently conducted a commissioned <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-total-economic-impact">Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study</a> to examine the return on investment (ROI) enterprises can realize by deploying the CIAM platform from ForgeRock. The top-line benefits realized by a typical large enterprise over three years are 186% ROI, less than nine-month payback period, and a net present value (NPV) of $28.5M.  Forrester's approach and methodology give you a way to analyze your own enterprise and gauge the value you could realize.</p>
	
	 The approach and methodology 
	
	<p>The TEI study analyzed the IT infrastructure and technology deployments for customer identity and access management, the business impact of the deployments on the organizations, and their overall strategic significance. Forrester conducted in-depth interviews with several people responsible for the strategy, implementation, and maintenance of their companies' CIAM infrastructure at five large enterprises. They used the resulting information to create a composite organization that represents a typical large global enterprise with $30B in revenue, 20,000 employees, and 30 million customer identities to manage.</p>
	
	<p>The Forrester framework is used to measure the economic impact for the composite organization, and is meant to be adapted and used for any organization to measure current costs and estimate the value of future benefits from implementing the ForgeRock CIAM platform.</p>
	
	 Analysis and results 
	
	<p>The impact analysis focused on five key areas and the potential benefits realized in each of them.</p>
	
	  Legacy environment infrastructure – Not surprisingly, the CIAM infrastructure in most enterprises consists of legacy components that are either home-grown or bought off the shelf and deployed in a heterogeneous manner with some components on-prem and others in the cloud.  Deploying ForgeRock as the single CIAM platform and integrating it with other applications in the enterprise returned a present value savings of $8.1 million over three years. 
		 Avoiding development costs – Software development to integrate an organization's customer workflow into their CIAM environment is expensive to implement and maintain.  ForgeRock's orchestration capabilities enable one to build and modify specific customer journeys using a drag-and-drop capability called Intelligent Access Trees.  This capability saved $1.3 million in custom development. 
		 Reduction in customer support requests – High friction in customer interaction is costly and detrimental to customer satisfaction.  Yet organizations must continue to evolve their identity infrastructure to keep their customers secure, and often do so by sacrificing the customer experience and increasing support costs.  Much of this is  due to tedious password reset procedures, multiple login requirements, and poor implementations of multifactor authentication (MFA). ForgeRock's CIAM platform provides a frictionless self-service approach to password resets, flexible MFA capabilities, and consistent single sign-on capabilities that reduced call volume by 40%, resulting in a present value saving of $24 million. 
		 Improved time-to-value for new releases – Fast-moving enterprises are under constant pressure to add new IT capabilities to support their business. They could include deploying new applications in the infrastructure, improving existing processes such as self-service workflows for customers, and security improvements. Many of these systems and processes have been dependent on and restricted by the CIAM infrastructure. ForgeRock CIAM transforms this dynamic. Improvements included an increase in the number of software releases made to the existing infrastructure, a reduction in the time taken for each release due to the simplified integration capabilities in the ForgeRock platform, and an increase in the number of new software capabilities added to the infrastructure. All this resulted in a present value benefit of $5.9 million realized through cost savings as well as an increase in revenue attributed to the faster addition of customer-facing functionality. 
		 Reduction of fraud – The impact of fraud on customer-facing organizations is significant and expensive.  Costs include reimbursements to customers for fraudulent orders made with their accounts and the effort required to detect such activity.  ForgeRock's platform was directly responsible for detecting and reducing fraudulent transactions by 25%, resulting in a present value savings of $4.7 million. 
	  Applying these results 
	
	<p>In its study, Forrester says: "By adopting a unified identity platform, enterprises have an opportunity to treat digital identity and identity access management as a key strategic initiative and work to develop and deliver differentiated experiences that delight customers and drive loyalty and profitability." Through its analysis, Forrester provides a framework that identifies the cost, benefit, flexibility, and risks that factor into a CIAM investment decision.</p>

	<p>In today's economic climate, can you afford not to?</p>

				<p>Sometimes I marvel at how, despite sending people to space, editing genes, and getting dangerously close to AGI, humanity hasn’t built a way for me to prove my legal name is Riley Hughes online. Even to do so in real life, I need to pull a hopefully-not-forged plastic card out of a leather pouch in my pocket.<br><br></p><p>WHAT?! <br><br></p><p>Today’s digital identity companies ask users to photograph those plastic cards (and take a selfie) to authenticate their identity. Yet, we don’t photograph handwritten notes to communicate—we email. We don’t photograph checks to pay—we use Venmo or crypto. For all of our modern transactions, we use modern technologies and streamlined processes.</p><p><br>Our identity is the last thread tethering our lives to paper. It’s laughable, really, the way we’ve continued to use an archaic system for such an important and sensitive part of our lives.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What Does Identity Even Mean? 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>When I refer to identity in this context, I’m referring to everything that makes you, you. It’s not the same as “auth”—usernames, social logins, even public keys, are not your identity. And we’re not just referring to government IDs either. Our lives are so much richer and extend beyond our birthplace or address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Real digital identity will allow us to represent our whole selves. It will enable us to illustrate and safely share our certifications, community memberships, licenses, preferences, and so much more.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Catch-22 Problem of Digitally-Native Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So why hasn’t real, digitally-native identity been done? First we need to acknowledge the catch-22 problem that exists. Right now, a university won’t be motivated to issue digital diplomas unless there are companies accepting them. Companies however, won’t be motivated to create an ecosystem for accepting university diplomas until universities are issuing them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer: we need a standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Historically, companies have tried to *be* the standard. The problem with companies *being* the standard is that it’s led to a graveyard of “one ID to rule them all” companies. The result is clear: No single company can own the world’s identity. Even if a company does succeed in a niche, they scarcely grow beyond that niche. Only a standard can solve this problem at scale.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Role of Verifiable Credentials 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>This is where verifiable credentials (VCs) come into play. VCs are a W3C standard data container. Data inside a VC can be verified instantly and independently. That means someone could check that my diploma:<br><br></p>  was issued by my university,  was issued to me,  hasn’t been tampered with, and  isn’t revoked  <p><br>all without checking with the university. Of course, you’ll only trust the data in the credential as long as you trust the issuer. But this new standardized data container makes data portable for the first time.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Challenges of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Instead of the interoperability companies were expecting, what we got were 15+ different “flavors” of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. These ranged from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBTs</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaHGyY9TjPg4a0VNLCsfchoVG1yU3ffTDsPRcU99H1E/edit#slide=id.g11b904107df_0_1">web5</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO’s mDL</a> (the standard Apple’s mobile driver’s license is based on), and more.</p>

				<p>What started as an effort toward interoperability ended up a mess of standards. Now, instead of solving business problems and building product, developers are being sucked into maintaining interoperability with an ever-changing, increasingly complex decentralized identity landscape. They’re forced to spend time and resources researching and detangling these complexities, instead of building their actual products.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>But the worst part of proliferating standards is the impact it’s had on adoption. The value of a standard is an exponential function of its adoption. In other words, verifiable credentials only become valuable as adoption increases. And the catch-22 problem is hard enough to overcome—a splintered ecosystem doesn’t help anything!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So is decentralized identity doomed? Enter Trinsic.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Trinsic: Decentralized Identity Made Simpler 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>We created Trinsic as an infrastructure for building awesome identity products. Dozens of engineers use our SDK to build identity wallets or embed verifiable credentials into their products. Our SDK enables an Apple Pay-like UX for sharing and verifying data either online or in-person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal has been to completely abstract away the complexity of the ever-changing landscape so organizations can focus on the important stuff—what product to build, and how to take it to market. Teams shouldn’t have to “pick winners” and wager what to build on. Their products should be interoperable with multiple ecosystems. That’s what Trinsic is providing, out-of-the-box.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Our Story 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So how did we get started? We came together in 2019 and built the first SaaS product for decentralized identity where developers didn’t have to run anything locally. We removed barriers to entry through a freemium product with usage-based pricing. We wanted to create a way for anyone to issue a verifiable credential in under five minutes, and we did.</p>

															</a>
														 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>As we ventured forward, we decided to build for the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> ecosystem first; it was the most mature ecosystem at the time, and we knew the ecosystem well. It was a great starting point, and we quickly became a major player in that community. Last we checked, we power about 2/3 of Sovrin’s traffic, which equates to tens of thousands of transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we also support the W3C ecosystem, including JSON-LD and BBS+ credentials, as well as the Anoncred format from the Sovrin ecosystem. Furthermore, we support anchoring those credentials to Bitcoin (using ION), Veres1, and traditional web-based PKI. <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">You can see all the details for each of these in our docs.</a> In short, today we’re building the rails that power products that interact with this emerging ecosystem of verifiable, user-controlled data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And where are we going next? Let’s talk about Visa, first. Below you can see the Visa business model:</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Visa created a trust model that successfully brought over 1 billion people access to better payment transactions. And they proved the model could scale. Our plan is to take that trust model and apply it to identity. Of course, there are some key differences:<br><br></p>  First, instead of plastic credit cards, we use digital verifiable credentials.  Secondly, instead of a centralized settlement network written in Cobol, we use decentralized PKI—usually on a blockchain, but we work with traditional DNS-based PKI too.  Lastly, instead of controlling the entire ecosystem, we’re an open, API-first infrastructure anyone can build on.  					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Our approach to growth has been very product-led. It’s helped us remain highly scalable as community members help answer questions other developers pose, contribute to discussions on new products being built, and foster an environment where more developers want to join and explore building. We’re what Visa would have built if they wrote their software in 2020 instead of 1960—except for identity instead of payments.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Future of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>By removing the barriers to entry and providing an interoperability layer for developers, Trinsic is attempting to crack the adoption problem of decentralized identity. The best news: we’re seeing it work. We’re currently powering over 100,000 end-users’ identity wallets, up by about ~10x in just the last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, imagine for a moment you’re getting off the SpaceX craft on a Mars Colony. You need to prove your identity. Do you pull a plastic card out of your spacesuit? No. The future of identity will be much better than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That future is a digitally-native identity as legitimate and nuanced as your human identity. Call it decentralized identity, web5, self-sovereign identity, reusable identity, or whatever you’d like. But it’s happening. Now that we know it’s possible, it’s inevitable.</p>

 Updating an application to use OAuth 2.0 doesn’t need to be complicated. Most of the time, your language or framework will already have an OAuth library. Sometimes, this isn’t the case, and you need to find an alternative. In this post, I’ll walk through setting up and using OAuth2 Proxy to secure your application without any code changes!

 An application without security 
 
 
<p>First things first, we need an application. You can use any web application, but for this post, I’ll stick with a Java Spring Boot app that will echo the details of the inbound HTTP request. Echoing the request information will help visualize the additional HTTP headers added by OAuth2 Proxy, such as the user’s email address.</p>
 
 
<p>You can grab the project from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example">GitHub</a>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example.git -b start
cd okta-oauth2-proxy-example</code> 
 
 
 






If you want to see the completed project, check out the <code>main</code> branch instead.



 
 
<p>If you are interested in the details for this Java application, take a look at the <code>EchoApplication</code> class. It contains a single endpoint that will handle all requests and "dump" the contents of the request as a JSON object:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@RestController
static class EchoRestController {
    @RequestMapping("/**")
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; echo(HttpServletRequest request,
                             @RequestHeader HttpHeaders headers,
                             @RequestBody(required = false) Map&lt;String, Object&gt; body) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();

        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; result = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();
        result.put("clientIpAddress", request.getRemoteAddr());
        result.put("cookies", cookies == null ? emptyList()
                                              : Arrays.stream(cookies).toList());
        result.put("headers", headers.toSingleValueMap()); // simplify json response
        result.put("httpVersion", request.getProtocol());
        result.put("method", request.getMethod());
        result.put("body", body);
        result.put("queryString", request.getQueryString());
        result.put("startedDateTime", now);
        result.put("url", request.getRequestURL());

        return result;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you are a Java fan, you can start the application by running <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>. Everyone else can run the following Docker commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker build --tag echo-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 echo-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once the application is running, open up your browser or access the web application in your terminal with HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost:8080/echo</code> 
 
 
 






When using HTTPie, you can omit "localhost" and just type <code>http :8080/echo</code>! 😎



 
 
<p>You will see a response that looks something like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
    "body": null,
    "clientIpAddress": "172.17.0.1",
    "cookies": [],
    "headers": {
        "accept": "*/*",
        "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
        "connection": "keep-alive",
        "host": "localhost:8080",
        "user-agent": "HTTPie/3.2.1"
    },
    "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
    "method": "GET",
    "queryString": null,
    "startedDateTime": "2022-06-24T18:52:07.853663255Z",
    "url": "http://localhost:8080/echo"
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that we have a working application, let’s secure it!</p>
 
 
<p>Before moving on to the next section, stop the app with Ctrl+C, don’t worry; we will start it back up in a minute.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Set up Okta 
 
 
<p>To secure our application with OAuth 2.0, we are going to need an OAuth Identity Provider (IdP). Just about any OpenID Connect (OIDC) capable server should work, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> or <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a>, but this is an Okta blog, so let’s use Okta.</p>
 
 
<p>If you don’t already have one, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>
and from the project directory, run <code>okta start</code> to sign up for a new account and configure this application!</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, run <code>okta login</code> first.



 

What does the Okta CLI do?
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the required redirect URIs and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: .env</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>cat .env</code> (or <code>type .env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ISSUER=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
CLIENT_ID=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
CLIENT_SECRET=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS</code> 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Set up OAuth2 Proxy 
 
 
<p>There are two ways to use OAuth2 Proxy: route your traffic through it directly or use it with the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive. I’d recommend routing traffic through Nginx if possible, but I’ll walk through both options and explain my recommendation below.</p>
 
 
<p>To reduce the number of moving parts, I’ll leave Nginx out in this first example; all of our web traffic will flow through OAuth2 Proxy. Users who access the echo web application will be redirected to Okta to sign in. Once they have signed in, OAuth2 Proxy will set a session cookie. OAuth2 Proxy will validate the session before passing the request to the echo web app in future requests.</p>
 
 






In OAuth terms, OAuth2 Proxy is acting as the "client", handling the OAuth protocol details, (in this case, an <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/">Authorization Code Grant</a>).<br>
TL;DR - Redirects the user to the OAuth IdP’s sign-in page and handles a "callback" route to return them to the application.



 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This example is going to outgrow manually using <code>docker run</code> commands; switch to using <code>docker compose</code> to start the echo web-app and oauth2-proxy.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s start simple and increase the complexity as we go along. Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with oauth2-proxy and the web app from above:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"
services:

  web-app: (1)
    build: .

  oauth2-proxy:
    image: bitnami/oauth2-proxy:7.3.0
    command:
      - --http-address
      - 0.0.0.0:4180 (2)
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/ (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAME: Okta
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: ${CLIENT_ID}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PASS_ACCESS_TOKEN: true (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*' (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: http://localhost:4180/oauth2/callback (7)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET} (8)

    ports:
      - 4180:4180 (9)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Build and run Dockerfile in the current directory.


2
Listen on port <code>4180</code>.


3
Proxy authenticated requests to the Java web-app container.


4
OIDC client information (issuer, client ID, and client secret), these values are defined in the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Optionally, pass the access to the web-app.


6
Allow all email domains unless you use a social auth provider, you’ll want to manage this in your IdP and NOT in your application.


7
Set the redirect URL to an <code>http</code> URL, this defaults to <code>https</code>.


8
Open up the <code>.env</code> file and set this variable to a random 32-byte base64 string <code>openssl rand -base64 32 | tr — '+/' '-_'</code>.


9
Expose port <code>4180</code>.


 
 
 
 
<p>Start everything up by running:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code>, and you will be redirected to a page with a sign-in button. Click the button, and you will be redirected back to the "echo" application, and you should see information about the newly authenticated request!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






If you are already logged into your Okta account, open an incognito/private browser to see the full sign-in flow.



 
 
<p>Great, the application is now secured, but we still have a few things to clean up:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>All the session state is stored in a cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>The initial double redirect sign-in page has to go.</p>
 
 
<p>We haven’t talked about API access yet.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These first two problems can be fixed with a few updates to the OAuth2 Proxy configuration. Edit the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>       OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET}
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_PROVIDER_BUTTON: true (1)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_NAME: SESSION (2)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SAMESITE: lax (3)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SESSION_STORE_TYPE: redis (4)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL: redis://redis
    ports:
      - 4180:4180
+    depends_on:
+      - redis
+
+  redis:(5)
+    image: redis:7.0.2-alpine3.16
+    volumes:
+      - cache:/data (6)
+
+volumes:
+  cache:
+    driver: local</code> 
 
 
 


1
Skip the default login page and redirect directly to the IdP.


2
By default, the cookie name is <code>_oauth2_proxy</code>; change it to <code>SESSION</code>.


3
Set the cookie’s same site policy to <code>lax</code>; the redirect from the OAuth IdP will need the session cookie.


4
Use Redis to store session information.


5
Start up a Redis container.


6
Persist the Redis data between restarts.


 
 
 
 
<p>Stop the docker-compose process (Ctrl+C) and start it up again:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once again, open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code> and open up your network tab, you will see the renamed and now smaller <code>SESSION</code> cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>You could stop here, but you shouldn’t. We still have a few issues: API clients are not supported, and we haven’t talked about logging out.</p>
 
 






For the next section, you will need an access token. You can use the access token from your last request’s <code>x-access-token</code> header. Open your terminal and set an environment variable: <code>export TOKEN={your-token-value}</code>.



 
 
 
 
 REST API clients 
 
 
<p>For the sake of this post, I will consider any client that sets an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header to be an API client. For example: <code>Authorization: Bearer {access_token_here}</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The API client probably cannot handle a redirect response but expects a <code>40x</code> status code to be returned.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Let’s take a step back and configure OAuth2 Proxy as an <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/">OAuth resource server</a>, which accepts JWT access tokens. This might be all you need for some applications, but if you need to support both browser and API clients, keep reading, we will get there in the following section.</p>
 
 






It is common, but it’s not required for <a href="https://oauth.net/2/access-tokens/">OAuth 2.0 access tokens</a> to be a JWT. If you are using a different OAuth IdP, double-check if they support JWTs before continuing.



 
 
<p>In the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, trim down the environment variables to the bare minimum needed for a REST API:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (1)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*'
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_JWT_BEARER_TOKENS: true (2)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM: sub (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER} (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: api://default (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SET_XAUTHREQUEST: true
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: this_value_is_required_but_not_used (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: NOT_USED_BUT_REQUIRED_VALUE_32b_ (7)
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
We are not actually using any of the OIDC flows, but this is still required.


2
Perhaps a poorly named variable, this tells <code>oauth2-proxy</code> to validate the JWT access token and to "skip" looking for an OAuth 2.0 session.


3
Read the user’s email from the <code>sub</code> claim in the access token.


4
The same issuer URL is used, the JWKS endpoint will be looked up automatically via the OIDC discovery metadata.


5
The "client-id" is actually the audience <code>aud</code> claim and not the ID of a specific client (multiple API "clients" could be accessing the same REST API).


6
There is no "client-secret," but it’s a required field…​


7
Same with the cookie secret, these flows do not use cookies, but the field is required.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services. (Stop and then run <code>docker compose up</code> again.)</p>
 
 
<p>Using the access token environment variable you set in the previous section, run this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :4180/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Awesome! Now your application is secured for REST clients!</p>
 
 
<p>Not so fast; now our browser clients don’t work correctly! The client ID and secret are not correct, which means users will not be able to log in. We can fix both of these problems with Nginx.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add Nginx to route traffic 
 
 
<p>Adding another reverse proxy into the mix might seem excessive; for a request to get to the application, it would need to pass through both Nginx and OAuth2 Proxy first. However, you may already use Nginx for load balancing, TLS termination, or other ingress concerns.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>While we could route our traffic through both proxies as pictured above, I will use the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive instead. Nginx will make a REST request to OAuth2 Proxy’s <code>/oauth2/auth</code> endpoint using the original request headers (including any cookies and <code>Authorization</code> headers). OAuth2 Proxy will respond with a <code>202</code> status code if the request is valid or a <code>401</code> otherwise.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This setup uses the same number of requests as the previous diagram but provides additional flexibility on how requests are routed to the upstream web app.</p>
 
 
 Configure Nginx 
 
<p>Jump back into the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and add a new <code>service</code> for Nginx:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.21.6-alpine
    depends_on:
      - oauth2-proxy
      - web-app
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    ports:
      - 80:80</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, create a <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code> file.  This code block is a little involved, be sure to read the annotations:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location = /oauth2/auth {
        internal; (1)
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme         $scheme;
        # nginx auth_request includes headers but not body
        proxy_set_header Content-Length   "";
        proxy_pass_request_body           off;
    }

    location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth; (2)

        auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email; (3)
        proxy_set_header X-Email $email;
        auth_request_set $user  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
        proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
        auth_request_set $token  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_access_token;
        proxy_set_header X-Access-Token $token;
        auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
        add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;

        proxy_http_version 1.1; (4)
        proxy_pass http://web-app:8080/; (5)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Don’t expose this route to external clients.


2
Nginx makes a request to <code>oauth2-proxy</code> REST API, to verify the auth for this request.


3
Add headers returned from the auth request.


4
HTTP 1.0 is the default if not set.


5
Send authenticated requests to the web app.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the docker containers and verify everything is working with HTTPie (make sure you are using port <code>80</code> now).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you remove or change the <code>Authorization</code> header, a <code>401</code> will be returned. Browser requests will now also return a <code>401</code>!</p>
 
 
<p>Almost done! We still need to make everything work for both API clients and browsers, and handle sign-out requests.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Route  all traffic through Nginx 
 
 
<p>Sending all the traffic through Nginx has the added benefit of giving you control of how the OAuth2 Proxy endpoints are exposed. For example, the previous section marked the <code>/oauth2/auth</code> route as "internal," so only the <code>auth_requst</code> directive can use it.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code>, add a couple of new <code>location</code> sections to expose the other <code>/oauth2</code> endpoints. The first <code>location</code> will handle the OAuth 2.0-related requests like the redirect callback. The second will configure the sign-out endpoint to accept only POST requests. (This prevents a rogue GET request from ending the user’s session.)</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>    location /oauth2/ {
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180; (1)
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }

    location = /oauth2/sign_out { (2)
        # Sign-out mutates the session, only allow POST requests
        if ($request_method != POST) {
            return 405;
        }

        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
Send the OAuth callback and logout requests to oauth2-proxy.


2
Only allow POST requests to the sign-out endpoint.


 
 
 
 






The sign-out endpoint does not use a CSRF token. TODO: link to Alisa’s post on this topic.



 
 
<p>One last change, update the <code>location /</code> section to redirect to the sign-in page for all non-API clients:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth;

        # if the authorization header was set (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer {token}`)
        # assume API client and do NOT redirect to login page
        if ($http_authorization = "") {
            error_page 401 = /oauth2/start;
        }
...</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Configure OAuth2 Proxy to support API and browser clients 
 
 
<p>Sometimes, an application needs to handle requests from browsers and other API clients.  In this case, the application acts both as an OAuth client and resource server. OAuth2 Proxy can be configured to support both types of applications. However, you may have noticed that a few OAuth2 Proxy configuration values are overloaded; for example, the "client ID" is used both as the ID of the OAuth client, and the JWT value for the audience. Luckily, there is a workaround! Here is the final annotated <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"

services:

  web-app:
    build: .

  oauth2-proxy:
    image: bitnami/oauth2-proxy:7.3.0

      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_PROVIDER_BUTTON: true (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: http://localhost/oauth2/callback (4)

      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER} (5)

1
Allow all email addresses; the IdP will manage which users have access.


2
For single IdP use cases, skip the intermediate login page.


3
oauth2-proxy defaults to <code>https</code>, this example uses <code>http</code> on localhost.


4
The issuer, client ID, and secret will be loaded from the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Allow processing of JWT bearer tokens for API clients.


6
Configure an extra "allowed" audience, in addition to the "client ID".


7
Use the <code>sub</code> claim from JWT access tokens as the email address.


8
Add user information headers to the proxied web-app request.


9
Optional, pass the access token to the proxied web-app request.


10
Use Redis for session management.


11
Refresh cookies every 30 minutes.


12
Set the session cookie name to <code>SESSION</code>.


13
Configure the encryption key (loaded from the <code>.env</code> file).


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services and access the application through your browser: <code>http://localhost/echo</code>. Try again using HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Both requests should show similar information.</p>
 
 
<p>Without any code changes, the "echo" web application is now secured with OIDC / OAuth 2.0!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Is OAuth2 Proxy right for your application? 
 
 
<p>This post taught you how to secure an existing application with OAuth 2.0 without any code changes! OAuth2 Proxy isn’t just for legacy applications; it’s also commonly used in a sidecar pattern with Kubernetes, allowing you to keep authorization concerns separate from your application.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s not perfect, though; there are a few shortcomings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>SSO logout (<a>OIDC RP-Initated Logout</a>) isn’t supported yet.</p>
 
 
<p>Requires working around a logout route that accepts <code>GET</code> requests and doesn’t require a CSRF token.</p>
 
 
<p>API use cases support JWT-only access tokens; if your application needs to <a>remotely validate tokens</a> you would need another solution. It may be easier to configure <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html">Nginx’s JWT module</a> instead.</p>
 
 
<p>Configuration is a little clunky; some values are required but not used.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Where does it shine?</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to add authentication to an application that doesn’t have OAuth support, or you need to support various types of applications in a standard way, OAuth2 Proxy can be a great choice! As a bonus, it has excellent <a href="https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>Dock is a pioneer in the decentralized identity space. Since 2017, our expert team has been building cutting-edge Verifiable Credentials and technology. We created this comprehensive guide on Verifiable Credentials to explain what they are, how they work, and why it's important for organizations and individuals.</p><p>TL;DR</p>  There is an increasingly global problem around the world of physical and digital credentials like driver's licenses and university degrees being forged. It is a slow, time-consuming, andse expensive &nbsp;process for organizations to verify the authenticity of credentials.  Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.  In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, there is an issuer, holder, and verifier.  The key benefits of Verifiable Credentials for:  <p>1) Organizations: Issuing organizations can conveniently provide fraud-proof credentials and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity of credentials.</p><p>2) Individuals: Enables full ownership and control of their data while preserving privacy as well as providing improved security.</p>  There are a growing number of use cases where Verifiable Credentials can be used in a variety of sectors including supply chain, education, and finance.  <p>Introduction</p><p>Organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, certifications, and passports to identify people and verify claims about them like being old enough to go to a nightclub or graduating with a degree. But of course, physical credentials have their drawbacks.</p><p>Did you know that:</p>  Over <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">half of all people claiming a new PhD</a> in the United States have a fake degree?  More than 1,200 vendors operating in the UK and worldwide offer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/16/fake-covid-vaccine-and-test-certificate-market-is-growing-researchers-say">fake COVID vaccine</a> and test certificates for as little as £25?  75% of university admissions staff <a href="https://ecctisblog.com/2020/02/26/survey-universities-and-education-fraud-75-cannot-spot-a-fake-certificate/">could not spot a fake certificate</a>?  <p>With the increasing digitization of information, people are required to interact with thousands of businesses online. How would organizations know if a digital document is real? If organizations can’t tell if digital assets are real or fake, they are exposed to liabilities such as hiring someone who is not really qualified to do a job. Many people simply use Photoshop or change a PDF themselves to make fake certificates or licenses.</p><p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a> can help individuals and organizations create and share their identities and claims reliably.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What Is a Verifiable Credential? CEO Nick Lambert explains the basics and importance of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. Imagine digital and instantly verifiable versions of identity documents, academic achievements, licenses, and more.</p><p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials. The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 is a “specification [that] provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.”</p><p>W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. Verifiable Credentials are one of the three pillars of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI), which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The other two pillars are blockchain and decentralized identifiers.</p>Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity.<p>The main parties involved in the use of Verifiable Credentials are the:</p>  Issuer: Organization that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials such as a government department issuing a national ID or a college issuing a diploma  Holder: Someone who owns the credential and stores it in their digital wallet  Verifier: The person or organization validating or authenticating the credential like a hiring company needing to check a candidate’s educational credentials  The main parties in a Verifiable Credentials system are the holder, verifier, and issuer. Benefits of Verifiable Credentials   Instantly verifiable anywhere at any time within seconds compared to days, weeks, or months with traditional verification processes  Tamper-proof with cryptography, which enables people to store, protect, and share data securely  No need to contact the issuer (e.g. a university or certifying body) to confirm the authenticity  Creates immediate trust between parties  ID holder have full control and ownership of their data, enabled by decentralized identifiers (globally unique identifiers) and Public key cryptography.  Provides user privacy because they can choose which parts of their identity they want to reveal such as showing their age without showing their full name. Or proving they are above a certain age without disclosing their date of birth.  No personal data is stored on the blockchain  Portable as holders can store Verifiable Credentials in their digital wallet and take them anywhere while still being verifiable.  <p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, and more as verifiable digital credentials that can be stored in a digital wallet, which is a digital version of a physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Gartner, a technological research and consulting firm, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-key-predictions-for-identity-and-access-management-and-fraud-detection">shared five trends</a> for identity and access management and fraud detection. One of the trends is that the decentralized identity standard will shift to being increasingly mobile and global. The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with self-sovereign identity because it refers to the idea of individuals owning and managing their own identities.</p> Verifiable Credentials Example A government can issue a passport as a Verifiable Credential for the holder to securely store in their digital identity wallet.<p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs. Decentralized identifiers are similar to email addresses and phone numbers in that they are unique. The public key associated with the DID of the organization that issued the credential is stored on the blockchain. So when someone wants to verify the authenticity of the credential, they can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. </p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>We will go into more detail later on about how DIDs work, but here is an example that ties all of these details together. </p><p>Let's say a government department uses Verifiable Credentials to issue passports. Whenever they issue a new passport, they will sign it with a private key while their public key and DID are on the blockchain. In this case, the data outline (schema) on the verified credential would include the name, country, date of birth, and so on.</p><p>You will be able to store your passport within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want a verifier to see. Then when a verifier like a company, for example, wants to check the Verifiable Credential, they can check to see if the government department really did sign it without contacting the issuer because the government's public key and DID are on the blockchain. </p>A passport issued as a Verifiable Credential can be stored on a digital identity wallet like the Dock Wallet.<p>Another benefit of a Verifiable Credential is privacy. If an on-demand driving company asks for your license if you're applying to become a driver, you can use your phone to simply show them a verifiable presentation of the credential that proves that you have the authority to drive. With a verifiable credential, you can selectively disclose only the information required by the verifier. If a platform uses Zero-Knowledge Proof technology, you could even prove you have a valid license without showing any information from the license itself.</p><p>With Verifiable Credentials, the DMV also has the authority and ability to define an automated expiration date. They can also revoke the license if a driver breaks the law and is penalized by having their credential removed for a certain period of time. </p> Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials? What’s Wrong With Our Current Verification Systems? Nick covers the difference between centralized, federated, and decentralized ID management.<p>The main reason why Verifiable Credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses around the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user privacy requirements and addresses several major issues associated with the current identity management system.</p> Problems With Our Current Traditional Verification Systems   Proving the authenticity of documents involves a slow and difficult verification process, which often takes organizations weeks or even months  Increased risk of breaches of data resulting from centralized data management systems storing a large amount of user information  Paper and digital credentials are easy to forge  Organizations store vast amounts of personal data from users which leaves users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used  With a physical credential or PDF, people may be disclosing a lot more information than is necessary when they present it for verification  <p>Verifiable Credentials enable people to verify their identity, only provide information that is relevant to the context, and prove their documents weren’t modified.</p><p>With a digital credential that could be in a PDF or XML document, for example, verifying the origin and authenticity of documents is complex. You’d have to confirm that:</p>  The Issuer Organization effectively issued that credential and has the authority to do so like an organization that provides driver’s licenses  The person submitting the credential (holder) is its rightful owner  The credential is valid and not expired, modified, or revoked  <p>​​In many cases, this involves manually contacting the issuing organization, which is a long, tedious, and often expensive process.</p><p>Here are just a few of many examples of how fraudulent IDs and credentials pose a risk to organizations:</p><p>Construction</p><p>New construction employees need to present credentials to an employer, especially if they will operate heavy machinery. If an employee presents fake credentials to a company, this is dangerous because this could result in a serious accident and the company could be liable for hiring someone without the right qualifications to operate the machinery and do the work safely.</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>The verification processes for providers in the healthcare industry have many inefficiencies with manual verification and gatekeepers. Traditional verification can take weeks to months which causes major delays in filling in much-needed healthcare roles and delays for people to begin working.</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>There can be severe safety issues and monetary damages that could happen from an improperly managed supply chain such as a manufacturer failing to ensure the safety of working conditions at their facilities, potentially resulting in severe injuries suffered by workers. Forged documents are also used to show the origin of goods, which can be dangerous for consumers if the products don’t meet safety standards.</p> How Does a Verifiable Credential Work? Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how a Verifiable Credential works.<p>The issuer (e.g. nursing program) creates the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. When the verifier (e.g. hospital) receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity instantly through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store people’s Verifiable Credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential.</p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired)  If the credential has been tampered with  <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p> The 3 Components of Verifiable Credentials   Credential metadata: This might be cryptographically signed by the issuer and contains the credential identifier as well as properties about the credential itself such as the expiry date and who the issuer is.   Claim(s): A tamper-proof set of claims made about the credential subject such as someone’s employee number and job title.   Proof(s): Cryptographic method that allows people to verify:     The source of the data (e.g. who the issuer is)  That the data has not been tampered with   What Is the Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) In Making Verifiable Credentials Work? Learn the basics and benefits of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>We often use physical cards to provide proof of our identity and claims about us to show to other people or organizations. But in the digital world, there were no universally accepted standards for expressing, exchanging, and verifying digital credentials.</p><p>We currently use emails and phone numbers as identifiers to access websites, services, and apps. But our access to these identifiers can be removed anytime by service providers, the data is controlled by providers, and user data is vulnerable to hacks. Decentralized identifiers change all of this. &nbsp;</p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is an example of a Dock DID: </p><p>A party can be an individual or organization and they can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. For example, you can have a DID for:</p>  Professional reasons like showing your credentials to an employer or university  Authenticate data for your personal interests like showing you are legal age to go to a bar or a member of an organization  Online gaming profiles  People can create as many Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as they want and manage them in a digital identity wallet. What Are Public and Private Keys? Every Decentralized Identifier (DID) comes with a public and private key.<p>Each DID comes with a private and public key. Keys come in private/public pairs and a DID can have multiple pairs. &nbsp;</p><p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data.  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it should never be shared with anyone else.  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents.   <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>To explain how public and private keys work, let’s use the example of comparing a private key to a master key of a car. The car’s owner (holder) has the master key that gives her full access to all parts of the car, including the trunk and glove compartment. She can provide restricted access to other people she chooses. The owner should never give her master key to anyone else.</p><p>Now the owner wants to make another key that gives restricted access to a valet or auto body shop to start the car. This key is like the public key. The valet and car shop worker wouldn’t be able to access the glove compartment and the trunk. </p><p>To use another example, an employer would use their private key to sign and issue a verifiable credential to confirm an employee's job title. The employer’s public key would be shared on the blockchain so that the verifier, such as a government department that needs to authenticate someone’s work status, can confirm the authenticity of the data with that public key. Basically, the government body can check the DID on the blockchain to see who issued the credential without having to contact the issuing party.</p> Key Differences Between Centralized Identifiers and Decentralized Identifiers Dock's WebID allows people to securely sign in without a password and without revealing any more information than needed to access a website or app.<p>Centralized Identifiers</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers</p><p>Identifiers provided by centralized&nbsp; providers like Google or phone companies allow access to apps and services (email addresses and passwords)</p><p>Identifiers you generate for yourself powered by blockchain to use apps and services</p><p>Your personal data is collected on centralized servers and it's not clear who has access to it</p><p>Data is not shared with anyone except whoever you choose to reveal it to and there is no personal data stored on the blockchain</p><p>Data can be manipulated by providers</p><p>Records on the blockchain are immutable and tamper-proof once it’s recorded on the blockchain</p><p>Data is owned by third parties and you can’t control your data</p><p>You have full ownership of your DIDs and complete control of your cryptographic keys</p><p>People’s identifiers are used to track online behavior</p><br><p>Create as many DIDs as you want for different relationships to keep your data private as having multiple DIDs makes it harder to track users and correlate data&nbsp;</p><p>Providers can remove access to your data anytime</p><p>Your data can’t be taken away from you and your credentials can be verified anywhere, anytime</p><p>Less secure and private connections between parties</p><p>Enables unique, private, and secure peer-to-peer connections between two parties</p><p>Here is a scenario that goes through all of the steps of how DIDs and Verifiable Credentials can work:</p>  Issuer: Successo Institute  Holder: Anita Ramos  Verifier: Bubble Pearl restaurant    Anita creates a DID using the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Certs platform</a> for educational purposes only to interact with the university and its partners. The DID will be on the Dock blockchain.  <p>2. Anita shares her DID with the university which allows the school to connect to her wallet and issue Anita a proof of enrolment status as a verifiable credential. </p><p>3. The university signs and issues the Verifiable Credential with their private key on Certs and emails Anita a PDF and JSON version of her credential.</p><p>4. Anita imports this credential on her Dock wallet phone app, allowing her to bring her Verifiable Credentials anywhere.</p><p>5. Partnering businesses on and off-campus give 20% discounts on products and services to university students and they trust Successo Institute as an issuer.</p><p>6. Anita goes to Bubble Pearl restaurant and they request data to confirm that she is a student of Successo Institute. They scan a QR code and she is prompted to give permission to show her credentials.</p><p>7. The cashier scans her QR code that is tied to her credentials and applies the 20% discount to her purchase.</p><p>In another example, if someone wants to buy alcohol, a cashier can scan the QR code on a customer’s verified credential to confirm that they are of legal age. In this process, the customer can use a Zero-Knowledge Proof to prove they are above a certain age, without sharing any other information like their entire birth date or name.</p> The Role of Blockchain in Verifiable Credentials <p>The DID's corresponding public key of the organization that issued a credential to a holder is stored on the blockchain, which is an immutable database. The person who wants to verify the validity or authenticity of the credential can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. &nbsp;<br></p>Learn the basics of blockchain.<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is a distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that can execute certain functions like sending and receiving information. Each block on the chain has unique data that references the previous block and the blocks combine to complete a chain. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p><p>1. Decentralized: Blockchains operate using a peer-to-peer network of computers to verify and record transactions. Whenever there is a new transaction on a blockchain, the block can’t be added to the chain until it is verified by the network. For someone to tamper with the blockchain, they would have to tamper with all of the blocks of the chain and hack every node, which is extremely difficult to do. </p><p>2. A blockchain acts as a decentralized distributed ledger: A distributed ledger is a digital database that runs on a distributed network in diverse locations rather than having one record of data in a centralized location that a person or body can control or manipulate. Each node gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that everything is in order and make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.</p><p>If everything looks good, each node adds this to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p><p>3. Immutable: Each block on a chain contains transaction data and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. Unlike traditional forms of record-keeping that are easy to change and manipulate information without anyone knowing.</p> Verifiable Credentials Using Blockchain Not all data goes on the blockchain to protect user privacy and maintain security. Mike covers which data goes on the blockchain.<p>In identity management, a blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. Blockchain can enable zero-knowledge proofs, meaning that someone can verify credentials without a holder revealing the actual data like their full name and address. </p><p>For example, let’s say Shelly wants to sign up to play a mobile game from her phone. The gaming company requires players to be at least 18 years old and uses Verifiable Credentials to confirm their age.</p>  Shelly creates a DID with the Dock blockchain and stores it in her Dock wallet on her phone  The department of motor vehicles (DMV) in the US issues Shelly a driver’s license as a verifiable credential that contains her date of birth  The gaming company trusts the DMV as an issuer  Shelly signs into the gaming site with her DID and the company uses the Verifiable Credential associated with her DID to verify that she is at least 18 years old without her revealing her date of birth  Shelly can securely sign in to play with her DID without ever using a user name and password  <p>In the above example, Shelly has full ownership and control of how her data is shared and used. And her information can’t be tracked or stored.</p> How to Show the Proof of Existence of Verifiable Credential Data and Files With Dock’s Blockchain <p>With Dock, issuers have the option of proving the existence of Verifiable Credentials or files to a verifier by connecting the data to a blockchain with the use of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-anchoring-feature-is-now-live/">anchoring</a>. </p><p>What is anchoring in blockchain? </p><p>An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is included in a blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic. The anchor makes up the credential’s proof of existence in their original form. </p><p>Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain. </p><p>Hashes: </p>  Prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Let’s say there is an online course that wants to issue credentials to students who have completed the program. The issuer can use Dock’s anchoring feature to hash the credentials that they have issued. Anchors are created when the hashes are posted to Dock’s blockchain and the record can’t be changed. </p><p>Anchoring can be applied to any documents and verifiable credential data for a variety of situations.</p> What Is and Isn’t Stored on the Blockchain  <p>By default, nothing gets stored on the blockchain except for an issuer's and holder's public keys associated with their DID. DIDs will only be stored on the blockchain depending on the client's preference and technology implementation. The Verifiable Credentials that contain personal details are securely stored on a decentralized digital wallet app rather than the blockchain. They don’t need to be stored on the blockchain in order to be verified as long as the keys are available.</p><p>What is stored on the blockchain</p><p>What is not stored on the blockchain</p><p>An issuer and holder’s public keys associated with their DID</p><p>A holder’s personal data like name, date of birth, address, and credit card details</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials like a passport, citizenship status, employee title, and university degree.</p><br><p>Cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters) can be tied to the verifiable credential and stored on the blockchain to confirm proof of existence without revealing personal data. The hashes make the data unidentifiable to a human.&nbsp;</p> Verifiable Credentials Use Cases <p>Industry</p><p>Traditional Process</p><p>Problems/Risks</p><p>Verifiable Credentials Solution</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>Relies on physical IDs and documents to demonstrate compliance, which creates inefficiencies.</p><br><br><p>Documents can be easily forged and difficult to authenticate.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Manual verification process is slow and prone to errors.&nbsp;</p><br><p>An importer can bring unapproved, non-compliant medical supplies into a market putting public health at risk.</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials can’t be forged and they can be verified within seconds without contacting the issuing party, saving a tremendous amount of time and money.</p><p>Finance&nbsp;</p><p>To access financial services, someone has to go through compliance screening by submitting personal details in physical form that is stored in a large database and shared with one or more third parties that conduct know your customer (KYC) and credit checks.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals have no control over how their data is secured, shared, and accessed by third parties.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The data provided in the credentials is cryptographically secured, tamper-proof, and can be verified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Employers use manual processes to verify paper-based licenses and certificates for healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Traditional verification takes weeks if not months, which creates delays in filling much-needed health care roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations that provide and regulate medical licenses for the healthcare workforce can issue licenses in the form of digital credentials. The recipients of these licenses can then easily share them for instant verification by any hospital, clinic, or medical department where they would like to work.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be applied to an infinite amount of use cases across many industries. Here are just a few of many examples of ways that Verifiable Credentials solve a variety of problems.</p> Dock’s Clients Using Verifiable Credentials <p>Dock is working with organizations to provide technological solutions to issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers. </p><p><a href="https://gravitytraining.co.za/">Gravity Training</a> connected with us so they could issue Verifiable Credentials in a convenient and cost-effective way to people who complete their training program in field positions. Authentic credentials are essential to keep workers and employers safe. Their courses include rigging, fall arrest, and radio frequency awareness training. </p><p>Fake credentials are a <a href="https://www.sapeople.com/2019/02/14/fake-qualifications-are-on-the-rise-how-universities-can-manage-the-risk/">growing problem in South Africa</a>. Many people are photoshopping credentials and showing them to employers. Gravity issues thousands of certificates a year for trainees and is manually uploading certifications on their database, which takes a lot of time and resources. They want to use Verifiable Credentials to be compliant, to manage verifications across various locations, and to enhance their record-keeping for auditability. </p><p>With Dock’s technology, Gravity is able to:</p>  Save a tremendous amount of time and money issuing and managing &nbsp;credentials with expiry dates in bulk with Dock’s user-friendly platform that doesn’t require any code  Allow inspectors and managers to instantly verify documents and monitor expiration dates digitally  Provide workers with credentials they can store on a wallet with their phones  Nick speaks with Grant Thomas, the CEO of Credenxia to discuss how this global verification company is using Dock Certs to move to a decentralized solution of creating and managing employee credentials.<p>Dock has also been <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-using-docks-technology/">collaborating with Credenxia</a> since 2021 to help them move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> is a leading global verification company that partners with businesses in a wide range of industries including construction, health care, and transport. Their technology helps with compliance for employers and workers as well as enables businesses to effectively manage the credentials of their workforce.</p><p>The company chose to work with Dock because of our expertise in blockchain, we are compliant with W3C standards, and the APIs were well-documented. Credenxia was previously running on a trust model to do manual verification. They were getting feedback from their stakeholders asking how people would know if Credenxia was compliant themselves during their verification process. There is no overarching body that checks the work and processes of document verification companies.</p><p>The collaboration with Dock allows Credenxia to: </p>  Provide Verifiable Credentials with blockchain technology.  Enhance transparency with clients by adding verifiable notes that are hashed on the blockchain, making them immutable. If the notes have been tampered with, clients would be able to see it.  Enhance the audit position of the user base and give back control to someone’s credentials and identity.  Move towards a zero-trust model that clients are demanding.  Retrospectively decentralize already verified credentials.   Decentralized Digital ID Wallet App <p>A decentralized digital identity wallet is an identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials. A digital credential can be an ID, license, background check, certification, and more. It’s the equivalent of a physical wallet that holds various IDs and cards to demonstrate claims about yourself like licenses, bank cards, and service cards. </p><p>To illustrate how a decentralized digital ID wallet can work, let’s say Carlos wants to create a new profile on an online sports shop that uses Verifiable Credentials. He can sign in and make purchases from his digital wallet without creating a user name, password, and entering credit card information. The website needs to confirm that shoppers live in Spain as they only deliver within the country and their payment method. The website verifies his credentials that were issued by a credit card company and driver’s licensing organization, which are issuers that the website trusts to authenticate the credentials. &nbsp; </p> Dock’s Decentralized ID Wallet  <p>The Dock Wallet enables you to have full control over your digital credentials and every piece of data stored in the wallet has the ability to be shared with third parties only when you choose to do so and how much information you want to provide. You can grant and remove access to whomever at any time. </p><p>With the Dock Wallet you can import existing certificates, batches, and credentials to store all of your records and achievements in one place as long as they were issued as W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials.</p> Summary of Key Terms<br> <p></p><p>Anchoring</p>  An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is recorded on the blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic  Proves the existence of verifiable credential data or files while the content is kept private  Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain  <p>Blockchain</p>  A blockchain is a decentralized database that is shared among nodes which are computers in the blockchain network  A system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system  <p>Decentralized Digital ID Wallet</p>  An identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials  <p>Decentralized Identifier (DID)</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Cryptographic hash</p>  A long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human  Used in anchoring to prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it must never be shared with anyone else  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents  <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>Verifiable Credential</p>  A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification  When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials   Conclusion <p>In an increasingly digital world, the problem with physical IDs and credentials is that they can be easily forged and take a lot of time to verify for authenticity. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials are:</p>  Are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to organizations  Tamper-proof  Supports data protection  Instantly verifiable  Secure and allow the ID holder to have full control and ownership of their data  <p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, there is an issuer, holder, and verifier. The issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers, or DIDs, which are globally unique identifiers that allow the owner to prove cryptographic control over them. DIDs allow for private and secure connections between two parties. </p><p>There are a growing number of use cases for Verifiable Credentials in diverse industries around the world. This has many benefits including speeding up the hiring process, reducing fraud, providing privacy, and improving safety in the supply chain.<br><br></p>
