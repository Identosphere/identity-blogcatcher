<p>At Mydex, we’re frequently contacted by academics and think-tanks wanting to research ‘<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-the-economic-value-of-data-ef129e6485e1">the value of data</a>’. By which they mean they want to put a money price on it. It seems like a simple and obvious question. But behind it lies a paralysing mountain of misconceptions: those of mainstream economics.</p><p>Of course, ‘economics’ includes many schools of thought. Our focus here is the economic doctrines that have dominated policy-making for the last four decades. Its core narrative goes something like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>“Wealth is created by firms selling products in markets for money at a price that makes a&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><p>This blog shows how personal data blows the assumptions behind this narrative apart, taking us to places it cannot cope&nbsp;with.</p> Worlds apart <p>Table 1 sums the differences between two perspectives on the economics of data: ours and those of mainstream economics. They point in entirely different directions.</p>Table 1: The assumptions of mainstream economics means it cannot see the economic opportunities presented by citizen data empowerment. Value <p>What makes something valuable? Is it what it can be used for: e.g. the improvements it can bring to peoples’ lives? Or is it what it can be sold for: e.g the (money) price it will fetch? You might answer ‘both’, but one is more important than the other. Most things sell at a price because they are useful to someone (and many things, like oxygen in the air, are very useful and have no&nbsp;price).</p><p>By defining value in terms of the money price an item can fetch, economists focus attention on abstract symbols (money prices) that stop us asking why things are valuable in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Personal data is not valuable because somebody, somewhere can make money selling it. It is valuable because of what people can do with it: make better decisions and plan, organise and coordinate resulting actions better. Trading personal data for a price does nothing to address the central question which is ‘how to use it to improve peoples’&nbsp;lives?’</p><p>Product</p><p>For something to fetch a price on a market, exclusive ownership of it needs to change hands. Traditional products fit this model. But most personal data is not exclusively ‘owned’ by any one party. If you buy an item online, the seller has data about the transaction and so do you. This data is not ‘owned’ by just one party, so legally speaking, this ‘ownership’ cannot change&nbsp;hands.</p><p>What’s more, the more people treat personal data as an exclusively owned ‘product’ the more they reinforce the fatal flaw of the organisation-centric database. Because data does not get ‘used up’ when used — because the data can be used for many different purposes by many different people — it needs to be shared. But the organisation-centric database is all about NOT sharing the data; keeping it under exclusive, proprietary control&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Treating personal data as a product like any other lifeless commodity such as milk, potatoes, or steel, generates an additional set of problems. By definition, personal data relates to a person. It is highly personal and the person it relates to has feelings, sensitivities and rights. For this reason, the sharing and use of personal data cannot be separated from issues relating to human rights and relationships between people using the data. These human (not trading) issues have to be addressed.</p><p>The personal data stores we talk about in this blog series intimately connect human rights and dignity with positive economic outcomes. By focusing attention on data as a ‘product’ — as a commodity to be sold for money — mainstream economics sets up a conflict between these goals. With its framing of “either privacy and data protection or ‘innovation and growth”&nbsp;, one side has to give — and alternative approaches which combine the two get&nbsp;ignored.</p> Markets <p>Despite what economists say, markets are not the engine of wealth creation. It’s obvious really: markets can only sell things that have already been made. For a market for something to exist, first of all it has to be produced. Production is and always will be the engine of wealth creation. It is production, not markets, that makes societies prosperous.</p><p>Personal data is valuable because it is used to produce services and to improve the productivity of these services. This has got nothing to do with markets and a lot to do with mundane but essential processes of planning, organisation, coordination and execution, all of which have to be administered. In turn, such administration depends on data logistics — getting the right data to and from the right places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>The more economists focus their attention on markets, the more they ignore the actual ‘how’ of wealth creation. In particular, they divert attention away from building new capabilities to enable the safe, rights-respecting sharing of data, and from the importance of new citizen-empowering personal data logistics infrastructure.</p><p>Firms</p><p>Traditional economics is fixated on the profit-seeking, shareholder-value- maximising private sector firm. But such firms are just one of many potential users of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>As we’ve stressed, the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/people-the-dark-matter-of-the-economy-24c00495ca02">dark (unobserved, unexplored) matter</a> of data use lies with people — individuals, citizens gathering and using their own data to improve their lives. Many of the most important users (and generators) of personal data are in the public and third&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>By seeing only the private sector as an agent of change, mainstream economics ignores half the economy. By assuming that innovation only happens in the private sector, economists generate an agenda that diverts attention away from where innovation is urgently needed: how to include citizens in the workings of the data economy and how to improve the ways in which public and third sector services&nbsp;work.</p> Money <p>Mainstream economics assumes that money is the measure of all value. But in the data ecosystem we’ve described no money changes hands and no price is put on data that is shared. Instead, productivity improvements are generated and these productivity improvements are measured by different currencies such as time taken to complete a task, energy and effort used in completing it, and materials used.</p><p>The end result may well be a cost saving measured in money terms, but it also includes other qualitative benefits such as improved outcomes for citizens, increased access and inclusion, and improved policy implementation. Because no money has changed hands and because no prices are involved, these are things economists have little interest&nbsp;in.</p><p>The constant quest to find better ways to ‘monetise’ data boils down to large scale displacement activity: not doing the work that needs to be done to change the underlying reality — of how to use data to improve service delivery and productivity.</p> Profit <p>According to the mainstream narrative, the main purpose of firms is to make profits. A firm is successful if it is extremely profitable, and becomes ‘uneconomic’ if it is not profitable. But in the model we’ve outlined, no profits are directly registered&nbsp;… because no ‘margins’ are made&nbsp;… because nothing is being sold in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Profit is a very narcissistic measure. It focuses on what benefits I get for myself, not on the impact I have on the world around me, for better or worse. In fact, the real ‘results’ of organisations always lie on the outside. The real ‘results’ of a hospital are the patients it treats successfully and efficiently. The results of the school or university are graduates who can apply what they have learned in their own life and work. The result of a car producer is improved mobility of the people who use its cars. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>By focusing attention on a narcissistic measure of success, rather than real economic contribution, economists render the opportunity we talk about in these blog invisible.</p> Contracts <p>Price-focused market-based transactions depend on formal legal contracts that are negotiated, often between parties with conflicting interests. Buyers want to buy cheap and sellers want to sell dear. In the data sharing relationships we’re talking about, there is a mutual recognition of mutual benefit that unfolds and extends over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The attitudes, practices, infrastructure and institutions needed to build and maintain long term trusting relationships are completely different to those needed to win contract negotiations. The more economists focus attention on price negotiations for markets, the more they divert attention from doing what is needed to unleash the full potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Alfred Marshall set the agenda for modern economics a century ago when he defined ‘economic goods’&nbsp;as:</p><blockquote>“those things, external to a man, which (i) belong to him, and do not belong equally to his neighbours, and therefore are distinctly his; and which (ii) are directly capable of a money measure.”</blockquote><p>Personal data fits none of these criteria. In doing so, it bursts the assumptions behind the mainstream narrative of modern economics. It demands a different agenda.</p><p>In this blog series we’ve outlined what this different agenda looks like and why it’s important. Personal data stores help citizens <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/people-the-dark-matter-of-the-economy-24c00495ca02">manage their own lives better</a>, ease their access to services, cut the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">costs of providing these services</a>, improve peoples’ experience of using them, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">joining them to produce better outcomes</a>, helping both citizens and service providers <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">find and engage with each other</a> — while also opening up <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">new dimensions of innovation</a> and accelerating and enriching <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-has-data-got-to-do-with-net-zero-bb48048b04bc">the journey to net&nbsp;zero</a>.</p><p>Together, they add up to an economic transformation <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/google-and-facebook-steam-engines-of-the-information-age-b1b4c9ee22d9">as big as that wrought in the 20th century by electricity and mass production</a>.</p><p>But in this process no money changes hands, no prices are set, no markets are established, no profits can be reported. So most economists simply do not see the opportunity. They are too busy looking in the opposite direction.</p><p>This doesn’t make personal data stores economically irrelevant. Quite the opposite. It makes mainstream economic assumptions irrelevant.</p><p>Three different drivers of selective attention are hampering our society’s ability to unleash the full potential of personal data: a fixation on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">Big Data</a>, on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/artificial-intelligence-no-authentic-folly-on-a-grand-scale-e88dbda191b9">Artificial Intelligence</a> and on attempts to shoehorn data into the outdated economic narrative.</p><p>That’s the simple message of this series. It’s time to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">stop counting bounces and looked up to see the gorilla in our midst</a> — the opportunities made possible by empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-economists-cannot-get-their-heads-around-personal-data-661d2dedd589">Why economists cannot get their heads around personal data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity. </p><p>Last month, we released a product update covering the latest development efforts on SSX - you can check that out here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ssx-product-update-optimization-updates-new-features-and-more/">  SSX Product Update - Optimization Updates, New Features, and More  We launched SSX in November to provide developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum. We are continuously working on a positive developer experience, and additional features to enable builders to work with emerging decentralized identity paradigms.  SpruceAnukriti Kunwar    </a><p>Additionally, we've released the first of many developer tutorials to come, using SSX with RainbowKit and Alchemy to build your first token-gated dapp: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/tutorial-build-a-token-gated-app-with-sign-in-with-ethereum-and-ssx/">  Tutorial: Build a Basic Token-Gated App with SSX, RainbowKit, and Alchemy  This example will show developers how to build and enable token-gated access in their dapp with SSX based on holding an ENS name. Additionally, it will show a developer how to also use SSX with RainbowKit and Alchemy.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We've continued to work on ways developers can leverage user-controlled data, wider support for NextAuth and Auth.js, additional test coverage, and a big push for ETHDenver this year. Stay tuned for that upcoming release! </p> Sign-In with Ethereum Core Libraries <p><br>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We plan on moving EIP-4361 from <code>Review</code> to <code>Last Call</code> this month to fully advance the standard to <code>Final</code>.  We are currently updating our ReCap library for extended compatibility with other specifications. We plan on updating EIP-5573 to reflect these changes (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-recap/pull/14">siwe-recap #14</a>).  Our next community call for Sign-In with Ethereum is this Wednesday - make sure to tune in to hear from us and our friends at Unlock Protocol!   We're waiting for some additional external review of our changes to the <code>siwe</code> TypeScript library (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/138">#138</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/139">#139</a>).   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We've recently refactored Kepler to rely on <code>libp2p</code>, and <code>libipld</code> while removing the <code>rust-ipfs</code> dependency (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/132">kepler #132</a>).   We've added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134">kepler #134</a>).   We've updated the Kepler SDK to account for the changes in Kepler for the capability read function (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/53">kepler-sdk #53</a>).   SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> SSI   We've updated our <code>ssi</code> library to use the latest version of <code>json-ld</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/500">ssi #500)</a>.   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We optimized unification of non-recursive blank nodes. The unification phase now runs in <code>O(n)</code> time average instead of <code>O(n²)</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/101">treeldr #101</a>).   We've added type hierarchy support. TreeLDR now understands what a sub class is. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/105">treeldr #105</a>).  We re-introduced RDF loader. This will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. For now, only N-Quads (besides the TreeLDR DSL) is supported. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108">treeldr #108</a>).   We relaxed ordering constraints on layout intersection. Intersecting two structure layouts sharing the same fields but in a different order will not raise an error anymore (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/110">treeldr #110</a>).  We minimalized the <code>rdfs:domain</code> and <code>rdfs:range</code>relations. This simplifies a lot of internal reasoning about properties (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/112">treeldr #112</a>).   Standards and Community   We've contributed a holder-binding focused use-case to the W3C VC use cases (vc-use-cases <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-use-cases/pull/129">#129</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Spruce provides an ecosystem of open-source tools and products for developers that let users collect their data in one place they control, and show their cards however they want.</p><p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce"></a>

  <p>North Korean hackers have stolen $630 million in cryptocurrency assets in 2022, the highest on record, reports Reuters. Sophisticated techniques have been leveraged by North Korean threat actors to facilitate the record-high theft of virtual assets, which are being allocated toward its nuclear weapons programs, according to a United Nations report. Such a figure comes after a cybersecurity firm earlier reported that more than $1 billion in cryptocurrency have been stolen by North Koreans last year. "The variation in USD value of cryptocurrency in recent months is likely to have affected these estimates, but both show that 2022 was a record-breaking year for DPRK (North Korea) virtual asset theft," said the U.N. report.</p>

Well, as already<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/19/china-launches-smart-contract-functionality-on-cbdc-through-e-commerce-app-meituan/"> seen in China</a>, CBDCs can support smart contracts. Once CBDCs start gaining traction and the support of Central Banks worldwide, DApps will also support them along with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>At that point, we expect the FATF to extend the Travel Rule to CBDCs. Similarly, countries may enforce their own set of AML &amp; CFT-focused rules and regulations on CBDC transactions.</p><p>That’s where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> comes into the picture, as VASPs will continue using it for Travel Rule compliance, whether it is for crypto transactions or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with CBDC, it stands for Central Bank Digital Currencies. As a concept, CBDCs have become a hot topic globally in a short&nbsp;time.</p><p>As per Atlantic Council’s<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"> CBDC tracker data</a>, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC in May 2020, which has grown to 114 countries, covering 95% of the global GDP&nbsp;today.</p>(<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Image Source</a>)<p>Jamaica is the latest country to launch its CBDC, the JAM-DEX. In terms of absolute user numbers, China’s CBDC pilot is leading by a considerable margin, as it has already reached a population as high as 260&nbsp;million.</p> What is a Central Bank Digital Currency? <p>A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country’s fiat currency. China’s CBDC, for instance, is called Digital&nbsp;Yuan.</p><p>The United States CBDC goes by the name of Digital Dollar. It is also common to denote a country’s digital currency by adding the prefix “e” before a country’s fiat money. For instance, Uruguay’s CBDC is e-Peso, Sweden’s CBDC goes by the name of e-Krona,&nbsp;etc.</p> Understanding CBDCs — Is it a Type of Central Bank&nbsp;Money? <p>Worldwide, CBDCs are known for some of their common features. Everywhere, it is a sovereign currency that Central Banks issue, and it appears on the Central Bank’s balance sheet as a liability. The central bank issues Central Bank Digital Currencies in line with the country’s monetary and fiscal&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Since a country’s central bank releases its CBDC, it is a legal tender, a valid payment medium, and a store of value for all citizens, enterprises, and agencies using it. There is no bar against converting CBDCs with commercial banks’ money and cash. CBDCs are a fungible legal tender. One may not need to have a bank account to hold Central Bank Digital Currencies.</p><p>There are several reasons why a Central Bank will be keen to bring out a digital currency for the country. The estimates suggest it lowers the cost of the issuance of money flows and transactions and helps deal with many limitations of the paper currency. A digital currency also helps solve the challenges that come with cross-border payments.</p><p>CBDCs reduce the cost associated with physical currency management. It helps reduce cash dependency in an economy by encouraging competition, efficiency, and payment innovation.</p><p>Central Bank Digital Currencies have their advantages over other digital payment systems. Since it is a sovereign currency endorsed by the Central Bank of the country, it seamlessly ensures settlement finality, reducing settlement risks in the system by a large margin. It supports financial inclusion. And as already seen, not only may it not require a bank account to hold it, but it is also an affordable, accessible, convenient, efficient, safe, and secure&nbsp;system.</p> How Many Countries are Considering Central Bank Digital Currencies? <p>To date,<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"> eleven countries</a> have already launched their Central Bank Digital Currencies. These countries include Nigeria, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and the Eastern Caribbean (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines).</p><p>In seventeen countries, Central Bank Digital Currencies are in a pilot phase. These countries include Ghana, South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, etc.</p>(<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Image Source</a>)<p>There are 33 countries where CBDCs are in their development phase. Examples of such countries include the United Kingdom, Norway, Tunisia, Turkey, Bahrain, Bhutan, Mauritius, etc. And CBDC research is ongoing in 39 countries, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Morocco, Hungary, the Czech Republic, etc.</p><p>There are 15 countries in the world where CBDC projects are on pause. These countries include the likes of Iceland, Denmark, Egypt, Kuwait, Argentina, Uruguay,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>So far, two countries globally have canceled their CBDC projects, namely Ecuador and&nbsp;Senegal.</p> Types of&nbsp;CBDCs  Wholesale vs.&nbsp;Retail <p>There are two types of broadly accepted CBDCs: the general purpose or retail CBDCs, usually known as CBDC-R, and wholesale CBDCs, denoted as CBDC-W. There could be other CBDC classifications as&nbsp;well.</p><p>For instance, if we go by the models for issuance and management, CBDCs could be Direct, Indirect, or Hybrid. By form, CBDCs could be token-based or account-based. By instrument design, Central Bank Digital Currencies can be remunerated or non-remunerated. CBDCs can also vary as per their degree of anonymity.</p><p>While all these categories exist, one classification that matters the most, as it directly deals with use cases in real life, is the classification by issuance.</p><p>Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies are for use by all private sector and non-financial consumers and businesses. The Wholesale CBDC is meant for restricted access and use by select financial institutions.</p><p>Put simply, the Retail CBDCs are the electronic version of physical cash used in retail transactions. The Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currencies facilitate interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions.</p><p>Direct model Central Bank Digital Currencies are ones where Central Banks are responsible for managing all aspects of the CBDC system. In an Indirect Model CBDC, other intermediaries, such as banks and other service providers, play a role. The indirect model is where the banks manage everything, including distribution, account-keeping, KYC adherence, anti-money laundering checks, transaction verification, etc.</p> Token-based vs. account-based <p>A token-based CBDC is a bearer instrument, which implies that the holder of the token at a given point in time is its presumed owner. An account-based CBDC needs maintenance of the record of balances and transactions of all holders of the CBDC, which denotes the ownership of the monetary balances.</p> Remunerated vs. Non-remunerated <p>Remunerated Central Bank Digital Currencies are interest-bearing, which means this kind of CBDC earns interest. The concept of paying interest will likely make the CBDC more attractive as a financial instrument.</p><p>Non-Remunerated CBDCs, on the other hand, imply non-interest-bearing instruments, i.e., holders of these CBDCs will not earn interest. Presumably, in the case of these CBDCs, the public would have less incentive to switch from holding bank deposits to CBDCs. It would also mean a limited effect of banking disintermediation.</p><p>Finally, ensuring anonymity in a digital currency is difficult — since digital transactions leave some trace. For retail Central Bank Digital Currencies, reasonable anonymity for small-value transactions could be a desired&nbsp;feature.</p> CBDC vs. Cryptocurrencies — Are CBDCs Cryptocurrencies? <p>While both can be thought of as digital money or digital currencies, and both run on the foundation of blockchain technology, the two are different.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are independent digital currencies that run on decentralization principles, devoid of any predetermined value or backing. CBDCs, on the other hand, enjoy the backing of Central Banks worldwide.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies leverage a permissionless open network. CBDCs typically use a private blockchain network that requires prior authorization.</p><p>We have already discussed the notion of anonymity and how it applies to Central Bank Digital Currencies. CBDCs, usually linked to a user’s bank account, are not anonymous. When users carry out cryptocurrency transactions, they remain anonymous.</p><p>It is easier to scale Central Bank Digital Currencies since a central authority manages them. Changes, upgrades, and modifications in the cryptocurrency network, on the other hand, require consensus among all nodes in the network. Nodes disagreeing on any agenda that impacts scalability could deter the crypto network’s growth.</p><blockquote>Speaking of the impact of CBDCs on cryptocurrencies, Thomas Borrel, COO of Shyft Network, said: “CBDCs are a contentious use of blockchain technology as they could improve our established financial system, but also materially affect individuals’ right to privacy. Implementation and governance are likely key factors on whether CBDCs will succeed in pulling away even a small percentage of crypto curious and crypto enthusiasts.”</blockquote> Most Advanced CBDCs&nbsp;Today <p>The Bahamas launched its CBDC in October 2020. Known as the Sand Dollar, the project received great praise from globally revered firms like PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which described it as the “World’s Most Mature&nbsp;CBDC.”</p><p>The purpose of the Sand Dollar was to increase financial inclusion by enhancing access to digital payments. However, many experts believe it failed to meet its commitments. Two years after its launch, there were<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2022/11/22/how-is-the-worlds-most-advanced-central-bank-digital-currency-progressing/"> $338,908 Sand Dollars</a> in circulation, implying a per capita circulation of around 86 cents. It was insignificant compared to a per capita circulation of $78 in coins and $1,287 in Bahamian&nbsp;notes.</p><p>There are many Central Bank Digital Currencies that offer a host of benefits. For instance, the Digital Yuan app in China allows users to transfer money from their bank accounts to top up a digital wallet. Subsequently, the users can choose which apps to use the Digital Yuan for. It is as convenient as using other forms of popular online payment platforms in the country, such as WeChat pay or&nbsp;Alipay.</p><p>A digital US Dollar by the federal reserve bank in the United States can enhance policy efficacy by directly reaching the targeted beneficiaries of government assistance and stimulus payments.</p><p>However, how far the committed benefits of CBDCs would be able to aid our financial systems is something that still requires more assessment time.</p> Summary <p>From South America to South Korea, CBDCs are everywhere. From the International Monetary Fund to the World Economic Forum, every major global authority discusses it with vigor and sincerity. In varied use cases, from fueling economic growth through enhanced inclusion to facilitating international settlements, Central Bank Digital Currencies have become a part of many countries’ monetary policies.</p><p>Many experts believe it can radically improve a monetary policy’s effectiveness by strengthening the pass-through of the central bank’s policy rate to the broader structure of interest rates in the financial system. CBDCs can also help counter the credit and liquidity risks from exposures to either private issuers of digital tokens or from the lack of an&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>In September 2022, the White House published a report that outlined the country’s expectations, stemming from the efforts of researching Central Bank Digital Currencies at a large scale in the U.S. The report, titled ‘Technical Possibilities for a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency,’ deposed full faith in the future potential of CBDCs. It cited President Biden’s vision for America, and that vision of possibilities applies to CBDCs across all countries that have undertaken it. The<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/16/technical-possibilities-for-a-u-s-central-bank-digital-currency/"> report</a> said, “a “digital dollar” may seem far-fetched, but modern technology could make it a real possibility.”</p><p>The same holds for all CBDC-aspiring economies.</p><p>…</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				  Coding in ACA-Py just got a whole lot easier with Indicio’s a simple, hackable repo.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>Indicio recently unveiled its Minimal Example Repo, built with both experienced developers and those just starting out and in mind.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Indicio’s Minimal Example repo (AME) is a simple, hackable repo containing the building blocks to quickly reproduce an issue or demonstrate a feature within ACA-Py.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is it for?</p>
<p>Developers and testers (especially those new to ACA-Py) who are looking to build scenarios with ACA-Py will find the repo very useful, whether they are seeking to quickly reproduce an issue (such as revocation, trust pings, issuing and verifying a simple credential, or sending messages between agents) or to demonstrate a feature by writing one simple script or Pytest test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The repo cuts down on the amount of time searching through documentation, while also being approachable to developers new to ACA-Py. Instead of looking through all the Aries RFCs, Indicio’s Aca-Py Minimal Example will help autofill certain scenarios for you.</p>
<p>How does it make using ACA-Py faster / convenient?</p>
<p>It gives you a significant head start in replicating scenarios in ACA-Py. For example, a traditional exchange between an Alice and Bob¹ agent can be found in `minimal_example.py.` It allows you to quickly copy, paste, and modify the components you need to get your scenario to work, without all of the hassle of sorting through the Aries RFC documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is available now?</p>
<p>Presently, we have examples constructed, with revocation support, for a traditional Alice and Bob agent scenario, supporting protocol versions 1 and 2, and are working to add more functionality. Further work will include generators for other common agent setups (`Dockerfile`s + `docker-compose.yml`) such as:</p>
<p>Alice, Bob, Mediator<br>Issuer, Holder, Verifier<br>Endorser, Issuer, Holder, Verifier<br>ACA-Py, Echo (Remote controlled static agent; for sending raw messages)<br>Any combination of the above with a specified set of plugins installed<br>Any combination of the above with tails server and/or tunnel</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/acapy-minimal-example">Get Started Today</a></p>
<p>In just three simple steps, the <a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/acapy-minimal-example">AME repo</a> can reduce the amount of code you need to write and save you time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.) Determine the scenario you are writing.</p>
<p>What does this flow look like? What all needs to happen in this flow?</p>
<p>B.) Determine if the AME repo fully or partly supports that scenario.</p>
<p>Is the scenario you are looking for already written?&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.) Copy and paste the portions that are relevant to the scenario you are working on and modify it accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the steps you are looking for aren’t already in `minimal_example.py`, try <br>searching in `protocols.py`</p>
<p>¹ Aries agents are software components that act on behalf of entities—people, organizations and things. These agents enable decentralized, self-sovereign identity based on a secure, peer-to-peer communications channel.</p>

<p>Learn how to build edge apps efficiently and securely using Webnative App Template.</p> Building Edge Apps is Difficult and Time-Consuming <p>Have you ever built an edge app and found yourself disappointed by the in-browser authentication experience? The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#crypto-interface">Web Crypto API</a> is great for enabling web applications to perform operations such as signature generation and verification and encryption and decryption without requiring access to the user's keys, but it can also be a minefield if not implemented absolutely correctly. Even the developer docs include a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">large warning message</a> advising developers to have a cryptographic security expert throughly review their work before launching, because it can be so tricky to get right. </p><p>Privacy is becoming increasingly important to users and developers, but building an app with user data that is encrypted at rest is very difficult and time-consuming. Decentralized apps have to solve for access control, sync file data between devices, and ensure user ownership and portability of data. This is a lot to set up before even getting to the features of the app itself!</p> Webnative App Template <p>Acknowledging these roadblocks, Fission built the Webnative App Template, or WAT, to empower developers to build edge apps in the browser without building all of the infrastructure from scratch. </p><p>We launched WAT with built-in passwordless login and device-linking (which uses UCANs for authentication), powered by the Web Crypto API. We also included encrypted IPFS storage (by integrating WNFS). Identity &amp; data, owned by your app users!</p><p>But we didn't stop there. We also made <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">app customization</a> much more streamlined by including an <a href="https://webnative-template.fission.app/">image gallery app demo</a> in the template. All you have to do is sub in your app's features, adjust the look and feel, and you're on your way! </p><p>Take a look at this speed run that Applied Researcher <a href="http://twitter.com/jessmartin">Jess Martin</a> did during a recent demo day, where he builds a decentralized flickr clone in under 10 minutes!</p> Command Line Generator <p>Alternatively, if you would prefer to access WAT via your terminal, you can use our <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/create-webnative-app">CLI generator</a> to spin up either the React or Svelte versions of WAT or WalletAuth by running <code>npx create-webnative-app</code> in the command line. </p> Next Steps <p>This is our first release of the Webnative Application Template. We are actively working on a recovery kit and WebAuthn/Passkey support.</p><p>Check the<a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template/milestones"> milestones for open issues</a>, and please suggest your own as you start building.</p><p>We've spent time working on the UX flows and components as a starting point for developers to build secure and usable apps for users, but it's just a starting point. It should work well on desktop and mobile web out of the box, so you can hit the ground running.</p><p>Start building edge apps with <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Webnative App Template</a> today, and mention us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/fissioncodes">@FissionCodes</a>) so we can cheer you on as you build. </p>

<p>The global pandemic had a negative affect on many businesses around the globe. While some are still struggling to make a comeback, one thing is clear – with the rise of sports and online gambling means the commercial casino industry is back and bigger than ever. In fact, the industry <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/resources/aga-commercial-gaming-revenue-tracker/">set a record</a> in Q3 of 2022, surpassing $15 billion in revenue for the first time. While this is a big win for the industry at large, casinos will need to work that much harder to make a lasting impression and keep their valued guests coming back for more.</p>
<p>Building brand affinity and differentiation for a brick-and-mortar casino can at times seem like an enigma, so it’s really important to consider what guests want. In all things, but especially while in a casino, guests are looking for exciting, elevated and exclusive experiences they can’t get anywhere else. They want to live that high roller life with swagger in their step.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of ideas to elevate your guest experience from start to finish, making you the hero and them feel like a V.I.P.</p>
<p>Minimize wait times, maximize game play</p>
<p>Have you ever arrived at a casino, excited about the possibilities, only to be ushered into a very long check-in line? Its not an ideal experience from the get-go. And from the casino’s perspective, that means less time serving guests and building revenue. If this is the experience your guests are having, its time to uplevel your player card issuance program. With an instant ID card issuance system that can print a bold, impressive player card in just seconds can make all the difference in guest flow.</p>
<p>Give them a flashy status symbol they can have fun with</p>
<p>While you are at it, make each guest feel like a V.I.P by personalizing and elevating the card to status symbol level with bold colors exuding luxury with a high-end metallic look and feel. Who doesn’t want to flash an eye-catching, beautifully designed card at a slot machine or table?</p>
<p>But don’t stop at design. Feeling like a high roller means having access to exclusive perks. Consider integrating your player cards into the casino’s access control system. This enables you to give guests perks like access to private V.I.P. rooms; service priority, and more. What’s more, you could take it a step further and make that card an all access pass − a convenient, cashless option for table play, slot machines, restaurants, vending machines, shops, entertainment and parking.</p>
<p>Streamline operations</p>
<p>Another way to make a lasting impression for guests is to make sure casino staff is fully equipped to surprise and delight them. Find a system that allows you to track player status, spending, event participation visits and rewards. The ability to monitor where guests are in their experience allows staff to add those extra touches of personalized service that really make a lasting impression.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 30th January to 5th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to another in-depth edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week, the focus is on Britain’s crypto regulation draft, the Philippines SEC’s efforts to get more regulatory powers over the local crypto industry, Australia’s plans for crypto regulations, and Hong Kong Pondering over the pros and cons of new crypto regulations and stablecoin rule amendment. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Britain’s Crypto Regulation Draft is Open for Public&nbsp;Comments <p>Britain’s Finance Ministry, HM Treasury, has come up with the first set of crypto-asset regulatory rules amid reports that most crypto license applicants have failed to meet the country’s stringent AML standards.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CamNguyenHome/status/1621121490543579136?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>Any previously unregulated activities will come into the regulatory parameter, including centralized crypto asset exchanges, custody, and lending activities, according to Financial Services Minister of Britain Andrew Griffith.</blockquote><p>Proposed rules, already put out to public consultation, will also look into customer onboarding, public offers, transactions and remittances, platform operations, custody and mining transactions, and blockchain node operations.</p><p>The jurisdiction of these rules will cover crypto firms in Britain or those providing services to Britain. They will also come with definitive licensing and minimum capital and liquidity requirements.</p> Philippines SEC Eyes More Power Over Local Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission aims to strengthen its control over the local crypto industry.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620240942694383616?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<p>The regulatory body has drafted rules on financial products and services, including cryptocurrencies and digital financial products, for public comment, keeping its goal in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>The proposed rules, if approved, will expand the definition of security to accommodate tokenized securities and other blockchain-related products.</p><p>It will also make the SEC more powerful by giving it the authority to restrict Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs: read crypto businesses) from collecting excessive interest, fees, or charges, disqualify or suspend law-violating executives, and even suspend a firm’s entire operation.</p> Australia has big Plans for Crypto Regulations <p>Australia’s Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services, Stephen Jones, recently shined a light on the country’s plans for crypto regulations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1621534370325532674?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>According to Mr. Jones, the government’s foremost goal is to protect crypto asset customers, and the government will take multiple crucial&nbsp;steps.</blockquote><p>The Australian authorities have first planned to expand their crypto team and enhance enforcement efforts to achieve this&nbsp;goal.</p><p>It also wants to encourage the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) to pay strict attention to properly reporting consumer&nbsp;risks.</p><p>As part of the efforts, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is looking forward to becoming more active in combating fraud and establishing a set of requirements and operating criteria for virtual asset service providers.</p> Hong Kong Mulls New Crypto and Stablecoin Regulations <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is weighing the risks and advantages of new regulations and amending the existing ones on stablecoins.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620965517530914819?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<p>On 12th January last year, the authorities published a discussion paper on the same, asking for feedback from stakeholders.</p><p>According to the regulator, the recent responses from public bodies, businesses, professional organizations, and individuals also show that public sentiment is in favor of regulating stablecoins with a risk-based and agile approach that takes evolving market conditions into consideration.</p> Shyft Network Starts Monthly Shyft-wide General and Dev Updates to Keep Community Well-informed <p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of our monthly Shyft-wide general and product-related updates!</p><p>The goal is to provide the Shyft community with comprehensive updates on both general and technical developments happening across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These posts will keep everyone well-informed and up-to-date on the latest happenings at Shyft, making it easier for our community to stay informed and&nbsp;engaged.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620422285126504448?s=20&amp;t=JOhP2eezjoY0n6kWsz5JBA">Click here</a> for January’s Shyft overview and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-jan-2023">here</a> for Dev Deep Monthly Overview.</p> Voting on Shyft DAO’s Proposal for Funding the Ambassador Program is now&nbsp;Live <p>The period for commenting on the Shyft DAO proposal for 300,000 SHFT and $31,400 to fund the expenses for the Shyft Ambassador program has now ended, and voting has begun after receiving sufficient interest from the community.</p><p>Your vote is important and will help decide the future of the Shyft Ambassador Program.

<p>Dock has just released the highly awaited Verification Feature on the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> platform and <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a>, which enables organizations to instantly verify their users’ digital credentials.</p> Benefits of Dock’s Credential Verification Features    Organizations can confirm the authenticity of someone’s credentials or documents within seconds instead of taking days, weeks, and months like &nbsp;traditional verification processes.  People can choose which parts of their credential to send to a verifier rather than showing all of the details of a credential, which enables more privacy and security by not providing more information than necessary.  Verifying credentials securely and instantly helps organizations:    Prevent document fraud  Save money on manual and expensive verifications  Enhance efficiency in operations  Comply with data regulations  <p>Nick Lambert, Dock’s CEO, said, "How can people trust each other and organizations in the digital world? Through verifiable, fraud-proof data. When someone presents you with a digital document or credential, it's more important than ever that you can quickly verify if that information is valid and authentic. We are thrilled to see more and more companies use Dock to eliminate fraud and save time and money by speeding up their verification processes."</p> Cutting Edge Ability to Verify Credentials Instantly and Securely <p>It’s never been easier for people to fake physical and digital documents and credentials to commit fraud. Many people around the world are using fake certificates to get high-stakes jobs like engineers, doctors, and nurses which puts many people at risk of injury, losing their assets, or death. It’s becoming harder to know what information is true and what isn’t. </p><p>Here are just a few of many consequences that unfortunately happened as a result of credential fraud:</p>  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/132700/Fake-surgeon-who-operated-190-times">Fake surgeon operated 190 times at a major hospital</a>  <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/brigitte-cleroux-sentencing-ottawa-court-1.6425978#:~:text=Ottawa%20Police%20Service)-,Brigitte%20Cleroux%20%E2%80%94%20who%20for%20decades%20has%20pretended%20to%20be%20a,patients%20when%20she%20was%20unqualified.">Brigitte Cleroux pretended to be a nurse and school teacher for decades and used needles on patients</a>  <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/fake-engineer-and-a-deadly-building-20120914-25xpd.html">Fake engineer supervised a building project that collapsed after an earthquake that killed 115 people</a> &nbsp;   <p>But fraud can be prevented by issuing documents as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> that can be verified instantly by organizations with Dock’s tools, which enhances trust and transparency. The future of verification is here and it's powered by blockchain technology. Because this approach is quick, efficient, and fraud-proof, people can be confident in the accuracy and authenticity of the information being presented to them. </p><p>With Dock’s blockchain-based credential verification, organizations and individuals can say goodbye to the hassle and uncertainty of traditional verification methods. These older processes often involve manual, outdated, and tedious work of calling issuing organizations like universities, licensing organizations, and waiting a long time to get relevant documents verified. These delays and inefficient processes have resulted in consequences including hospitals not being able to fill enough nursing positions during urgent times and companies losing out on great job candidates.</p> Conveniently Verify Credentials With a QR Code By Phone or Computer <p>By creating a Verification QR Code in Dock Certs, you can request and instantly verify any document from your users. Users who scan the Verification QR Code with their Dock Wallet receive a notification of what data you are requesting. Once the user accepts, Dock instantly verifies the authenticity of the data and presents you with the verification result.</p> Wallet-to-Wallet Verification <p>Verifiers can import the Verification QR Codes to the Dock Wallet to enable Wallet-to-Wallet Verification. This way, they can easily start the verification process on their phone by showing the QR code for a holder to scan or sharing it via email or messaging channels.</p> Verify on the web <p>A Verifier can display the Verification QR Code on the web using a URL that holders can scan with their Dock Wallets.</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/guides/credential-verification-guide">Click here to see our complete step by step guide</a> on how to verify credentials with Dock Certs and Dock Wallet.</p> Privacy Enhancing Feature: Enabling People to Share Only the Data They Want With Selective Disclosure <p>With this new release, people will be able to share only the information they choose to, and nothing more with a tool called Selective Disclosure. This approach to data sharing provides a level of control and security that’s not possible with traditional verification methods. An example of Selective Disclosure is when someone sends an employer their license number on their credential but not their full name, address, and date of birth. </p><p>Elina Cadouri, Dock’s Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, "At Dock, we built our company around the principles of privacy and security. Selective Disclosure is key to enabling these features. We are proud to offer a solution that empowers users to protect their data and ensures that privacy is at the forefront of everything we do." </p><p>By only sharing the information that is necessary for a specific purpose, people can minimize the amount of personal data they share, reduce the risk of their information being misused, and have control over who has access to it.</p><p>Selecting specific attributes to share from a credential is only possible if the credentials were issued using the Dock BBS+ option in Dock Certs. This innovative cryptographic signature enables privacy enhancing features such as Selective Disclosure and, coming soon, Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a way for someone to prove a claim without actually revealing what that information is, such as proving to someone that you are over 18 years old, without telling them your exact date of birth.</p> Benefits of Dock’s Verification Tools for Organizations <p>The Old Way</p><p>The Efficient Way</p><p>Outdated, manual,time-consuming, and expensive verification process that involve phone calls and emails</p><p>Simply scan a QR code</p><p>Credential verification takes days, weeks, or months</p><p>Verify credentials in seconds</p><p>Risk of credential fraud</p><p>Invalid credentials will be detected and won’t be verified</p><p>Verifying credentials instantly with Dock’s tools helps organizations: </p>  Reduce the risk of liabilities, fines, and lawsuits by enhancing the credential verification processes  Speeds up the hiring process, which is especially important in sectors like healthcare to fill in staffing shortages efficiently  Saves money and time by reducing the number of resources needed to verify if documents and documents are trustworthy  Helps organizations stay compliant with data regulations  Injuries and death can be prevented by ensuring your hire people with the right qualification process  <p>Get started with <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> and the <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet (free)</a>.

  Japan will begin the CBDC pilot program this&nbsp;year.  The Bank of Japan will collaborate with a few regional financial institutions to conduct the pilot&nbsp;program.  If it’s Digital Yen pilot program meets its expectations, the country will launch it for wide-scale public usage in&nbsp;2026.  <p>Japan announced its plans to begin the CBDC pilot program in November 2022, which will launch sometime in 2023 and run for two years from the date of launch. During this period, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), with other banks and regional financial institutions, will conduct the&nbsp;pilot.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/BTCTN/status/1596406657214566402?s=20&amp;t=O9hQLpKrrbuiwshLuV-q6w">Image Source</a>)<p>It will test deposits and withdrawals from accounts and the feasibility of the currency in an emergency when there is no access to the internet. Whether the country adopts the CBDC, digital Yen, in 2026 will depend on the results of this&nbsp;trial.</p><p>This program that BOJ has currently taken up is an end-stage trial. The first or initial stage trials were held last year to test the primary functions, including issuance and circulation. It was an internal trial, while the current one examines the currency’s real-world usage feasibility.</p> Features Japan Wants to Have in Its&nbsp;CBDC <p>Japan wants its CBDC to offer universal access and not avoid any individual, device, or card. It also wants its CBDC to have counterfeit deterrence technology and prevention mechanisms to stop it from being used in illicit activities.</p><p>The CBDC should be available 24/7/365 to all users and offer cash-like settlement finality or instant payment capabilities. To ensure the same for many users simultaneously, the Japanese CBDC must have sufficient processing capabilities and scalability.</p><p>Finally, for it to be a meaningful financial tool, the CBDC has to have comprehensive interoperability features and compatibility with other payment and settlement systems.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australia-going-the-cbdc-way">Australia Going the CBDC&nbsp;Way</a></p> Purposes Japan wants Its CBDC to&nbsp;Serve <p>Japan would have two main CBDC variants: i)Wholesale CBDC and ii)General Purpose&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>While Japan has no intention to impose any sort of restrictions on its cash supply, there might come a time when the volume of cash in circulation will drop. In such a case, the Central Bank of Japan thinks general-purpose CBDCs could become a useful payment instrument alongside cash.</p><p>Moreover, irrespective of the levels of cash in circulation and the public’s demand, Japan wants its CBDCs to improve the stability and efficiency of the overall payment and settlement systems.</p> Point of Cautions in Japan’s Trajectory to Launching a&nbsp;CBDC (<a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/cherry-blossoms-spring-chureito-pagoda-fuji-mountain-japan_10824511.htm#query=Japan&amp;position=0&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph">Image Source</a>)<p>Japan is cautious about maintaining a balance of its CBDC policy in line with its overall monetary policy. It is careful about designing its CBDC schemes, such as applying limits on the amount of issuance/holdings and remuneration.</p><p>The country wants its banks to carefully decide on the role-sharing arrangement with the payment service providers or PSPs. It believes the data handling part requires in-depth scrutiny, including who obtains and manages what data and under what conditions.</p><p>One of the crucial aspects that Japan’s CBDC is expected to play is cross-border payments. Monitoring is essential to maintain a seamless and secure flow of international and domestic transactions.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/norway-leading-the-way-towards-cbdc">Norway leading the way towards&nbsp;CBDC</a></p> Japan’s Cryptocurrency Scenario <p>Cryptocurrencies are pretty popular in Japan, and data from 2021 suggest there are more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1279096/japan-cryptocurrency-transaction-value-by-trading-type/#:~:text=The%20crypto%20asset%20market%20in,on%20crypto%20exchanges%20in%20Japan.">three million active crypto asset accounts</a> on crypto exchanges in the country. In 2021, the trading value of crypto assets in Japan was close to 66 trillion Japanese Yen. The crypto spot market recorded a transaction value of more than 28 trillion Japanese Yen, while margin trading crossed the 37 trillion Japanese Yen&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Japan has also been an active proponent of Web3. In fact, its promotion is a part of Japan’s national strategy. A small active group of politicians is ensuring guidelines for DAOs, NFTs, and everything related to cryptocurrencies. A focused approach toward the market has also helped the country list new currencies easily and conveniently.</p><p>Whether the Central Bank Digital Currency, the digital Yen, would also become a success that we would get to know by&nbsp;2026.</p><p>…</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

Image generated by AI using openai.com/dall-e-2<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Do you have high hopes (or fears) of a future dominated by artificial intelligence? If so, the story of IBM’s venture into AI with Watson Health provides a cautionary tale.</p><p>Watson began 10 years ago, in 2012, when IBM decided it could use AI to make medical treatment recommendations that, it would soon be claimed, would put doctors out of their&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Watson would “quickly find hidden insights&nbsp;… in massive volumes of data” to revolutionise healthcare, claimed IBM. It would transform medical imaging, transform our ability to diagnose rare diseases and extend treatments for scourges like cancer to where doctors are scarce (in places like India). It would understand each individual’s genetic profile to create a new era of personalised health care. And, because it could read and absorb far more medical research than any doctor could ever do in a lifetime, it would transform the ability to provide medical advice. Doctors would be increasingly redundant.</p><p>IBM’s PR machine went into overdrive, as did a sycophantic gullible&nbsp;media.</p><p>Ten years later, IBM quietly sold Watson Health for $1bn. Wow! you might say. That’s a lot of money! But it was nothing compared to what IBM had poured down the drain: over $5bn spent acquiring as many databases as it could, plus the costs of the 7000 people employed on the project. Watson Health — the ‘moonshot’ that was going to revolutionise health care globally — was a total&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Even while IBM was touting Watson as a saviour of mankind, doctors were telling the company it was useless. Either it told them stuff they already knew or made recommendations that were inappropriate for individual patients. Its advice didn’t travel either. The recommendations it gave to medics in India just didn’t fit Indian circumstances because the AI was trained by American doctors in American hospitals.</p> A fundamental fallacy <p>Many reasons have been given for Watson Health’s failure. Perhaps, if it had been trained by Indian doctors in Indian hospitals, it would have been more helpful in India, for example. (Perhaps, though at what&nbsp;cost?).</p><p>Many other criticisms of AI are also unfair: racist and sexist policies, for example, where the real fault lies with the people managing the process, not the technology itself. But what lies behind the Watson fiasco is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of artificial intelligence itself: a belief that it is somehow replicating or replacing human intelligence.</p><p>This fallacy is now so widespread that it’s almost accepted wisdom. For example, both the UK and the Scottish governments are building AI and digital strategies that define AI in terms of computers doing “tasks commonly (or normally) requiring human intelligence”.</p><p>Watson-fed hype about the supposed feats of AI led Yuval Noah Harari (the supposedly learned author of the best-selling book Sapiens) to declare that with AI, “Humanity will create something more powerful than itself. When you have something that understands you better than you understand yourself, then you’re useless. Anything you can do, this system can do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt expressed the same thought when, in a recent speech, he asked “Who needs politicians when you have AI?”. No doubt he was joking, but the very fact that he could make such a quip illustrates how far the hype has gone. Because that’s what it is: hype, born of deep misunderstanding.</p><p>So-called artificial intelligence is nothing more or less than a machine — a computer — crunching lots of numbers using mathematical and logical functions in a strictly mechanical fashion. Er&nbsp;… that’s it. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ would lose its glamour (and its enormous value to hand-waving snake oil salesmen) if it said “dumb routine calculation at massive speed and scale”. But that’s what it is — and here is the essential point: such an ability to calculate does not equal human intelligence. AI does not ‘understand’ anything. The two are like chalk and&nbsp;cheese.</p><p>AI is good at solving logical, computable problems with clear, definite boundaries using clearly defined, fixed rules to achieve clearly defined, fixed answers. Like a game of chess, or recognising a face, or processing the way people use language. That’s immensely valuable. We at Mydex are enthusiastic about tools that do such things. But they are not ‘intelligent’&nbsp;.</p><p>Human intelligence did not evolve to solve logic puzzles like chess. It evolved to help humans survive by adapting to their environments — in a world where the most important problems are open-ended, with unclear boundaries (where one problem is likely to blur into other problems), where there are no clearly defined best answers and where, if we do find some good rules and answers, chances are that things will change so we need to change them for tomorrow. Human intelligence is designed for a changing world full of other people, in other&nbsp;words.</p> Spouting nonsense <p>Human intelligence is biological: embedded in a living, feeling body that is the product of billions of years of evolution, that has its own individual history and lives in a society with its own history, culture, morals, values and&nbsp;norms.</p><p>AI has none of this. As a result, it has no common sense. No concept of causation. No ability to ask ‘what if?’ questions. No imagination. No creativity (unless programmed to combine random elements, which is a million miles away from purposeful, intuitive human creativity). No ability to use analogy or metaphor (e.g. noticing the ways in which X is ‘like’ Y in some ways, but not in others). No ability to ‘level jump’ — to question rules as well as operate by them. For example, it cannot stop what it is doing to ask “Hang on! Does this actually make sense?” (which is why it is sometimes very good at generating nonsense). No ability to switch attention (by definition, because it never actually pays attention to anything). No feeling. No empathy. No awareness of context. No ability to sense situations and judge appropriateness. And so on. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>In fact, as well as displaying all the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">drawbacks and dangers of Big Data</a> discussed in our last blog, AI is so dumb that it is a major feat of AI research — a testimony to researchers’ genius — that, when it is presented with a picture of a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon, they can teach it to identify the boundaries of the tea cup; an even bigger feat to teach it that the tea cup, saucer and teaspoon are separate objects. Something that every human child knows instantly without even thinking about&nbsp;it.</p> Fish or&nbsp;fowl? <p>AI’s failures on these fronts isn’t because of a lack of access to data or computing power. It’s computation and human intelligence are qualitatively different things. Teaching an AI to think like a human is like teaching an eagle to breathe water and swim and a tuna fish to breathe air and fly. It’s not going to happen because neither eagle nor tuna fish are designed to do these things. No matter how much data, computing power or money you throw at computer-driven number crunching it can never replicate a human being’s thinking, because they are designed in different ways to do different things.</p><p>Talking of design, you may have noticed I used the term ‘an AI’ in the last paragraph. That’s deliberate. There is no such thing as ‘artificial intelligence’ in general, aside from a human discipline: a collection of (very human) skills and knowledge about computing. In practice, there are only specific AI tools designed to do specific things, such as recognise faces or play&nbsp;chess.</p><p>AI tools designed to do these highly specific tasks cannot suddenly decide to do something else such as natural language processing, just as a mechanical tool such as a drill or kettle cannot suddenly decide to become an aeroplane. Both AI tools and mechanical tools are designed and built (by humans) to do specific things, and only those&nbsp;things.</p><p>So when the UK and Scottish Governments declare that AI is about computers doing things that normally require human intelligence, they are spouting nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. The reason why AI can be valuable is because it can do one thing that humans can not do — crunch huge amounts of numbers in no time at all to identify correlations and patterns. That’s fantastic. We should use that ability for all its worth. But as soon as we ask, hope or expect AI to do anything more than that, all we are doing is wasting time, effort and money and risking disaster. As with Watson&nbsp;Health.</p> A deep-rooted misunderstanding <p>To be fair to the UK and Scottish Governments, this deep, fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the beast has long, venerable roots. It goes back to a seminal paper, published by the father of AI Alan Turing back in 1950 when he asked “Can machines&nbsp;think?”</p><p>In that paper, entitled <a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>’, he invented the term ‘machine learning’ and laid out what would become an AI research agenda for the next three quarters of a century. Pure genius. But the paper did NOT answer ‘Yes’ to the question ‘Can machines&nbsp;think?’.</p><p>Instead, in the very first paragraph, Turing ducked his own challenge to ask a different question instead: whether machines can imitate human thinking. Then he spent the next half the paper narrowing his ‘imitation game’ down, further and further, setting aside all the ways in which machines can not imitate human intelligence, to finally focus on one tiny area of overlap: making calcuations using&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Turing’s paper is therefore seminal in two ways: in the research agenda it created, and in the endless misunderstandings it spawned. Today, we are having to deal with both consequences — including folly on a grand scale resulting in:</p>  Billions of £/$/€ and decades worth of effort being spent on wild goose chases such as Watson&nbsp;Medical  Immense harm being done by multiple misapplications of AI, arising from people believing it can do things that it&nbsp;can’t  A failure to invest available resources in uses of data that could bring immense personal, social and economic benefits very&nbsp;quickly.  <p>In this blog series we have shown how providing every citizen with their own personal data store can ease citizens’ access to services, cut the costs of providing these services, improve peoples’ experience of using them, and join them up to produce better outcomes — while also opening up new dimensions of innovation and accelerating and enriching the journey to net&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Yet, in an extreme case of selective attention — <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">of counting bounces while ignoring gorillas</a> — all these immediate, practical, definite benefits are being ignored in favour of expensive, futile pipedreams born of gullibility and ignorance. Just imagine the real, demonstrable benefits, as outlined above, that Mydex personal data stores could deliver if it had $5 billion, 7000 staff and a decade to invest in providing personal data logistics infrastructure to inform all service provision!</p> Conclusion <p>To stress once more: we at Mydex are all in favour of AI, deployed correctly, to do what it can do. We have high hopes of personal AI, which crunches individuals’ own personal data to help them make better decisions and manage their lives better — working for them, rather than doing things to them — while protecting their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Right now, as part of the Peoplehood project for example, we are collecting billions of data points from individuals’ smart meters to identify abnormal behaviour patterns for the old and frail — to generate alerts if they have a fall, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>This is all wonderful stuff. But it is not a panacea. Policy- and decision-makers’ fixation on Big Data and AI are one reason why the real, immediate, practical opportunities presented by personal data stores are being overlooked. But there is another reason too: mainstream economic theory is blinding people to the economic potential of personal data. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/artificial-intelligence-no-authentic-folly-on-a-grand-scale-e88dbda191b9">Artificial Intelligence?

<p>Microservices architecture—often called microservices—is a modern application design model developers use for designing large software projects. This architecture enables you to separate an extensive application into many independent parts, with each piece responsible for performing a single function or operation. Then, when a user requests a service, the application calls each of the relevant microservice components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the user of an e-commerce website wants to purchase a product, the app will only interact with the components responsible for processing transactions. Features like user reviews, product searches, and support communication are independent. Of course, all this occurs behind the scenes while the user interacts with a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A microservices-based approach offers countless benefits, including increased development speed, enhanced application security, rapid and efficient scaling, and improved fault isolation. However, compartmentalizing software in this fashion can also introduce complexities, especially regarding authentication across several disparate services.</p>

<p>Audit all apps, determine which are trusted and then limit scopes for all other applications.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>One of the largest surface areas for data to be unknowingly leaked is through an unmanaged application through OAuth in Google Workspace. OAuth is a widely used protocol for granting access to resources. When a user grants an application access to their Google Workspace data through OAuth, they may not be fully aware of the scope of access they are giving to the application, and the application may have access to more data than the user intended. Additionally, if the application is not properly secured or is malicious, it may misuse the access it has been granted and potentially leak the user's data.</p>

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>You will first want to audit all connected apps, determine which ones are still needed, mark them as trusted, and prevent all other applications from accessing any high-risk/restricted scopes. Before restricting scopes, communicate with your employees about the change and provide a documented path for having new connections approved. </p>

<p>Reviewing Apps</p>
<p>Head to Security &gt; Access and Data Control &gt; API Controls and review your third-party API app access list. This will allow you to view every app in your organization in addition to what scopes have been granted. </p>

<p>Set Apps As Trusted</p>
<p>Look to see if there is an internal list of applications that have been approved. If they are allowed to access data from Google, mark them as Trusted. This will prevent them from being blocked if and when you move to block access for untrusted apps.</p>

<p>Set Access Levels for APIs</p>
<p>Note: Setting access levels will start restricting access. This will prevent employees (including yourself!) from connecting apps to Google that request any scopes you restrict. 

</p>
<p>Under Security &gt; Access and Data Control &gt; API Controls &gt; Google Services - View List, set the access levels that you want to use for each application. For example, if you store proprietary data in Google Drive, set Drive to be a Restricted App so that only trusted apps can authenticate with Drive scopes. </p>

<p>We recommend restricting the following:</p> 
   Drive 
   Mail 
   Calendar 
   Google Workspace Admin 
   Vault 
   Groups 
 
<p>Once complete, add a custom message under Settings to give users a meaningful error and path forward - include a link to your IT helpdesk contact information. </p>

<p>On the main API Controls page you can optionally restrict all third-party API access, but this will also block sign-in scopes. If you would prefer to have awareness of all apps using Google to sign in, this may be the best path. </p>

<p>In Conclusion</p>
<p>We hope that these tips have helped to demystify where to start with securing your Google Workspace environment! Remember, Rome was not built in a day. Start with an initial audit, explore your environment, and do the appropriate amount of testing and planning to make these changes a success. While some hurdles may be a challenge, it is far easier to lay the groundwork for security best practices when you are a smaller company versus when you reach hundreds, or even thousands, of employees. There is no time like the present to gift yourself some peace of mind. </p>

<p>Here’s to a year of good health, good company, and an even better Google Workspace setup than the year before!</p>

				  The Battle Ground 
<p>The major players in the digital wallet space are Google, Apple, and Samsung and then a long list of mostly failed bank wallets. They are all jockeying for the top position in the digital wallet race, hoping to make their wallets the default option on mobile devices. The minor players are startups developing innovative new technologies that could significantly advantage the companies that adopt them. These startups are developing new identification and authentication methods to improve the user experience of digital wallets.</p>
 Who Is Already Out? 
<p>In 2019, Facebook took a step into the world of finance with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682838/facebook-digital-wallet-calibra-libra-cryptocurrency-kevin-weil-david-marcus-interview">its digital wallet Calibra</a> and announced the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682290/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-visa-mastercard-digital-currency-calibra-wallet-announce"> launch of a crypto token Libra</a>. Calibra allowed users to store and exchange fiat currencies and make payments through Messenger and WhatsApp. In 2020, a change in direction saw the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi">rebrand to Novi</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has already stepped back, and they shut down the Novi pilot in 2022. If you look at where they are investing, though, they will likely return.</p>

				  Who will win the wallet wars? 
<p>It’s still too early to say who will ultimately win the wallet wars. But one thing is sure: the battle for your digital identity is just getting started.</p>
<p>The fight for payment processing is likely to be won by the company that can provide the most effortless and seamless payment experience for merchants. And the battle for identity is likely to be won by the company that can provide the most secure, comprehensive and convenient digital wallet for consumers.</p>

<p>Around the world the transition from physical wallets to digital wallets is well underway. An Accenture survey of 16,000 customers in 13 countries found that 56% of them were using digital wallets more than five times every month (compared with only 48% using cards that often) and they interpret these results to mean that heading towards a hundred billion dollars of annual payments revenues for banks are “at risk”.

				  Challenge That Remains 
<p>However convenient as digital wallets may be, they are not without drawbacks, and one of the biggest challenges faced is backup and recovery. Chapter 9.7 of the SSI Book states, “a well-designed and engineered digital wallet should be safer and better protected from loss than a physical wallet, but only if the owner takes the necessary recovery preparation steps.”</p>
<p>So, what’s the best way to protect your digital wallet? It’s more complex, and bluntly, there are yet to be compelling answers. But – most of the things we’re putting in our wallets can be replaced, just like what happens if you lose your physical wallet.</p>
<p>User identity management and backup/recovery can be difficult, especially as organizations seek to minimize the risks associated with storing personal information.</p>
<p>Backup and recovery are still challenging, especially as organizations seek to minimize the risks associated with storing personal information. The answer might be that users take back control of their identities and become personally accountable for their security and recovery. Organizations can drastically decrease their risk burden by empowering individual users to manage their identities.</p>

				  Story 
<p>Recently, I discussed the advantages of digital wallets with my parents regarding safety and security. The risks associated with a physical wallet—like getting stolen or lost—are significant. On the other hand, digital wallets require passwords and other forms of authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals can access them. I reminded my dad that at any time, I could take his physical wallet and use his cards. But I would never be able to access his phone or digital wallet because I don’t know the password and can’t pass the biometric identification. My dad was intrigued by these enhanced security protocols and agreed that switching to a digital wallet was worth looking into.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p></p>
<p>What’s to Come</p>
<p>The future of digital wallets is likely to be defined by security and interoperability. Trust registries will anchor both.</p>
<p>On the security front, trust registries will make it impossible for bad actors to share and issue fake credentials. On the interoperability front, we will see the development of new standards that will enable different digital wallets to work together—allowing users to choose the digital wallet that best suits their needs without worrying about compatibility.</p>
<p>If you’re considering entering the digital wallet market, now is the time. With so much growth expected, there’s a massive opportunity for organizations to get involved in this rapidly growing industry.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time for the industry, and we can’t wait to see what comes next!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>We are happy to announce our first partnership of 2023: Pangea Inc. Through this partnership; both companies will cooperate in developing new business opportunities in the Metaverse, including NFT and SBT projects.</p><p>Pangea Inc. has worked on multiple blockchain projects, including an artwork NFT platform, a K-content platform, and a P2E project. Pangea’s most recent project is <a href="https://sbt.pizza/en-US">SBT.PIZZA</a>, a service that helps brands, institutions, and influencers to easily issue NFTs to consumers and fans and build strong communities. Via SBTs, the receivers can authenticate or commemorate experiences related to the&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>SBT.PIZZA is currently collaborating with Yonsei University to issue SBTs to students who satisfy qualifications like attending specific lectures, seminars, or activities.</p><p>With this partnership, Metadium will continue expanding its reach in the metaverse by adding more projects and uses of its technology.</p> NFTs and&nbsp;SBTs? <p>SBT stands for soulbound token, a publicly verifiable and non-transferable non-fungible token (NFT) that represents an individual’s credentials, affiliations, and commitments.

<p>Innovation, speed, and scale are the fundamental building blocks for success in tech today. Automation solutions help businesses implement these core principles and enable them to fulfill rapidly evolving customer needs across different ecosystems.</p>
<p>In a Linux ecosystem, bash scripts consisting of a series of shell commands help automate repeated tasks. As a command language interpreter (CLI) tool, it is used in an array of applications in the Linux ecosystem. Combined with Cron Job scheduler, these scripts are often used in DevOps to build business workflows and processes.</p>
<p>You can now utilize these bash scripts to also integrate PKI-based security into your workflows and protect your servers and applications. Digital security ecosystems have evolved to ensure DevOps can leverage their existing knowledge to collaborate with the new tools and make implementing security a smooth, scalable process that matches their speed.</p>
<p>Until now, PKI expertise was a necessary prerequisite for successfully securing applications and servers, making developers wary of integrating security measures in their DevOps builds/processes. Today, it is possible to leverage out-of-the-box tools developed by PKI experts to implement security end-to-end to protect your business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/whitepapers/pk20-1001-001_pki_rest_api_wp.pdf">Entrust CA Gateway (CAGW)</a> Command Line Interface (CLI) tool is one such tool that can be used to automate security for Linux servers and applications. It uses CAGW’s REST APIs to automate certificate and key generation, issuance, and lifecycle management to secure your endpoints at the time of deployment itself. Using this CLI tool it is possible to automate various complex cryptographic operations and integrate security into existing workflows and processes. It is an interactive tool that can be modified based on your requirements.</p>
<p>The CAGW CLI tool can automate the execution of these tasks:</p>
 
 Generating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with subject using OpenSSL 
 Listing various certificate authorities (CAs) in the system 
 Listing all profiles for a CA 
 Requesting and enrolling new certificates with CSR 
 Certificate revocation by serial number 
 Bulk certificate issuance 
 
<p>The technical documentation and the bash scripts for the CAGW CLI tool are available on this <a href="https://github.com/EntrustCorporation/pki-utilities">Entrust GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>A suite of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki">Entrust PKI</a> products can be leveraged in the DevOps environment to simplify the automation of security essentials. A DevSecOps approach is necessary to ensure your network, servers, and applications are secure at the time of deployment itself. With the threats and attacks modern businesses face, security cannot be an afterthought. And it is now possible to implement security in DevOps without sacrificing the pace of development.</p>

<p>Modern businesses need to adopt a culture of agile collaboration to deliver results and exceed market expectations. DevOps enables organizations to innovate at speed, collaborate efficiently, and deliver results faster.</p>
<p>While helping organizations build better, DevOps often sidesteps implementing security in its need for speed. Traditionally, security has been the complex component that would hit the brakes in the DevOps race. But today, security solutions can match the speed and flexibility needs of DevOps and protect businesses at the same time.</p>
<p>Entrust automation solutions enable DevOps to implement security from day one with scalable solutions that are easy to integrate, iterate, and automate. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/whitepapers/pk20-1001-001_pki_rest_api_wp.pdf">Entrust Certificate Authority Gateway</a> (CAGW) provides a RESTful interface to access multiple CAs like Entrust – public and private, Microsoft CA, and AWS for automating certificate provisioning, issuance, deployment, and lifecycle management.</p>
<p>Certificate and key issuance are the first steps in security. But to secure an application end-to-end you need complete visibility and control over the various keys, certificates, and identities in use. Entrust automation solutions like <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/certificate-hub">Certificate Hub</a> and CA Gateway provide the speed and scalability with an automation layer enabling DevOps to leverage best security practices without slowing them down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/how-does-ssl-work">TLS/SSL certificates</a> and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/how-to-manage-encryption-keys">cryptographic keys</a> establish trust in identities and communications. But TLS/SSL encryption/decryption at high volumes can negatively impact a web server’s performance. TLS/SSL offloading is a process by which this encryption/decryption process is moved from a web server to a separate device earmarked for processing TLS/SSL.</p>
<p>F5 BIG-IP is a popular hardware or software-based local traffic manager that “offers a high-performance network load balancer with blazing-fast TLS/SSL offloading and TLS/SSL inspection to secure data from end-to-end between clients and servers. To leverage F5’s network capabilities, organizations need to provision and manage certificates and cryptographic keys for the numerous clients and servers connected to the load balancer.</p>
<p>Entrust CA Gateway Ansible Module enables users to fully automate security implementation in the F5 ecosystem. This module helps to automatically implement the TLS/SSL offloading policies, from certificate issuance to certificate deployment at the desired endpoints. Together with other Entrust services like Certificate Hub, it provides users complete visibility, real-time monitoring, and control of the certificates and keys in their network, enabling them to mitigate business disruptions.</p>

Our ongoing Predict ETH Challenge →<a href="https://t.co/0lxSpl4khC">http://bit.ly/3XrXzHu</a><p>“How do I predict future asset prices?” is the multi-billion dollar question on every trader’s mind. Artificial intelligence can help to accurately predict asset prices. Indeed, the most robust predictive trading algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques. On the optimistic side, algorithmically trading assets with predictive ML models can yield enormous gains à la Renaissance Technologies… Yet algorithmic trading gone awry can yield enormous losses as in the latest FTX&nbsp;scandal.</p><p>If you code an accurate price prediction model, then the next logical step is to trade with it. Sounds easy enough, right? But putting your faith in a trading algorithm is no easy task. Not only does it take significant coding &amp; financial prowess to avoid (massive) trading errors, but it takes quite the emotional leap of faith&nbsp;too.</p><p>Don’t have the stomach for risk? Maybe you want 0% downside. Lucky for you, there’s a solution for that. Enter, Ocean Protocol.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s open-source tools enable you to sell your algorithms without risk of others stealing your trade secrets.&nbsp;How?</p><p>This is a tutorial! We show, don’t tell&nbsp;;)</p><p>Here we’ll teach you from start to finish how to create an algorithm for predicting ETH crypto prices and then upload your algorithm privately to the Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>By the way, this is a purely educational tutorial — we’re not financial advisors! We authors give no warranty about the performance of this algorithm, nor should anything in this article be considered financial advice.</p><p>Moving on to the fun&nbsp;stuff…</p> Setting up our environment <p>First, we’ll set up our environment with a Prophet machine learning model to forecast prices. Easy&nbsp;peasy.</p> Profit with ‘Prophet’ <p>Prophet is a forecasting algorithm originally developed by Facebook that uses additive models. In other words, Prophet sums several different functions that each fit pieces of a historical dataset to create one complete model for predicting future values. This forecasting model can be used for any kind of time-series data, but in this example we will use it to predict ETH crypto&nbsp;prices.</p><p>‘Explain Prophet’s additive models to me like I’m five years&nbsp;old.’</p><p>Prophet sums: 1) a combination of trend functions (including non-linear ones) with 2) seasonal inputs (including yearly, monthly, weekly and daily seasonalities) and 3) holiday effects (customizable to particular regions!). The result is a practical, real-world model that’s much more sophisticated than simple linear extrapolation. Pretty cool,&nbsp;no?</p><p>Prophet is implemented in Python, a widely used programming language for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It’s also open-source!</p><p>Find the full Prophet source code at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">https://facebook.github.io/prophet/</a></p> Installing Prophet <p>To install Prophet, you can use the pip command in your Terminal/Git Bash or an equivalent command based on your computer’s package-management system. We’ll install with pip here for ease of use with&nbsp;Python:</p> $ python -m pip install prophet <p>That’s it! Nothing complicated here.</p><p>If you have a fickle environment and encounter issues while installing, we’re here to help! Chat with the Ocean Protocol core team on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a> with any questions!</p> Your Crystal Ball: Or how to make price predictions <p>All the code for creating the algorithm to predict ETH is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KDtCc5K6bXItHggBi2e4bEkl6-GRB2X3?usp=sharing">here</a> in a Jupyter notebook.</p><p>It’s time to use machine learning to forecast prices. We’ll be implementing a basic ML pipeline to forecast future prices for the Ethereum-Tether (ETH/USDT) cryptocurrency pair.</p><p>What is an ML pipeline? A machine learning pipeline usually consists of these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Data gathering and processing  Machine learning&nbsp;modeling  Model evaluation  Model inference  <p>Let’s collect and transform ETH price data from a reliable source into a format that we can use with our Prophet&nbsp;model.</p><p>ETH/USDT prices data can be downloaded from several <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/tree/main/examples">places</a>, but in this tutorial we’ll use Binance API for a simple solution to getting hourly ETH/USDT&nbsp;prices.</p><p>In your terminal, start the Python&nbsp;console.</p> $ python <p>Then, enter the following steps each in a new&nbsp;line:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; import requests<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; url = "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&amp;interval=1h&amp;limit=1000"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(url)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; cex_x = r.json() <p>Note: The Binance API only works outside of the U.S. American users will need to either run a VPN or use a different data&nbsp;source.</p><p>In the snippet above, cex_x is an object of 500 data points, one for every hour, on the hour. Each data point has a list of 6 values: (0) Timestamp (1) Open price (2) High price (3) Low price (4) Close price (5) Volume. We will use the hourly “Close price” to make our price predictions.</p><p>More information regarding the Binance API is available in their <a href="https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#introduction">documentation</a>.</p><p>Initially, the timestamp is a Unix timestamp in milliseconds. We need to convert that Unix timestamp into a Python datetime object. We’ll convert the Unix time interval from milliseconds to seconds, then use a loop to convert the Unix timestamp into a list of Python datetime&nbsp;objects:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; uts = [xi[0]/1000 for xi in cex_x]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ts_obj = [datetime.utcfromtimestamp(s) for s in uts] <p>The variable ts_obj contains the list of Python datetime objects. Remember, these datetime objects correspond to the Close prices of ETH/USDT coin pair on hourly intervals, but are not the Close prices themselves… We need to create a Python dataframe containing both the hourly timestamps and their Close&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Let’s create the Python Pandas dataframe using the first two lines of code below. Then, we will split the dataframe into a training set and a test set using the third and fourth lines of code&nbsp;below.</p><p>What is a training set and a test set? A training set is the data fed into the ML algorithm to model the behavior of the data for generating a forecast. A test set is the data your ML algorithm uses to see if its forecast is accurate. If the forecast isn’t accurate, then the algorithm revises its model. Thus, the machine “learns” from the test&nbsp;data.</p><p>We’ll use most of the hourly Close price data as our training set, but we’ll save the last 12 hours of Close prices to test our&nbsp;model.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; cls_price = [float(xi[4]) for xi in cex_x]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dataset = pd.DataFrame({"ds": ts_obj, "y": cls_price})<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; train = dataset.iloc[0:-12, :]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; test = dataset.iloc[-12:, :]  ‘Fit’ for a&nbsp;model <p>The first step to using Prophet is instantiating a Prophet object. We create a Prophet object called model in the first two steps below. Then, we just call the fit function on our training set to create our forecasting model.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet import Prophet<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = Prophet()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; model.fit(train) <p>Et voilá, our Prophet model is created and we can start to predict hourly ETH/USDT crypto&nbsp;prices!</p><p>But how accurate is our model,&nbsp;really?</p> Cross Validation Testing <p>One way to significantly improve our ML model’s accuracy is by using cross validation. Cross validation will help us with two things: 1) selecting the additive functions correctly that create the model and 2) making sure that the model doesn’t fit the training data too closely to reduce&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Additive functions individually model data’s behavior and add together in sequence to create one unified model for the data. Noise is the small, high frequency fluctuations in ETH/USDT prices over time. Since our Prophet model is fitted perfectly to our data including all that noise, Prophet’s forecasted prices will likely deviate from general trends in the data because noise generates a greater number of additive functions in the&nbsp;model.</p><p>What we need is a way to smooth out our Prophet model’s functions to eliminate some of the noise and predict more generally the direction of future ETH/USDT&nbsp;prices.</p><p>How does cross validation work?</p><p>Cross validation takes the training set and splits it into chunks for re-training and testing the model. Starting from an initial time in the past, each chunk has an equivalent timespan called a Horizon to evenly cross validate. The very first horizon is used to train the model, then the second horizon is used to test your model. This pattern repeats in chunks until a final Cutoff time in the training&nbsp;set.</p><p>The ML algorithm tests one last time its model on the data after the cutoff. Then, the error is computed and the ML model does its final&nbsp;tuning.</p><p>All that to say, we can cross-validate with just a few elegant lines of&nbsp;code:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; df_cv = cross_validation(model, initial='30 days', period='1 hour', horizon = '12 hours')&gt;&gt;&gt; df_cv = cross_validation(model, initial=’30 dys’, period=’1 hour’, horizon = ’12 hours’) <p>Computing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is just as&nbsp;easy:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet.diagnostics import performance_metrics<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; df_p = performance_metrics(df_cv) <p>You can see in the chart below that the MSE of the prediction increases as we try to predict further in time, which makes sense because uncertainty increases over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Now that we have a working and cross validated ETH price prediction model, let’s see how closely it modeled the data overall using the NMSE&nbsp;metric.</p> How good are we at predicting future ETH&nbsp;prices? <p>We’ll calculate the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) to assess the accuracy of our cross validated Prophet model. Why? NMSE is the de facto measurement for comparing the accuracy between various ML models, so it will give us a good sense of how we stack up with the competition. Let’s compute the&nbsp;NMSE:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; forecast = model.predict(test)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mse_xy = np.sum(np.square(np.asarray(test["y"]) - np.asarray(forecast["yhat"])))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mse_x = np.sum(np.square(np.asarray(test["y"])))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nmse = mse_xy / mse_x <p>In this code, the variable nmse is the error of the model performing in the unseen test set. The following chart shows a 12 hour ETH price prediction. The dotted line divides the historical data used for training and the unseen testing&nbsp;data.</p><p>And indeed, things are on the up and up 🙂 It’s time to monetize our trade secret ETH price prediction algorithm…</p> Ocean Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol builds open-source tools to monetize datasets and algorithms on the blockchain. Publishers of datasets and algorithms can use Ocean Protocol tools to mint their own data NFTs (including metadata) and grant access to these NFTs using data&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>You can learn more about Ocean Protocol in the <a href="https://www.oceanacademy.io/ocean101/chapter-1">Ocean&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ll create a data NFT to store our ETH price prediction algorithm and grant access to it for paying consumers.</p><p>Installing Ocean is just one&nbsp;command:</p> $ python -m pip install ocean-lib <p>If you encounter issues, ping us on <a href="https://discord.gg/B5KsHKf8">Discord</a> and the Ocean team will help you! Our <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/main2.md">official docs</a> are also a reference.</p><p>Let’s set up our environment by creating an Ocean object on our blockchain of choice. We’ll use Polygon in this example for its low gas&nbsp;fees.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; connect_to_network(“polygon”)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ocean = Ocean(get_config_dict()) <p>Next, we have to connect our wallet (Alice impersonates the owner of the wallet in the steps&nbsp;below)</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; # Assuming the private key comes from env var<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from brownie.network import accounts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; alice_private_key = os.getenv(‘REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1’)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts.clear()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; alice_wallet = accounts.add(alice_private_key) <p>Now we’re ready for compute-to-data. Drumroll, please!</p> Compute-to-Data <p>Compute-to-data (C2D) is a functionality within the Ocean tech stack that allows data consumers to buy the results of computation on a dataset (i.e. AI model or other data outputs) rather than purchasing the dataset directly.</p><p>In this case, data publishers can upload an algorithm to the Ocean Marketplace by creating an asset through the Ocean Library. The output of this algorithm can then be sold to other users in the marketplace. In other words, data and algorithm owners can monetize this IP while preserving the privacy of the data contents.</p><p>First, the algorithm should be uploaded to a repository — Github for example. Then, the URL from the algorithm is used in the following way to create the asset in the marketplace:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_url = “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;repository&gt;/&lt;file&gt;.py"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (ALGO_data_nft, ALGO_datatoken, ALGO_ddo) = ocean.assets.create_algo_asset(name, ALGO_url, alice_wallet, wait_for_aqua=True)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"ALGO_ddo did = '{ALGO_ddo.did}'") <p>The URL of the algorithm is only visible to Ocean Protocol’s technology, but the URL is encrypted to the users who buy the asset. The key printed above is the identifier for the asset created in the marketplace.</p><p>We’re done! The output DID is your algorithm asset’s digital identifier that proves it exists now on the Polygon blockchain. This asset can now be bought on the Ocean Market to compute on data and output those predictions to purchasers.</p><p>Congratulations!</p> Conclusion <p>We trained a forecasting ML model to make predictions about the future values of ETH/USDT crypto pair. We explored how to transform algorithms into sealable assets using the Compute-to-Data (C2D) feature. The end result? Those who follow this tutorial can sell predictions for ETH/USDT for any point in time through the Ocean Market using C2D, allowing you to monetize your IP. This example is only one of the many possible applications of the Ocean Protocol.

<p>Self-sovereign identity gives users the ability to store and manage their own identity and data online. This new identity layer of the internet will fundamentally shift the relationship users have with the applications and services they interact with. When users access websites, they can provision access to their self-managed data, rather than relying on the company that operates said website to store and manage their personal information.</p><p>For example, we can use Bob, an everyday person who uses an ever-increasing number of different online applications and services for various purposes. If you're a human in the modern age reading this, you probably are like Bob in many ways. In the current model for identity on the internet, Bob's online data is stored in siloes across all the different servers for the companies he has accounts with. </p><p>Bob does not own this data—if his favorite photo-sharing social media application decides to shut down his account, he loses all of his memories stored there and the personal connections he has built over time. In a proposed future state of the internet powered by self-sovereign identity, Bob would own and manage all of his own data, then provision access to each of the applications and services whenever he chooses. </p><p>This shift has several benefits for both users and enterprises. For users, self-sovereign identity gives them more control over their personal data. They can choose which data to share and with whom, and they can revoke access at any time. This gives users greater privacy and security, while also improving user experience by allowing for more personalized experiences and reducing the number of unique usernames and passwords that need to be managed.</p><p>For enterprises and companies, self-sovereign identity has clear benefits–more personalized experiences for users, lower compliance costs associated with storing data, and reduced risks of data breaches. </p> Better User Experiences <p>By allowing users to share the data they choose, enterprises can create more tailored experiences that are relevant and engaging for the user. Providing highly personalized experiences can increase customer conversion rates, while also improving customer satisfaction and retention overall. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying">A recent report from McKinsey</a> found that companies that excel at personalization see 40% higher revenue than their competitors. Measuring performance across US industries, the report estimates that shifting to top-quartile performance in personalization would generate over $1 trillion in value. Current data aggregation practices to inform personalization strategies are incredibly costly, with billion-dollar companies specializing in collecting and selling customer data for personalization and targeted advertising.</p><p>With self-sovereign identity, we can enable a system where users themselves can selectively disclose their information for a more customized experience, which can increase conversion and retention rates while decreasing the costs of personalization. This may be a tough pill to swallow for companies earning millions (and billions, in some cases) by tracking and aggregating consumer data. However, leveling the playing field to restore user control of personal information will ultimately create unique branding and memorable experiences in the digital world. </p><p>Currently, our online preferences and behaviors are stored in siloes managed by separate companies. There are incredible opportunities unlocked if that data becomes portable. Users can then share a combination of their preferences and other identity attributes within a new application to customize their initial experience immediately. The key to remember here, however, is that the choice to share that information should remain with the user. &nbsp;</p><p>Reducing Compliance Costs</p><p>Decentralized identity can also help enterprises and companies reduce their costs of compliance. By storing less personal information of users on their servers, they can reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored and protected. This can lower costs associated with data management, in addition to reducing costs for maintaining compliance with various data protection regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. </p><p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> (the General Data Protection Regulation) is a law passed by the EU, effective in May 2018, that enforces guidelines for any organization that targets or collects data related to people in the EU. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/assets/pwc-gdpr-series-pulse-survey.pdf">PWC</a> surveyed 200 C-Suite executives (CIOs, CISOs, CMOs, CPOs, and General Counsels) from US companies with more than 500 employees about their preparations for GDPR compliance in 2017 before the law became effective. The survey results showed that 68% of respondents had budgeted between $1 million and $10 million for GDPR compliance. Nine percent (9%) of the survey respondents expected to spend over $10 million to address GDPR obligations. The fines for violating the GDPR can be as high as the greater of €20 million or 4% of global revenues, plus damages owed to affected individuals seeking compensation. </p><p>Other jurisdictions, like the State of California, are following suit, passing their own versions of consumer data protection regulations in an effort to curtail the mass surveillance on citizens by Big Tech. The California Attorney General released <a href="https://www.dorsey.com/newsresources/publications/client-alerts/2019/12/ccpa-update">an economic impact assessment,</a> which estimated the total cost of initial compliance with the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) would approach a staggering $55 billion. As regulators globally address public concerns about data privacy and processing, the costs for companies maintaining compliance will become even more significant, if they do not reframe their philosophy on the data collection practices at a fundamental level. </p><p>A new identity layer of the internet, which allows users to self-opt into disclosing their personal data and manage how their data are shared further, will significantly decrease the overhead and administrative costs associated with managing user data in company servers. </p><p>No Data to Breach</p><p>In addition to improved user experience and lower costs associated with data storage and compliance, self-sovereign identity can help prevent one of the biggest PR crises a large company can face–a data breach.</p><p>By reducing the amount of personally identifiable information (PII) on company servers, the honeypot of large internal databases storing millions of records representing user data, like names, addresses, passwords, and credit card details, is eliminated. This means that hackers will be less likely to target companies’ servers, and if they do, there will be less sensitive information for them to steal. While this also protects companies from the PR nightmare of a data breach, it also protects consumers by reducing the risks that their private information becomes compromised and potentially used for nefarious purposes.</p><p>The cost of data breaches can be significant for companies. According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700072379268739&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAoL6eBhA3EiwAXDom5phVM9EeO8XsaQOvGFFAmJdFMbtgH8C9WOwDSMAxf9mGl1qN1PgyXxoCyJ4QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">a study by IBM</a>, the average cost of a data breach for a company in the United States is $9.44 million, compared to the global average of $4.35 million. This total cost represents expenses such as legal fees, lost business, and damage to the company's reputation. For “mega-breaches” with between 50 to 60 million records affected, the average cost is $387 million.</p><p>In addition to the financial cost, data breaches can also lead to negative press and loss of consumer trust. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">McKinsey surveyed</a> 1,000 consumers in North America and found that 71% of respondents would stop doing business with a company if it mishandled sensitive data. Data breaches can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line, as well as its reputation. This risk is mitigated in a new digital identity paradigm powered by verifiable credentials. If users are able to self-manage their data and provision access to websites only when needed, the data aren’t housed in centralized databases, which act as a honeypot for hackers or other bad actors looking to sell user credentials or data on the dark web.</p><p>Self-sovereign identity enabled by verifiable credentials can give users more control of their data online and afford them more customizable and personalized experiences as they interact with companies online, if they choose. Companies can see reduced compliance costs for enterprises and reduced risk of data breaches by reducing the amount of consumer data stored on their servers. By adopting self-sovereign identity solutions, companies can protect themselves and their customers from the significant costs and negative press associated with data breaches.</p><p>There is a wide range of industries that rely on data storage and record-keeping that can be supercharged with verifiable credentials and similar technologies. We previously <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/future-state-healthcare/">wrote a blog post</a> about how digital credentials can be applied within the healthcare industry. We will explore other industries in future blogs to come–so subscribe and follow along on this Verifiable Credentials Future State journey with us!</p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

Update to Reward Function for&nbsp;DF23  3.1 DCV-bound rewards at asset&nbsp;level <p>DF9 introduced the constraint to “bound total rewards by total DCV * mult”. The multiplier keeps shrinking, such that by DF29 it’s no longer profitable to wash-consume.</p><p>We’re pleased with the outcome of this: it’s incentivized data farmers to drive&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>We can make a small change to tune it further. The idea is: rather than bounding total rewards by DCV (global), bound them at the asset level. (Just like RF bounds &lt;= 125% APY at the asset&nbsp;level.)</p><p>Here’s the updated macro algorithm for rewards distribution:</p>  As usual, distribute rewards pro-rata to each asset on its&nbsp;DCV.  Then, for each asset: (a) Compute rewards (b) Further bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY and by its DCV *&nbsp;mult  <p>Benefits:</p>  People can’t rely on a single actor to do wash consume for everyone; instead they need to do it themselves. This catalyzes more engagement from more&nbsp;people.  More robust RF, because it’s specific to each asset: generalizing on the previous point, it likely bounds other undesirable behaviors that we haven’t yet identified  Conceptually simpler implementation, side-by-side with 125%&nbsp;bounding   3.2 Reward on DCV&nbsp;rank <p>DF9 modified the RF such that it first sent rewards to each dataset pro-rata to its DCV, then for a given dataset it sent rewards to stakers based on their stake (veOCEAN allocated to the dataset).</p><p>The challenge was: 1–3 datasets could swamp the DCV, and readily get &gt;99% of active rewards. This is a lost opportunity to incentivize others to publish their datasets and get DCV on&nbsp;those.</p><p>We can address this issue as follows: rather than send OCEAN to datasets pro-rata on the the DCV value itself, send based on the dataset’s DCV rank. The dataset with highest DCV (rank 1) gets the most; then second-highest (rank 2) gets the second-most; etc. This will spread rewards to more data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This begs a question: what % of rewards should go to rank 1, to rank 2, etc?There are many options here. We approached this question in the following fashion. First, we implemented a prototype. Second, we parameterized the problem according to two variables:</p>  max_n_rank_assets: how many assets get nonzero rewards. E.g. 20, 50, or&nbsp;100  rank_scale_op: scale rank linearly (LIN), logarithmically (LOG),&nbsp;etc.  <p>Then we performed a study to explore the effect of these variables.</p><p>The images below explore the effect of max_n_rank_assets, when LIN scaling. As an example, on the left, assets with rank &gt; 100 do not get any rewards. (Assets with DCV = 0 never get rewards, of&nbsp;course.)</p>Effect of max_n_rank_assets = 10 (left), 50 (middle), and 20 (right). Scaling =&nbsp;LIN.<p>The images below explore the effect of scaling (LIN vs SQRT vs LOG), for is when max_n_rank_assets = 100. Going from LIN to SQRT, the dropoff after the top-ranked asset is sharper. Going to LOG, it’s sharper yet. In LIN, the top-ranked asset gets 2% of OCEAN reward; in SQRT it’s about 2.7%; in LOG it’s about&nbsp;4.8%.</p>Effect of scaling: LIN, SQRT, and LOG. max_n_rank_assets =&nbsp;100<p>The full study is in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zZdWfywruMPt6r7vfl0nQD8Fgj4wkfuMslZcWJmy3GE/edit?usp=sharing">these&nbsp;slides</a>.</p><p>Using the study as a guide, we chose these final parameters: scaling = LOG, and max_n_rank_assets =&nbsp;100.</p> Conclusion <p>DF22 has completed.

				  Hyperledger Aries Bifold is a project focused on building decentralized identity wallets for the purposes of receiving, holding, and presenting verifiable credentials. While there are other exciting use cases for the technology down the road, the immediate goal is to provide open-source tools and wallets for the community.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Ebert</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Aries Bifold Users Group recently hosted its first ever summit to discuss technical priorities for the coming year. The most pressing issues were architectural — how to easily contribute and pull changes in from the project and how to better facilitate customization for individual solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the other important issues raised over the two-day summit included: What does the Bifold community want out of the next Aries interop profile – essentially, what technologies does the community want to be standardized for interoperability? A related question was “where does overlay capture architecture (OCA) fit into the interoperability profile?” This conversation led to several good ideas and is being continued in the Bifold Working Group bi-weekly meetings.</p>
<p>Other questions became action items for additional research, specifically around certain tools and integrations that the group would like to accomplish for the project. One such action item is in regard to Storybook — a tool for UI design and iteration, another one was Expo — a tool used to simplify the development process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important outcome from the summit is that the project will move toward a focus on a modular, component-based architecture. The goal is to provide building blocks for creating digital wallets, rather than a full application that people can adapt to their purposes. This will provide more flexibility to the end developer trying to build using the software that already has their own requirements and use-cases they need to meet.</p>
<p>What’s next?</p>
<p>The group will also gradually experiment with implementing this new architecture: the consensus was that we don’t want a full refactor but rather a slower inclusion of more features over time. The next steps are getting some of the basics in place — for example, migrating to using Yarn instead of Node Package Manager (NPM) for package management, and setting up new standards for project configuration and repo management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is certainly plenty still to be done but I think that you could comfortably call the first Hyperledger Aries Bifold summit a success. There was a great turn out from the community, the important conversations for moving the technology forward happened, and now we have a clear development direction for the group and action items to tackle in 2023.</p>

<p>We recommend standardizing on Chrome as your internal browser.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>By standardizing on one browser, IT administrators can more easily deploy and manage security policies, updates, and troubleshoot issues. This can save time and resources for IT staff. It can help to improve security by reducing the attack surface and enabling IT to focus on securing one browser instead of multiple. Also, IT staff can be more familiar with the security features, vulnerabilities and best practices of that browser.</p>

<p>From the compliance perspective, some industries may have regulations or compliance standards that specify which browser must be used, standardizing on one browser can help organizations to meet these requirements. And finally, standardizing on one browser can help to reduce costs associated with purchasing and maintaining multiple browsers.</p>

<p>Guidance </p>
<p>It can be difficult to get employees to sign in to Chrome with their enterprise accounts in order to apply settings. We recommend first <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9301891?hl=en">,deploying an enrollment token</a> to your managed devices, which will apply Chrome settings to them regardless of whether a user has been signed in. </p>

<p>Once some form of browser management in place, head into Devices &gt; Chrome &gt; Settings &gt; Users &amp; Browsers and set your security baselines. If you’re not sure where to begin, start by taking a look at the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_chrome">,CIS Benchmaks for Chrome</a>. Any major changes should first be applied to an OU of testers (such the IT team) and then expanded out from there.</p>

<p>Enabling biometrics with FIDO can help create more security for your logins and reduces the risk of login attacks from succeeding.</p>
<p>What is <a>FIDO biometrics</a>? FIDO biometrics are a way to authenticate a user via their face, fingers, or voice; this lends itself to a user having a passwordless experience with their login.</p>
 What Are FIDO <a>Passwordless</a> Standards? 
<p>One of the more significant cybersecurity threats today is the inherent weakness of passwords. In the earliest days of computing, having a simple username and password or PIN combinations proved suitable for security.</p>
<p>In modern cybersecurity and authentication, however, the “always on” nature of the Internet and the proliferation of cloud-based apps and mobile devices have shown us that password authentication is weak against several common attacks like phishing or other social engineering approaches.</p>
<p>There has been a massive shift in authentication from common password systems towards <a>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> and passwordless solutions. But, as with many innovations, this move introduced several new issues, namely the fragmentation of the implementation and maintenance of these standards.</p>
<p>The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance was formed to address two key issues related to strong authentication and adoption:</p>
 
 Passwordless Authentication: The stated mission of the FIDO alliance is to reduce our reliance on passwords by shifting technology toward passwordless systems. 
 Interoperability: While passwordless authentication is a step towards strong authentication, it won’t provide much benefit if it isn’t used. Therefore, FIDO promotes a shared and open industry standard for adopting passwordless authentication. 
 
<p>To provide the required interoperability sufficient for an industry standard, FIDO developed several specifications on their own and in conjunction with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):</p>
 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-uaf-v1.1-id-20170202/fido-uaf-overview-v1.1-id-20170202.html">Universal Authentication Framework (UAF):</a> This is the passwordless standard for FIDO. UAF architecture provides a framework through which users can authenticate themselves, without a password, through the exchange of asymmetric encrypted key pairs between a FIDO server and a client application or device with the user (most commonly a phone or tablet). 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html">Universal 2nd Factor (U2F):</a> U2F is a narrower authentication implementation that allows developers to include a second (or more) factor for authentication. U2F allows MFA over UAF passwordless verification, password systems, or USB verification devices. 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>: The <a>FIDO2 project</a> results from the FIDO Alliance’s work with the W3C. It combines the Web Authentication API, or WebAuthn (a standardized, <a>secure authentication</a> interface for web applications using public-key cryptography) and the Client to Authenticator Protocol, or CTAP2 (a protocol that allows cryptographic authenticators like USB keys or smartphones with other devices). 
 
<p>While this combination of technologies might overlap, they all serve the primary function of bringing secure, passwordless security to hardware devices and web applications.</p>
 What Are FIDO-Certified Biometrics? 
<p>Simply put, FIDO biometrics are just FIDO-certified biometric devices and technologies that can function on top of FIDO authentication. These biometrics devices are built to conform to FIDO (thus, open) standards to provide strong authentication security that can complement several kinds of identity verification and management requirements.</p>
<p>The benefit of FIDO, and this FIDO biometrics, are that they are open and certified by the Alliance, meaning that they will operate under common standards and share interoperability with other FIDO protocols.</p>
<p>Some of the FIDO-certified types of biometrics include:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/voice-authentication/">Voice</a> 
 Facial Recognition 
 <a>Iris Scans</a> 
 
 Biometric Component Certification Program 
<p>To ensure the interoperability of the FIDO biometric component technology, the FIDO Alliance uses a certification process that’s independent of its other programs. This means that the creators of biometric components can apply for FIDO certification for that component without having a fully-functional, FIDO-certified authentication application or platform.</p>
<p>There are, however, rules for component integration–that is, if a biometric component is certified, there are still essential rules around how other authentication platforms can integrate that component if they seek FIDO certification.</p>
<p>Additionally, these certification requirements will depend on the type of FIDO certification. Authenticators seeking certification at FIDO levels 1 or 2 only have the option, not the requirement, to integrate biometrics. Levels 3 or higher, however, require certified biometrics.</p>
<p>In either case, FIDO provides a concrete process by which biometrics components are certified:</p>
 
 Application: Developers seeking certification must apply for a FIDO Alliance account to access the Biometric Dashboard. This Dashboard allows them to navigate the certification process, including initiating their application. 
 
<p>The FIDO Alliance <a>biometric</a> component certification secretariat will review this application, accept it, reject it, or ask for further documentation.</p>
 
 Biometric Testing: The developer submits the component to a FIDO-accredited laboratory for testing. The laboratory will combine online and offline testing with live subjects. The laboratory will also provide an Allowed Integration Document that outlines the changes necessary for authenticators to integrate the biometric component properly. 
 Laboratory Reports: Once the testing is complete, the laboratory will provide a laboratory report to the developer and to the certification secretariat, including the Allowed Integration Document. 
 Certification Requests: After the report is approved, the developer completes a certification request. This step also calls for the developer to provide metadata that describes the component. This metadata must include the Biometric Certification level, the Self-Attested False Accept Rate, and the Self-Attested False Reject Rate. 
 Certification Issuance: If the FIDO Alliance approves the certification, then the certificate is issued to the developer. The developer may submit their metadata to the FIDO Metadata Service. They will also pay their certification fee ($10,000 for members and $13,000 for non-members). 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Moving to FIDO Biometrics? 
 
 Standardized Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication is a critical step in identity and access security. FIDO provides a robust and maintained way to implement passwordless authentication without having to lock into a single vendor or service provider. 
 Flexible Hardware-Based Authentication: A strength of FIDO standards is that it supports hardware-based token authentication, including using USB keys, keycard authentication, and hardware tokens. 
 
<p>With FIDO biometrics, you’ll also get the benefits of stronger security using physical traits (for example, including a fingerprint scan in a USB security key or leveraging FIDO-compliant facial recognition in a Windows laptop.</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Biometrics, hardware-based authentication, and MFA are all components of most regulatory frameworks. 
 
<p>Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, governs almost every federal and defense cybersecurity standard and is a member of the FIDO Alliance. Working with FIDO-compliant technology will go a long way to aligning your infrastructure with security standards.</p>
 
 Interoperability: FIDO biometrics won’t require you to lock in with a single provider or vendor. Additionally, the FIDO Metadata Service provides an extensive directory of compliant technology so you can trust any component or solution you adopt.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Erick Pinos and I’m the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology. I grew up in New Jersey. I’m half Costa Rican and half Ecuadorian.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied Computer Science and Business Management at MIT. At the moment, my hobbies are centred around virtual reality. I love to play with VR and try out new experiences involving games, 360º videos, VR-guided meditation, and more. I also love to cook, and I really enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and recipes to see how each affects the flavours and textures of what I’m making. It’s a fun application of chemistry and a good way to save money and eat healthier at the same&nbsp;time.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>On a day-to-day basis, I scout new leads for potential Ontology partners, whether it be a dApp for the Ontology EVM, or an integration partner for one of Ontology’s projects. There are a wide range of projects where we’re constantly seeking out new integration partners to strengthen Ontology’s offerings and use cases. These projects include ONTO Wallet, Ivy Market, Wing Finance, and Orange Protocol. I have regular calls across all time zones with various internal working groups and potential leads. So, I’m kept quite&nbsp;busy!</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I think Ontology’s focus on decentralized identity and data makes it stand out. It was one of the first blockchains to have a working implementation of decentralized identity, complete with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials that fit the W3C standard. That, coupled with Ontology’s extremely fast turnaround time for product deployments and updates, makes it a strong contender in the blockchain space.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The most exciting part is seeing the many new Web3 projects that are popping up all over the space tackling various different problems. I like that working in outreach and lead generation gives me the opportunity to talk to various different founders and start-ups and to constantly be learning about the cutting edge of Web3, Metaverse, DeFi, DeSci, DAOs, and&nbsp;more.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The most important moment for my career so far was taking the time to really understand Ethereum in 2016. Despite being involved in Bitcoin since 2014, my ideas in the space were limited to scalability infrastructure or payment systems for Bitcoin. After truly understanding how smart contracts worked, however, my mind was opened to all the possibilities of financial and non-financial systems that could be fully run on a blockchain.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited to see how the Web3 space will unfold, given that most agree that technological progress occurs during a bear market. I’ve been a huge fan of the metaverse and I would like to continue to have an active role in helping more adoption&nbsp;occur.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I see further developments in the decentralized identity and data space, led mainly by DAOs that have a growing user base and a growing need to properly manage and safekeep the identity and data being generated by their users via various day-to-day activities. I can see Ontology being a leader in this space, given its longstanding focus on decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-americas-ecosystem-lead-erick-pinos-7928a9fe780">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick Pinos</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tokeny’s 2023 Product Roadmap: Scaling RWA tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We hope you are well. For the first edition of our Product Focus newsletter in 2023, we would like to share our main product development priorities for this year. Our focus is on four key areas: scalability, connectivity, security, and composability.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability empowers asset owners to efficiently tokenize and manage real world assets (RWAs) and securities,&nbsp;reducing costs and improving accessibility. Our self-service SaaS platform already allows our customers to start tokenization without any tech support. This year, we are taking it a step further by enabling issuers to manage advanced settings directly via the Servicing platform. We are also enhancing the UX and adding multiple new features, which will lower operational costs and increase investor access to digital securities.</p>
<p>For example, we are working on several features to enable large-scale operations for open-ended funds, such as REITs and UCITs. By simplifying blockchain tools for traditional investors and offering fractionalized assets at affordable prices, tokenized asset issuers can boost the accessibility of assets with automated workflows.</p>
<p>Connectivity ensures that tokenized assets are interoperable with the necessary service providers and market solutions to enrich data and facilitate liquidity.&nbsp;Our solutions use the token standard ERC3643. As it is now widely adopted, the number of ecosystem players is rising. Our role is to ensure that our customers can easily connect to any service provider, for example, valuation agents, centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, as well as DeFi protocols to not only improve liquidity but also to&nbsp;open up new revenue streams&nbsp;(e.g. DeFi services, Billboard ads, etc.).</p>
<p>Security is a top priority to keep data and assets safe from potential vulnerabilities.&nbsp;To continue protecting our customers from any form of technical risks and data breaches, we are taking a multi-pronged approach by conducting more thorough security tests and audits, obtaining certifications such as SOC2, and improving extra measures such as 2FA authentication. In addition, our solutions will be compatible with the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2iuCRRAaZEi4QzWcpx_W7qnzk7wF094pPnPbtN1uzGGqUTR4sONNCS8V9oKq7NefcrdJc">upgradable ERC3643 V4</a>&nbsp;to ensure that issuers always have full control over their assets as it provides the capability to fix any vulnerabilities that may arise.</p>
<p>Composability guarantees that issuers’ tokenized assets will never be blocked on one single blockchain network, providing a future-proof tokenization approach.&nbsp;Thanks to the portability of ERC3643, tokenized assets can switch to any EVM blockchain. Currently, our solution is already multi-chain, supporting Ethereum and Polygon. This year, we plan to integrate with more EVM blockchains based on market demand. We’ll also provide services to bridge assets from private networks to EVM public blockchains as institutions transition from private networks to public ones.</p>
<p>Our outlook for the coming year is exciting, and we look forward to continuing to receive your support as we strive to improve our products in order to assist you in achieving your tokenization goals.</p>

<p>As technology evolves, regulations in various industries also need to do the same. Although Europe is regarded as a “single state” in relation to its economic significance and is governed by the EU, individual countries are still responsible for passing their own laws. This is especially true within the gambling industry since no regulation or legislation standardizes betting throughout the continent. And the same goes for the United Kingdom. Though no longer part of the EU, the gambling market in the UK is still strongly connected to the rest of the EU gambling landscape.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/09/2459937/0/en/Global-Gambling-Market-to-Reach-876-Billion-by-2026.html">global gambling market is estimated to reach roughly $876 billion by 2026, evolving at a CAGR of 3.6%</a> over the assessment period. The <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/10/81248/europe-online-gambling-market-report-2020-2025-featuring-major-players-bet365-888-holdings-gvc-holdings-kindred-group-william-hill-and-betsson/">European online gambling market is expected to grow by 9.20% by 2025</a>, fueled mainly by software and hardware innovations and the rising popularity of gambling. As such, the gambling industry in Europe shows no sign of slowing down. Still, with scams, gambling addiction, money laundering cases, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, and other pressing issues, how is gambling regulated across the European Union? What do online gaming companies need to be aware of?</p>



<p>Regarding compliance and regulations, it is crucial to note that they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">vary throughout Europe</a>. That said, KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are standard regardless.</p>



 A well-regulated market. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/european-gaming-and-betting-association-egba/">European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA)</a> was formed to keep the casino industry under control. Their main objective was to promote a sustainable iGaming sector in Europe to help players enjoy a safe and fun experience inside a well-regulated market.</p>



<p>Based in Brussels, the association has worked to shape gambling regulations in the region. Online gaming companies associated with EGBA abide by a large set of industry standards designed to complement the numerous licensing guidelines they already adhere to in European nations.</p>



<p>Such European industry standards incorporate Responsible Remote Gambling Measures introduced by the European Committee for standardization and are executed to achieve the below objectives:</p>



  Ensuring the safety of vulnerable gamers  The prevention of underage gambling via age verification  Countering criminal and fraudulent behavior  Safeguarding customer privacy and the protection of private information  Accurate and prompt payments for customers  Responsible and truthful marketing through advertising regulations  Fair and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gaming</a>  The prevention of money laundering  Ensuring a safe, secure, and reliable operating environment  Dedication to customer support and satisfaction  



<p>A growing number of European Union countries have established licensing systems allowing more than one operator to provide services on the market. Under EU law, no system is favored over another.</p>



<p>Gambling regulation in European Union countries involves diverse regulatory frameworks. In several judgments, the Court of Justice of the European Union has legitimized the compliance of national regulatory systems with European Union Law.</p>



<p>The Commission promotes the efforts of EU nations to upgrade their national online gambling legal systems, particularly in administrative cooperation among gambling regulatory authorities. It also offers support to protect gamblers and vulnerable individuals, including minors.</p>



 







 



 Regulations by EU country. 



<p>Each European country essentially shapes its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">gambling regulations</a>. Below are the regulations in some of the most prominent countries in that region.</p>



 France 



<p>Numerous forms of gambling are legal in France, and three central bodies regulate them. The Francaise de Jeux handles betting games and lotteries, the Pari Mutuel Urbain deals with horse racing, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/arjel/">ARJEL</a> is associated with online gambling.</p>



<p>ARJEL also issues licenses for horse racing betting and forms of gambling that use decks of cards, i.e., poker. It also enforces online gambling regulations. The regulation makes it mandatory for licensees to verify players’ identity, address, age, bank information, and other data.</p>



<p>Technological solutions to verify players’ identities, such as AI applications like VideoIdent, are permitted within the requirements. The adoption of PACTE in April 2019 safeguards minors by fining online gambling companies offering free gambling.</p>



 United Kingdom 



<p>Though no longer part of the EU, the UK Gambling market is still very much connected to the rest of Europe. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> regulates gambling activity in the region, offering some of Europe’s most stringent gambling regulations. Gamblers in the UK <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49731701">spend 14.5 billion GBP</a> annually, and this number is expected to grow. Based on such findings, the body added a limit to the amount gamblers can place on fixed bets in betting shops. Betting shops in the UK can typically be found in high streets up and down the country, and before these limits were introduced, players could place up to 100 GBP per bet. Currently, players can only wager up to 2 GBP. This resulted in great losses for betting shops, and William Hill had to close over 100 of its betting shops showing how much this decision has changed the betting landscape.</p>



<p>Operators must also verify a customer’s age before allowing them to deposit funds into a gambling account. Regulators encourage operators to use artificially intelligent applications such as AutoIdent to identify gamblers. Non-compliant behavior, such as illegal advertisements, failure to identify age, etc., can lead to severe financial consequences for online gaming companies.</p>



<p>The UKGC may also revoke gambling licenses if the Commission feels that the online <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a> company is not abiding by the rules or mistreating customers.</p>



<p>Originally set to release in 2019, the UK Gambling Act white paper is a set of rules put forward by the UK government for the protection of online gamblers. <a href="https://www.translationroyale.com/why-uk-gambling-white-paper-is-delayed-for-approval-again/">Delayed for the fourth time</a>, the white paper also aims to put the UK Gambling Commission under scrutiny to ensure it has sufficient investigation sanctioning powers, and whatnot.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">Online Gambling regulations in the UK – an overview</a></p>



 Germany 



<p>The legal framework governing online gaming is referred to as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Interstate Treaty for Gambling (ISTG) or Glücksspielstaatsvertrag, GlüStV</a>, introduced in 2012. Germany is known to have some of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">most complex gambling regulations</a> in Europe. The nation has also made numerous changes in the last few years. Recently, the country banned all online gaming platforms save for those offering horse racing betting. EGBA attempted to dispute this decision since it was not adhering to EU rules.</p>



<p>In 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the country’s industry was monopolized and had to be made liberal. When the ISTG was introduced, it allowed private companies to offer gambling services.</p>



<p>The new Interstate Treaty on Gambling 2021 <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/germany#:~:text=The%20Interstate%20Treaty%202021%20reintroduced,be%20impracticable%20or%20not%20promising.">came into force in July 2021</a>. It distinguished between online casino games and virtual slots. It offers each state the choice to impose a state monopoly or issue a limited number of licenses to private gambling companies.</p>



<p>Sports betting operators must demonstrate that they are willing to offer safe services <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">in line with the AML measures</a>. Operators are required to authorize all players and ensure all minors are excluded. Video verification lets online gaming companies enter the market in line with online gaming regulations.</p>



 Switzerland 



<p>Switzerland has two levels of gambling laws, i.e., federal and cantonal. The country offers casino licenses via the Swiss Federal Casino Commission (ESBK). The Swiss Lottery and Betting Board handles sports betting, lotteries, and fixed odds.</p>



<p>To urge operators to pay their fair share of taxes, the <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/switzerland">Money Gaming Act</a> was passed in 2018 to block the IP addresses of offshore gambling sites. The law became effective in January 2019, and all unlicensed gambling was banned by the end of June.</p>



 Austria 



<p>Licenses for online gaming companies are issued by individual states in Austria, with no regulations at a federal level. Regulations only cover sports events in most states, but some jurisdictions also allow bets on other types of events. Live betting is prohibited in some states.</p>



<p>Technically speaking, state laws specifically regulate land-based betting. That said, licensed operators can also provide their services online.</p>



<p>The Austrian Ministry of Finance recently announced plans to reform the gambling regulatory framework. The proposal also suggests raising taxes on gambling-based revenues and establishing an authority tasked explicitly with enforcing regulations and providing licenses.</p>

 Malta 



<p>Malta became the first European Union Member State to offer services to gaming companies and is now the most prominent remote gambling jurisdiction internationally. Based on that, a broad range of online gaming services and facilities are available in the industry.</p>



<p>Founded in 2001, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority</a> was set up to regulate various forms of gambling in the nation. This includes land-based activities like casinos and their online counterparts, including B2B and B2C services.</p>



 Isle of Man 



<p>The Isle of Man Government thoroughly promotes the development of gambling on the island, whether land-based or online. The region is committed to offering a robust regulatory environment backed by a stable government and various attractive business advantages.</p>



<p>In terms of regulation, the island’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gsc-isle-of-man-supervision-authority/">Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC)</a> is an independent gambling operation regulator established in 1962. Aside from licensing and regulating land-based gambling operations, the Commission also regulates all iGambling activities.</p>



 Gibraltar 



<p>Gibraltar is among the world’s leading jurisdictions in the iGaming industry and an internationally recognized innovator in the field. Gibraltar offers all kinds of casino games, slots, poker, machine games, and most other number games without limits. That said, online operators require separate licenses for betting activity.</p>



<p>Two entities, i.e., <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gibraltar-regulatory-authority-gra/">GRA (Gibraltar Regulatory Authority)</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gibraltar-betting-gaming-association-gbga/">GBGA (Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association)</a>, work collaboratively to ensure the region’s gaming laws.</p>



<p>The GRA issues licenses, ensuring operators comply with established regulations and monitoring possible risks threatening Gibraltar’s iGaming industry. On the other hand, GBGA assumes the role of an advisory body, supporting the region’s licensed gaming companies while certifying they operate responsibly.</p>



 Spain 



<p>Gambling has been legal in Spain since 1276. That said, gambling has been banned and re-legalized numerous times since 1276. It has only been continuously legal since 1977, with the exception of the lottery, which has been continuously legal since 1763.</p>



<p>Currently, the definitive piece of gambling legislation is the Spanish Gaming Act 2011 (i.e., Ley 13/2011, de 27 de mayo, de regulación del Juego) and its amendments.</p>



<p>Gambling in Spain is regulated at the national level and by the 17 self-governing regions, wrestling in a complex legal landscape. However, certain forms of gambling, such as American and French roulette, blackjack, craps, etc., are legal in all 17 regions.</p>



 Cyprus 



<p>Most forms of gambling in Cyprus were illegal until 2012. However, in 2012, the Republic made online and land-based sports betting legal. The NBA (National Betting Authority), established under Betting Law 2012, examines applications, and licenses, audits and supervises betting shops and online gambling operators.</p>



<p>The Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission, also known as the Cyprus Gaming Commission, was set up in 2015 under the Cyprus Casino Control Law.</p>



<p>As a result, the 2015 Cyprus Casino Control Law allowed a license to be offered to a sole operator to establish an Integrated Casino Resort along with four “satellite” casinos. The Integrated Resort is Cyprus’ most prominent tourism development.</p>



 Alderney 



<p>Part of the British Channel Islands, but a self-governing dependency of the British Crown, the States of Alderney have their own separate commission that oversees gambling on the island. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alderney-gambling-control-commission/">Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC)</a> is the official regulatory authority for gambling in Alderney. It reviews gaming licenses and certification applications and ensures all laws are observed.</p>

 Shyft Dev Deep Dive Monthly — Jan.&nbsp;2023 <p>Welcome to Shyft Dev Deep Dive, our monthly developer update, where we share the new Shyft-wide features and technical changes.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope finished 2022 on a strong note with the introduction of<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/change-log.html#2022-nov-08-v3-0-0-major-release-pr-70-address-proofs"> Address Proofs</a> that enable VASPs (read: crypto businesses) to prove ownership or control of an address before personal identification information (PII) is shared between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>Address Proofs sets Shyft apart from its peers as Shyft Veriscope now solves for both address attribution (i.e., who owns a hosted wallet address without having to ask end-users) and secure, peer-to-peer data transmission between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>In the last month, several additional enhancements have been added to Veriscope. These are detailed below. As always, if you have questions or would like a demo, please reach out to us at veriscope@shyft.network. We look forward to hearing from&nbsp;you!</p> Veriscope Releases (Jan-2023)  Node Synchronization Upgrade <p>Veriscope Relay Node has now been upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.15.0">Nethermind v1.15.0</a>, which has made data synchronization with the Shyft Blockchain must&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Event transactions, too, take considerably less time to complete, as the time it takes to load and save them to Veriscope has decreased significantly. Events refer to the events emitted from transactions on the Shyft blockchain.</p><p>Earlier, the above-mentioned processes used to take 12+ hours to complete, but the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-30-v3-5-0-pr-78-node-synchronization-upgrade">Node Synchronization Upgrade</a> has decreased it to 4–6 hours. <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/install/node-synchronization.html">Click here</a> for more details on Node Synchronization.</p> Veriscope UI&nbsp;Update <p>With the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-20-v3-4-0-pr-77-veriscope-ui-update">new Veriscope UI Update</a>, Discovery Layer Key-value pairs are now sorted A-Z. A new settings page has also been introduced to provide easy access to user settings (email, password, 2FA), webhook URL, and API&nbsp;tokens.</p> IVMS Update <p>Keeping in line with the <a href="http://34.64.107.172/~vasp/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IVMS101-interVASP-data-model-standard-issue-1-FINAL.pdf">IVMS specification</a>, we added additional IVMS fields to Shyft Veriscope. With this, IVMS values saved to Veriscope are now shown in the IVMS form input&nbsp;fields.</p><p>VASPs can also export their IVMS data as either Originating VASP or Beneficiary VASP in the required IVMS format. <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/learn/ivms101.html">Click here</a> for more details on&nbsp;it.</p> Blockchain Analytics Update <p>In January, we made <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-20-v3-2-0-pr-75-blockchain-analytics-update">two blockchain analytics updates</a>. The API endpoint for Merkle Science has been corrected, and the API endpoints for each Blockchain Analytics service provider are now shown in the Veriscope user interface, next to where the VASPs can input their API&nbsp;keys.</p> Conclusion <p>Starting the year with significant improvements to Shyft Veriscope, the Shyft Product &amp; Engineering team proved again that what matters the most is user experience. We believe user experience must remain frictionless even while complying with stringent regulations. And the Shyft team is committed to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Stay tuned for next month’s update, where we will share more exciting developments and&nbsp;updates.</p><p>…</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Restricting unnecessary data sharing is key to any information security strategy. </p>

<p>Why? </p>
<p>It helps to minimize the potential impact of a data breach or unauthorized access to sensitive information. The less data that is shared, the fewer opportunities there are for hackers or other malicious actors to access and exploit that data. When you restrict unnecessary data sharing, you can also reduce the risk of data breaches caused by human error, such as an employee accidentally sending sensitive information to the wrong person. </p>

<p>Additionally, sharing data with third-party companies and service providers can also pose a security risk, as you are entrusting the security of that data to another organization. Restricting unnecessary data sharing helps you to be more selective about which companies you share data with and to ensure that they have adequate security measures in place to protect that data.</p>

<p>Finally, restricting unnecessary data sharing is also important from a compliance perspective as it helps organizations to comply with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA that require organizations to protect personal data of individuals and to limit the sharing of sensitive information.</p>

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>Before making any changes, we recommend using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM/wiki">,GAM</a> or other reporting tool with deep hooks into Google Workspace to better understand how many people are utilizing these features and what the impact of your changes will be. </p>

<p>Gmail</p> 
   Disable settings such as Automatic Email Forwarding under End User Access to ensure that users cannot automatically send all emails outside of the organization or to unauthorized services. 
   Review and adjust Safety settings. We’d recommend settings all of them to ON, with the exception of “Protect against unauthenticated emails” to avoid legitimate flagging emails from misconfigured domains as spam. 
 
<p>Calendar</p> 
   Prevent users from sharing anything other than free/busy information with external sharing for primary and secondary calendars. Depending on the organization, consider also disabling sharing for all information internally as well, or apply a rule to disable it for a group/OU of users with privileged calendar information, such as executives or your People team. 
 
<p>Drive</p>
<p>With Drive, you will need to think through how your employees are utilizing Google Drive to interface with external parties, like customers. In some cases companies may be presenting a Google Drive file as a public link to publish content online. Remember that settings can be applied to groups or OUs to more granularly scope permissions. The settings below represent an ideal:</p>
 
   Disable the ability for users to make files and published web content visible to anyone with a link 
   Only users in your domain can share content outside of your org 
   General access default is set to be private to the owner by default

<p>SSX provides developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. As we continue working on SSX, we want to show developers how they can quickly get started with easy-to-run example projects. Gating access to content based on a user's NFTs or tokens is a core-building block for building rich dapp experiences. For example:</p>  If a DAO wanted to limit content based on users with a certain amount of token-based voting power.  If an NFT PFP project wanted to offer exclusive content to token holders.  If a project wanted to enable early access to an application based on holding an NFT.  <p>The following example will show developers how to build and enable token-gated access in their dapp with SSX based on holding an ENS name. Additionally, it will show a developer how to also use SSX with <a href="https://www.rainbowkit.com/">RainbowKit</a> and <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a>.</p><p>You can also follow along in our documentation <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/appendix/build-a-token-gated-dapp">here</a>.</p> Run our Completed Example <p>Want to jump in and see a token-gated example in action quickly? Use the following commands to download the SSX repository: &nbsp;</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/spruceid/ssx
cd ssx
</code>   Ensure SSX packages are installed from the <code>ssx</code> directory by running <code>yarn install</code>  Navigate to the example directory (<code>cd examples/ssx-test-token-gated</code>)  Add an <a href="https://dashboard.alchemy.com/">Alchemy API</a> key to <code>.env</code>  In your terminal, run:   <code>yarn install
yarn start</code> <p>Once run, you will be presented with a dapp using RainbowKit that prompts you to connect your wallet and Sign-In with Ethereum.</p><p>After signing in, if the wallet used owns an ENS name, you will be presented with the gated content. If not, the dapp should display "No ENS name found"</p><p>The following guide will teach you how to create a token-gated dapp enabled by SSX from our <code>create-ssx-dapp</code> package.</p> Create the Dapp Yourself <p>The initial setup will be done using SSX's dapp creation tool. Type the following in your terminal to get started:</p> <code>yarn create @spruceid/ssx-dapp token-gated-example</code> <p>For this example, we will be using the following explicit options in the setup tool:</p>  Typescript  Leave the other options empty when prompted  The <code>create-ssx-dapp</code> tool Set up the Alchemy SDK and RainbowKit <p>The Alchemy SDK dependency can be installed with the following command in the directory of your dapp:</p> <code>yarn add alchemy-sdk</code> <p><a href="https://www.rainbowkit.com/">RainbowKit</a> is also used in this example. Add the required dependency via the following command:</p> <code>yarn add @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi</code> <p>Additionally, you will also need to add the <code>ssx-react</code> dependency. To add it, use this command:</p> <code>yarn add @spruceid/ssx-react</code> <p>Head to <code>src/index.tsx</code> and add the following to plug things in initially:</p> <code>/** src/index.tsx **/

import { RainbowKitProvider, getDefaultWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import {
  goerli,
  mainnet,
  configureChains,
  createClient,

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'SSX ENS Token Gated Example',
  chains,

In this case, we'll be gating based on an ENS name. </p><p>To accomplish this, tokens owned by the address must be fetched and filtered for ENS names. ENS names are under the contract <code>0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85</code>, so a variable with that value needs to be added. </p><p>Add the following after the <code>import</code> statements:</p> <code>/* src/App.tsx */
const ENS_CONTRACT = '0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85';</code> <p>Including the modifications above to <code>src/App.tsx</code>, we can now add the additional logic needed to fetch tokens:</p> <code>/*....*/

<p>Company’s successful 100+ day early-stage launch creates new commercial opportunities for expansion of verifiable credentials, digital goods and services and the Metaverse.</p>



<p>February 1, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T51) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the continued expansion of use of the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Meta Park Pass, providing Proof of Humanity, allowing users to remain anonymous, but still verify that they are a real person, through blockchain based verifiable credentials, working to eliminate fraudulent activities, duplicate and fake accounts and bots.&nbsp; Deploying the technology to its controlled subsidiary’s Aftermath Islands Metaverse Play to Earn game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, the Meta Park Pass has been successfully utilized allowing users to sign in with their biometrics, eliminating username and passwords, proving that all users are genuine people, with only 1 account, and supporting the collection over 1 billion gaming resources, resulting in the creation of over 1.2 million Resource Pack NFTs for use in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Users are engaging for upwards of 70 minutes per day on the platform and have collected a variety of in-game resources, that they have then converted to Resource Pack NFTs that will be used, crafted, traded, and consumed in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse as part of platform activities, allowing the NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology to support in-game inventory management.&nbsp; These also include the ability to work, play, learn, earn, entertain, create, and socialize within the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited has generated over $2 million in retail sales since late 2021 and continue to generate sales on a monthly basis.&nbsp; As the Company works to launch its full Metaverse platform, these revenues are recorded, under IFRS guidelines, as deferred revenue, until such time that the Aftermath Islands Metaverse meets further launch requirements.&nbsp; However, the Company has had access to the proceeds for working capital.</p>



<p>In late Q4 2022, the Company also successfully launched its first Aftermath Islands Metaverse servers that provide users with a high-fidelity graphics experience, similar to realistic console gaming, with no download, providing an easy-to-use experience similar to streaming services, on almost any mobile, tablet or computing device.&nbsp; The open platform is available for early engagement at <a href="https://play.aftermathislands.com">play.aftermathislands.com</a>.</p>



<p>The Aftermath Islands Metaverse also seamlessly incorporates the ability for organizations and enterprises to leverage their current websites and eCommerce activities by allowing users to click on an item in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse, creating a new browser tab that display’s the organization’s website, eCommerce programs and social media.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands is one of the first to completely integrate Web2 and Web3 activities in a single click.</p>



<p>As one of the first of its kind, the Liquid Avatar Mobile App can also be used to create a host of other credentials that have been already tested for government level access for travel and age verification.&nbsp; The Company is also designing credentials with uses that include online access, validation and marketing in the Metaverse and throughout the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp; While the Company is ready to deploy to convenience stores and other age restricted programs, current market and economic priorities have caused delays of the rollout of Ontario’s and other jurisdiction’s Digital Identity programs. &nbsp;Liquid Avatar is currently expanding its programs to other online and commercial opportunities that are eager to use verifiable credentials to ensure that their users are real, unique individuals and have only a single account.</p>



<p>David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited commented, “Despite the various market challenges, we have launched and continue to accelerate verifiable credentials. Use of these credentials by Aftermath Islands and its programs continues to reinforce our focus, not only on building a Metaverse with wide appeal, but promoting the positive sentiment that we are seeing from users that have embraced the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and the Meta Park Pass as participants in an ecosystem that insures users are real and that they don’t have to worry about fake or multiple account holders, phishing attempts, bots and other nefarious actors.&nbsp; Our core efforts remain squarely on digital identity, avatars, digital good and services and the Metaverse and we believe that by providing seamless, no download experiences, wide availability on a host of devices and the integration of Web2 with Web3, we will continue to see revenues, engagement, and growth.”</p>



<p>The Company is also continuing to work on its LQID Metaverse Rewards payment card program and is awaiting final network and payment processor approvals.&nbsp; The Liquid Shopz program is currently part of the LQID Rewards program, and the Company is currently reviewing stand alone vendor and affiliate programs for its Metaverse activities and user programs.&nbsp; The Company will provide further updates as they become available.</p>



<p>The Company would also like to express its appreciation to outgoing board member, Mr. Jeff Mesina for his contribution to the Company’s growth and we appreciate the consideration and support he has provided over the last several years.&nbsp; Mr. Mesina has resigned to pursue other endeavours and the Company wishes him every success.</p>



<p>The Company would also like to provide an update on its August 3, 2022, announcement regarding a commitment letter Aftermath Islands Metaverse had received from global investment group LDA Capital.&nbsp; Due to the prolonged decrease in the prices and reduction in market capitalization that several sectors have been experiencing over the last several months, and in conjunction with the evolving regulatory conditions, Aftermath Islands Metaverse has chosen not to actively pursue this opportunity at this time.&nbsp;</p>

   A 13-year quest to save our customers money and improve their security. 

<p>"Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years." This quote, often attributed to Bill Gates, came to mind as I looked back on the last 13 years at ForgeRock. It continues to amaze me how our customer focus first led us to redefine the IAM space, and then to introduce many innovations that have since become universally acknowledged as critical capabilities.</p>

<p>For ForgeRock's birthday, I wanted to take a trip down memory lane with a focus on a specific area that is near and dear to my heart: our orchestration journey (or is it our Journeys journey?).</p>

<p>It all started when some of our earliest customers wanted to provide different login experiences for different types of users. We took inspiration from the Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAMs) and introduced the ability to add Java code to the login flow. We called this capability Chains, and our customers loved it because it allowed them to change login behavior as they desired. However, it required a lot of custom Java coding.</p>

<p>To reduce the customer development time and make orchestration more flexible, we took it to a whole new level with a drag-and-drop designer UI and the ability to branch out in multiple directions based on different conditions. Our engineers called this orchestration engine Trees (branching…Trees, get it?). Even though we named the product Intelligent Authentication and built in many capabilities around context and device data collection, dynamic decisioning, and continuous authentication, many customers still call it Trees. We also started shipping a number of pre-built actions called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/realms/auth-nodes.html">Nodes</a> that make it easy for customers to build orchestration journeys for different needs without coding.</p>

<p>But ForgeRock customers didn't stop there. They decided to use our orchestration engine to not only integrate with their home-grown systems but also with third-party vendors for multi-factor authentication (MFA), user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and identity verification, just to name a few. When we found out that many customers were repeatedly building the same set of integrations, we decided to save them some time and money by delivering integration capabilities to everyone. That's how our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> started more than five years ago. Back then, the notion of having a Marketplace was still new in the IAM space. We did it anyway and today we have the largest ecosystem of integration partners with 200+ integrations available from the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace">ForgeRock Marketplace</a>. This is the reason a leading bank threw away their homegrown orchestration and decided to start leveraging ForgeRock Orchestration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the IAM market evolved and customers started asking for a single platform to provide full identity fabric capabilities along with governance, we delivered <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>. Intelligent Access extended our orchestration engine to simplify user self-service capabilities, such as registration, forgotten password, password reset, and so on. [Have you ever created an account on a site, and it immediately turns around and asks you to enter the just-created login and password again? That's because the site's identity management system that created the account and the access management system that secures the access are not talking to each other properly. I don't like that experience at all. With an integrated platform like ForgeRock, your users don't have to experience that friction.]</p>

<p>A couple of years after we launched our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud service</a>, our customers asked us to add a UEBA engine to it. Since we accumulate many signals as part of the cloud service during authentication, the addition of UEBA made a lot of sense, so we launched our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> service. Even there we made it easy to consume the capabilities delivered by a powerful AI engine with easy-to-use nodes that can be integrated into any orchestration journey with a simple drag-and-drop UI.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have also added many orchestration capabilities based on customer feedback — along with our own security and product best practices — resulting in multiple patents in this area. What I love most about these investments is the sheer number of nodes we now ship with our service, the volume of pre-built journeys that incorporate security and usability best practices, and our improvements to the architecture that have helped many customers save countless hours of development and integration time. We hear from new customers again and again that they chose ForgeRock because of our strong orchestration capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we are not stopping there. Our vision is an orchestration engine that drives all the users' IAM journeys, whether for authentication or for access request approvals and beyond. We're building a future where every action within an IAM platform, from configuration management to application onboarding, will be driven by orchestration. By sticking to our founding principles, built on a persistent focus on our customers' needs, we'll continue to innovate on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>

Image generated by AI using openai.com/dall-e-2<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>There’s a famous psychology experiment where subjects are asked to watch a video of people playing basketball and count the number of times they pass the ball. You can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo">video here</a>. If you haven’t already done it, try it. It’s fun. It only takes a&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The astonishing thing is that a very high proportion of those counting the passes simply don’t notice a gorilla that walks through the game and stands there, right in front of them. Plain as plain can be. They just don’t see it. When asked, many of them even deny it: they are so intent on looking for something else they can’t believe that a gorilla was standing there, right in front of their eyes. This is the phenomenon of selective attention, and it’s extremely powerful.</p><p>In this blog series, we’ve explored many aspects of the economics of personal data, showing how and why personal data stores offer huge opportunities for positive economic transformation. But if this opportunity is so big, why aren’t organisations and governments clamouring for&nbsp;it?</p> A narrative of our&nbsp;times <p>Selective attention is a key reason. One particular narrative has come to dominate the conversation to such a degree that many people simply assume it accounts for the whole picture; counting passes and not seeing the gorilla in front of them. This is the narrative of Big Data and it goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Data is needed to create the insights that drive improved and innovative services. The more data there is to analyse, the better the insights will be, the greater the benefits. Therefore, everything should be done to help organisations amass as much data as they&nbsp;can.”</blockquote><p>There is a small element of truth to this narrative (every effective lie includes a small element of truth to make it seem credible). Like the telescope and microscope before it, data is helping us see the world in ways we never could before. Tackled the right way, this is indeed an opportunity. But most Big Data today falls far short of this. It’s either flawed, unnecessary, irrelevant or downright dangerous — a bandwagon fueled by&nbsp;hype.</p><p>Big Data, we are being told, is a ‘game-changing’ development, revolutionising industries as diverse as marketing and health care and helping to ‘solve humanitarian issues around poverty, health, human rights, education and the environment’. It’s now ’a key factor in how nations, not just companies, compete and prosper’, a ‘foundation for disruptive business models’, ‘transforming processes and altering corporate ecosystems’. It can even predict the future (apparently).</p><p>Little wonder it dominates Government policies such as the UK Government’s National Data Strategy and the EU’s Horizon Europe research programme. But what is the reality behind this&nbsp;hype?</p> Are Big Data insights really transformational? <p>The Big Data bandwagon revolves around two words: ‘insights’ and ‘analytics’, which are widely referred to with close to mystical awe, as if they had magic&nbsp;powers.</p><p>Genuine insights, used for the right purposes, are wonderful. But Big Data has never generated an insight and never will. Why? Because only humans have insights. This is flaw Number&nbsp;One.</p><p>Big Data analytics are done by a computer crunching lots of numbers to surface correlations and patterns. But, in themselves these correlations tell us nothing because statistical correlation can be meaningless and is not the same as causation. While Big Data analytics can alert us to something we hadn’t seen before, only humans can understand the why; what it all&nbsp;means.</p><p>Confusing the two is one of the reasons why there is currently a crisis in medical research. Around 50% of medical research findings cannot be repeated if the experiment is conducted again. Why? Among the many reasons are that doctors (like most data scientists) are not trained in statistics and frequently confuse correlation with causation.</p><p>The trouble with Big Data is that the more data you crunch, the more noise: the more meaningless correlations pop up. Without clear ways of distinguishing between noise and signal, chances are you’ll end up in multiple wild goose&nbsp;chases.</p><p>This assumes that the data used by Big Data is reliable in the first place. But often it isn’t. One of the best kept secrets about most organisations’ large databases is that the quality of their data is often very poor: incomplete, out of date or simply wrong. And most data sets, no matter how large, are biassed in some way. No matter how big they might be, they are still a&nbsp;sample.</p><p>Building genuinely representative samples isn’t something that happens easily or automatically. In fact, one of the biggest barriers to Big Data research is the cost of accessing reliable data. According to the <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/insights/improving-government-data-a-guide-for-senior-leaders/">National Audit Office</a> 60–80% of researchers’ time is spent cleaning and merging data. In a world where each individual was able to aggregate information about themselves into their own personal data store, these costs could be slashed — assuming, that is, that the researchers can make a compelling case for the value and ethics of their research.</p><p>But as it is, much of the data used for Big Data analytics is of questionable quality. GIGO is an ancient IT catchphrase. It stands for Garbage In, Garbage Out. With Big Data the risks of Big Garbage are high, such as Big Data-generated algorithms that build racist and sexist assumptions into how they&nbsp;work.</p> Can the insight be&nbsp;applied? <p>Even when a good signal is identified, it doesn’t mean it’s automatically useful. To be useful, it has to be applied. But Big Data doesn’t help here, because it only deals with statistical data — e.g. probabilities — not specifics.</p><p>If you toss a coin many times you can know with certainty that 50% of the time it will be heads, and 50% of the time tails. But complete, certain knowledge of probabilities doesn’t translate into complete, knowledge of the real world — of what it going to happen next. What’s it going to be? Heads or tails? For the real world, we need ways to deal with different, specific outcomes, not just generalised observations.</p><p>This can wreak havoc when it comes to applying Big Data insights in the real world. Say for example that Big Data analysis tells us that if you do X the probability of Y happening is doubled. Great! But if the probability of Y happening has doubled from 2% to 4%, it still means that 96% of the time it won’t happen. How useful is that when it comes to applying the ‘insight’ in the real&nbsp;world?</p><p>OK. What about a 99.9% probability rather than just 4%? You might think you can rely on a 99.9% probability in a real world application. The German Ministry of the Interior thought so when it installed facial recognition programmes outside big railway stations to identify known terrorists.</p><p>The 99.9% figure meant that 0.1% of observations generated false positives: that declared an individual to be a terrorist when they weren’t. With 12 million people passing through big railway stations every day, the German police were presented with 12,000 people a day wrongly identified by the system as terrorists. Acting on this information would have resulted in a large-scale invasion of civil liberties (hundreds of thousands of people being treated as if they were terrorists when they were not), while wasting all available policing resources hounding them. The programme was quickly (and quietly)&nbsp;dropped.</p><p>Behind this lies another flawed assumptions that keeps Big Data hype afloat: confusion between statistical data about populations — data that deals in probabilities — and the actual data about real, individual people that is needed to actually do something useful. The one does NOT automatically translate into the&nbsp;other.</p><p>Once Big Data is applied to an identifiable individual, it stops being Big Data and becomes deeply personal instead. It requires access to and use of personal data, and a matching, testing and application process to see if the generalised statistical ‘insight’ is relevant to this particular case. For that, you need to access exactly the right data, at the right time, for the use case in hand: you need the personal data logistics capabilities provided by personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Without such a translation process from statistical probabilities to personal circumstances, Big Data insights can only be applied in a blanket manner — in a way that is often irrelevant, if not&nbsp;harmful.</p> Do you need Big Data to get big insights? <p>All this assumes that Big Data is the only or main way to generate useful insights. But this isn’t so. Most of the insights used to inform decisions and resulting actions today don’t come from Big Data. Other simpler, easier, cheaper processes such as traditional research or even mundane activities such as filling in forms provide the surprises — the new information needed to keep decisions in line with a changing world — that most people and organisations need to get stuff&nbsp;done.</p><p>So Big Data isn’t the be all and end all of ‘insight’ that it’s made out to be. Far from it. Viewed across the economy as a whole its contribution is actually marginal.</p> Beware hidden&nbsp;agendas <p>When you listen to Big Data hype however, it’s as though Big Data is a magic bullet that is going to save the world: it comes with a touching but naive faith that, by definition, if something is an ‘insight’ it must be ‘good’ — it will be used to help people rather than harm them or take advantage of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Unfortunately this is not true. Much of the hype about ‘insights’ derives from the activities of Silicon Valley advertising giants like Google and Facebook. But their insights weren’t generated to help people live better, richer lives. They were generated for the purposes of manipulation and control, to get people to do what advertisers wanted them to do. Cambridge Analytica was a business driven by Big Data insights. Its agenda was profit via manipulation and control — for which it needed as many ‘insights’ it could&nbsp;get.</p><p>The sad reality behind Big Data hype is that it is widely used as camouflage to extend surveillance capitalism into new areas, to justify a privacy-invading corporate data landgrab; an excuse for even further concentrations of data power and rewards in the hands of a tiny number of organisations (along with increasing pressure to bypass citizens’ data protection rights).</p><p>Are these corporations suddenly really that interested in data analytics for ‘data for good’? Or is this sudden interest a cover for a much more cynical hidden&nbsp;agenda?</p> Squandered resources, missed opportunities <p>The biggest damage wreaked by Big Data hype lies in a different direction, however. In a classic case of selective attention, countless politicians and policy-makers around the world have drunk the Big Data Kool Aid to sanction and promote vast Big Data programmes that promise the world and cost almost as much — billions of&nbsp;£/$/€.</p><p>In doing so, they failing to notice the gorilla in their midst: the immense opportunities for productivity improvements, service quality, outcome improvements and innovation that lie in the opposite direction of empowering citizens with their own data. The result is missed opportunities on a vast scale, coupled with equally vast misallocation of available resources — a misallocation of resources that deepens the imbalances of power and reward that already blight today’s data-driven economy.</p> Conclusion <p>Don’t get us wrong. We have nothing against Big Data per se. We are all for genuine analytics and insights, if done properly and ethically. But we are also all for seeing gorillas as well as counting passes — for seeing opportunities that are NOT reliant on big data, such as empowering individuals with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s not one versus the other. To really work well, Big Data needs to advance hand in hand with the personal data logistics capabilities offered by personal data stores. Focusing only on Big Data while ignoring personal data logistics — and associated citizen empowerment — is like trying to run with just one leg. Extremely hard work to not get&nbsp;far.</p><p>That, unfortunately, is what we’ve got right now. As long as policy-makers look determinedly in just one direction — only counting the passes — they won’t see the gorilla standing there, right in front of them. It’s time for them to look&nbsp;up.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>Last week was a happy week for us at Holochain. It has been a long time coming — years of almost-but-not-quite-ready, of helping the bravest devs succeed with immature tech, of telling more risk-averse projects to wait just a little longer. And now it’s here — Holochain is finally in beta.</p><p>The general mood among colleagues and friends has varied from “quiet satisfaction”, in one person’s words, to open celebration. This is a big milestone for us and you, folks!</p><p>Of course, there is still lots of work to be done — the core devs are already working hard on the 0.2 beta series, which will bring the ‘immune system’ features that are meant to automate communities’ ability to protect their networks and data from attacks. And of course there are still planned features and the regular boring engineering work of performance tuning and bug discovery. And most of the developer tools haven’t been updated yet, although we’ll see that in the next week or two.</p><p>But this is the first point at which we can say, with confidence, that Holochain is ready for most projects (not just bleeding-edge ones) to start building serious apps on. The APIs will not get any breaking changes for the entirety of the 0.1.x release series, and keep our bootstrap and proxy servers running for six months.</p><p>In the coming weeks we’ll be publishing a series of blog posts, videos, and updates to the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">Developer Portal</a> to help you get started building your first hApp.</p><p>Does this mean that Holochain is now ready for everyone? Not quite. You will be able to build your hApp without fear of refactoring, you’ll be able to get it into your users’ hands, and they’ll be able to use it long-term without fearing data loss on every upgrade. But it’s important to note that, before the immune system and security audits are completed, your hApp should be considered beta-quality and shouldn’t be used in hostile environments.</p> Holochain 0.1.0 release notes <p>Release date: 26 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.2.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.1.0<br>Breaking changes: app API</p><p>This is largely a ceremonial release — you’ll note that we’ve dropped the <code>beta</code> and <code>rc.x</code> from the end of all of our packages. There are only two changes:</p>  Removed (HDI): The unused <code>validation_package</code> callback is no longer supported, and all types related to it have been removed. Given that no hApps in the wild used this callback (to my knowledge), you shouldn’t need to update your integrity zome code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1739">#1739</a>)  Breaking (app API): <code>FetchQueue</code> has been renamed to <code>FetchPool</code>. This shows up in one of the fields of the <code>NetworkInfo</code> API endpoint’s return value. If you don’t know whether you need to know about this, you probably don’t — <code>NetworkInfo</code> is generally only used by conductor orchestrators like the Launcher. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1793">#1793</a>)   Dev tools release notes  JavaScript client 0.11.16: Internal refactor <p>Release date: 25 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release refactors the way the agent’s public key is retrieved; now it gets it from <code>AppInfo</code>.</p> JavaScript client 0.12.0: Version bump <p>Release date: 25 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release simply marks a shift to Holochain Beta. Note: A breaking change to the <code>NetworkInfo</code> app API endpoint, introduced in Holochain 0.1.0, is not yet supported, but will be supported in the next release. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/172">#172</a>) Most hApps don't use this, though, so it should be safe to use this release with Holochain 0.1.0.</p> Tryorama 0.11.0: Version bump <p>Release date: 27 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release bumps the included JavaScript client to 0.12.0.</p> Rust client 0.3.0: Initial support for Holochain 0.1.x <p>Release date: 23 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3</p><p>This release brings the supported Holochain version up to 0.1.0-beta-rc.3, which means the following breaking changes:</p>  All zome calls must be signed.  <code>install_app_bundle</code> is renamed to <code>install_app</code>.  <code>archive_clone_cell</code> is renamed to <code>disable_clone_cell</code>.  <code>restore_archived_clone_cell</code> is renamed to <code>enable_clone_cell</code>.  <code>enable_clone_cell</code> is moved to the app API.  <code>delete_clone_cell</code> can only delete a single disabled clone cell.  <code>app_info</code> returns all cells and DNA modifiers.  <code>request_agent_info</code> is renamed to <code>agent_info</code>.  <p>There are two non-breaking changes:</p>  The admin API call <code>get_dna_definition</code> has been added.  There’s now a utility crate for authorising credentials and signing zome calls.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.3.0">Read the changelog.</a></p> Scaffolding 0.1.3: Support for Holochain 0.1.0 <p>Release date: 31 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0</p><p>This is the first time I’ve included release notes for the scaffolding tool. We’ve <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/time-to-start-testing-your-happs/#the-new-scaffolding-tool-like-rails-but-for-dapps">shared</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/#preview-of-new-cli-scaffolding-tool">about</a> it already, and I will be sharing more about it soon, but for now, just know that it lets both newcomers and experienced hApp devs generate a lot of boilerplate DNA and UI code in a short time. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/releases">release log</a> if you’ve already been using it.</p> Second security audit completed <p>Last week Least Authority <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">published the results</a> of their second security audit of Holochain. The first, which <a href="https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/Least_Authority_Holo_Ltd_Lair_Keystore_Final_Audit_%20Report.pdf">analyzed the Lair keystore</a>, identified only one issue and three further suggestions, all of which were resolved.</p><p>This second one analyzed the Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) crate, which is the hApp developer’s interface between their integrity zomes and Holochain itself. The HDI allows the dev to write validation callbacks that check data for correctness. These callbacks, combined with the plumbing of Holochain’s DHT implementation, are what create the ‘immune system’ that keeps honest participants safe.</p><p>Because the HDI is so heavily dependent on the foundation of Holochain’s inner workings, they found that their analysis had to go further than just this one library. This gave them an opportunity to assess the correctness of Holochain’s model for arriving at consistency and take a look at how the model is implemented.</p><p>The results of this audit were similar to the first, with one issue related to insufficient formal documentation, which they identified as a potential risk for correctly implementing Holochain’s consistency model. We’ve resolved that by writing a formal specification and rewriting the Holochain whitepaper, which we plan to publish soon.</p> Reminder: Holochain Dev Training in March <p>Now that Holochain has its first beta and the dev tools are almost ready, Holochain is pretty much ready for prototyping your hApp and getting it into the hands of beta testers. If you want to skill up yourself or your dev team quickly and effectively, the online Dev Training course in March will get you there. <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">Read the details and apply</a> on our website.</p>

				  Digital transformation across all aspects of business makes verifiable data the currency for seamless and secure processes in 2023  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By&nbsp;Trevor Butterworth and Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Across every sector, digital transformation is the agenda. It means doing more and doing better, often with the economic constraint of having less. It means reorienting to changing employee demographics and labor shortages while meeting customer expectations for seamless experiences and greater efficiencies — often managed from a mobile device. It means adopting new platforms for product design, simulation, and lifecycle management, integrating data from sensor-equipped devices, and in-sourcing supplies.</p>
<p>It means adapting to continuous brand or product engagement by creating and integrating new data streams while complying with data privacy law. And it means seeing digital relationships in terms of authenticity: they aren’t just about modified&nbsp; data flows, they are about creating new kinds of genuine, peer-to-peer interaction based on consent.</p>
<p>Successful digital transformation will deliver better products, experiences, and services, for both B2B and B2C companies, while reducing costs, friction, and risk.</p>
<p>Trusted data is the currency of digital transformation<br>Trusted data is data that is verifiable. The quicker it can be verified, the more seamless the process that depends on the authenticity and integrity of the data. That may sound simple and obvious, but the inability to trust the authenticity and integrity of data has throttled digital interaction with punishing costs in fraud and friction. There is no reliable verification layer for people, entities, or the data they wish to share; the internet was built without one.</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology (often referred to as decentralized identity or self-sovereign identity) changes all this. It means data can be immediately acted upon while reducing the risk of fraud. In practical terms, there’s no need to check in with the source of the data or rely on a third party to store data in order to cross check and manage data verification; the data is issued in a credential from a trusted issuer and is not written to a database or a blockchain; It can be shared by consent and verified through metadata across direct, uniquely encrypted peer-to-peer communications channels. All this removes friction and adds consent, privacy, and security. The result is trusted data, seamlessly verified.</p>
<p>Trusted data not only accelerates seamless processes, it enables new kinds of digital processes and services by removing barriers to digital interaction and enabling interaction to scale.</p>
<p>So how do we think trusted data will be used in 2023 to drive digital transformation? Here are our predictions.</p>
<p>1. Digital wallets will take a backseat to “super” credentials<br>Perhaps because digital wallets are apps, and apps are what make mobile devices powerful, digital wallet apps have come to be seen as “really important” to implementing verifiable credential technology. But — just as a fancy wallet doesn’t do much in the real world if there’s nothing of value in it — a killer digital wallet is only as useful as what it actually stores, which is to say, digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create interoperable “super” credentials for seamless KYC, payments, and travel, and a digital wallet becomes super useful. There isn’t a critical shortage of wallet apps; Hyperledger Aries has an open-source white label wallet — Bifold — that anyone can adapt, build on, and offer with their credentials. This is why we see the hype of a killer wallet being replaced in 2023 by the practicality of a “super” credential.</p>
<p>2. DeGov will gain commercial and public sector traction<br>One of our <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/?preview_id=3622&amp;preview_nonce=510518f883&amp;post_format=standard&amp;_thumbnail_id=3625&amp;preview=true">earliest insights</a> into consumer needs was that governance needed to be simple to implement and yet capable of handling complex information flows, rapid rule change, jurisdictional hierarchies, and—crucially— offline environments.&nbsp; Governance authorities need to be confident that they are in charge of the governance decisions within their jurisdictions and Decentralized Ecosystem Governance (DeGov) enables that accountability.<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonstrates-decentralized-ecosystem-governance/">DeGov</a> began with machine-readable files that could be cached in the software for each party in an ecosystem, and it has now expanded to a specification, currently under discussion at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/partner/925">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, with efforts to standardize and interoperate with other governance implementations at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">net result</a> is that we have a coherent, powerful, and easy-to-use way for establishing and managing trust in an ecosystem, one that results in a smooth user experience with the capacity for verification in offline situations. DeGov will catalyze commercial and public sector use cases of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>3. KYC credentials pave the way for payment disruption<br>Identity assurance is expensive to do, time consuming, and has to be done over and over again, causing frustration and friction for both the customer and the financial institution. The crypto and banking sectors both <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/id-fraud-rises-worldwide-but-biometrics-helps-kyc">experienced</a> a doubling of identity fraud in&nbsp; 2022 from&nbsp; 2021, and payment fraud increased by 40 percent. At the same time, financial losses from identity theft rose to almost $6.1 billion in 2022.A know-your-customer (KYC) credential (with biometric binding to a device) means both one-time identity assurance and proof-of-card ownership without the need for storing and sharing any personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By simplifying KYC, verifiable credentials will save time, effort, friction, and, significantly, cost. This also means that the barrier to performing KYC will be lowered, encouraging&nbsp; identity assurance to be more widely performed.</p>
<p>The combination of reduced friction and increased trust will change ecommerce, invoicing, mortgage brokering, payments — and DeGov — will make this easy to coordinate and manage on a global scale.</p>
<p>4. Passwords will become a relic of the old times — like rotary phones and punch cards<br>No one loves passwords and usernames. According to a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2022/what-banks-can-do-to-protect-consumers-from-social-engineering-traps/">recent poll</a>, 68% of consumers would be willing to use non-password login options on their mobile apps. There is no digital future where they turn into vinyl and the kids will want to use them because they’re cool. Our digital lives will be immeasurably better once they are gone.The way to replace a username and the password is to create a trusted digital relationship with a verifiable credential. The authentication problem that passwords and user logins are meant to solve&nbsp; vanishes, because they are no longer needed as a substitute for a trusted digital relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital-forward companies that use verifiable credentials for login will be able to build stronger relationships with their customers, develop more effective product lifecycle management, and collate product data and consumer feedback. These digital relationships will use DIDComm technology for direct, peer-to-peer secure communication between entities, and they will be data privacy compliant, as data can be shared by explicit consent and in privacy-preserving ways.</p>
<p>5. There will be new models for monetizing credentials<br>First, verifiable credentials will save you money, then they’ll make you money. The immediate value proposition for verifiable credential technology is in fixing inefficient and insecure verification processes, especially around payments. Then they can be deployed to tackle problems that are, presently, filed under “the cost of doing business,” such as chargeback fraud. But as&nbsp; trusted data scales, it also presents opportunities for both better digital relationships and products and&nbsp; services that deliver the customer value (think seamless travel). If the cost of KYC is minimal, the cost and risk of entering a market is correspondingly reduced. Anything that provides a valued customer with more value and efficiency has the potential to become a new business model.</p>
<p>Much of the talk around “super apps” reflects the behavior and expectations of a maturing digital-first demographic that wants to be able to manage everything as simply as possible through their phone. But super apps aren’t going to work without trusted data that’s interoperable across ecosystems. They aren’t going to be super if they can’t deliver privacy, consent, and security.</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology doesn’t require everyone moving to a new system or companies and organizations trashing their existing systems. It’s a technology layer that transforms what you already have. And because it is open source, there’s no vendor lock in. It’s a tool and a toolbox for innovation and interoperability. Those that have it will be able to accelerate digital transformation. Those that don’t will face equally rapid obsolescence.</p>

<p>Today our focus is on authentication settings. If you are using Google Workspace as your IDP, reviewing your authentication settings to ensure they align with internal policies and are appropriate for any use of Google Cloud Platform is paramount. </p>

<p>We recommend two important settings:</p>

<p>1. Turn on two-factor authentication. </p><p>Why? Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This can be in the form of a code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or a physical token. By using 2FA, you make it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your accounts, even if they have your password. This is because a hacker would also need to have access to your second form of authentication in order to log in. Additionally, 2FA helps in cases where the password is compromised, and it's a best practice for organizations to secure their online access.</p><p></p>
<p>2. Enforce strong passwords</p><p>Why? Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked by hackers using automated tools, making it easy for them to gain access to your accounts. A strong password typically contains a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and is at least 12 characters long. The longer and more complex the password, the harder it is to crack. Using a unique password for each account is also important because if a hacker gains access to one password, they will not be able to use it to access your other accounts</p><p></p>

<p>If your org is behind a third-party IDP, super admins will still use username/password and Google’s 2FA, so you will still want to ensure that settings are set properly. </p>

<p>To review these key settings, follow these steps:</p> 
   Sign in to the Google Admin Console 
   Go to Security &gt; Authentication 
   Review Password Management to ensure that password policies are properly set. Consider requiring <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9094506?hl=en">,strong passwords</a> to automatically set a secure default.  
   Go to 2-Step Verification and check enforcement settings. If 2FA is not enforced, kick off a project to require it.  
   If it’s on and all methods are allowed, look into whether it is feasible to disable verification codes over text and phone calls as those are more susceptible to attack. 
  
   If your org uses GCP, check Google Cloud session controls to ensure that reauthentication is required. This way users cannot maintain a persistent connection to GCP resources without reauthentication.

<p>Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the number of bad actors involved increasing at an alarming rate. New and sophisticated techniques are being used that have evolved over the years to leverage modern computational hardware. These developments have aided and abetted the guessing of passwords and hacking of digital credentials. While these threats expose the inherent weaknesses of password-based authentication schemes, simplistic identity-detached passwordless authentication is not the answer either.</p>
 Personnel Onboarding Risks and Requirements 
<p>Organizational risk tolerance for new hire onboarding is very low because of the Day 1 access granted to services and applications. Granting access comes with risk and therefore companies will try the usual means of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> via background checks on government-issued documents, work history, address history, etc., as a means to establish trust. But there are limits to background checks that a company normally performs, as these might not extend exhaustively to domestic and international subcontractors. Therefore, establishing trust via identity-linked proofing becomes mandatory.</p>
<p>Passwordless for employees does not by itself inoculate the enterprise against credential compromise. Ensuring the employee is who they claim to be is the gap in most passwordless solutions today because while passwordless only eliminates friction in the employee’s journey, it does not make the journey more secure.</p>
<p>What is needed is a means to mitigate identity theft and identity spoofing to ensure the individual is exactly who they are claiming to be. For the new hire onboarding journey to be secure the employee’s identity must be established irrefutably as well. Companies ask for government-issued identity documents to prove an individual is who they are claiming to be, but that does not prove that the individual logging in to applications at any given time is indeed the same person.</p>
<p>Authorization is another added requirement for onboarding an existing employee to new applications and services. Risk is minimized best when there is continuous authentication as well as transactional authorization in place where the company checks for the identity and authentication assurance level of the individual in real-time before granting them access to critical service and application assets.</p>
 Privacy, PII and the Onboarding Process 
<p>A CIO is interested in simplifying and securing the Information Architecture of the Enterprise and implementing guardrails for preserving user privacy. Data privacy has recently attained critical focus in the international community with violations costing companies billions in penalties and significant reputational damage to boot. The organization has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of their employees and customers.</p>
<p>In essence, there are a few key factors driving the need for a digital transformation of the new hire onboarding process: verify the identity of the individual, secure the PII data in a way that it is impossible to compromise it, secure or even better, eliminate login credentials (i.e., passwords), implement continuous verification of the identity, continuous transactional authorization before granting access, and finally, ensure continuing privacy of the individual by imposing protections and restrictions on any PII release to third-parties.</p>
 Simplified Access 
<p>Simplified access to legacy systems using passwordless sign-on improves productivity, no doubt about that. Even better, enabling quick password resets to legacy apps after the individual has completed a strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-authentication/">identity-based authentication</a> roundtrip using live biometrics enables faster and frictionless access to legacy applications. Another strategic benefit of deploying an identity-based passwordless solution is to reclaim 2FA spend on migrating legacy systems to passwordless. Why not re-use the identity from a secure digital identity wallet for onboarding new hires and existing employees to modern and legacy services?</p>
 Reduce Costs 
<p>A CIO’s broad mandate is to reduce IT costs, including personnel onboarding administration costs by implementing projects that automate the self-service workflows for new hire onboarding, identity proofing, and <a href="http://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-verification-system/">identity verification</a>. Another key requirement is to reduce help desk costs, which can be implemented by automating password resets for legacy applications as described previously. This identity-based authentication strategy also eliminates help desk calls for those same password resets and reduces 24/7 helpdesk overhead and support costs with fewer complaints and ‘stalled’ or stuck employees.</p>
 Improve Security 
<p>A quick word is in order for a CISO’s mandate as well. They are looking to improve the overall security posture and prevent – or the more likely scenario – manage losses from data breaches (they are inevitable!). CISOs want to restrict the amount of PII stored in a central user repository to only what is needed to do business. A good information security program also attempts to eliminate vulnerabilities resulting from weak non-identity based authentication techniques.</p>
<p>In summary, CXOs want to simplify the information and information security architecture of the organization, minimize the reputational damage of information breach, and reduce their insurance liability at the same time. Why not go with an identity based authentication and proofing platform that makes mass credential compromise impossible?</p>
<p>It is clear that live biometrics-based aka identity-based authentication that uses pre-proofed identity is much stronger for use in a continuous authentication and continuous authorization paradigm than any other form of identity-detached passwordless scheme. It is the only way to verify that the individual is who they are claiming to be at the time of an access request.</p>
 1Kosmos Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>All these goals can only be achieved if an organization starts with identity and not just authentication. The traditional approach to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> is to focus on MFA or passwordless login. While 1Kosmos is passwordless, we bring identity-based features to an authentication scheme used by the organization. This flexibility may be used to enhance the identity verification process using strong biometrics-based identity and verification of user credentials via industry standards.</p>
<p>What’s unique about 1Kosmos is that we start with Identity, instead of starting with authentication, as the basis for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/strong-authentication/">strong authentication</a> and this enables us to solve many of the same challenges for both employees and customers. Our biometrics engine allows for continuous identity verification of the individual at login-time, and continuous transactional authorization at access-time, while remaining aligned with the company’s risk policies. It is no longer acceptable to identity-proof an employee or a customer once – for example during onboarding or new hire – and let them use services indefinitely.</p>
<p>By combining authentication with true Identity (NIST 800-63-3a principles and modified versions for corporate applications), you have a much higher assurance to know who is truly at the end of a digital connection every time they authenticate.</p>
<p>These principles apply to customers especially in the banking industry where strong KYC is needed. 1Kosmos is a member of the FIDO alliance, DIACC, The DIF foundation, Linux Foundation (for Trust over IP), W3C, and the COVID Credentials group. This ensures that you will have a partner with a product that is not only open, preventing vendor lock-in, but is on top of the latest trends in Identity.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 28th&nbsp;January <p>Back with another Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week in focus — the note from the Biden administration officials urging Congress to intensify crypto regulatory efforts, Indonesia signing a new financial law to regulate crypto beyond trading, and a US Democrat introducing a bill for legalizing crypto payments in New York state. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> US Official Note Urges Congress to Step up Crypto Regulations <p>The Biden Administration presented in its official blog, from January 27th, 2023, a roadmap for addressing potential crypto risks. It aimed to ramp up enforcement and asked the U.S. Congress to step up its regulatory efforts.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1619372444610953216?s=20&amp;t=n6BrR6gfOxRQAufJv_r1gw">Image Source</a>)<p>The post cited some significant failures in the crypto industry in recent times, including the implosion of Terra protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin and the collapse of FTX, the third-largest crypto exchange in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The lack of applicable regulations, the prevalence of misleading statements, inadequate disclosures, and weak cybersecurity measures are among some of the risk factors that the blog has identified.</p><p>The administration asked not to allow mainstream financial institutions like pension funds to enter crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> Indonesia Wants to Treat Crypto as a&nbsp;Security <p>With Indonesian President Joko Widodo signing a new law on January 12th, crypto regulatory powers will now shift from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to CoFTRA, a commodities watchdog.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1619848363288961024?s=20&amp;t=n6BrR6gfOxRQAufJv_r1gw">Image Source</a>)<p>ABI, the blockchain trade association of Indonesia, has welcomed the move saying that “this shift has shown a good understanding from the regulator that crypto assets are broader than just trading.”</p><p>According to the Indonesian Government, the regulatory changeover would take two&nbsp;years.</p><p>The country also has plans to set up a national crypto exchange similar to the NYSE, which the government believes will make market monitoring easier for regulators.</p> IMF Issues 5-Point Crypto Regulatory Recommendations <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendations ask regulators to license, register, and authorize crypto asset providers.

<p>Step-up authentication is an authentication method available for eService providers to allow users to access certain resources with minimal credentials, while requiring additional verification when accessing sensitive information. Matching authentication levels and authentication methods with the sensitivity (or value) of the resource provides a good balance between security and ease of use.</p>
<p>This blog will concentrate on and explore step-up authentication, what it is, how it interacts with SSO and its benefits.</p>
 What is step-up authentication? 
<p>Step-up authentication is the use of two separate authentication methods, at differing intervals throughout login and information access. A lower level of assurance method is used to access the basic information before a higher level of assurance method is then requested if the user wants to access more sensitive information.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication is technically an upgrade to an existing authentication level. The basic concept is that initially, users authenticate themselves using a lower-level authentication method. For example, the username and password created during the account registration or one of the social media methods like Apple, Google, or Facebook. This login creates a session which is typically stored to a web browser cookie, and this allows the users to access certain types of services and information.</p>
<p>If the users want to access more sensitive information or, for example handle money-related transactions, then they must upgrade the authentication level of the existing session to a higher degree. This is where the step-up authentication takes place. From the users’ point of view, it is just another authentication workflow where they use a higher level of assurance authentication method, such as Bank ID, Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) codes, mobile PKI, ID cards or similar. This adaptive approach ensures that only authorised users can access the sensitive information, thereby managing the risk level without negatively impacting the usability.</p>
 Step-up authentication and SSO 
<p>One of the basic features of a modern CIAM System is the single sign-on (SSO). It is a great feature that allows users to move between different services of the same service provider without the need to re-authenticate in between. The SSO between different applications requires the user session to be authenticated to a specific level or re-authentication will be requested. The different MFA authentication workflows utilise the so-called ‘weakest method first’ principle where the lower level of assurance methods are executed first, followed by the higher assurance methods. This is the same principle usually applied in step-up authentication. If users have not yet executed the higher level of assurance within step-up authentication, they may be blocked from using the SSO within applications that require the higher level of authentication. In these cases, the users must execute a new authentication which is not part of the step-up authentication.</p>
 Why choose Step-up authentication? 
<p>There are several so-called multiple authentication request schemes to choose from. These include multifactor authentication (MFA), step-up authentication and risk based authentication (RBA). Although there are some similarities between these, including the authentication methods being the same and step-authentication and RBA both being based on MFA. There are also some fundamental differences, like the conditions of when and where those extra authentication steps are requested. Step-up Authentication sits between MFA and RBA. Making it an ideal authentication method when your system requires a higher level of authentication than basic MFA can provide but does not require the intricacies of RBA.</p>
<p>In comparison to MFA, which requests two authentication methods during the initial login process, step-up authentication only requests the additional higher-level authentication when the user wants to access sensitive information, or perform higher risk, higher value transactions. This not only makes the system more user friendly but also saves costs in comparison to traditional MFA due to only requesting secondary authentication as and when required.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication and Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) differ in that step-up authentication allows access to different parts of a service using both single-factor and multi-factor authentications, while RBA only utilises multi-factor authentication as a means of added security when suspicious activity is detected, without providing any additional access to the service.</p>
<p>By raising the assurance level of an authentication method, we make services more secure. However, at the same time, the access procedure becomes more complex for the end user, thus potentially increasing frustration, which we want to avoid. In addition, added security of MFA usually increases the cost for the service providers in form of transaction-based pricing per authentication action. Step-up authentication and RBA provide optional approaches to solve these issues.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Nowadays, people understand the role of the cyber security of eServices and are becoming more familiar with the higher level of assurance authentication procedures. However, usability is a key factor for a successful eService. Providing easy access without compromising security can be a separator between you and your competition.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication provides the best of both worlds, easy usability when accessing protected resources and a high-security level when accessing more sensitive information. Even if criminal hackers managed to get users’ credentials to access their services, sensitive information or money-related transactions would not be available without using the higher level of assurance method required to access these resources. This, combined with the cost savings that service providers can achieve with step-up authentication, makes it a very attractive option when evaluating different authentication method schemes for their eServices.</p>
<p>As a Customer and Identity Management System (CIAM) vendor, Ubisecure’s Identity Platform offers various authentication method options for the eService providers. These methods can be used individually, as a single-factor manner, or as a combination of two or more, offering various schemes for authentication.</p>

Literally. They inspire awe in people. Their raw power. The heat, the huffing and the puffing. The choo-choos! What they do is visceral. Breath-taking.</p><p>Steam engines transformed our world and came to symbolise an entire era. They powered the first factories. Steam-powered trains transfigured our society, economy and geography bringing distant, remote places closer. The stupefying power of The Flying Scotsman, the steam engine that slashed the time it took to travel from London to Edinburgh, was celebrated, admired — and emulated — across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Transformational and awesome as it was, the steam engine was an evolutionary dead-end. It may have been the harbinger of a new industrial age. But in the end it wasn’t the foundation and driver of this new age. Instead, it was displaced by something far better: electricity. Steam had its day. Then the world moved&nbsp;on.</p> Steam engines of the information age <p>Could modern juggernauts like Google and Facebook (sorry, Alphabet and Meta) be the Flying Scotsmen of today’s information age? Awesome but doomed symbols of an era? Yes, they&nbsp;could.</p><p>Steam faded from its glory because, as a means of providing energy, it had severe limitations. A separate new steam engine had to be built for every use-case and occasion. Steam engines were inefficient. Cumbersome to use. Expensive.</p><p>Compared to an electricity national grid there was no contest. The grid provided universal, safe, instant, easy, cheap access to something that everybody needs: energy for the purposes of heat, light and motion. Steam may have inspired awe. But ultimately it did not represent the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Today, we have a similar situation. Personal data is something everybody needs to access safely, instantly, easily and cheaply to manage their affairs better: to make better decisions and to plan, organise and coordinate their implementation. So we need the equivalent of a national grid to enable this, via better data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>But today’s data systems are specifically designed NOT to do this. They revolve around the organisation-centric database — a separate data silo where each organisation keeps the data they collect under lock and key, for its use only. Like steam, a separate database needs to be built for every use case and occasion.</p><p>Yes, back in its day, the organisation-centric database transformed our world by enabling the collection and use of data, to make an increasing range of activities data driven, just as steam made an increasing range of activities steam&nbsp;driven.</p><p>But like the steam engine, the organisation-centric database is also inefficient, cumbersome and expensive, restricting access and use of personal data. Steam demonstrated the power of energy. The organisation-centric database demonstrated the power and potential of data. It opened a door to a different future, But like steam, it does not represent this&nbsp;future.</p> A flawed&nbsp;model <p>This includes Google and Facebook, icons of our age, just as the Flying Scostmen was an icon of its era. As data juggernauts, they have transformed our society, inspiring awe, admiration (and emulation) the world over as they have done so. As steam-powered railways&nbsp;did.</p><p>But they are also severely&nbsp;limited.</p><p>Despite their size and ambition, they are limited in the data they can collect (how many people would share their health or financial data with Google or Facebook?). Economically speaking, they are just skimming the surface of what data can do. Focused as they are on marketing, advertising and media they hardly touch the core — industries such as health, education, banking finance and insurance, public administration in central and local government; any and all services dealing with identifiable individuals. As such, they cannot touch anything more than just a tiny fraction of all economic activity.</p><p>Meanwhile, their business models generate irreconcilable conflicts that constrain them: to keep on growing their profits, they have to hoover up ever more data. But the more they try to do so, the less trustworthy they become and the more they are hounded by regulators and competition authorities. They had an amazing run, but they are already plateauing. They are not the harbingers of the future. They represent an evolutionary dead end. They do NOT represent any sort of sustainable model for the&nbsp;future.</p> From electrification to datafication <p>In this blog series we’ve talked about the transformational power of personal data and personal data stores, their ability&nbsp;to:</p>  unleash <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">breakthrough productivity improvements</a> for both households and service providers  solve the challenges of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">seamless joined-up services</a>  transform the way people and organisations <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">go to&nbsp;market</a>  create <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">entirely new person-centric services</a> and industries  accelerate and enrich <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-has-data-got-to-do-with-net-zero-bb48048b04bc">the journey to net&nbsp;zero</a>.  <p>We’ve talked in some detail about the how and why of each of these opportunities, but we haven’t explained the common economic principles that unite&nbsp;them.</p><p>One such principle is illustrated by the national electricity grid. By making a universally needed enabler — energy — safe, easy to access and affordable, it lifted previous barriers to its use and opened up an explosion of possibilities. Providing every individual with their own personal data store would do the same for another universally needed enabler — the personal data that lies at the heart of every service that deals with an identifiable individual, across all sectors of the economy (public, private and&nbsp;third).</p><p>The national electricity grid enabled the electrification of the economy. The personal data store enables its datafication, transcending the barriers and limitations of the steam-engine of our age, the organisation-centric database.</p> Applying tried and tested economic principles <p>The national grid analogy is useful in two ways. It captures some key principles that need to be adopted, and it illustrates the nature and scale of the opportunity.</p><p>It also illustrates the importance of key divisions of labour, between electricity generation and distribution. With personal data, today’s organisations act as ‘power stations’ that generate data and personal data stores enable its distribution.</p><p>But what the analogy misses is the ‘how’. To see the underlying economic principles at work here, we need to look at another transformational development of the early 20th century: mass production, the brainchild of Henry&nbsp;Ford.</p><p>Think of any physical product you like. It’s made up of a specific combination of different, specified parts which (if put together in the right way) contribute their own little bit to making the whole product work. Different products require different parts, combined in different ways.</p><p>Henry Ford’s genius was to invent an extremely efficient, generalisable way to bring standardised parts together to create a whole product, using a moving assembly line. It was this that cut the cost of making a motor car by over&nbsp;90%.</p><p>Personal data stores apply exactly the same economic logic to assembling the highly specific combinations of personal data that are needed to deliver specific services. If you think about it, what service providers do with personal data is exactly the same as what manufacturers do with parts to make products: assemble unique configurations of data/parts to produce any and all services/products imaginable.</p><p>The only way to make this work, efficiently and effectively, is to use standardised parts. Previously in manufacturing, when each part was made by hand, it was also unique. Different. Which meant it couldn’t just ‘snap’ to fit to other parts. Each one had to be reworked, even if just a little bit, to make the whole product. And this rework took an enormous amount of&nbsp;time.</p><p>To make the whole thing work, the components that went into the making of products had to be standardised. By using standardised parts and a moving assembly line (which slashed the time, energy and effort needed to get each part to where it needed to be) Ford reduced the costs of making a motor car by over&nbsp;90%.</p><p>In the world of data, verified attributes (or credentials) are the standardised parts of service manufacturing.</p><p>A verified attribute is a piece of information about an individual that has been generated or confirmed by a responsible organisation and turned into a cryptographically secure token — so that it can be shared and used quickly and easily, thereby eliminating the huge amount of re-work that currently takes&nbsp;place.</p><p>A verified attribute could be about anything: the fact that you have a valid driving licence, that you are over 18, what your blood type is, or your credit score, or inside leg measurement. It doesn’t matter. But once it has been verified it can be turned into a token (a standardised part) and used to assemble any service that needs it (thereby eliminating the need to fill in forms, for example).</p><p>By enabling the gathering and sharing of such verified attributes (as well as additional information provided by the individual that only the individual knows), personal data stores apply the logic that revolutionised the manufacture of physical products to the manufacture of personalised services. They achieve what the national electricity grid achieved for&nbsp;energy.</p> Conclusion <p>Breakthrough innovations like the national electricity grid and the mass production moving assembly line, or personal data stores, happen at unique moments in history. They combine novel combinations of things which are relatively new but nevertheless tried and tested. In Ford’s case for example, the oil and electricity industries were relatively new. Standardised parts were already used in arms manufacture. Moving (dis)assembly lines by meat packers. Ford put them together to transform car&nbsp;making.</p><p>In our day, the Internet, cloud storage, APIs for data sharing and technologies to make cryptographically secure tokens are all relatively new but tried and tested. Personal data stores bring these developments to transform the collection and use of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Such transformations are seismic in their effects. Together, the national electricity grid and the mass production assembly line transformed 20th century economies, making steam engines history. Current organisation-centric approaches to the collection and use of data, including those of the Flying Scotsmen of the information age Google and Facebook, are its steam&nbsp;engines.</p><p>Yes, they paved the way, highlighted the opportunities, and built new capabilities and infrastructure. But they do not represent the future. Personal data stores on the other hand are the 21st century information age equivalents of the electricity grid and the assembly line. They provide the data logistics infrastructure a modern economy needs, making access to and use of personal data universally accessible and available. They do so by applying principles that were tried and tested with the handling of things to the handling of information.</p><p>This raises a knock-on question however: If the resulting opportunity is so big and so beneficial, why haven’t people been falling over themselves to seize it?

<p>Introduction from YeshID</p>
<p>At YeshID, we're big fans of Google Workspace and have adopted it like many other startups. However, we were not fully aware of all the security features it offers. </p>

<p>That's why we reached out to our design partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylanmuller/">Ylan Muller</a>, an expert in Google administration, for guidance on best practices for a Google administrator. Ylan is an IT professional with nine years of experience in managing SaaS applications, including Google Workspace, across industries from financial services to software. She currently runs IT at<a href="https://firehydrant.com/"> FireHydrant</a>.</p>

<p>Ylan provided us with valuable and easy-to-implement advice, even without a dedicated security or IT team. With Ylan's permission, we've turned her advice into a 5-day New Year's challenge to improve our workplace security. Oh and bonus - you don’t have to purchase any new software to put these good practices in place!</p>

<p>We're excited to share Ylan's insights with you.</p>

<p>Introduction to Google Security Basics</p>
<p>Inheriting a Google Workspace environment can be an intimidating experience. While you can address some problems through written policy (don’t send sensitive data outside of the org!), Google Workspace offers ample technical control for locking down the data that matters most to your business.</p>

<p>I’ve honed in on the settings I find most important to review over several years of managing Google Workspace environments for companies ranging from 50 to 1050 employees and am here to share them with you! Below you will find a list of settings to review and ideas to implement as you look to lock down your Google organization. </p>

<p>Welcome to Day 1!</p>

<p>Day 1: Establishing a Secure Foundation - Review and/or Create Your Organizational Unit and Group Structure</p>
<p>Many settings in Google Workspace can be scoped to either a user group or OU. Ideally, groups and/or OUs should be able to represent your organization structure and any other groupings that would be appropriate for slicing and dicing access and settings. For example, you may want to prevent your finance team from sharing files outside of the organization, but your customer success team may need to. Having your groups and OUs set up properly to start will allow you to more easily scope settings. </p>

<p>Groups are also used in Google Cloud Platform - if you or your engineering team plans on utilizing GCP in the future, think about how you would want to handle access. Setting up department and team groups in Google Workspace in advance may save you time when you go to configure IAM. </p>

<p>We also recommend:</p> 
   Avoiding nesting OUs too deeply. Having many layers of nested OUs will get unmanageable quickly since a user can only be in one OU, but they can be in many groups. For example, the nested OU structure below will result in a lot of overheard if you ever need to change a setting for every user who is allowed to share externally:
 
 <p>
With the newly introduced abilities to apply settings to groups, smaller organizations should consider keeping everyone within a general “Employees” OU while applying settings purely through groups. 
</p> 
   Creating a group for IT as a first-stop for new setting assignments for testing 
   Creating a cross-functional group of people in the company, representing all parts of the organization, that can serve as beta testers outside of IT. There is no world in which IT can vet every setting for every use case. Work with this group to collect their feedback about new features or settings you deploy.  
 
<p>If you are on an Enterprise or Education plan you can also <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10286834?hl=en">,construct dynamic groups</a> based on profile attributes to automate memberships. </p>

 Popular sporting tournament surpasses previous World Cup viewing figures, betting activity, and visits to black-market sites. 



 



<p>As predicted, the unusual combination of winter scheduling and enforced breaks of domestic football leagues resulted in a World Cup with a record-breaking <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/19886/bgc-black-market-gambling-site-traffic-tripled-during-2022-world-cup">5.4 billion </a>cumulated views .&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, traffic to <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/19886/bgc-black-market-gambling-site-traffic-tripled-during-2022-world-cup">black market gambling sites also tripled</a> during the world-famous sporting tournament. According to the UK Betting and Gaming Council, 250,000 people visited black market sites in December alone, compared to 80,000 during the same month in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s unfortunate, but not surprising. Consumers are often drawn to black-market gambling sites because of bonus benefits and unclear rules regarding deposit limits. However, users should be aware that there is no consumer protection when using these black-market sites. So, if you win a bet, there is no guarantee that they will pay out. This is why it’s incredibly important for users to use licensed gambling operators that have rigorous player protection and safer gambling tools in place,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk,&nbsp;Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Read more about Roger’s 2023 predictions for the online gambling market, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-trends-2023/">‘“Always bet on good regulation.”’ interview</a>.</p>



 Why bettors may go to black-market operators. 



<p>Two of the main reasons players may decide to go to black-market operators is that they tend to offer higher bonuses, along with the promise they don’t have to do <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>. However, it’s worth remembering that the KYC requirement is there to not only protect operators from consumers using the platform for nefarious activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> or other types of identity fraud, but also for consumer protection. If consumers use an unregistered, black-market gaming platform then there is no guarantee that they will pay out.</p>



<p>The other reason why some consumers decide to go with a black-market operator could be down to their superior customer experience. </p>



<p>Businesses that enter the online gambling market, and comply with regulations, are also often plagued by sluggish UI, and poor customer experience. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://egr.global/compliance/news/report-up-to-30-of-online-gambling-customers-abandon-sign-up-process/">research</a>&nbsp;shows that 30% of online gamblers have abandoned the onboarding process when registering a new account with a gambling website due to its complicated sign-up processes.</p>



<p>The importance of offering a fast and smooth, multi-jurisdictional, and KYC-compliant onboarding experience cannot be overstated. As every potential customer needs to be verified before being allowed to gamble, players will no doubt flock to the website or gambling platform that can verify their information the quickest. This need for speed is becoming increasingly important in both the KYC, and online gambling arenas. If player onboarding is too complicated, or has too many hurdles, organizations run a real risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/online-gambling-authentication-security-digital-identification/">significant drop-off</a>.</p>



 FIFA World Cup 2022 recap. 



<p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup was a massive success for the betting and gaming industry, with an estimated <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/5660/uk-wagers-15bn-on-fifa-world-cup">$155 billion wagered on the game, including $1.9 billion in the UK</a> alone. As we predicted in our<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/winter-world-cup-qatar-impacts-sports-events/"> ‘How the Winter World Cup in Qatar impacts other sports events, including the Premier League.’ blog</a>, many bettors appeared to have preferred to stay indoors to watch the winter World Cup tournament, leading to increased demand for online gambling platforms. Indeed, the World Cup 2022 tournament attracted even more gambling activity that World Cup 2018, with a <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/sports-betting/2022-world-cup-breaks-betting-records-thanks-in-part-to-us-growth/">13% increase in sports betting</a> according to provider of sportsbook technology, content and services, OpenBet.</p>



<p>Key to the growth in betting activity was the recent legalization of online gambling in some states of the United States. GeoComply, a provider of geolocation security and compliance solutions, revealed that the Argentina-France World Cup final actually attracted more US bettors than the final games of the NCAA’s March Madness, NBA final, and NHL’s Stanley Cup final.</p>



<p>In a bit to capitalize on the growing popularity of football, many operators seized the opportunity to offer new products specifically designed for World Cup fans. For example, offering odds on everything from which team will be sent off first, to particular bets, such as how many yellow cards England will receive during one game.</p>



<p>However, now that the World Cup 2022 is over, sportsbooks should not assume that a newly gained customer will continue to bet after the tournament ends, or even place multiple bets throughout the tournament. This was demonstrated on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kambi.com/qatar-2022-what-a-winter-world-cup-means-for-sports-betting/">Kambi network during the Euro 2020 tournament</a>, when 78% of new players bet on the event when given a coupon, but only 76% returned for a second bet during the same event.</p>



<p>Customer acquisition and retention after a big tournament are crucial to successful sportsbooks. The timing of the World Cup 2022 created a real opportunity for operators as the Premier League resumed just a week after the World Cup 2022 ended, allowing for a much shorter retention (and loss) window compared to Euro 2020, which had a gap of over a month.</p>



 Unique operational challenges for gambling operators. 



<p>The last thing sportsbooks need is for consumers to try their platform – whether they are solid bet builders or player props – only to lose interest and vanish when the World Cup ends.</p>



<p>Operators that can offer a great customer onboarding experience, and a product that delivers a wide variety of markets and an outstanding level of combinability, are perfectly positioned to benefit from the opportunities at major sporting tournaments like the World Cup.</p>



<p>Of course, there is no uniform global legislation that governs gambling services. For example, some countries allow all types of gambling, while others&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe">only allow certain forms</a>&nbsp;such as poker or casino games.</p>



<p>Keeping abreast of regulatory differences can be confusing, time-consuming, and expensive. Some of the most common gambling regulations concern age limits, which means verifying the age of players is essential in preventing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>. There are also specific national and regional laws that gaming operators must follow. Find out more in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">overview of both the EU &amp; UK Online Gambling Regulations</a>.</p>



 Security and betting fraud. 



<p>During the World Cup 2018, there were major concerns about security and betting fraud. In preparation for the World Cup 2022, gaming operators were warned to be wary of the following:</p>



  Bookmakers offering inaccurate odds – this could be due to a lack of liquidity, and result in customers not being able to place bets.  A lack of transparency –  some bookmakers were accused of fixing matches.  Fraudulent activities – bots operated by criminals were used to manipulate bettors into placing wagers on specific teams or players.  



<p>Betting fraud is a problem that affects all countries where <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">online gambling is legal</a>, not just those hosting major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics. Ahead of the World Cup 2022, fraud prevention service, Cifas warned operators and users about the serious consequences of committing gambling fraud.</p>



<p>As gambling fraud and betting fraud tends to spike during major sporting events, Cifas predicted a huge increase in the number of fraudulent claims that would be submitted in the months following the World Cup 2022.</p>



<p>An increase on figures that were already at an all-time high. Indeed, in the first <a href="https://www.cifas.org.uk/newsroom/betting-fraud-2022-world-cup">nine months of 2022, fraudulent claims for chargebacks</a> (where a person fraudulently claims they didn’t make a purchase or receive a product to recoup costs from bank) rose by 172%.</p>



<p>Gambling operators endure many challenges, such as risks of fraud, underage gambling, regulatory compliance, and offering a safe and smooth onboarding process for new users.</p>



 How to prepare for World Cup 2026 as a gambling operator. 



<p>By the time the next World Cup rolls around, in 2026, the online gambling market is likely to be even more regulated, but unfortunately still susceptible to different types of betting fraud.</p>



<p>It will still also likely be an opportunity to attract new users (considering it will be held in the growing football market of Canada and the United States). For all these reasons and more, customers will want to be able to use a safe and secure gambling platform that complies with multi-geographical regulations. </p>



<p>IDnow offers a seamless onboarding process, reducing verification times and increasing compliance with all major European regulations and beyond.</p>

<p>Identity and access management is a nuanced problem. Everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/JustJake/status/1613348687048224769">,hates it</a>, and with good reason.</p>

<p>So, welcome to YeshID’s metaphorical kitchen. Notice it’s spotless! Let’s take a quick tour, and I’ll point out how we do things differently.</p>

<p>Let’s start over there. Do you see the sign “Customers never hacked because of YeshID”? That is where we create the secure foundation for managing the identities of customers, and employees, the services they need to access, and the authentication methods we provide. Notice the minimalism. How simple everything is. Simplicity minimizes mistakes and ensures precision work. No rough cuts or shortcuts here! The chefs use Golang, a simple, fast, statically typed language created by Google to power our backend. </p>

<p>Next is the frontend station. It’s the one with all the colorful spices and ingredients. Do you see the “Dead simple and delightful to use” sign? We want everything that comes out of the YeshID kitchen to be a perfect balance of security and usability. Every step is continuously refined: customer onboarding, deployment, the employee on and offboarding, security, compliance, privacy, and simplicity. We eat with our eyes first and keyboards next.</p>

<p>The next station, the one with the storage islands, charts and whiteboards, lab instruments, and measuring tools, is our metrics station. Here is where we measure everything we do. The goal here is to identify what – exactly – works. How much time did you spend onboarding a new employee? How many clicks did you have to make? What was the employee’s experience? How can we make it easier and more secure for everyone? We try to measure everything and turn it into actionable information so that the next dish is better for everyone.</p>

<p>The last thing I am going to show you is the most important: our team. Our talented chefs work across all stations. Together, we yesh things into existence–building everything from nothing. We’ve built the kitchen and tools; we’re growing the ingredients, and assembling the dishes. We’re obsessed with the customer experience, your experience as an admin, your experience as an employee, and your experience as a user of the YeshID wallet. We constantly iterate on every aspect and try new ingredients, new combinations. We’re never satisfied. This is why one of the values in our metaphorical kitchen, but very real company, we put in our first blog post: “<a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/our-values#:~:text=Innovate%20until%20experience%20%26%20security%20exist%20in%20harmony.">,Innovate until experience &amp; security exist in harmony.</a>”</p>

<p>Our chefs are experienced. They have tasted good dishes and bad ones. They experiment and innovate mixing old ingredients and new, and delight when they create something delicious that no one has ever seen, tasted, or smelled before.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a little about why we felt compelled to start YeshID - the frustration that drove us. </p>

<p>Imagine you are responsible for digitally onboarding new employees to your company, AcmeLabs. You just hired Fred or Sally. And you (or someone charged with that duty) need to assign an @acmelabs email address (and temporary password) for each new hire. They need to make sure that the email and password are sent securely and that the new hire enabled 2FA.</p>

<p>So here’s the classic recipe:</p>
 
   Get the new hire’s personal email address (the one that’s been used in the hiring process) 
   Go to Google Workspace and create a new user account. Assign a user name based on the company’s standard (an alias can be added later) 
   Add the personal email and phone number (if known) as backup contact points. 
   Send an email to the personal email address with a log-in link. 
   When they click the link they’ll have to replace the temporary password with a new one. Yikes! Passwords.
Of course, you’ve set up a domain-wide password policy – the minimum and maximum password length; whether to require strong passwords; how often they expire; Yes, replace a password with a password. And users never make mistakes. And they never forget the passwords that they’ve entered or increment that last digit. Never. And they never let the link expire – like you sent it on Friday and they don’t get to it until Monday. Two weeks from now. Oh never! 
   And of course, you’ve enabled 2FA for the domain. So after they replace a password with a password they have to choose their second authentication method. And that’s not dead simple. It’s easy to screw up and then you’ve got to fix it. 
   By the way, how long a grace period do you give new users before they provide their second authentication method? And do you want to enforce it? Hint: if enforcement and no grace period, then they can’t log in! And if there’s a grace period, what happens when the grace period lapses – as it will? And how many steps do they go through to authenticate with their phone?  
   If you’re using a third-party MFA solution, make sure it’s been installed ahead of time and your new hires already know how to use it, or they’ll get locked out. 
 
<p>Taste good so far? Or is it kind of bitter? And that’s not all of it. There are lots more things that can go wrong.</p>

<p>And will.</p>

<p>And we wonder why 40% of help desk tickets have to do with credentials.</p>

<p>What about YeshID? How do we make it dead simple, completely secure, and delightful to use?</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we share more about our special sauce in upcoming posts.</p>

  Norway joined Israel and Sweden in September 2022 to test the feasibility of CBDCs as a way to facilitate cross-border payments  The Norwegian Central Bank has made the open-source code for its Ethereum-backed digital currency Sandbox available on&nbsp;GitHub.  The second part of the code is yet to come out, while the test network is leveraging Hyperledger Besu now instead of Ethereum.  <p>The prevalence of digital assets and the intensity of the crypto-economy in Norway is at a moderate stage compared to some of its neighboring countries.</p><p>While Swedish and Danish crypto startups have raised 40 million and 32.5 million Euros, respectively, so far from Initial Coin Offerings, Norwegian crypto companies have raised 27 million&nbsp;Euros.</p><p>If we compare Norway’s volume of ICO funds with Lithuania and Estonia, it lags by an even wider margin. For instance, in Lithuania, blockchain startups have raised nearly 1.1 billion Euros, and the figure has touched 285 million in&nbsp;Latvia.</p><p>In terms of the number of blockchain solution providers, Norway has 22, while Denmark has 24, Finland 18, and Latvia 15. The numbers show that while the volume of funds raised in Norway might be less, there is no lack of blockchain solution providers in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>It is in such context that Norway has taken up a CBDC project in collaboration with countries like Israel and&nbsp;Sweden.</p> Project Icebreaker: A Joint Exploration on&nbsp;CBDCs <p>In late 2022, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the Central Banks of Israel, Norway, and Sweden jointly launched Project Icebreaker. The project’s core rationale was to see how Central Bank Digital Currencies can facilitate cross-border payments.</p><p>The banks decided to connect the domestic proof-of-concept CBDC systems and publish the exploration outcome report during the first quarter of&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The architecture of the Icebreaker, a retail CBDC cross-border project, involves five stakeholders: the end user, retailer, FX Provider, Wallet provider, and the Central Bank. The project aims to enable and test the feasibility of immediate retail CBDC payments across borders at a significantly lower cost than traditional systems.</p><p>Norway has long been trying to eliminate any over-dependence on traditional payment systems, significantly cash.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/china-leads-the-digital-currency-future">China Leads the Digital Currency&nbsp;Future</a></p> Norway’s Problems With&nbsp;Cash <p>Trond Bentestuen, a then executive at a major Norwegian Bank DNB, proposed restraints on the use of cash in 2016, citing that the country’s Central Bank could account for only 40% of its use, while 60 percent of the usage was outside of any&nbsp;control.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/KryptonAi/status/1616802801081847809?s=20&amp;t=znDe3u3NZYCahjGaPCVBEw">Image Source</a>)<p>In 2015, another Norwegian bank, Nordea, refused to accept cash except for its Oslo Central Station branch in a similar instance.</p><p>Inclination towards non-cash means of transactions ran parallel to it. However, the country took another six years to launch digital currency initiatives on the&nbsp;ground.</p> The Norwegian CBDC <p>In September 2022, the Norwegian Central Bank made the open-source code for the Ethereum-backed digital currency Sandbox available on GitHub. The second part of the code was decided to be revealed in mid-September 2022. However, it has not come out to&nbsp;date.</p><p>The purpose of the digital currency sandbox was to offer an interface to interact with the test network and enable functions like minting, burning, and transferring ERC-20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>To explain the release of the first phase of the open-source code, the Norwegian Central bank said that it was to offer a good starting point for learning and not to imply that the technology will be based on open-source code.</p><p>At this point, the Norwegian Test Network is not using the public Ethereum ecosystem anymore but leveraging a private version of Hyperledger Besu, an enterprise blockchain.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/indias-cbdc-project-what-is-it-upto">India’s CBDC Project: What is it&nbsp;Upto?</a></p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/MonkerGuy/status/1617638343977885698?s=20&amp;t=znDe3u3NZYCahjGaPCVBEw">Image Source</a>)<p>The Norwegian Central Bank’s principal partner in building the CBDC project’s infrastructure is Nahmii, the developer of a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.</p><p>Overall, the progress of Norwegian CBDC development is yet to reach a state where conclusive opinions around its feasibility can be drawn. Both Project Icebreaker and the country’s domestic CBDC project are still on their way to fruition.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>There has been quite some traction behind the ISO Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL) recently. Many US States have opted to deploy them, it has recently been suggested in the EU digital identity guidance as an initial use case to be supported, and the mDL mdoc format is starting to be supported by other transport protocols such as OIDC4VC.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about various flavours of verifiable credentials on this podcast. Verifiable credentials aim to give broad expressive capacity to digital credentials for a variety of use cases, while the Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL) addresses the particular use case of mobile driving licenses.</p>
<p>One of the things that resonated the most to me in this conversation with Andrew was the fact that mDL has the opportunity to be a powerful tool in credential transformation. What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments today aren’t accustomed to issuing verifiable data to their citizens.&nbsp; And because mobile driver’s licenses are an issuer-oriented standard today, and governments (issuers) are members of the organization that is defining these standards (ISO), there is a clear appetite for them. The thought is that once a use case-specific credential such as a mobile driver’s licence gets issued into the wild, then the next logical step for government issuers is to begin thinking: “Hey! What if I don’t have to issue digital representations of physical documents, but instead start issuing specific claims or attestation?” This is the credential transformation.</p>
<p>Another thing that resonated with me in this conversation was the fact that we need to make sure we separate standard work from implementation work in our discussions, regardless of the standard. Certain features such as privacy, interoperability and security can be built-in, or rather suggested by the standards. It however comes down to implementers to build their solutions around them in the right manner. This also includes how mDL issuers determine how they interact with the large mobile hardware and software vendors (e.g., Apple and Google), who pose risks of walled gardens and control.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Andrew Hughes, we discuss, <br><br></p>
 
 Distinguishing the mobile driving licence (mDL) credential type from a verifiable credential (VC). 
 How the mDL standard is working towards being consumed by other credential transport protocols (e.g., DIDComm, OIDC4VC) 
 Can the same ISO standard for mDL be used to issue non-driving licence credentials? And should it? 
 Do issuers of driving licences consider mDL it as a driving licence credential, or an identity credential? 
 What does the ecosystem look like for mDL vs the one for physical driving licences? Who are some new participants that aren’t involved in physical DL production and governance? 
 Why implementation supersedes the standard work. 
 What are some interesting use cases around mDL that are gaining traction? 
 How ISO works and how the relevant mDL sub-committees are evolving the standard. 
 Are there concerns with the mobile hardware and OS providers gaining too much control over the mDL credentials?

<p>The rise of AI has been imminent for quite some time. What was lacking were commercialized products that are relevant for average users. However, 2023 seems to have offered the first real glimpses of a change on this path — many believe that this will be the breakthrough year for AI as more applications and AI utilities become embedded in our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>With the increased use of AI-based bots, users around the world are relentlessly testing and improving these products – and AI in general. And when it comes to crypto, bots have always been part of the picture. With all these recent developments in mind, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that AI has an undeniable influence on our daily lives.</p>
<p>The rise of a technology like AI, which reduces manual human effort, is probably the next step in human evolution. AI can help bring improvements to various facets of life, and the possibilities are endless. Nevertheless, the drawbacks – and any necessary steps to curb these drawbacks – should also not go overlooked.</p>
 AI for Crypto &amp; Web3 
<p>Bots that utilize AI and machine learning technologies have been used for various purposes within the crypto industry. Anyone with even a superficial interaction with the space will have come across trading bots, anti-spam bots, or similar others that offer unique utilities for users. And with the advent of Web3, the dependency on bots and AI within the crypto industry is bound to increase.</p>
<p>The utilization of AI and its related technology should collectively be beneficial for the crypto community. However, since every coin has two sides, we should always “hope for the best and plan for the worst.”</p>
<p>So what could go wrong with AI or bot usage on Web3 or within crypto communities?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Web3 is more decentralized and democratic than its predecessors. And these inherent properties enable Web3 platforms to ensure that all value created through these platforms will be shared equally by creators, content-makers, and users without any discrimination or bias towards one party.</p>
<p>Imagine a video-sharing platform that viewers can use to earn tokens for the time they spend on the platform and the work they do to suggest improvements to the overall working of the platform.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, an ideal Web3 platform would treat all parties equally. In such an ideal scenario, everyone associated with the platform will have equal stakes on the platform, making it truly decentralized.</p>
<p>However, an ideal scenario is often not the reality. Bots or AI programs created by bad actors, which can mimic human behavior, can take advantage of this parity and skew the stakes of the platform in their favor. Such behavior can distort the decentralization of a platform and tip the balance toward centralization.</p>
<p>Added to that, by gaining an unfair advantage on a platform, exploiters can theoretically influence voting and gain an unfair advantage over the governance rights of other users, making the system even more biased.</p>
<p>Thus, bots and AI programs have the potential to dismantle the two core properties of Web3, which would effectively take it back to Web2.</p>
 SelfKey Can Help 
<p>Web3 users and platforms can win the race before it even starts by not allowing bots to compete with real human users. To achieve this, platforms may need to employ a decentralized human-proof verification process: Only users who pass the verification as real humans should be allowed to share the value of the platform and subsequently take part in its governance.</p>
<p>A decentralized identity ecosystem like the SelfKey ecosystem can help Web3 users and platforms distinguish humans from bots. Users who verify their identity once will be able to use their verified identity across Web3 using NFTs backed by Soulbound NFT technology.</p>
<p>In this way, the SelfKey ecosystem can keep bots in check, allowing the technology to be used for its benefits, and giving peace of mind to users and platforms alike.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The AI revolution is here, and like any other technological advancement that can help humanity, we will need to embrace it. However, the exploitation of AI for unfair advantages on new-age crypto and Web3 platforms needs to be kept in check to promote a more decentralized digital environment.</p>
<p>Recent internet history has shown that humans often <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-03/solana-polygon-are-among-blockchains-being-overrun-by-crypto-trading-bots">cannot successfully compete</a> with bots, as they are constantly active and evolving. This doesn’t mean that bots or AI are fundamentally bad technological advancements. In fact, in most cases, it’s quite the opposite: AI is and will play a more active part in our digital lives, performing countless functions that most humans would either be incapable of or unwilling to perform.</p>
<p>It is foolish to fear AI and attempt to arrest its growth. However, communities need to work on solutions to avoid exploits by bad actors who can wield the power of AI for unfair, biased, and centralized benefits. If we don’t, humans will soon be competing against AI bots seeking to skew decentralized systems in their creators’ favor.</p>
<p>A decentralized identity ecosystem like the SelfKey ecosystem can effectively allow human participants to verify their identity and use their verified identity across Web3. This solution does not sideline or ban the usage of AI but allows Web3 platforms to distinguish bots from humans.</p>
<p>AI technology will constantly evolve, which may one day make bots indistinguishable from humans. However, what defines us as humans is our identity. Using projects like SelfKey, we can use this unique attribute to distinguish ourselves on Web3.</p>
<p>It is imperative that Web3 adopts a decentralized human verification system, much like the SelfKey ecosystem, to fight against the potential threat of AI to the fundamental properties of decentralization and democracy that are embedded in Web3.</p>
<p>Identity verification using the SelfKey ecosystem can make AI and bots work for humans – not the other way.</p>

<p>Today we published Holochain Beta 0.1.0, an app-stable beta release, the next step of our Holochain Beta release sequence.<br><br>This is a major leap in the Holochain development roadmap, and it is one we have been diligently preparing since our first Release Candidate published in December.</p><p>Let’s walk through what this means.</p> What does app stability mean for devs? <p>Over the past years of development as a rapidly iterating project we have introduced new fixes, features, and optimization to our code. In our weekly Holochain alpha releases we have typically pushed new features, structural changes, fixes, and updates, many of which would break functionality in existing applications. App developers frequently had to change their app code to access the new fixes and features. Not an easy environment to develop a fully fledged app in.</p><blockquote>With Holochain Beta, the days of us regularly breaking your code are behind us.</blockquote><p>Now we will be updating a beta 0.1.0 branch of Holochain with non-breaking fixes and features for six months. So you know you won’t have to make changes to your app code to keep it running. We’ll also keep the 0.1.x-compatible bootstrap and proxy services running for that entire time, so people using your hApps will be able to find and connect with each other.</p> Holochain’s second security audit is complete <p><a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">Least Authority</a>, a respected security firm that focuses on decentralized tech recently completed another audit for Holochain. <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-lair-keystore/">Their first audit</a>, completed in December 2022, was of the Lair Keystore. In this second security audit, the Holochain Deterministic Integrity library was reviewed.</p><p>Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) is a hApp developer’s interface with the Holochain framework’s consistency and security model and is crucial in allowing devs to write rules that ensure all nodes make the same conclusions and ultimately reach the same state. This required the auditors to go deep into Holochain itself, analyzing the assumptions embedded in the integrity engine and networking protocol.</p><p>Here is what the Least Authority team published today:</p><blockquote>“Our team performed a comprehensive design review and audit of the Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) crate, a critical component of the Holochain system. Overall, we found the HDI crate to be highly modular and organized in a logical, compartmentalized manner.”</blockquote><p>The report identified one issue, related to a lack of up to date design specifications, which we resolved. If you’re interested to read the findings, <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">the full report</a> is now available.</p> Dev tools coming soon <p>While Holochain Beta 0.1.0 is fully functional, we now need to update the multiple components and developer tools that are affected by the breaking changes introduced by Beta. We expect to have those complete by 9 February. Once that is announced you will be able to start building more easily and with the confidence that will come with our full, integrated dev stack!</p> Preview of new CLI scaffolding tool <p>In preparation for you being able to run stable apps, we’re making it much easier to build and maintain them. One of the new dev tools is a refreshed scaffolder built on feedback from the developer community. It’s useful for both new and experienced hApp devs, offering a command-line-driven process for rapidly creating boilerplate code. This isn’t just back-end DNA code, but also front-end client code (in vanilla, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, and <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a> flavors), tests, and a dev environment setup that keeps all your project dependencies in sync. It also supports custom templates, and we expect that the dev community will come up with all sorts of creative uses for this: templates that target that favorite front-end framework of yours, or NodeJS, or Electron or Rust; templates that bundle popular and maturing <a href="https://hrea.io/">hApp</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/">libraries</a>; and more.</p><p>Eric Harris-Braun, Holochain co-creator and a prolific hApp developer himself, has this to say about the scaffolder:</p><blockquote>"For people who have been in the web app development world for a while, you might remember when Rails came out with its scaffolding, how much of a game changer that was for building Web2 apps—the way you could scaffold an app that runs in literally ten minutes. And what we’ve got coming out will be, I believe, just as powerful for Web3 apps. That gives developers a super powerful ability to just get started."</blockquote> What can you do now? <p>With Beta released now and dev tools targeted to be live by 9 February, we encourage you to start developing fully fledged apps on Holochain. We know that there are many projects who have come to love Holochain over the past years but have been waiting for a beta release before they put significant investment of effort into their app development. Now is the time. Let’s show the world what real Web3 apps look like.</p> Dev Training opportunity <p>Do you know Rust? In March we have a unique education opportunity led by the Co-founder of HackReactor. It is synchronous, <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">online Holochain developer training</a>. Please apply!</p><p>If you’re not a developer consider sending folks to start building your developer team, or help us create direct hiring opportunities for our next crop of alumni. With a stable beta, now is the time to learn and grow with the ecosystem.</p> What’s next? <p>Three key pieces:</p>  We are working on an updated whitepaper, so you can read about the underlying logic behind the code. Keep an eye out for that.  The Holochain team is also already working towards a beta 0.2.0 with enhancements to network security and performance, along with any breaking API, SDK, or protocol changes that are discovered to be necessary or useful. This will be released and run alongside Beta 0.1.x, giving you time for comprehensive testing and migration without a loss of support.  We’ll also be updating the Dev Portal alongside the release of the components and dev tools to reflect these changes and provide an easy learning environment and knowledge base to help you build.

				  Verifiable credentials are a powerful solution for verifying data, but whose verifiable credentials are trustworthy in any given use case? Two solutions to this challenge—Trust Registries and Trust Lists— have emerged from two different organizations. We explain their strengths, weaknesses, and differences, the effort to unite these groups, and how you can get involved in developing both.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Mike Ebert</p>
<p>“How do we know which agents to trust?” is a problem you encounter quickly when creating a decentralized network (“agents” is the generic term for the software that issues, holds and presents, and verifies credentials; think of an “agent” acting on your behalf). Multiple organizations have come up with different answers to this challenge. Two of the most prominent are the Trust Over IP (ToIP) foundation with “Trust Registries,” and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) with “Trust Lists.” Coordination of these efforts has begun; and, at some point in the future, joint and separate work will be defined and duplication will be eliminated in order to provide unified standards for sharing trust information. At the moment, there are some key differences to each organization’s approach.</p>
<p>Trust Registries</p>
<p>To date, a Trust Registry has referred to a solution for sharing trust information via an API: You call the API when you have a question about trust and it provides you with that information, usually one item at a time. Trust Registries also allow for a cached copy of the data when necessary. One strength of a Trust Registry is that it is likely to be up to date: as you are constantly asking questions of the API, you will receive updated data the API has found in real time. But one downside to implementing a Trust Registry based on an API is that it requires a relatively high level of expertise and commitment to develop, host, and maintain.</p>
<p>To use a dictionary as an analogy, you can almost think of a Trust Registry as a search tool for an online dictionary — if you want to know the definition of a specific word, you don’t need to read the entire dictionary to find it.</p>
<p>Trust List</p>
<p>A Trust List is usually described as a solution for sharing trust information through a file-based approach that doesn’t require the heavier support requirements of running or using an API. Being able to publish, retrieve, or load a single file requires less effort for developers than building and maintaining an API. Because copies of the governance file are stored with each software agent, trust data is cached with each one. How often you retrieve that file can be configured, so you might retrieve it once a day or once a month; but whatever the setting, you have caching built in. A huge benefit here is that, should you lose connection to the internet, you can still look up the data you need because it is all stored locally. The tradeoff is that caching can be tricky because you have to consider if your information is recent enough and deal with the possibility that information that has been cached differently by different parties.</p>
<p>To go back to our analogy: With a Trust List, you now have the dictionary in your pocket, so you may need to look through all the words, but you can get the definition of a word without needing an Internet connection.</p>
<p>With a good internet connection, the end user will likely not be able to tell the difference between a Trust Registry and a Trust List; problems may arise for the API-based approach when there is poor internet connection and similarly for a Trust List if cached information differs between downloaded files. Each approach has benefits and tradeoffs that ecosystem builders and developers will have to consider.</p>
<p>How do they come together?</p>
<p>Led by Indicio’s Sam Curren, representatives from both organizations met at the most recent Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) and, through discussion, realized that their goals have a significant overlap. This has led to collaboration on compatible solutions and to ensure minimal or no duplication of effort.</p>
<p>The new goal is a coordinated, agreed-upon data format for sharing trust information. By building on the same data formats, anyone who needs to bridge the gap between API or file based solutions should be able to do so without having to resolve fundamental differences in what is being communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio is working closely with both the DIF and the ToIP Trust Registry Task Force to help define this specification. Indicio also created an <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">open-source governance file editor</a> and is working on open-source reference implementations for how to create, share, interpret, and follow a governance file. Both organizations are likely to stick to their API or file-based approaches as described above, but in providing reference code for delivering trust information in the same format, interoperability between both solutions should be much more achievable.</p>
<p>One useful task for the two organizations would be to agree on a single name, so that people are not confused by artificial distinctions between Trust Registries and Trust Lists. The real differences lie in how the trust information is delivered via an API or a file and not in the core purpose or format.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this conversation, I highly encourage you to get involved in the discussions that are taking place right now as they are shaping the technology. You can find out more information on the ToIP (Trust Registry) solution <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">here,</a> and the DIF (Trust List) solution <a>here.</a></p>

<p>Digital credentials and self-sovereign identity have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a more secure and efficient way to store and share important health information. </p><p>A digital credential (such as the W3C Verifiable Credential) is a tamper-proof, cryptographically secure form of a machine-readable credential. For example, it might be a digital version of your SSN, your passport, or even a concert ticket. Your health records–immunizations, diagnoses for medical conditions, allergies, clinical vitals, lab results, prescriptions, and other health data–can also be represented as verifiable credentials, and therefore, owned and managed by patients themselves.</p><p>In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of using digital credentials in the healthcare industry, including protecting sensitive health data from data breaches, improving patient care with more complete records, and reducing administrative burdens.</p><p>Protecting from Data Breaches<br>Verifiable credentials can secure health data from cyber threats, such as ransomware and data breaches. Health data is often stored in large centralized databases, which are increasingly vulnerable to these threats. With verifiable credentials, it is possible to decentralize the storage of health data to be accessed only by authorized individuals, which greatly reduces the risk of data breaches. This architecture can transform a centralized honeypot–a single point of failure–into a decentralized network supported with multiple points of resiliency and backups to meet high assurance requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights</a> tracks all breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals, as required by section 13402(e)(4) of the HITECH Act. In 2021, there were over 27 million individuals affected by healthcare data breaches. In 2022, reported cases indicate over 48 million individuals affected by breaches, an increase of over 177% since the previous year. </p><p>The total number of incidents has also dramatically increased, with 601 breach incidents reported in 2022, a 226% increase from the 266 breaches reported in 2021. Breaches reported can result from hacking/IT incidents, theft, loss of records, or unauthorized access/disclosures. In most of these scenarios, wrongful access is granted to sensitive health records, either due to human errors, system errors, or lack of security controls. Currently, the individuals whose data is stored in these records are required to trust their healthcare providers and others who handle their sensitive data to have adequate systems in place to prevent unauthorized disclosures or loss of data.</p>An example architectural shift enabled by digital credentials eliminating a central database as the single point of failure.<p>In a new health records system, powered by verifiable credentials, patients would control disclosures and access to their data. Healthcare providers, pharmacies, or insurance companies would be granted access whenever required, but would not need to store a “honeypot” of sensitive health data on their internal servers, nor would they be able to share with any other third parties (either intentionally or unintentionally).</p><p>Better Care through Complete Records<br>Another key benefit of verifiable credentials in healthcare is that they enable patients to control and manage their own health data. Patients can create a portable, secure record of their health information that they can access and share with healthcare providers, insurance companies, and family members as needed. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/nlsoy.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, individuals hold an average of 12.4 different jobs between the age of 18 to 54. With each new job, the employer-sponsored health insurance provider may change, which requires the individual to find and establish new, in-network primary care. It becomes increasingly more difficult to piece together health history records with each new doctor’s office visit, primary care physician, specialty doctor, and same-day care facility. </p><p>Let’s use Alice as an example. Alice is an early 30s young professional who grew up in Florida and now lives in New York. As a child and teenager, Alice saw the same doctor every year for her annual checkups and regular vaccinations. After graduating from high school, she moved to California to attend university and enrolled in the student health insurance plan. She had a vague, but imprecise recollection of receiving different vaccines and, as a result, had to request records be sent from her family doctor in Florida to the university health office. Her new health records covering the care administered for her four years of university are stored in her student profile for the university health system. </p><p>After graduating from university, Alice moves to New York to pursue a career in finance. Her health insurance is now provided by the bank she works for, and Alice needs to find a doctor in New York in that health insurance network. She is no longer a student, so she’s lost access to her university student health portal and has to call the university health office to request that her health records be faxed to the new doctor. She also has to contact her family doctor in Florida to fax records to her new doctor, which can take a few days or even weeks. Between the ages of 22 to 32, Alice changes jobs four times, staying at each job for between two to three years. For each new job, Alice has new health insurance coverage, which requires finding new in-network doctors and repeating the process of requesting her health records over and over again.</p><p>Compared to average American workers, Alice is not a unique, fictional character. According to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?dataView=1&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=employer&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 49% of Americans, or 156 million people, receive health insurance coverage through their employer. Insights from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> show that the average worker tenure for employees aged 25 to 34 is 2.8 years. This means that 156 million people might be faced with establishing new in-network care every 2.8 years as they switch employers and, subsequently, employer-provided health insurance coverage. This results in spotty health records with incomplete care history. </p><p>Alice’s ability to establish care would be simplified dramatically with verifiable credentials allowing her to manage her own health records. Each time Alice needs to visit a new primary care physician, get a routine vaccine, or visit urgent care, it would be a simple, seamless process to share relevant health records and receive new records to store or share in the future. Alice would have a more complete, accurate picture of her health history to help any new doctor, either for routine care or emergency situations, and have all the context required to make informed recommendations for care plans. Medical records currently are often fragmented and incomplete, which can make it difficult for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat patients effectively. Applying self-sovereign identity within healthcare will empower patients to create a comprehensive record of their medical history that can be accessed by healthcare providers, allowing for better diagnosis and care.</p><p>Lowering Healthcare Administrative Costs<br>In addition to the benefits mentioned above, verifiable credentials can also help to reduce administrative burdens and overhead costs for healthcare providers. A study by the American Medical Association and Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system published in the <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-0961?articleid=2546704">Annals of Internal Medicine</a> found that physicians only spend 27% of their office day on direct, patient-facing care time, with 49% of their day spent on electronic health records and administrative paperwork.</p><blockquote>“This study reveals what many physicians are feeling – data entry and administrative tasks are cutting into the doctor-patient time that is central to medicine and a primary reason many of us became physicians,” <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2016/2016-09-06-ama-study-technological-administrative-demands.page">said</a> Steven Stack, M.D, Past-President of the American Medical Association. </blockquote><p>With current systems, healthcare providers must spend a significant amount of time and resources verifying the authenticity of health records and other information, requesting health record transfers from previous care providers, and facilitating health record transfers between patients and insurance companies. Verifiable credentials make this process much more efficient, as the credentials can be easily verified using cryptographic algorithms, and, being fully controlled by the patient, accessed quickly on a need-to-know basis. </p><p>This future state with verifiable credentials powering health records wouldn’t completely eliminate the administrative overhead related to record-keeping, but it would streamline the processes with standardized formats that are easily verified. This can help to free up time and resources that can be used to provide better patient care, while also lowering overhead costs for healthcare providers–including fees paid to cloud service providers</p><p>—</p><p>Digital credentials have the potential to significantly improve the healthcare industry by providing a secure and efficient way to store and share important health information. They enable patients to control their own health data, create a full medical history, and protect sensitive health information from cyber threats. As the use of verifiable credentials continues to grow, we can expect to see many more applications of this technology in the healthcare industry. </p><p>Healthcare is just one example–virtually every industry that relies on data storage and record-keeping can be supercharged with verifiable credentials and similar technologies. Watch this space as we explore use cases across different industries.</p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Shyft Network — Token Distribution and Economics Update <p>More than a year has passed since the launch of SHFT, a time of excitement, challenges, achievements, and hard work. Our community and partners have been highly supportive of our mission to power trust on the blockchain through data discoverability and compliance while preserving privacy and sovereignty. The economics behind our Shyft Network token SHFT reflects this mission and our vision for the ecosystem's future.</p> The Hard Facts (Jan 26, 2023&nbsp;)   Initial SHFT supply: 2,500,000  Currently at block <a href="https://bx.shyft.network/">8,884,061</a>  Current SHFT circulation: <a href="https://circulatingsupply.shyft.network/">595473894.1127162</a> (Tokens that have been unlocked and claimed.)  Current SHFT unlocked: 951,904,687 on Jan 26, 2023 (As, for example, yield wrap and AMM solutions have not been launched yet — unlocked tokens are accumulated and are not distributed. Thus, even as they are unlocked — they have not been touched and have not reached the market/users but may be introduced upon the launch of yield wrap programs. Also, it includes unlocked SHYFT treasury&nbsp;tokens)  Maximum SHFT supply: 2,520,000,000  Projections: month 33 (Dec 2023), SHFT circulation 1,745,981,345 (conditioned to inflation rate remaining constant at 6%&nbsp;p.a.)  Node Inflation rate: set at 6% of the initial universe, released on a per-block basis, perpetually  <p>The initial supply for SHFT at the time of launch was 2,500,000. At the time of writing (Jan 26, 2023), the circulating supply of SHFT tokens was <a href="https://circulatingsupply.shyft.network/">595473894.1127162</a>. The current circulating supply only accounts for the number of tokens released (per the token release scheduled) and&nbsp;claimed.</p><p>It is important to note that if SHFT tokens are unlocked but remain unclaimed, they won't be included in the circulating supply.</p><p>A <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/d/36-circulating-supply-calculation-change-discussion-pre-proposal">proposal to change the way the circulating supply is </a>calculated is being debated in Shyft DAO. If the community approves the proposal, the SHFT circulating supply will include all tokens released per the schedule, regardless of whether the tokens are&nbsp;claimed.</p> SHFT Token: The Fuel That Powers Shyft Ecosystem <p>Made publicly available on Polkastarter on Mar 26, 2021, Shyft Network's native token, SHFT, is available on two blockchains:</p>  As the native layer 1 token for the Shyft Network blockchain, and  As an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC20 token is a wrapped version of the native SHFT&nbsp;token.  <p>Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) use the native layer 1 SHFT token to pay for the gas fees required to post attestations on Veriscope, the only frictionless Travel Rule Solution in the market, and comply with the FATF Travel Rule. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1593651955506757638?t=XIsjuHd74Bpti8lJvKCb0Q&amp;s=19">here</a> to find out more about attestations. Additionally, it is expected that users will be able to use SHFT tokens to pay for some fees for the DeFi solutions launching soon on the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>SHFT tokens can also be used for governance. Token holders can exercise their right to vote on Shyft DAO proposals.</p> Token Distribution <p>The SHFT token supply was divided into multiple allocations prior to distribution. Each allocation was attributed to a specific set of activities designed to benefit the Shyft community and network. The distribution ratio was also entered into the token distribution contract to ensure transparent and automated distribution. The distribution is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p> Next-Gen DeFi <p>5.8% of the maximum supply of SHFT token supply, which is 146,093,916 SHFT, is reserved for Next-Gen DeFi projects that are expected to be built atop the native Shyft Network. The distribution of Next-Gen DeFi funds will begin in the 39th month from the date of the public launch of the SHFT token (Mar 26, 2021) and will continue over the next 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>Each month, between months 39 and 50, 12,174,493 SHFT tokens will be unlocked for Next-Gen DeFi and added to the circulating supply. At the time of the publication (Jan 26, 2023), which is month 22, no Next-Gen DeFi reserved SHFT tokens have been unlocked.</p> Wrap Yield <p>The Wrap Yield fund is expected to reward users holding Shyft Network-wrapped ERC-20 assets to incentivize user participation. A total of 117,282,495 SHFT tokens have been allocated to Wrap Yield, which is 4.65% of the token&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Each month, between months 1 and 120, 977,354.13 SHFT tokens will be unlocked for the Wrap Yield and may be added to the circulating supply as per the product launch timeline after the unlocks. Currently (month 22, Jan 26, 2023), the number of unlocked Wrap Yield reserved SHFT tokens is 21,501,790.75 SHFT.</p> AMM Yield <p>The AMM Yield fund incentivizes liquidity providers in SHFT liquidity pools. A total of 150,000,000 SHFT tokens have been allocated to AMM Yield, which is 5.95% of the token&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Each month, between months 1 and 180, 833,333.33 SHFT tokens will be unlocked for the AMM Yield and may be added to the circulating supply as per the product launch timeline after the unlocks. Currently (month 22, Jan 26, 2023), the number of unlocked AMM Yield reserved SHFT tokens is 18,333,333.33.</p> VASP Ecosystem Initializer <p>The VASP Ecosystem Initializer is reserved for promoting Shyft's Travel Rule-related products by incentivizing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). A total of 875,000 SHFT tokens have been allocated, which is 0.03% of the token&nbsp;supply.</p><p>These tokens were unlocked according to the following schedule:</p>  125,000 were unlocked in the second month that followed the&nbsp;launch  125,000 were unlocked in the third&nbsp;month.  The remaining 625,000 were unlocked in the fourth month, totaling 875,000&nbsp;tokens.  <p>All VASP Ecosystem Initializer reserved tokens have been unlocked.</p> Shyft Treasury <p>Shyft Treasury holds 166,260,215 SHFT tokens, representing 6.60% of the token supply. It consists of the unallocated SHFT tokens reserved for Shyft's partners, advisors, etc. The treasury will continue to hold onto these assets until it allocates them per their pre-decided purpose. So far, this allocation has not been unlocked.</p> Economic Metagame <p>With economic metagame, if a user wraps a token from one ecosystem (e.g., ERC20) to another (e.g., Shyft Network), a similar amount of SHFT tokens would automatically be burned from the economic metagame allocation. This automated action is designed to reward users for wrapping their&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>504,000,000 SHFT tokens, which is 20% of the token supply, have been set aside for the economic metagame. Depending on how many tokens users wrap to different ecosystems, these tokens would be burned over the next two years from the SHFT token public launch&nbsp;date.</p><p>To date, this allocation remains untouched. However, to preserve the allocation's original use, all 504,000,000 tokens will continue to be allocated to the economic metagame until the allocation is exhausted.</p> Core Team <p>450,000,000 SHFT tokens (17.86%) have been reserved for the Shyft core team. The distribution begins from the 24th month and will continue over 12 months with a monthly tranche of 37,500,000 tokens.</p><p>No Core Team reserved SHFT tokens have been unlocked by the date of this publication (Jan 26,&nbsp;2023).</p> Advisors <p>Our advisors have been valuable partners in Shyft Network's development. To reward them for their unparalleled support, we have reserved 110,251,147 tokens, which is 4.38% of the maximum supply of Shyft Network's tokens.</p><p>The distribution began on the 13th month from the public launch date (Mar 26, 2021), with 6,125,063.72 SHFT tokens unlocked &amp; released to advisors, followed by a 6-month pause. It resumed again on the month 20th (Nov. 2022) and is expected to continue release, in equal monthly installments of 6,125,063.72 SHFT tokens released until month&nbsp;36th.</p><p>At the current time, the number of unlocked tokens allocated to Advisors is 24,500,254.89 SHFT.</p> Partnerships <p>While building the network's critical infrastructure, Shyft has inked many strategic partnerships with development teams and advisory entities. The goal is to expand the use cases of the Shyft Network and, respectively, the SHFT&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Shyft Network has reserved 127,334,060 SHFT tokens for strategic partnerships, which is 5.05% of the maximum supply of SHFT tokens. The distribution of tokens from the strategic partnership reserve will occur in two distribution cycles.</p><p>A total of 18,083,515 SHFT tokens were released in the first distribution cycle, which was only one month long, followed by a six-month pause. The second distribution cycle began in April 2022, the 13th month from the public launch date, and will end in February 2024. The amount of tokens released every month during the second distribution cycle&nbsp;varies.</p><p>Between March 2022 and February 2023, 3,389,739.94 SHFT tokens will be released monthly. Then, 7,973,071.27 SHFT tokens will be released in March 2023, the 24th month from the public launch&nbsp;date.</p><p>Between April 2023 and August 2023, 7,298,071.27 tokens will be released monthly. Next, from September 2023 to February 2023, 4,583,333.3 SHFT tokens will be released monthly. By then, the Partnerships reserve will be completely exhausted.</p><p>Currently, the volume of unlocked SHFT tokens from the Partnership reserve is 51,980,894.40.</p> Strategic Purchasers <p>Strategic purchasers fulfill the mandatory bonding requirements to enable the Shyft Network's interoperability bridge layer to function. It can be network participants, industry partners, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>134,215,584 SHFT tokens have been reserved for strategic purchasers, which is 5.33% of the maximum supply of SHFT tokens. The SHFT tokens from the Strategic Purchasers reserve will be unlocked in four cycles of varying lengths, starting in April 2021 with the release of 333,333 SHFT&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>In the second token distribution cycle (July 2021 to August 2022), a total of 91,239,394.06 SHFT tokens were unlocked, whereas in the third one (December 2022), 250,000 SHFT tokens were unlocked. The fourth distribution cycle will begin in January 2024 and end in September 2024, and 42,392,857 SHFT tokens will be unlocked during this period, exhausting the Strategic Purchasers' reserve in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>The Strategic Purchasers reserve SHFT tokens unlocked as of this date are 91,822,727.06.</p> Public Distribution <p>2,500,000 tokens which is 0.10% of the maximum supply of SHFT tokens, were distributed through Shyft Network Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on <a href="https://www.polkastarter.com/pools/">Polkastarter</a>, which took part on Mar 26,&nbsp;2021.</p> Purchasers <p>507,987,583 SHFT tokens, or 20.16% of the total supply of SHFT tokens, have been reserved for purchasers. They bought SHFT tokens before the launch date, which was Mar 26, 2021. The allocation began in March 2022 and will continue until June&nbsp;2023.</p><p>To date, 380,990,686.64 SHFT tokens have been distributed to purchasers.</p> Token Reserve&nbsp;(People) <p>103,200,000 SHFT tokens, or 4.10% of the entire supply of SHFT tokens, have been reserved for Token Reserve, which is meant to facilitate liquidity across the Shyft ecosystem. The Token Reserve was fully exhausted after four months of the public&nbsp;launch.</p> Inflation <p>Similar to real-world currencies, Shyft Network's native token, SHFT, too, is influenced by inflation. The rate at which the SHFT tokens will be released yearly has been fixed at 6% per&nbsp;annum.</p><p>SHFT tokens are subjected to three types of inflation: Staking — Adjusted Inflation, DAO — Adjusted Inflation, and Nodes — Adjusted Inflation. Each of these inflation sub-types contributes 2%, bringing the total inflation rate to 6%&nbsp;p.a.</p><p>To address the block-wise inflation, 11,767,813 SHFT tokens are added per month to the circulating supply, which is less than the expected amount of 12,600,000 SHFT tokens if we go by the 6% annual inflation rate.</p><p>…</p><p>You can find our Shyft Network block explorer here: <a href="https://bx.shyft.network/">Shyft POA Explorer </a>For updated information on Shyft Network's token supply, please check out <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shyft-network/">Shyft Network, SHFT live marketcap, chart, and info | CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

			  Laurie Cappelle is a Digital Marketing Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello everyone, I am Laurie, and I am 23 years old. I was born in the north of France, close to Lille, where I have studied almost all my life, but I have always loved traveling, so I finished studying in Italy, and Spain. I am now living in Granada, Spain, and I love the city. During my free time I love to go to hike, take pictures and spend time on social media. </p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>After having studied business administration, I realized that what I really liked was marketing, so I decided to do a master in marketing. When I saw that a position was available at Tokeny, I immediately thought that it would be a good opportunity for me. Effectively, I would help in all the domains of marketing and would learn a lot of things. Moreover, even though I did not know much about blockchain and tokenization, I always thought that it was interesting. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is fascinating, I am learning new things every day, as well about marketing as about the blockchain and tokenization world. Moreover, all the colleagues are really nice and helpful, they are always here to help if we need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, it is a pleasure to see that the company is doing its best to be flexible and for us to feel good at work, and we have colleagues coming from all over the world. </p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>My passion is traveling. I love discovering new cultures, languages, food, landscapes, and cities. I also really enjoy taking pictures and sharing them on social media.</p>
<p>Moreover, I like learning languages. I speak fluent French, Spanish and English, a bit of Italian, and I am learning Russian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate learning new things and, since I started working at Tokeny, I have been discovering the blockchain universe and the potential it has into the financial world.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I just want to be happy, having the people that I love close to me and traveling to the most places possible. I think that everyone should be able to have a happy life living where they want to live and working of something they like. </p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I see that Tokeny is growing very fast and that the tokenization sector is only at its beginning. I believe that Tokeny has a bright future and will help to revolutionize the banking sector, and I am glad to do my internship here. </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Identity and Authentication</p>
<p>Digital transformation can be defined as a process that organizations go through to deliver digital services to their customers and consumers in the Digital Age. Essentially, delivering digital services requires the management of the digital identities of consumers, customers, and business partners in a secure and seamless manner. Therefore, the success of digital transformation initiatives depends on managing access and managing these digital identities.</p>
<p>In contrast to the increased centralization of digital identity, the authentication layer has become more complex and fragmented. However, it's important to understand the difference between identity and authentication before we get into passwordless authentication. Identity is who you are. Identity proofing is about knowing whether someone is who he or she claims to be. It's the process of verifying the identity of users based on life history, biometrics, and other factors before granting them access to an application or system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, authentication is an ongoing identity-proofing process that ensures both the identity of digital users and the integrity of their devices. Nevertheless, disruptive login experiences and the continued reliance on passwords are creating significant challenges for consumers and enterprises. As a result, organizations are starting to adopt new authentication mechanisms that go beyond the traditional username and password. This passwordless approach leverages public-key encryption and open standards to offer greater flexibility and increase both security and convenience.</p>
<p>The Birth of Passwordless</p>
<p>In today's digital world, identity theft and credential-based attacks are some of the most pressing concerns for companies and consumers alike. For years, the use of passwords as the primary method of authentication has made identity a nuisance in the digital world. Since data breaches are often the result of stolen credentials and compromised passwords, organizations are looking to adopt more modern forms of authentication that can help close the security gaps that are associated with the use of passwords.</p>
<p>As a result of the security risks and inconvenience of passwords, businesses and organizations are starting to embrace passwordless authentication technologies. The evolution of passwordless was driven by the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Single sign-on (SSO). The combination of these two technologies, coupled with the exponential growth in smartphone use and the development of open standards such as FIDO2 and WebAuthn has further generated adoption of passwordless systems.</p>
<p>Legacy MFA solutions were supposed to solve the problem with passwords, but these still rely on the password as a backup or first factor of authentication. MFA requires users to provide two or more factors in order to be authenticated: something they are, something they have, and something they know. Unfortunately, some of these factors are prone to phishing attacks, such as mobile SMS codes, voice calls, push notifications, and one-time passcodes (OTP).</p>
<p>SSO is an authentication method that allows a user to enter one set of login credentials (such as name and password) in order to access multiple applications. With an SSO mechanism in place, users only need to authenticate themselves once regardless of which applications or websites they access. While SSO can be paired with password-based authentication, integrating it with passwordless access is the key to unlocking its full potential.</p>
<p>Separating Authentication from Identity</p>
<p>Organizations must choose between adopting a single identity platform or maintaining multiple fragmented identity systems as they move to the cloud. The separation of authentication from identity providers is being implemented by businesses and organizations in order to fully leverage passwordless technologies. It is important for passwordless technologies to have a passwordless authentication layer in front of the various access management systems.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication should work across everything –all attack surfaces and identity sources, apps and devices, the VPN, SSO, Azure AD, operating systems, workspaces, servers, and whatever your organization has in place. Some solutions in the market are using passwordless at the device, and then federating to other access management services or directly into applications.</p>
<p>Separating identity and authentication is a very important thing. If implemented successfully, organizations will provide their users with a frictionless user experience and a consistent authentication approach. In addition, IT teams will no longer be overburdened with managing multiple identity and MFA products. Thus, fully leveraging the potential of passwordless technologies.</p>

<p>There is a classic juxtaposition within security controls. Organizations need to make data and services available, but if it’s too easily accessible, too open, then a data breach can occur. On the other hand, if data and services are too restricted then the controls are marginalized and ignored. Organizations struggle with balancing the risk between easy access and advanced controls. Whichever approach is taken impacts the user experience, and both can lead to less than desirable results if done poorly.</p>
<p>I’ve asked many IT professionals if they consider the end user when implementing a new security protocol. Surprisingly the answer is often, they don’t. The reasoning for my question is simple. If you know more about the users being asked to perform the task, the task can be implemented with less friction.</p>
<p>Friction, or the user experience, is a critical consideration to security. To achieve the desired security outcome, IT organizations must understand and develop with their customers’ motivations and behaviors in mind. In doing so, the intended ask will be met with less resistance and higher adoption, therefore improving overall security.</p>
 Why SSO Is Still A Must 
<p>Let’s clarify with something first – SSO is still a must in an enterprise infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>An end user will not type in their credentials for every access point. But, SSO in its current form and with 2FA or MFA as part of the access flow does not meet Zero Trust standards. And this construct ties back into what I started with above. Organizations need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a proactive security approach that continuously verifies users, devices, and services before trusting them. This approach is commonly summarized as “never trust, always verify”. Essentially, Zero Trust assumes that anything connecting to a system is a potential threat that should be verified before earning trust. But to do that security teams need to know as much about the identity accessing the resources as possible. Without this fundamental knowledge of identity, security is more hope-based than fact-based and impacts the effectiveness of a Zero Trust architecture.</p>
<p>On its own, the Zero Trust sounds like it will cause friction at the time of user access, a poor user experience. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Many of the access types that are in existence are here because the end users are creating poor passwords. These passwords can be hacked or even phished. So the transition to a Zero Trust architecture can be an opportunity for organizations to improve the user experience and implement technologies that improve security and improve user experience at the same time.</p>
<p>How can that be done? With Identity. What does identity have to do with Zero Trust architecture? It’s a pillar of the Zero Trust architecture because when you verify user identity at each point of access, you proactively verify users before a breach can happen. This is in line with the “never trust, always verify” core principle of Zero Trust. But to securely authenticate a user, one must first implement an indisputable identity proofing process. Because an indisputable proofed ID must involve the triangulation of a user claim with biometrics. Implementing this element of identity management will ensure that every access attempt is tied to a trusted and verified identity.</p>
<p>The result is a secure access infrastructure that is based on verified identities tied to the user’s biometrics. So instead of using passwords and trying to secure them with additional authentication methods, the user’s identity becomes the access method.</p>
 1Kosmos Supports Zero Trust and a Better User Experience 
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring identity into the security forefront so that organizations implementing a Zero Trust infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This identity pre proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and high level of identity assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dixit and I am from New Delhi,&nbsp;India.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. <p>I am a blockchain enthusiast and also a web developer. Outside of tech and development, I also have a good experience working in marketing and communications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am the community manager for Ontology, India and I joined in December 2021. I communicate with the Indian community members and provide them with updates in Hindi Language. I also manage the Ontology, India Twitter account. I find this is an interesting activity because it allows me to interact directly with Ontology’s close-knit Indian community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I think the fact that Ontology has been growing continuously for 5 years now is what makes it stand out from other blockchains. This shows that the team is focused on continuous innovation and is here for the long term, which is particularly important during challenging market conditions such as those we’re currently facing.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I’m really impressed by the ONT and ONG token models. Both models have separate functionalities but they still work together in harmony. The low gas fees and flexible API also attract users — so I see huge value in those elements of Ontology&nbsp;too.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The most important moment for my career so far was taking the time to really understand Ethereum in 2016. Despite being involved in Bitcoin since 2014, my ideas in the space were limited to scalability infrastructure or payment systems for Bitcoin. After truly understanding how smart contracts worked, however, my mind was opened to all the possibilities of financial and non-financial systems that could be fully run on a blockchain.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>Coming into the cryptocurrency world was the best move I made and worked for. The past few years have been life changing for me, thanks to blockchain.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-community-manager-for-india-dixit-bb4ae1db5161">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Community Manager for India, Dixit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This article was based on <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/UNCEFACT%20JSON%20LD%20Web%20Vocab_0.pdf">Transmute Solutions Architect Nis Jespersen’s ‘UN/CEFACT Linked Data’ presentation</a> from December&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Leading the UN Web Vocabulary project, I presented at the December 2022 UN/CEFACT Forum. The UN Forum sessions are not recorded, so I thought I would just capture the main points in this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The essential part of my presentation was a live demo, building a supply chain knowledge graph from the bottom up. In doing so, I gradually introduced the full tech stack in&nbsp;play:</p>  The essentials of APIs, JSON and JSON&nbsp;Schema  Adding semantics with JSON Linked&nbsp;Data  Building Knowledge Graphs from LD&nbsp;files  The important role of standardized Web Vocabularies  <p>I typically also talk about Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers. But not this time — this is all about UN semantics and data&nbsp;graphs.</p> Introducing The UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary <p>The UN/CEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay model is the undisputed semantic model for terms in global trade. It has been around for decades, and is broadly recognized, adopted and implemented.</p><p>UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary brings this model to the web, expressing the existing trade terms as a library of so-called Unique Resource Identifiers — URIs.</p><a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/</a><p>The above example shows the definition of the term Trade Party, behind the URI <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/TradeParty">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/TradeParty</a>. The URI itself is great for unambiguously express intent; resolving it to the above documentation page makes it human understandable too.</p><p>We will come back to the UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary shortly and why it matters. But for proper context, we will start a couple of layer down the tech stack, level-setting on some API essentials.</p> APIs, JSON and JSON&nbsp;Schema <p>Since you are reading this, there is a pretty good chance that you have heard of APIs&nbsp;before.</p><p>An API is a way for computer systems to communicate over HTTP. It is the same protocol serving you this article right now, an API is just tailored to be invoked by computers instead of humans. This is done by stripping away all the graphical elements and putting more emphasis on the structure of&nbsp;data.</p> JSON Schema, Defining&nbsp;Data <p>APIs are made up of “endpoints”, each of which can define a data structure for what you sent to it (the request)&nbsp;, and another data structure for what you can expect to get back (the response). A definition of such a data structure is called a schema. Typically, data gets encoded in the JSON syntax, so you can think of an API endpoint consisting of a Request JSON Schema and a Response JSON&nbsp;Schema.</p>The Request and Response JSON Schemas of a sample&nbsp;API.<p>Each JSON Schema defines for example hierarchical structures and naming of attributes. Note that a JSON Schema does not contain data — only how data must be structured.</p> JSON, the Actual&nbsp;Data <p>JSON files carry actual data. JSON is just a file format, much like&nbsp;.doc or&nbsp;.txt. A JSON file can be validated against a JSON Schema — this is how an API controls what data gets exchanged.</p><p>While JSON is designed for data transfers, it is also quite readable by&nbsp;humans:</p> {<br>  "id": "https://sales.online-shop.global/inv/0000112318",<br>  "type": "TradeTransaction",<br>  "applicableTradeSettlement": {<br>    "type": "HeaderTradeSettlement",<br>    "invoiceDocument": {<br>      "id": "urn:uuid:9c3c66a6-f49f-485e-a7b2-013fb4a0e0a8",<br>      "type": "Document"<br>    },<br>    "invoicerParty": {<br>      "id": "did:web:online-shop.global",<br>      "type": "TradeParty",<br>      "postalAddress": {<br>        "type": "TradeAddress",<br>        "attentionOf": "Nis",<br>        "streetName": "Runebergs Alle",<br>        "cityName": "Copenhagen",<br>        "countryName": "Denmark"<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "invoiceeParty": {<br>      "type": "TradeParty",<br>      "postalAddress": {<br>        "type": "TradeAddress",<br>        "streetName": "Sunshine Ave",<br>        "cityName": "Austin",<br>        "countrySubDivisionName": "Texas",<br>        "countryName": "USA"<br>      }<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>Unless you have a severe case of code-allergy, you should intuitively get the gist of this JSON file: “Trade Transaction”, “Invoicer Party” and “Invoicee Party” — this is a something about an&nbsp;invoice.</p><p>If you know UN/CEFACT you might even recognize the exact terms used. Trade Transaction, for example, means something very specific to those who “speak the UN/CEFACT language”. Such a common language helps the developer on the receiving side interpret the data according to the sender’s intention.</p><p>While such a “common language” is much better than nothing, the human interpretation aspect entails certain challenges:</p>  Costly, as developers must make data mappings on “both sides” of the&nbsp;API.  Error prone, because all human involvement is, even assuming alignment to a common specification is established.  Does not scale, if you have 10 customers using your API, they must each have a developer team doing data mapping 10 times&nbsp;over.  API breaking, a live API cannot just be changed to align to UN/CEFACT will without breaking the API contract (JSON Schemas), greatly displeasing your customers.  <p>While many organization accept these shortfalls of working with raw JSON, there is a much smarter way,&nbsp;namely…</p> JSON Linked&nbsp;Data <p>What traditional integration developers do is add the context needed for the target computer to work with the data. JSON-LD allows the sender to add this context. Literally, using a keyword called @context. The context maps the “human friendly” terms used in the JSON to “machine friendly” URIs.</p><p>In non-technical terms: when the sender is more explicit, it is less ambiguous for the receiver to understand the&nbsp;message.</p><p>Adding context switches from “encode once, interpret anywhere” to “interpret once, understand everywhere” which is great for scalability economics.</p><p>Even better: adding a line with the@context definition into your JSON doesn’t even break your existing APIs! If the receiver does not have JSON-LD support, the JSON library will just ignore this attribute.</p><p>As an example, the invoiceDocument attribute in the earlier example really isn’t anything but a string. But the @context maps this to a computer-friendly URI such as <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/invoiceDocument,">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/invoiceDocument</a>.</p><p>The example below was the first live demo of my presentation. It shows how adding just the@context lets the Linked Data processor automatically structure the&nbsp;data.</p>Adding an @context statement to the JSON (left) makes the data processable by a computer&nbsp;(right).<p>To recap: with very little effort, we can add precise semantics to our data. We make the data meaningful. Our next step will be to turn that meaning into knowledge.</p> Knowledge Graphs <p>The JSON-LD processing we just saw above actually picks apart the JSON, turning it into individual basic statements. Each statement is called a triple, because the consists of three things: subject, predicate and&nbsp;object.</p><p>For example: “The consignment’s (subject) consignor (predicate) is a business called Global Online Shop (object)”.</p><p>Another triple could be “Global Online Shop’s location is the UN/LOCODE DKCPH”.</p><p>We can piece together these two statements: Consignment — Global Online Shop — DKCPH. This way we can infer that the consignment is going to Copenhagen. The JSON-LD file is actually a data graph, which we are traversing for insights.</p>How a sample Bill of Lading data snippet turns into a data graph with&nbsp;JSON-LD.<p>The above diagram illustrates the data graph aspects of a Bill of Lading document which could be transferred through any standard API. But because JSON-LD is based on URIs (and not vague strings like “a business called Global Online Shop”), the graph does not have to be limited to just one JSON file. Say we have another API which deals with invoices, and we route inbound messages to a graph database. A graph database can recognize common URIs and easily deal with overlapping graph segments. This way, we can continuously piece together larger and deeper data&nbsp;graphs.</p>Data graphs from two separate JSON-LD files “snap together”.<p>The above example is also derived from my live demo. By importing a Commercial Invoice “on top of” the previously imported Bill of Lading, we realize&nbsp;that:</p>  The consignee of one document is the same organization as the invoicer party of the&nbsp;other.  We expanded the common knowledge of this organization, now knowing both its postal address and UNLOCODE.  <p>We did this with literally no manual data mapping. The knowledge graph just “snaps”into place like&nbsp;magnets.</p>A knowledge graph constructed from very large amounts of JSON-LD files. Pretty-looking knowledge graph on the right curtesy of https://medium.com/@annalienk/investigation-of-the-flow-of-tweets-d0b1c31d915b.<p>This means we can dump massive amounts of JSON-LD files at the graph database. Data can come from different origins, APIs, data schemas, etc — it will all still snap together automatically. A key feature of graph databases is their ability to reveal hidden relationships across siloed&nbsp;data.</p> Extracting Knowledge <p>Not having to worry about the hassle of fitting data together, we can focus our efforts on data analysis. We can do this with standard data queries. For example “return all consignments to be delivered in Denmark”.</p><p>In my final demo at the UN/CEFACT Forum I it took it a step further, though, introducing some basic data science tooling. This means applying graph algorithms and machine learning on the data graph’s explicit relationships, in the search for its implicit relationships. I used Neo4j’s Graph Data Science which offers rich library of such features.</p><p>Specifically, I ran the Betweenness Centrality graph algorithm on the knowledge graph we created earlier, build from a Bill of Lading and a Commercial Invoice. The result is illustrated graphically below:</p>Betweenness Centrality algorithm applied on the previous&nbsp;example.<p>This result reveals how often shortest paths between nodes pass through a given each node. Unsurprisingly, the “Global Online Shop” node scores high — remember, this was the node which connected the two subgraphs.</p><p>Data scientists typically connect multiple graph algorithms in their search for patterns. Here are links to a couple of examples which I have shared in earlier articles:</p>Determining untrusted subgraphs of the UN Trust&nbsp;Graph.<p>Determination of Verifiable Credential data originating from untrusted subgraphs, based on the UN Trust Graph concept:<br><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678</a></p>Trade Party Community Detection.<p>Trade Party Community Detection, determined from running a series of graph algorithms on basic verifiable credential issuance patterns: <br><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78</a></p> Semantics is Everything <p>We have now gone through the whole tech stack and at the same time progressed from Data to Meaning to Knowledge.</p><p>Without semantic context, raw data is meaningless. Traditional APIs depend on human intuition and labor to make sense of data. But we have seen how simple it is instead to add an explicit, declarative context and let computers do all the hard&nbsp;work.</p><p>When meaning is automated, we can be much more flexible with our data sources yet still shift our attention to gaining knowledge. With all those previously disparate datasets now connected, by leveraging modern algorithms we can extend our knowledge into the implicit relationships, answering questions we would have never thought to&nbsp;ask.</p><p>Web vocabularies provide the common definition of meaning, and strong web vocabularies are vital to this new infrastructure. The best web vocabularies are governed by authoritative institutions, which are relevant for the domain they define. This way, they gain gravitational critical mass and become not only formal, but also de-facto standards.</p><p>Lending from UN/CEFACT’s decades-long established authority, the UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary is the undisputed global semantic dictionary for terms in&nbsp;trade.</p><p><a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/</a></p>UN/CEFACT, now available as Linked&nbsp;Data<p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

<p>Munich, January 26, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, welcomes Bertrand Bouteloup to the management team as its new Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). Based in France, he will assume the group-wide commercial end-to-end responsibility.</p>



<p>For the last six years, Bertrand held the position of Vice President of Sales at ARIADNEXT, the French market leader for identity proofing, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-and-french-identity-technology-provider-ariadnext-combine-to-create-leading-pan-european-identity-verification-platform/">which was acquired by IDnow in June 2021</a>. Prior to that, Bertrand was Global Director of the Cybersecurity Business Unit at Capgemini, then European Director of Security Services at Unisys, and Managing Director of 8-i, a consulting and integration company. He will be employing his more than 15 years of management experience in the IT industry in his new role as CCO of IDnow.</p>



<p>Bertrand’s previous position of Vice President of Sales within the IDnow group will be filled by Cyril Patou, who most recently held the position of Regional Director for France, Alps and Southern Europe at Clear Skye. Cyril has over six years of experience in the digital identity sector, having worked for One Identity and Ping Identity in France.</p>



<p>Commenting on his appointment, Bertrand said:&nbsp;“I am delighted to be taking on this new challenge within the IDnow group and to drive our revenue targets in 2023 and beyond. As a group, we want to continue to grow closer together and leverage our expertise in the German and French market across borders. One of my priorities will be to bring the different commercial teams closer together, and harmonize targets and processes even further.”</p>



<p>“I have known Bertrand for several years now and I look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as Chief Commercial Officer. His many years of managerial experience in the identity verification and cybersecurity industry, coupled with his understanding of our company values and his vision for our future with a strategic and business-led approach, means that he is the perfect match for this role,” added Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>

<p>Have you received a new payment card either in the mail or from a branch recently? You may have noticed that many financial institutions are transitioning away from using embossing machines for personalization, and toward flat card technology. Is now the right time for your institution to make the move to flat cards? As we enter a new era for consumer payments, reimagining your card design can maximize efficiency and brand impact to give you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Review your fleet for maximum efficiency</p>
<p>To fully understand your efficiency, it’s important to evaluate the total cost of ownership, or TCO. TCO is an estimation of all the cumulative expenses associated with purchasing and operating a product. The TCO will provide a way to measure how efficient your current operations are and where you can lift the efficacy of your current technology to outperform what was done previously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With inflation still high and supply-chain, logistical, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/emv-chip-shortages-putting-a-strain-on-your-bottom-line-increasing-the-durability-of-the-payment-cards-you-offer-might-help/">EMV chip shortage</a> challenges persisting, now is an ideal time to make the move to flat cards for your efficiency and brand. Does your current setup prepare you for your continued success in the time of flat card innovation? Are you considering eco-friendliness and durability before you make your next big purchase? Are you taking full advantage of your cards from a branding and personalization perspective? If you are curious about answers to these questions, you are at the right place. Let’s start reviewing what to consider for your financial institution.</p>
 
 Review your total cost of ownership and identify where you can improve your efficiency. Is your system supported by best-in-class standards for hardware, software, and service? How efficient and durable are your system and its supplies? Find your best possible option in the market to elevate your operations. 
 Take control of your future by starting out with the right solution. Does your solution support modularity to enable future development and innovation into your current fleet? Making the right first choice helps you establish a better fleet, and you don’t have to start all over when there is a new technology in the market. 
 Consider eco-friendliness for your overall operations. Is your current system enhancing durability of your card compared to the industry standard? By reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact from your operation, you will lead the eco-conversation that brings positive brand impact to your business. 
 
<p>Lift your brand impact with flat card printing</p>
<p>Flat card printing enables card layout flexibility by supporting frontside, backside, horizontal, and vertical orientations and provides more real estate for branding and creativity. Now you don’t need to worry about how your card design will look after applying the protective topcoats. Unique and eye-catching payment cards have a stronger chance of being elevated to the top of the consumer’s wallet.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Entrust is exhibiting at this year’s <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/">IoT Solutions World Congress</a> in Barcelona at the end of January, and I’m proud to be part of a new initiative Entrust is undertaking at the event we’re calling “Demo for a donation.”</p>
<p>A standard part of all events like this is the ‘swag’ offered by all the exhibitors. But with the event theme of “Game Changing,” we got to thinking that instead of little branded tchotchkes like pens, stress balls or socks, we want to change the game by donating to charities that focus on kids in tech.</p>
<p>Together with our exhibition partner Device Authority, we are contributing to the education and development of young minds in the digital world, the young people who&nbsp;will one day&nbsp;“change the game”&nbsp;in the world of cyber security.</p>
<p>If you’re attending the event, helping us to achieve this aim couldn’t be simpler:</p>
 
 Drop by booth D441 in Hall 4 and chat with an Entrust or Device Authority expert 
 For every badge scanned Entrust will donate $10 to your choice of one of three charities 
 You will receive a thank you card confirming the donation 
 
<p>The three charities we have selected are as follows:</p>
 
 <a href="https://everychildonline.co.uk/">Every Child Online</a>– a UK-based charity that provides refurbished PCs, laptops and tablets to underprivileged children for free. The charity’s goal is to help close the digital divide and improve the quality of digital education offered in schools. 
 <a href="https://code.org/">CODE</a>– a US-based charity, it is an education innovation non-profit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. 
 <a href="https://www.technovation.org/about/">Technovation Girls</a> – a global charity that equips young women to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. With the support of volunteer mentors and parents, girls work in teams to code mobile apps that address real-world problems. 
 
<p>I’ll also be presenting together with an expert from Device Authority at two sessions during the show on the topics of <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/agenda/zero-trust-security-in-the-connected-supply-chain/">Zero Trust Security in the Connected Supply Chain </a>and <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/agenda/the-challenges-and-considerations-of-preparing-iot-for-pq/">The Challenges and Considerations of Preparing IoT for PQ</a>. They’re both hot topics of discussion, so if either (or both) of those sound of interest, come by and check them out, I’d love to know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>As well as feeling good about helping support one of these fantastic charities, you can also get a pick me up in the form of a candy treat from our “Sugar bar,” so be sure to stop by the Entrust/Device Authority booth and speak to one of our experts.</p>

<p>IDENTOS’ latest FPX version, FPX Vale, features user-led delegation, enriched administrative capabilities, and more </p>
<p><a href="https://www.identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc.</a>, a leader in digital identity and access management, launched the latest Federated Privacy Exchange (FPX) version of its identity and authorization software API offering as a strong kick-off to 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FPX Vale version builds on the company’s previous <a href="https://developer.identos.com/docs/fpx-overview/">FPX version</a> (<a href="https://www.identos.com/2022/09/07/identos-puts-developers-first-in-its-latest-product-release/">FPX Junction</a>), a cloud-based software product that provides fine-grained API authorization and user-centric identity management capabilities. Enabled by and extending <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/uma/overview">User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0</a>, FPX allows users to safely share their information with trusted digital service partners. This facilitates the efficient flow of data between users and applications benefiting all parties.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proud to release our latest version, FPX Vale. As identity sits at the root of all digital experiences, we are continually pushing the user-centric experience while keeping security and privacy at the heart of everything. We’re thrilled to empower our customers with added flexibility to execute on use cases that are critical today and in the future.” &nbsp;– Alec Laws, Chief Technology Officer, IDENTOS</p></blockquote>
<p>The highly anticipated FPX Vale version incorporates several capabilities, including User-to-User delegation and new API functions, enabling improved administrative flexibility, user convenience, security, and privacy – critical to sharing personal and sensitive data across digital healthcare, financial, and government services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FPX Vale key capabilities</p>
<p>-User-to-User delegation at the wallet – FPX Vale now allows a <a href="https://developer.identos.com/docs/fpx-components/wallet/user-to-user-delegation/">user to delegate</a> access to another user over certain functions, including consent to share personal information on their behalf. The ability to provide authority over sharing personal information is critically required in healthcare, legal and financial settings where a child, senior, or individual may need the support of their family or trusted party to assume their role in a critical scenario. With FPX Vale, individuals can do so without sharing passwords and avoid compromising security. Moreover, determining connection timeframes and revoking access at any time enables many privacy outcomes.</p>
<p>-New Admin API to configure Resource Server Adapter (RSA) – Resource Server Adapter minimizes data source onboarding effort through pre-integration to other FPX components and configurable extension points for data and API integrations. FPX Vale offers administrative flexibility and ease of use.</p>
<p>-New Disable API – FPX Vale allows for entities within the FPX network to now be disabled, using the new Disable API, allowing system administrators to quickly cut-off access to any resource protected by FPX. This provides the administrators complete lifecycle management of ecosystem partners and services.</p>
<p>Availability<br>
IDENTOS’ FPX Vale updates are available today to new and existing customers.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT website</a> introduces a way to get a KILT DID (decentralized identifier) without using cryptocurrency. This allows users to have their DID — a “digital fingerprint” at the core of their decentralized digital identity — anchored on the blockchain where no one else can ever delete it. DIDs also provide access to the full range of KILT’s identity solutions.</p><p>In the physical world, identity starts with your face or fingerprint. KILT brings this model of identity to the digital world, with a DID serving as your digital fingerprint. Identity is then built around your DID by adding credentials or digital certificates. On KILT, you can anchor your DID on the blockchain. This means that unlike an identity card (which should not be confused with identity itself — it’s just a credential) no external body can cancel or delete the core of your identity.</p> Anchoring a DID: Pay with&nbsp;KILT <p>Anchoring a DID requires data storage on the KILT blockchain database, which is replicated among multiple computers. Unlike Ethereum, KILT incentivizes cleaning up this database rather than letting it grow for eternity. Every time a user stores data on the chain, they have to put down a small deposit, which they receive back automatically when they remove the data. Storing a DID on the KILT chain requires a deposit of roughly 2 KILT Coins. The deposit never leaves the user’s account. It is just locked and not available for transfers, voting or&nbsp;staking.</p><p>If the DID is no longer required, the user can remove the data at any time, which automatically unlocks the deposit and makes it available again.</p><p>Once users anchor their DID on the chain they can use the full range of KILT identity solutions. Since KILT DIDs meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C industry standards</a>, they are also compatible with any applications that also resolve the KILT DID&nbsp;method.</p> Anchoring a DID: Pay without&nbsp;KILT <p>Many people are interested in enjoying the benefits of decentralized identity. But some don’t want the friction of buying or holding crypto in order to put their DID on the blockchain.</p><p>B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, has created two solutions to address these adoption challenges:</p>  A <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/get-did/index.html">Checkout Service</a> that puts the individual user’s signed DID transaction on the KILT blockchain, and allows payment with&nbsp;PayPal.  An enterprise solution for buying large numbers of DIDs for their customers or employees and paying once via bank transfer.  <p>In both cases, the user’s DIDs are generated on their own device in their private wallet, and are unique to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>These two services utilize a unique feature of KILT: the account that pays the fees and makes the deposit (the service) does not need to be the same as the account that authorized the transactions (the DID owner). This means that the owner of the DID stays in control of their DID while an external account (the service used) can be used to submit the DID operations to the blockchain and lock the deposit on behalf of the user. The user always stays in control of the DID. No one except the user can delete or add to the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Naturally, both solutions are compliant with KILT’s privacy by design. Here’s how they&nbsp;work:</p> Checkout Service <p>Individuals who prefer not to pay with KILT can use the Checkout Service provided by KILT partner BTE. This service can be accessed via the <a href="https://kilt-io/build-your-identity">KILT website</a> or through KILT’s Sporran wallet. Getting a DID (anchored on chain) using the Checkout Service currently costs a non-refundable service fee of EUR 4,⁰⁰. Users can pay for this service using PayPal, which may also provide options for paying in other fiat currencies.</p><p>The process starts by <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/files/How-to-Guide-Create-Sporran-Wallet.pdf">creating an account in Sporran</a>, which automatically generates DID details as part of the setup process. After clicking “Get your DID” in the Sporran wallet and selecting the Checkout Service option, users are directed to sign with their password in Sporran to prepare the transaction. Then users will be directed to the Checkout Service, which processes their transaction and offers them PayPal to pay for the Checkout&nbsp;Service:</p><p>The service then puts the transaction on the blockchain, pays the KILT transaction fees as well as the required deposit, and registers the DID on the blockchain on the user’s behalf. When the order has been processed, the Checkout Service website shows the order has been completed:</p><p>Users will be able to see their DID in their Sporran under “Manage&nbsp;DID”.</p><p>The Checkout Service has no control over a user’s DID at any point. Once the service makes the deposit required by the blockchain, the deposit is locked forever. Only the user can delete the DID. The DID is now stored on the blockchain, and the user can start building their digital identity around it, knowing that no external party can turn it&nbsp;off.</p> Enterprise Solution <p>This service is also relevant for enterprises that want to build on their real-word trust reputation to create a business around digital identity. Or need to equip their customers or employees with DIDs for various reasons, without requiring them to acquire KILT Coins. Some enterprises even have policies that prevent them from holding cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Working on a larger scale, these enterprises don’t want to go through the payment process for every single DID and would prefer an automated solution. To meet this need BTE developed an enterprise service. Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p>  The service allows an entity (e.g. a company) to pay once in fiat for a large number of DID deposits.  The BTE service then acquires the necessary amount of KILT&nbsp;Coins.  The company can develop its own wallet for their customers to store their credentials securely using KILT’s open source software, or integrate the Sporran&nbsp;wallet.  Employees or users of the company’s service can then download the company’s wallet on their device and generate their DID which is anchored on the blockchain.  Following a similar process to the Checkout Service, the BTE enterprise service communicates with the company’s software to register DIDs on the blockchain as requested via an API, up to the number of DIDs paid for in&nbsp;advance.  <p>As in the Checkout Service, neither the BTE enterprise service nor the company have any control over the DIDs; they cannot revoke them or remove them from the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The Checkout Service and enterprise solution represent a significant step forward for KILT Protocol. These innovations add convenience and flexibility that will drive adoption of KILT DIDs across new audiences and industries.</p><p>______</p><p>Still have questions? Browse the FAQs&nbsp;below.</p> FAQs <p>Q: Where do users get their&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: The DID is generated on your computer when you create your account in your wallet (Sporran for Checkout Service, or the wallet developed by the provider for other services).</p><p>Q: Can other people add credentials to my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: No. You can request credentials and store them in your wallet on your device. You decide, which credentials you accept and who you share them with. If you wish to make some credentials public (e.g. email address, social media handles) you may <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/files/How-to-Guide-Link-Credentials-via-GitHub.pdf">link them to your DID</a>, but no one else can do that for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Q: How do I know that BTE won’t cancel my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: BTE / the Checkout Service cannot remove the user’s DID from the blockchain. Only the user can delete their&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Q: Can the Checkout Service / Enterprise service / Company control my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: No. Only you have control of your DID. Once it’s registered on the blockchain, no one can delete or turn off the core of your digital identity besides you. However, if you later decide you don’t need your DID, you can choose to delete it&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: Once I have my DID anchored on the blockchain what can I do with&nbsp;it?</p><p>A: There are already several services “built on KILT” that utilize DIDs including Social KYC and DIDsign. More applications are in development and will be available soon; keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> or the <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">KILT blog</a> for announcement updates.</p><p>Q: How much does Checkout Service&nbsp;cost?</p><p>A: You currently pay a non-refundable €4 (or Euro equivalent) using PayPal for the Checkout Service. This includes VAT, the transaction fee, a handling fee for the service, and the equivalent of the&nbsp;deposit.</p><p>Q: If I pay for my DID using Checkout Service, can I delete my DID&nbsp;later?</p><p>A: Yes, you can delete your DID from the KILT blockchain. If you do so, this DID cannot be recreated.</p><p>Q: What happens if I delete my on-chain DID. Is it completely removed from the blockchain?</p><p>A: No, records are permanent on the blockchain. However, deleting your on-chain DID invalidates it&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: If I pay for my DID using Checkout Service and later delete my DID, do I get a&nbsp;refund.</p><p>A: No, deposits paid by Checkout Service are not refundable. The deposit is locked&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: How are deposits calculated?</p><p>A: The deposit amount is calculated using a formula based on the size of the data stored multiplied by a scaling factor that can be decreased or increased by governance vote.,&nbsp;e.g.:</p><p>Number of items * 56 * 0.001 KILT (milliKILT) + (item size, bytes) * 50 * 0.000001 KILT (microKILT)<br> <br>Q: If KILT Coins increase in price, will the price of a DID increase&nbsp;too?</p><p>A: KILT is a decentralized protocol governed by the community of KILT holders; a decision to change the price of a DID would be made by the community.

 New Year, New Launch: <br>KILT Website Features Enterprise and Consumer Onramps to&nbsp;DIDs <p>The new KILT.io website is now live! The redesigned site features a vibrant look and feel, with new tools to “Claim your Independence” and regain control of personal data using KILT’s digital identity solutions.</p><p>The new website continues KILT’s mission of education about digital identity, DIDs and verifiable credentials. New sections highlight enterprise use cases and ecosystem partners, and the Protocol section includes KILT’s governance framework, the new <a href="https://www.kilt.io/protocol/constitution">Constitution</a>, and guidelines for Treasury proposals. Developer resources and documentation provide the information needed to start building with&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>In the physical world, your identity starts with your face or fingerprint. KILT brings this model of identity to the digital world, with a DID (decentralized identifier) serving as your digital fingerprint. Setting up a DID is the first step to building your identity with KILT services, and requires a deposit of around 2 KILT Coins. Users can <a href="https://www.kilt.io/build-your-identity">get their DID with KILT</a> via the new website and KILT’s Sporran&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>But not all users are familiar with or comfortable buying crypto. So today’s relaunch introduces a Checkout Service that makes digital identity and DID creation available to a much broader audience, and doesn’t require crypto knowledge or&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Created by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (a subsidiary of BOTLabs, the initial developer of KILT Protocol), the Checkout Service enables individuals to get their DID without using KILT and easily pay for the Checkout Service via&nbsp;Paypal.</p><p>Also available is a new DID solution for enterprises to offer DIDs at scale for their employees and customers. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/get-your-did-kilt-launches-new-services-for-enterprise-and-consumers-d34be03261f3">Learn more</a> about how enterprises can buy a batch of transactions and anchor the DIDs on the KILT blockchain, while preserving the user’s privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Browse the site, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/build-your-identity">Get your DID</a> with KILT or Paypal via the new Checkout Service, and start building your decentralized identity.

 Spherity and U.S.&nbsp;pharma? <p>The U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) aims to secure patient safety by increasing supply chain integrity. Hence, all pharmaceutical supply chain actors should ideally only interact with those that meet the DSCSA Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status when they engage in electronic product identifier (PI) verifications, in particular in relation to suspicious or returned product investigations.</p><p>Spherity is a software start-up specializing in enterprise identity solutions. In association with industry players including Legisym, Center for Supply Chain Studies, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/rfxcel-integrates-spherity-credentialing-service-to-enable-dscsa-authorized-trading-partner-49bc3cca2e5c">rfxcel</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-credentialing-service-now-available-on-sap-store-356ab6a15dca">SAP</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories.html?pdf-asset=d8b2ecc4-1c7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;page=1">Novartis</a>, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AmerisourceBergen, GS1 US and <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-joins-health-distribution-alliance-hda-as-a-service-provider-member-7a5024317567">HDA</a>, we have addressed the challenge of authenticating a trading partner’s identity and authorizing them in DSCSA-regulated electronic PI verifications that are facilitated by <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#v">Verification Router Service (VRS)</a>. The original solution is based on cryptographically <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#v">verifiable credentials</a>. This credentialing approach has been developed further collaboratively within an industry collaboration called the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>. The method introduces a new layer of security, efficiency, and convenience to DSCSA compliance for any VRS-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain&nbsp;actor.</p> Innovation hat-trick? <p>The credentialing solution began as a classic technological innovation project in April 2020 with Spherity and other companies representing different segments of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain coming together in a cross-functional pilot. Explore the published <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/resources-portfolio/dscsa-atp-pilot">pilot resources</a> for detailed information. After successful conclusion the team realized that true industry-wide innovation will not happen in isolation. A <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-is-partnering-with-legisym-offering-joint-compliance-product-for-the-u-s-cbf9fd5a217">close partnership</a> emerged from the pilot between <a href="https://www.caro.vc/">Spherity</a> and <a href="https://legisym.com/">Legisym</a>, an expert in regulatory compliance technologies for the pharmaceutical industry. To standardize and evolve the piloted solution, Spherity and Legisym spearheaded the foundation of OCI, a non-profit industry collaboration, in April 2021. Thus, the innovation has been threefold — at technological, compliance, and governance level. 2022 was a pivotal year for the Spherity-Legisym partnership and OCI yielding not only matured architectural and governance frameworks for the latter but also a commercially ready solution for the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Technological innovation: Spherity leverages <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#d">decentralized identifiers</a> in combination with verifiable credentials (VCs) as a new layer of trust in digital interactions. Each decentralized identifier is uniquely and cryptographically verifiably associated with a pharmaceutical trading partner. A VC is effectively a translation of existing real-world evidence, including trading licenses, into a specific standardized electronic format. These identifiers and credentials are stored securely in a piece of software called a digital wallet. By presenting an organization’s VC to a counterparty through electronic PI verification messages facilitated by VRS, supply chain actors are able to identify trading partners as intended by DSCSA in secure electronic processes. The key advantage of the described digital credentials is that they can be independently automatically verified unlike other identifiers (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>Compliance innovation: Initially, pharmaceutical supply chain actors intended to rely on existing enterprise identifiers for the accurate identification of trading partners in PI verifications, in particular global location numbers (GLN) or data universal numbering system (DUNS) numbers as well as existing manual or semi-automated look-ups of compliance information, such as trading licenses. However, in electronic interactions, the receiving party cannot be sure that an entity providing the aforementioned identifiers is indeed who they say they are because their identity and provided details cannot be independently verified. It poses a challenge to reliably associate such identifiers with separate evidence for trading authorization increasing the complexity of due diligence. In addition, there have been cases where GLN were not well maintained, e.g., they were not active or not associated with the expected entity. Thus, existing means had left a compliance gap that the credentialing method has now plugged. Besides the technological qualities of VC solving the challenges around the assurance of the interacting parties indeed being who they claim to be and possessing the appropriate trading authorization, Legisym’s assessment of the existing compliance landscape has enabled the adaptation of due diligence processes and available pieces of evidence with a high level of assurance for use with this novel technology.</p><p>Governance innovation: To bring true value to the US pharmaceutical industry as a whole, ecosystem thinking must be applied. To create not only an isolated solution but allow for industry-wide interoperability and adoption, Spherity, Legisym, and others have co-founded OCI as a governance platform for the credentialing method, forum for industry stakeholders, and to create the foundation of an open market for other service providers to join. Under the stewardship of the Center for Supply Chain Studies, the Spherity-Legisym partnership has been a leading force within OCI in the creation of the technological architecture, conformance criteria, and organizational governance as well as industry-wide alliances and educational efforts.</p> Gains in productivity, supply chain safety, and efficiencies <p>Supply chain safety — automation: DSCSA has been enacted to enhance supply chain safety. By enabling the automation of aspects of legal compliance, ATP credentialing directly pays into fulfilling the promise and intent of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Supply chain safety — auditability: Equipped with monitoring and reporting features, the Spherity solution, named <a href="https://www.caro.vc/">CARO</a>, generates automated audit trails enabling timely investigations.</p><p>Productivity — staff time: Credentialing involves the conversion of real-world evidence provided by each trading partner to Legisym into electronically verifiable credentials in a one-off enrollment. Any interactions between trading partners leverage these credentials through automated checks. Thus, the due diligence process in the context of PI verifications becomes a passive, entirely hands-off exercise for trading partners on either side of an exchange. This means that (1) an individual company does not need to undergo a separate due diligence process with each new trading partner and (2) that staff are freed up from due diligence-related tasks. For example, a manufacturer does not need to vet every single dispenser before reacting to a product enquiry because the dispensers have already been vetted within the credentialing system. Legisym’s ongoing monitoring keeps verifiable credentials active for as long as trading partners maintain their businesses in good standing.</p><p>Productivity — speed: While DSCSA allows for up to 24 hours, there is a drive by trading partners to achieve response times of under one minute to PI verification requests by using automated electronic systems. Consequently, the ATP check must happen in the same timeframe. The credential-based system is able to handle both the ATP and the PI verification requests within far less than one&nbsp;minute.</p><p>Efficiency — operations: The credentialing approach alleviates the additional compliance burden on supply chain actors caused by DSCSA, as it maximizes the use of existing processes as much as possible. (1) Legisym leverages existing licenses/registration etc for due diligence and eliminates the need for repetitive checks. (2) Thanks to fully API-based integration of VRS providers with Spherity’s CARO, trading partners have no technical implementation effort. Hence, ATP authentication can be incorporated into existing processes without disruption.</p><p>Efficiency — market: The ecosystem approach through OCI opens the market to any company aspiring to be a service provider, as shared information and standards are openly available to lay the foundation for industry-wide system interoperability. This avoids monopoly-like pockets, vendor tie-ins, and encourages competition through value-adds or&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Efficiency — joint innovation: The ecosystem approach through OCI encourages the involvement of various industry stakeholders and, thus, enables the development of solutions that are needed and fit for purpose, as they are born from within the industry.</p> Contact us <p>DSCSA will reach its final enforcement deadline on Nov 27, 2023.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>In the digital era, business would greatly benefit from having increased identity assurance levels, be able to interact securely with partners, suppliers, consumers, and customers, and be able to reduce the administrative load during onboarding or ongoing verification of credentials.</p>
<p>One potential solution, that is gaining momentum and support around the world, is the implementation of decentralized Identity systems that use verifiable credentials that are tamper proof, can be stored in a digital wallet, and can contain a decentralized identifier that is globally unique and can be cryptographically verified.</p>
 A user-centric universal digital identity solution 
<p>The ultimate goal is a universal digital ID that can be used to access all digital services without having to enter personal identity information for every single service and without having to trust every service provider to keep that centralized personal information safe.</p>
<p>While we still have some way to go in achieving that goal, organizations can already start using decentralized identities and verifiable credentials, thereby gearing up to enable the wider ecosystem that they will be able to tap into as soon as it is up and running.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identity highlights in the EIC agenda 
<p>Any organizations interested in finding out more about decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and how and why to implement them, should attend the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/922">track</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 dedicated to these topics. The track is designed to provide a wide range of useful and practical information about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/agenda#tab_1_2023-05-10">Decentralized &amp; Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Interworking or interoperability is one of the key challenges to the implementation of Decentralized Identity. To find out how OpenID for Verifiable Credentials can help with this challenge and a lot more besides, attend this track session on: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5274/1">How to Build Interoperable Decentralized Identity Systems with OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more about the NFTicket protocol, how it combines the identification power of cryptographic wallets with those of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and how it has been applied in a pilot to create Renewable Energy Certificates as Verifiable Credentials in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5274/2">Verifiable Credentials and Dynamic NFTs – Two sides of the same medal</a>.</p>
<p>Drilling down even further into the topic of interoperability, the session on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5279/1">Interworking of Verifiable Credential Products</a> examines in detail two projects aimed at fostering wide scale adoption of Verifiable Credentials and discusses their finding.</p>

After all, using personal data doesn’t help us replace fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy, and all uses of data have their own carbon footprint from the energy used to power servers and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>So how can we argue that the proper collection and use of personal data is an essential part of the journey to net zero? To be sure, it definitely isn’t the solution. But it is part of the solution, a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-hidden-key-to-carbon-reduction-d5872032fc7d">hidden key to carbon reduction</a>. Here are six ways&nbsp;how.</p> A human-made, expanding resource <p>First, a new net zero economy has to find a way of reducing dependence on materials extracted from the earth. It needs to go circular. Data, including personal data, is a vital part of this transition because of two&nbsp;things.</p>  It is human-made, generated by humans in the course of their activities — not extracted from the&nbsp;earth.  It is infinitely renewable and more, because every time we use data we generate more of it (including ‘metadata’ e.g. data about the data we are using and generating).  <p>Data isn’t the only, or even the most important human made, renewable, expanding resource. It is part of something even bigger: human culture and knowledge. As economic forces they’re even more powerful than energy (because we use knowledge and our ability to do things together to obtain energy). But data is a key part of this, providing an ever-growing contribution to&nbsp;it.</p> Active carbonisation <p>Second, at a lesser but nevertheless real level, increased use of digital and data processes helps to decarbonise the economy. An enormous amount of energy is required to fell trees, transport them, turn them into pulp and then paper, to move this paper using physical transportation, and to store it. In comparison, an electronic digit is a massive carbon saving. The more we can eliminate paper (by, for example, eliminating form filling and the sending of letters in the post), the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Third, improved data logistics is key to improved physical logistics — eliminating unnecessary carbon-emitting activities by better, more accurate planning and coordination. A parcel that is sent to the wrong place because of a data error produces carbon emissions entirely unnecessarily. Eliminating paper by digitising a data process is just the tip of a much bigger energy saving ice-berg: using data to make better decisions and implementing them more efficiently — decisions involving physical, energy-using processes. This is another aspect of decarbonisation.</p> A deeper, seismic&nbsp;shift <p>More generally and fundamentally speaking, the data revolution is shifting the epicentre of economic activity. For the last few centuries the economy has revolved around one central question: how to use energy to transform and move material things? It was all about making&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a society we are now very good at doing that. What we are less good at is two other, equally important economic activities: making the right decisions in the first place (so that we don’t waste time, energy and materials doing the wrong things), and implementing these decisions more efficiently and effectively (which boils down to the data-intensive tasks of planning, organising and coordinating). This is where the biggest opportunities for improvement now lie — opportunities with carbon reducing possibilities at their&nbsp;heart.</p><p>This shift in economic focus from using energy to make and move stuff to using data to make and implement better decisions, is epochal and seismic. It changes the underlying dynamics of all wealth creation. And it is essential for the journey to net&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Closely linked to this, is a slow but inexorable shift in how we think about and understand value and wealth. Wealth is not the ability to consume more things. It is human beings’ ability to live better lives. Yes of course, to do that we need to use and consume stuff. But consuming ever more stuff is not the be all and end all of life. There’s lots more to it than that, nowadays coming under the general heading of ‘wellbeing’.</p><p>Compared to what we know about how to make stuff, we know much less about how to improve human wellbeing in all its dimensions. To understand this better, we need data: detailed data about how people live their lives and, from this, what contributes to improved wellbeing and what does not. This is part of the ‘life management’ revolution we talked about in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">our last blog</a>. Because it is so deeply personal, it needs privacy protecting personal data infrastructure to support&nbsp;it.</p><p>More concretely, as we also talked about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">in our last blog</a> personal data stores will help deliver mass scale citizen behaviour change via ‘carbon concierge’ services: services that help each individual understand the unique carbon footprint of the things they buy and do, and to identify ways to eliminate or substitute high-carbon activities for low or negative carbon activities.</p> A positive alternative <p>But there is one more way in which personal data stores have an even deeper contribution to make to net zero. Just imagine, for a second, if by some piece of magic, all fossil fuels were rendered instantly irrelevant by a universal take-up of green, renewable energy sources. We’ve done it! We’ve gone net&nbsp;zero!</p><p>But if all we have done is gone net zero, nothing else has changed. We still have obscene levels of inequality, deep and growing poverty, the super-exploitation of people working in a rights-free gig economy, a collapsing health and care system, a corrupt extractive financial system with huge, unsustainable levels of debt, endless invasions of privacy by predatory, profit-seeking corporations. Would our lives actually be any&nbsp;better?</p><p>Without broader, deeper changes to our economic system net zero, in itself, will not create a fairer, better, more prosperous society. What we need is a journey to net zero that combines with, and brings these broader, deeper changes in its wake. That develops positive alternatives as it does&nbsp;so.</p><p>This is what personal data stores are part of: as well as accelerating the journey to net zero, they develop positive alternatives that make an enriching, circular, well-being focused society and economy possible.

<p>Businesses have embraced digital to engage with their customers. Keeping pace in this rapidly evolving threat landscape requires businesses to look for innovative ways to build experiences that optimise security without impacting user convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> and <a href="https://versent.com.au/">Versent</a> conducted a roundtable luncheon in Sydney and Melbourne in November 2022, with CISOs and related C-level executives responsible for ICT and/or cyber security in their organisations or business units. The aim was to spark thought and engage in a robust conversation about the challenges, issues, and approaches to identity access &amp; management orchestration, with a specific focus on using customer identity to optimise security and convenience, especially in the areas of customer and employee experience. Twenty-eight executives from a very broad range of industries and backgrounds attended the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Dillon, Head of APAC Architecture at Ping Identity, and Eddie Smith, GM Identity and Security at Versent hosted the events. Both 2.5-hour events were moderated by Craig Baty, Principal of <a href="http://www.datadrivenservices.com.au/">DataDriven</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders must collaborate with teams across the business to develop and execute a customer-facing digital strategy that ensures a frictionless experience, enhanced security, protection from fraud, and regulatory compliance. Using customer identity, leaders can establish a firm foundation of collaboration with different stakeholders to orchestrate digital experiences that drive sales, lower fraud losses, and meet business objectives.</p>

<p>We launched SSX to provide developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. We are continuously working on a positive developer experience, and additional features to enable builders to work with emerging decentralized identity paradigms. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Our most recent work on SSX focused on two areas: adding optimizations, and adding additional features and support for various dapp setups. We recently took some time to consolidate and optimize code to reduce existing technical debt through some refactoring and added plenty of additional tests to make adding new features to SSX a breeze. </p><p>In our efforts to support various existing authentication setups, we've released support for NextAuth via our <code>ssx-react</code> package. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth">we've added an example</a> in our growing example library to show how to integrate it. To support <a href="https://wagmi.sh">wagmi's</a> recent updates beyond version 0.7.15 and NextAuth in a variety of different development environments, we are updating our <code>ssx-react</code> library to improve support for different Javascript module types (ESM and CJS modules).</p><p>Additionally, we added support for custom paths for endpoints on both the client and server sides to support various application setups in our core libraries. We also updated the <code>ssx-react</code> API to allow for additional options to pass to the SSX instance, widening the number of supported providers (such as <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/configuring-ssx/configuring-ssx-with-react#other-providers">Blocknative’s web3-onboard provider</a>!). </p><p>Speaking of providers, SSX now also has <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples">multiple examples</a> showing a developer how they can build an SSX-enabled dapp with WalletConnect’s web3modal-v2!</p><p>Finally, we’re happy to announce support for Lens profile resolution. This enables any developer using SSX to easily pull in Lens profile information to the dapps they’re building by simply turning on a <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/YHxbgvbOJwARzKZAVAA0/s/Yk3peyHr3yYsgyIYXUky/configuring-ssx#resolvelens">feature flag</a>. &nbsp; </p><p>For more information on our recent updates, check out the following:</p> Features:   <code>ssx-react</code> now supports NextAuth, and we’ve added corresponding documentation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/49">#49</a>).  We added support for resolving Lens profiles (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/50">#50</a>).  We updated the <code>ssx-react</code> API to use additional providers. We added this support alongside an example using Blocknative’s <a href="https://github.com/blocknative/web3-onboard">web3onboard</a> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/34">#34</a>).  We added flexibility in SSX to let developers configure what endpoints they want to use for issuing nonces, and handling login/logout functions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/36">#36</a>).  We added examples of how to use SSX with <a href="https://web3modal.com/">web3modal-v2</a>. We have one example for each web3modal v2 package: <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-html">web3modal/html</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-react">web3modal/react</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-standalone">web3modal/standalone</a>.   We also updated our <code>ssx-test-dapp</code> to also support testing this new integration (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/58">#58</a>).   Testing and Code Refactor:   We are over 70% in code <a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/spruceid/ssx">coverage</a> with tests and are currently working on continuing to get to full coverage this month.  We optimized try/catch blocks, cleaned up existing code, and created a new package for functions and utilities used across our other packages <code>ssx-core</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/26">#26</a>).  We updated how we bundle our packages to prevent typescript build issues for builds using gulp (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/52">#52</a>).   What’s Next <p>The team is working on improving interfaces in SSX to enable any developer to use it as a core building block, and extend it toward various decentralized identity use cases. </p><p>Additionally, we’re working on how developers with existing email or OAuth flows can easily enable Sign-In with Ethereum in their existing applications using SSX. We hope to eventually migrate applications to a world where Sign-In with Ethereum is the default way of logging in.</p><p>Finally, we think of SSX as a core enabler of user-controlled identity, where anyone can bring their own data anywhere they wish. We are working on a service that enables users to obtain credentials that they can take with them across the web using SSX. Stay tuned for more information late next month, closer to ETHDenver! </p>

				  Hype over web3 and the Metaverse put selling the future ahead of building the infrastructure for digital transformation. But that infrastructure is the source of business opportunity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The current malaise over web3 and the metaverse feels very much like a case of flying car syndrome: let’s take a shortcut to the future — and watch as we crash. We’re still waiting for flying cars, 70 years after they first seemed like a consumer reality; but if crypto is a similar measure of whether web3 will fail, then we’re missing a crucial point.</p>
<p>The important thing about the 1950s and 60s in terms of business and technology was not flying cars or the belief that their time had come; it was the many, ways in which the infrastructure for doing business changed: processes for creating new and better materials, and generating greater yields, the development of computer chips and their productization, and statistical management techniques and quality control. Individually, few of these developments caught the public interest; yet in the case of Japan, which combined them all, we ended up with a manufacturing and economic “miracle.”</p>
<p>We are in the middle of a similar infrastructural revolution in the way we can do business. Whether digital or analogue, the problems with legacy infrastructure and processes, are that they are too costly (think fraud), too complex (they can’t be managed quickly and easily from a mobile phone or a digital twin), too insecure (logins, passwords, and VPNs are “Bronze-Age” tools for defeating phishing), too fragmented (System A can’t interact with System B), too labor intensive (think the great resignation), too disengaged (they don’t facilitate a relationship with the customer or continuous product feedback), or too burdensome (they struggle to comply with digital privacy rights).</p>
<p>All these interrelated problems need to be substantially solved before we can get to decentralized finance or meaningful interaction on the Metaverse’s Broad Street; and central to their solution is verifiable data, otherwise (and perhaps now confusingly) called decentralized identity. Verifiable data through the use of verifiable credentials based on the W3C’s open standard for decentralized identifiers are the new level up for the internet and digital interaction. They are the infrastructure that will power new processes, new products, and new services—and, perhaps most importantly, address sectoral needs for immediate digital transformation.</p>
<p>A digital shipping container<br>You might think of a W3C verifiable credential as the digital equivalent of the standardized shipping container. The way it is designed to hold data determines the data’s integrity and verifiability. It can transport any kind of data associated with any kind of entity, whether a person or a device or even a thing—and it has its own direct shipping channel, so you don’t have to route the data through a third party (solving the data privacy compliance issue).</p>
<p>Because the container is built on open standards, it’s interoperable, and it can be used, in a manner of speaking, for air, rail, road, and sea transport. Because it’s built on open-source code, it can be continuously upgraded to provide new functions. And because it’s both a flexible and light piece of technology, you can overlay and integrate your new containers into your existing infrastructure. A container can transport data from System A to System B even if the two systems can’t directly speak to each other—which saves on the cost of a direct integration.</p>
<p>What do you get with this new data shipping system? You get the missing verification layer for interaction online. You get the ability to authenticate data: you can know where it has come from without calling up the source or relying on a third party to manage the transport; you can immediately see if the container has been tampered with compromising the data inside; and based on those two facts, you have the power to make data immediately actionable.</p>
<p>The first practical consequence is a way to deal with fraud. The data is in the container and not stored in some centralized database that the container accesses. If you trust the organization that sent the container, then you’ll trust the information inside it. That’s instantaneous, which leads to the second practical benefit: seamless processes.</p>
<p>At the customer end, seamless processes are being driven by the expectation that everything should be controllable from a mobile device and minimally inconvenient. At the business end, they are being driven by the need to automate mundane processes dependent on manual labor, for which there is either a shortage of workers or little worker interest. This is an acute challenge facing all sectors. Similarly, changing workforce demographics mean that remote is not going to disappear—and a decentralized workforce needs a more secure way of interacting with business systems than VPNs.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices, Industrial IoT, and digital twins will all need verifiable identities so that verified users can interact with them and consume and share verifiable data in secure ways. Smart manufacturing, supply chain transparency, and product lifecycle management all require verifiable data and relationships that can be easily facilitated by verifiable credentials and its rich, direct communications protocol, DIDComm.</p>
<p>In fact, when you look at digital transformation in <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/four-banking-trends-tracking-2023">finance</a>, <a href="https://www.g2.com/articles/manufacturing-industry-trends-2023">manufacturing</a>, <a href="https://www.sita.aero/innovation/meet-the-megatrends/index.html?v=megatrends&amp;a=2">travel</a>, any sector, verifiable data and verifiable identities provide the critical infrastructure needed to move digital interaction forward and deliver the transformation that overcomes fraud and friction.

<p>This Data Privacy Day it is time to address those who serve on Boards of Directors because there is an opportunity to turn 2023 into the year of Cybersecurity culture building – starting at the very top.</p>
<p>These days when it comes to an organization’s cybersecurity strategy, the question isn’t IF a breach will occur, but WHEN. Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated and the frequency of attacks is rising. Staying on top of each and every threat is like trying to ice skate uphill. And with the average cost of a data breach <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/email-security/average-cost-of-a-data-breach-expected-to-hit-5-million-in-2023">expected</a> to hit $5 million in 2023, it is vitally important to prioritize your security strategy to protect your most sensitive data.</p>
<p>With the number, frequency and sophistication of threats increasing, it’s important that organizations build a security-minded culture, where employees at all levels feel empowered and accountable to not only protect sensitive data, but also to build resiliency into the business. However, organizations often turn their attention to employee security training and forget to bring along those at the top. As Boards become acutely aware of data privacy and data protection, they are increasingly interested in participating in the governance of both.</p>
<p>Here are five useful steps Board and C-suite members can take now to ramp up their cybersecurity expertise in 2023 and beyond.</p>
 
 Add a cybersecurity expert to the Board. This will help drive a cybersecurity culture and make data privacy governance and data security a priority at the highest level of the organization. Visibility is key to building trust by helping people to understand how data privacy, data security and compliance are maintained in the background. This applies to the Board as well. Having clear and well-understood policies and solutions can drive investment and buy-in. In fact, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-39">recently proposed</a> a new rule that mandates cybersecurity experience at the Board level, as well as regular reporting among its recommendations. And not just regulatory bodies are pushing for more of this knowledge at the Board level – MIT <a href="https://fortune.com/education/articles/cybersecurity-risks-can-no-longer-be-ignored-mit-sloan-launches-course-to-teach-board-members-prevention-tactics/">recently launched</a> a course to teach Board members security tactics. 
 Create a cybersecurity committee in which qualified Board members can participate in advising and mitigating risks. Creating this committee opens the door to more resources and support as the CISO and their team have the opportunity to build allies and champions within the Board, C-suite, and across the organization. 
 Conduct a cost-benefit analysis on cybersecurity insurance. While cybersecurity insurance can be an effective part of an organization’s overall security strategy, it’s expensive and it usually doesn’t cover everything. Cybersecurity insurance is a tool within a company’s security toolbox to recoup losses from unforeseen incidents – it’s not meant to be a substitute for risk management. An insurance payout may cover the cost of a breach, but it won’t cover the damage to reputation and trust. Each company is different and so are its security needs, so it’s important to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/post/Do-companies-need-cyber-insurance">evaluate all factors</a> and decide if it meets your business needs. 
 Learn the distinct differences between data privacy and data security. These terms are often mistaken as interchangeable ideas; however, while they are connected, they are fundamentally different. Data privacy focuses on how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Data privacy laws and regulations can vary by regionally, with each having varying degrees of rigor and enforcement. Conversely, data security is focused on how sensitive data is protected from external and internal threats. From a compliance perspective, taking ownership of data security means responsibility to abide by data privacy regulations in place like the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), to name a few. If an organization gets its data security framework right, then it can achieve data privacy for its clients. If not, then that’s a problem. Of all the information available, a person’s identity is the most coveted data there is and when it’s mishandled that’s when the opportunity for fraudsters occurs. 
 
 
 For user authentication, it’s time to embrace some friction For years experts have touted the need to remove friction (or passive authentication) in the consumer, workforce and citizen identity verification experience. However, when friction is completely removed, that’s often when a breach happens – particularly when that friction is reduced by workarounds rather than reducing complexity. There’s an idea circulating among experts that some level of friction can serve as a trust builder – if people have no impediment to accessing applications and services, they start to question whether or not there are any security measures in place at all. This tells us organizations need to strike the right balance between minimizing friction and maintaining customer trust in an organization’s or government’s ability to keep their personal data safe – because when systems are secured, employees are enabled, partners are confident, and customers feel safe doing business with the organization, then you know you’ve got a formula that works. 
 
<p>Board-level involvement in the governance of data privacy and security for an organization can only enable an improved security posture and help mitigate risks. So go ahead and seek out opportunities to engage with your organization’s CISO to see how you can help keep sensitive data safe.</p>

<p>The payment card issuance industry continues to be challenged by production inefficiencies as a result of global pandemic supply chain disruptions. Of course, the usual operational hiccups exist, but the added pressures that come from the on-going global chip shortage have strained the entire industry. In this blog, we’ll explore some of these challenges and how they affect issuers and integrators. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to mitigate these risks and optimize operational footprints with increased agility and production throughputs.</p>
<p>The usual suspects</p>
<p>Vendor diversification is intentionally limited to organizations. Global chip suppliers often act to restrict issuers from looking for alternative suppliers. Pre-printed card stocks limit design and force higher carrying costs with increased volume inventories for anyone downstream. Both contribute to the same MRP inefficiency, steering the front-end procurement of specific items from specific vendors, contributing to higher overall costs and volumes which translate to operational inefficiency.</p>
<p>Too many designs can proliferate supply. With chip issuers and stock card designers constantly adding new card models to their portfolio, there is an added burden on production personnel and procurement systems to keep track of different SKU’s and maintain costs. Vault monitoring, production planning and material flow are all exacerbated by incremental stocks within complex MRP systems, sometimes driving multiple facilities with multiple lines to satisfy issuance demand across different regions. Static “card programs” can easily translate to production inefficiency if respective volumes do not align with overall customer demand.</p>
<p>Personalization systems limit issuance architectures. Most personalization systems in the market do not support the ability to mix and match different chips into one single job, causing significant inefficiencies in production volumes. Similarly, static card designs contribute to an identical concept — running independent batch sizes for specific programs. A recent ICMA study, concluded that the average worldwide production batch-size for financial bureaus is less than 20 cards, contributing to 20% of the total volume per day.</p>
<p>Piling on the on-going global chip shortage</p>
<p>Much of the focus on chip shortages has been on automotive manufacturing and consumer electronics, but payment cards and point-of-sale devices are also under significant strain from global shifts in supply chains. “The entire payments industry relies on semiconductors, chip cards, smartphones and digital point-of-sale devices, which are all impacted by the shortage,” said Oliver Manahan, the San Francisco-based senior director of business development for Infineon Technologies in Neubiberg, Germany. Manhan, who oversees partnerships with card vendors, issuers, payment networks and other firms at Infineon, is also co-chair of the Secure Technology Alliance and is on the steering committee of the U.S. Payments Forum.</p>
<p>The median chip inventory companies have on-hand fell from a 40-day supply in 2019 to less than five days in 2021, according to a 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/01/commerce-semiconductor-data-confirms-urgent-need-congress-pass-us">report</a>&nbsp;by the U.S. Department of Commerce that does not take the Russian war in Ukraine and China’s recent coronavirus lockdowns into consideration.&nbsp;Supply chain experts and economists agree that the semi-conductor challenge is expected to persist through 2023 and perhaps into 2024 as wafer capacity is strengthened with new sources of western supply.</p>
<p>It’s highly unlikely that these supply chain disruptions would prevent issuers from producing replacements for lost or stolen cards, or card expirations. However, if we get to that point we’ll have a significant industry-wide customer service nightmare on our hands. Calculated and careful management throughout the supply chain can help the issuance and greater payments industry minimize potential disruption to the cardholder experience.</p>
<p>Overcoming the odds</p>
<p>Amidst each of these challenges, bureaus and integrators can optimize production with the Entrust Adaptive Issuance and Print-on-Demand solutions. Both offer flexibility in a parallel issuance environment:</p>
 
 Adaptive Issuance EMV Data-Prep and Perso Software, in conjunction with rainbow decking (mixed chip card stocks), provide maximized production by aggregating card stocks and running them together in one batch, and 
 Print-on-Demand solutions such as UV-curable Drop-on-Demand and Artista VHD Retransfer offer unlimited efficiency options by allowing individual card designs vs batched, pre-printed stock. Both eliminate major lead-time inconsistencies across chip supply and reduce total Operating Expenses (OPEX) with greater throughput. This design and chip-agnostic approach allows Entrust Central Issuance customers to mitigate the leading supply chain constraint in the industry today—semi-conductor lead-time, affording Issuer’s the ability to choose any combination of card stock suppliers regardless of chipsets.

 We sit down with our Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk to discuss the challenges of complying with multi-geographical regulations, why the era of black-market operators is coming to an end, and which gambling trends to bet on in 2023.&nbsp; 



 



 Digital identity proofing has become an essential part of every sector’s digital offering. Although the application of identity proofing technology may be similar, how important is it to be aware of the intricacies of a particular industry, for example with gambling and offering solutions that promote responsible use?&nbsp; 



<p>I would say there’s two sides to this. On one hand you have the supply side, and on the other side you obviously have the operator side. On the supplier side, it’s important to be aware of where the industry is, what the industry is doing, and what the use cases are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our solutions are being used by operators to make their lives easier, to make the players’ lives easier and safer, and at the same time prevent any harm or any wrongdoing. Nowadays, the regulations are very tight and rightly so, especially with regards to protecting minors from underage gambling, and those who may develop a gambling addiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it is very important that we as suppliers know what to offer, how to offer it, and whether the solution can do enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC and identity verification is a business enabler for online gambling because operators don’t see their customers face to face, so they don’t know what kind of situation they are in, or what they’re doing. The most superior identity verification experiences are safe, secure, and easy to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As KYC is regarded as an enabler, compliance should be at the top of every operator’s mind, whether they’re at C-level or account management, in fact everyone involved in the technical teams that implement those solutions need to be concerned with compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 As online gambling regulations change and evolve with such regularity, what difficulty does this present to operators, especially those that operate across multiple geographies?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It can be very challenging because in some countries, for example, Germany, if you wanted to get a gambling license, you would need to fill out the applications in German, which obviously restricts the ability for certain international organizations to enter the market, unless they have somebody on staff who can speak the language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding regulations, the biggest problem is that there are different ways to interpret certain rules or requirements. So, one company might read it one way, and another operator might see it another way, and that’s a big problem. A good example is what you see with the Alcohol and Gaming Commision of Ontario (<a href="https://www.agco.ca/#modal">AGCO</a>), which essentially <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">regulates operators in Ontario</a>; they’ve done a fantastic job with their regulation. They want to protect the players, but at the same time, they’re also considering how to enable the operators to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a clear and proactive regulator, like the AGCO, you will always get better results for that region, or that country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are, unfortunately, many bad or frustrating examples of regulations, which may have four or five different interpretations of one paragraph. This does not do anyone any good because there will always be bad players and unscrupulous operators who want to grow quickly that will exploit those grey zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators tend to be well prepared when it comes to these things. They use lawyers and consultants to make sure they are going down the right path and take steps to implement the right technology along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So yes, it is challenging, but this is also what makes this sector so interesting, because there are always new challenges and new markets to enter, with different regulations and nuances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, I would say regulation is necessary, but it is extremely hard to find good regulation.</p>

 Are there any specific risks that operators should be aware of in the gambling sector, and how can operators protect themselves against them?&nbsp; 



<p>Bonus abuse is one example. This is where people create multiple accounts to get the sign-up bonus and then attempt to withdraw the money. Money laundering is another issue in certain countries, as is addiction, and feeding customers’ addiction rather than providing information that helps them to stop. Operators need also to be wary of minors attempting to onboard using the details of their parents, as well as people just not being honest about who they are and what they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What can operators do? Well, there is great technology available now where identity verification providers and KYC providers can monitor how users are behaving. There is a lot of focus right now on behavioral screening of players and how to spot addiction a lot earlier than ever before. This involves monitoring after a customer is verified. Operators are now utilizing technology to perform the screening stage because doing it manually is no longer feasible. In fact, in certain regulations you are not even allowed to do it manually anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would even say that in some cases the gambling industry uses more tools, or more innovative applications of solutions than the financial industry, such as technology that can identify ‘at-risk behavior’, predict and prevent incidents of fraud and even customer churn.&nbsp;</p>



 Which region, or country would you say has a) the most developed and lucrative online gambling sector, and b) the most regulated? Is there a link between how much potential a country’s gambling sector may have, and how regulated it is?  



<p>Oh, yes, 100% the link is there. Bad regulation is not good for the players and not good for the operators. If you look in Germany, the tax is very high and player limitations are super strict. So, there’s an argument that people are being forced into the black market, and that’s not good for the country because obviously the government is not going to benefit from the associated tax, and secondly the players are not protected if they go to the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>If you’re using a black-market operator, your winnings are totally in their hands. For example, if you hit a jackpot of €1 million, they don’t have to pay you out, because there is no consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>The most developed and consistent regulation is probably the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>, both of which have been regulating online gambling for many years and making sure it’s an attractive proposition for both the operator and the consumer – because to have a healthy market, you need to appease both sides. Of course, a national market needs protection, but it also needs tax revenue too; it needs to be commercially viable. You must strike a balance.&nbsp;</p>



 With gambling via offshore, unregulated gambling sites still a major problem within the industry, how can operators attract players away from unregistered sites? Are there any unique benefits that regulated operators can provide?&nbsp; 



<p>Regulated operators should promote their compliance with consumer protection laws, and all the aforementioned responsible gambling tools. One thing that regulated operators probably don’t do enough of is mentioning consumer protection. However, adverts have changed in recent years to incorporate responsible gambling messages and moved away from promoting bonuses to showcasing responsible functionality like deposit limits and setting gaming time limits. I still think they could do more in terms of promoting regulation and consumer protection. I also believe the role of the regulator should bear some of this reasonability too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think some bettors go to unlicensed, or offshore gambling operators as opposed to registered/ domestic platforms?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In Germany, for example, if you have gone over your deposit limit, you’re not going to be able to play anymore within that country as deposit limits also often don’t correspond to your withdrawals. So, let’s say you have deposited €500 euros into your account, and you’ve won €20,000, your deposit limit is not adjusted. It’s fixed as standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn’t make sense, because some people gamble for a living, so if they can’t continue to play, they’re obviously going to go to a black-market operator. Also, regulation forbids certain amounts of bonuses you can give out. An interesting situation is in the New York-New Jersey area, where you won’t see any adverts for bonuses in New York, but on the tunnel to New Jersey, which is just a few hours away, you will see many adverts and billboards promoting bonuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Black market players can obviously lure players with high bonuses, and with the promise they don’t have to do KYC. Black-market operators can literally do the total opposite of what the regulated operators are doing, and still attract players.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



 What online gambling trends do you foresee in 2023?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>I think 2023 will be all about responsible gambling, and I expect a lot of regulators to start introducing regulations to promote this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responsible gambling will be the biggest thing in 2023, especially in the current economic situation where we are heading into uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second trend to affect the industry in 2023 is going to be a focus on the customer experience, and operators providing an experience rather than just an account to transfer your money into. There’s also going to be a lot more innovative uses of technology. In our industry, we obviously speak with a lot of operators, and some of those solutions are mindboggling. I also think that online gambling will seek to replicate the social aspect of traditional gambling, like the experience of visiting casinos with friends. So, operators will be able to play with friends online and share the winnings online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personally speaking, I hope in 2023, digital IDs will take further strides forward because we probably spend more time in the digital world than in the physical world where we actually use physical IDs.&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think online gambling and crypto has struck up such an unhealthy relationship?  &nbsp; 



<p>Crypto casinos are not very popular, so I don’t think crypto will remain in the gambling market for too long time. Right now, crypto is being used with some of the black marketplace platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the most famous online casino is a crypto casino, which is being endorsed by big celebrities, and is an unregulated casino. However, in my opinion, I don’t think any major operator will be offering crypto anytime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the operators that we work with are heavily AML-regulated, KYC-regulated, and will not be able to bypass such regulations by offering crypto payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the perspective of an operator, they will have to perform a KYC check to verify a person either way. Every regulator has a certain deposit limit, so users will have to provide the source of their funds, and that will be either via bank statements, or crypto exchange statements.</p>

 Lubna Dajani joined Wider Team  



  
<p>Wider Team welcomed <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> to help clients on digital innovation and transdisciplinary collaboration. Lubna’s dives into <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Hardware-Roots-of-Trust">Hardware Root Of Trust</a> and strategic alliances deepen our strengths. Lubna is based in New York. </p>
  



 Wolff co-wrote a paper on accountability for human harms in trust ecosystems  



<p>Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/philwolff">Phil Wolff</a> co-authored a white paper at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a> with with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickyhickman">Nicky Hickman</a>. They identified human harms that can come from trust systems. The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-in-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2022-11-16.pdf">Trust Over IP’s “Overcoming Human Harm Challenges in Digital Identity Ecosystems” paper</a> (pdf) calls for the SSI community and identity industries to acknowledge the risks of harm and build in preventive measures to avoid negative externalities. ToIP announced the paper this year as “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/17/why-the-digital-identity-juggernaut-needs-safety-belts/">Why the digital identity juggernaut needs safety belts</a>” (“a systemic view of how human harms function in digital identity ecosystems – and how to mitigate them”). Phil asked “<a href="https://wider.team/2023/01/17/what-if-your-identity-ecosystem-caused-pollution/">What if your identity ecosystem caused pollution?</a>” as part of a series on applied ethics, risk management, and <a href="https://wider.team/tag/accountabilitybydesign/">Accountability By Design</a> to every layer of the trust stack. </p>



<p>WiderPoV: “When thousands of parties become part of a digital identity ecosystem, you diffuse responsibility for side effects that ruin, starve, and kill people. Accountability By Design, anyone?” </p>



 Sovrin IoT Paper on traceability for digital twins 



<p>Michael Ford of Aegis Software and Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> wrote and presented “<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/stc/2022/886400a166/1Ip7DKjUrUk">A practical approach to a holistic digital twin</a>” to the October 2022 IEEE Software Technology Conference. (DOI Bookmark:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/STC55697.2022.00030">10.1109/STC55697.2022.00030</a>) </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Digital transformation is bottlenecked by interop problems. Interoperability is being held up by concerns of data security and privacy. “We don’t compete, we complete each other.” Using SSI establishes a chain of trust, enabling integration of siloed data sets. Lubna explained “Let’s say a chip goes into an engine that goes into a pacemaker, in a human. How does your twin of the pacemaker let you trace all the way down to its components.” The IPC-2551 electronics industry standard can be paired with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to let digital twins provide trust and provenance across silos.</p>



<p>We also presented this to the <a href="https://www.gsaglobal.org/iot/ties/">Global Semiconductor Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security</a> (TIES) group in November. </p>

 Shea’s Clinical Internet of Things leadership 



 

 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/michaelshea/">Michael Shea</a> shepherded the IEEE P2933 Trust &amp; Identity team to final draft on their chapter in the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2933/7592/">Clinical Internet of Things (IoT) Data and Device Interoperability with TIPPSS – Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety, Security</a> standard. </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Within a device, “identity of components” is the same as “traceability,” from circuit board parts to modular components. This is another area for security compromise and risk in sensitive devices. A future direction: integrating DIDs and Verifiable Credentials into electronics manufacturing processes. </p>



 IHSCM presentation  



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/mmc/">Michael Morgan-Curran</a> presented to the <a href="https://ihm.org.uk/">Institute of Health And Social Care Managers</a> about how the digitisation of care is impacting healthcare professionals, and how healthcare organisations can support them. We looked at how integrating high assurance digital identity into digital health apps and backend systems can help improve the caregiver experience. </p>







<p>WiderPoV: “High assurance digital identity promotes confident telehealth interactions by providing automatic know-your-patient and know-your-doctor capabilities. It supports appropriate care decisions by letting providers trust data from remote devices.” </p>



 New DIF IoT SIG, new leadership, building on a year of work at Sovrin. 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> started steering the new <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/SIG-IoT">Decentralized Identity Foundation Internet of Things Special Interest Group</a> at the end of 2022. Bi-weekly tempo in Q1. The <a href="https://discord.gg/xG2ZeXX6">IoT Sig Discord</a> channel. Ongoing theme: SSI in <a href="https://wider.team/tag/digital-twins/">digital twins</a>,.</p>



<p>Damian: “This is an exciting opportunity to influence how DIDs and VCs are integrated within the internet of things, and to accelerate adoption.”  </p>



 Wider at European Identity Conference 



<p>“<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5096/2">In Transition – From Platforms to Protocols</a>” drew an appreciative crowd for Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/michaelshea/">Michael Shea</a> and Danube Tech’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a> at EIC 2022 in Berlin. “Only a few years ago the identity ecosystem seemed to be ‘set’ with little chance for change or dislocation of the large federated identity providers. Today the entire identity technology ecosystem is in flux. What will emerge? OIDC? OIDC/SIOP? DIDComm?” </p>



<p>WiderPoV: The changing protocol landscape and shifting identity power centers means we are living in a heterogeneous world where standards are the key to building interoperability and nurturing ecosystems.</p>



 Wider at Grad School 



<p>Damian Glover and Michael Shea gave a Masterclass on the identity of things at the April <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/april/bayes-mba-london-symposium-2022-kicks-off-looking-into-londons-post-covid-role-on-the-world-stage">Bayes MBA London Symposium 2022</a>. It was “about developments in digital identification and the need for decentralised systems to achieve supply chain efficiencies and facilitate ‘reusable, verifiable and universal’ characteristics of online identity.”</p>



<p>WiderPoV: “Someone asked about sanctions on Russia and if SSI affected the ability to implement them and prevent sanction dodging.” (Not so much. Yet.) </p>



 AI Ethics Talk 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> spoke on <a href="https://www.academia.edu/79546094/Smart_cities_through_the_lens_of_human_rights">Smart Cities Through The Lens of Human Rights</a> (paper). </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Injecting “liability regimes” into large projects should help their civic and industrial ecosystems improve accountability in ways that preserve public confidence. </p>



 Wider at Future Identity  



<p>Michael Shea moderated a panel on the Future Identity stage at the Fintech Talents Festival in the City of London. “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-id-driving-data-quality-up-healthcare-costs-down-widerteam/?trackingId=8vPjtJG1RqqdS6TI5Ifwpw%3D%3D">Leveraging Digital Identity In Healthcare</a>” featured <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-mccann/">Maria McCann</a>, who is leading implementation of the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) at the Health Service Executive in Ireland; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mccallum-96640818/">Iain McCallum</a> at techUK, which is being consulted by DCMS on the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillan-ward-7724706/">Gillan Ward</a> from ID Crowd, which is working on a framework enabling NHS Trusts to use digital credentials issued by other Trusts during staff onboarding; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaychopard/">Kay Chopard</a> of Kantara Initiative.</p>

 Problems with Passwords 
<p>Are passwords the weakest link in cybersecurity? We all know that it is risky to authenticate workers, citizens, and customers with passwords. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of credential-based security breaches that we see in the news every day.<br>
There is also no doubting the devastating business impact of these breaches. It’s estimated that the average ransomware payment reaches almost $1.5 million and the average cost of business interruption from ransomware tops $5 million, according to a Lockton report.<br>
But what is actually the root cause of all of these breaches? Passwords really aren’t the problem. It’s anonymous users hiding behind compromised credentials that represent the weakest link in cyber security.<br>
What can we use instead of passwords that will prevent these breaches and keep our workforce, citizens, and customers safe? And when we finally decide to go passwordless, what should our strategy be? If eliminating passwords isn’t enough, what are the three things that are missing in your current passwordless strategy?</p>
 1. Password Reset 
<p>When you go passwordless, it’s almost impossible to get rid of all of your passwords simultaneously. That’s why it’s important to build a password reset mechanism into your passwordless strategy. With BlockID Workforce, the user never has to contact the help desk to reset a legacy password. Instead, all a user needs to do is open the account screen on his or her BlockID application, select the persona associated with the invalid password, enter and confirm a new password, and authenticate with LiveID. Not only does self-service password reset create a substantially easier user experience, it also saves your company $50-$70 each time a user doesn’t need to contact the help desk to reset their password. Another benefit with 1Kosmos legacy password self-service is that in less than 30 minutes, BlockID can integrate with your workstation, network, cloud apps, remote access solutions, or identity platforms.</p>
 2. Interoperability 
<p>You work with a multitude of platforms, all with a multitude of requirements and technologies, making it difficult to scale, securely manage, and modernize. Today one of the biggest challenges organizations face is interoperability. Interoperability is one of the limiting factors to digital transformations and passwordless experiences. You need to blend the new with the old to deliver services and data securely and efficiently. But how? You can’t rip and replace everything as that’s cost-prohibitive. When looking to new security standards your investment needs to look beyond the problem at hand. Many times when asking prospects what their 1-3-5 year road map is, they don’t have one, and that’s a problem. Without a plan, we end up with siloed infrastructures held together with duct tape and hope. So when investing in new technologies there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:</p>
 
 Is it built on modern architectures, and will it meet demands beyond my current needs? 
 Does it have open APIs and an SDK so that you can integrate with new and old technologies? 
 Can it scale to meet current and future requirements? 
 Is it certified? Does the technology adhere to industry standards and regulations like – ISO/IEC 27001, Kantara for Identity Proofing, FIDO for Passwordless and iBeta Biometric certification, etc.? 
 
<p>Answering these questions can set you on the path to success as you’ll implement a technology that is fit for purpose and will grow with the business. You’ll be able to connect the old with the new while you continue down your modernization path keeping everything online, accessible and secure.</p>
 3. Identity 
<p>Identity is the foundational element to security. It’s critical you know who is accessing resources, so you can better determine what they should or shouldn’t have access to. The more you know about that identity the better. That’s why the 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring worker, citizen, and customer identity into the security perimeter so that organizations know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.<br>
This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This provides users with a frictionless experience and organizations with a high level of assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.<br>
By adding identity as a key pillar to network security, we help CISOs and Digital Experience leaders regain control of their IT services from anonymous users hiding behind compromised logins. With identity based authentication, organizations will no longer be held hostage to data breaches, ransomware, and financial fraud perpetrated via identity deception.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? Edward Amoroso and I dig much deeper into all three of these points in our on-demand webinar, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and the Journey to Passwordless</a>. Watch the session to explore passwordless security, zero trust, and understanding who is on the other side of your digital connections.</p>

<p>With the expected date of Holochain’s first-ever beta release this week, I thought it’d be good to go into the sequence of events that are coming before and after that moment. If you’re a developer who’s been waiting for stability before you jump into developing hApps, or if you’ve got an existing codebase and have put it on pause, this will tell you when you can jump back in.</p><blockquote>Keep in mind that this is our best estimate of timelines; things may roll out slightly differently depending on what we encounter. In a project like this, there’s a big difference between “we’ve made a release” and “our whole ecosystem of dev tools is ready for you to use”. So there’ll be a bit of time after the release date as we update all the dependencies.</blockquote><p>After that, I’ll share some release notes for updates that’ve happened since <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/time-to-start-testing-your-happs/">last Dev Pulse</a>. Note that these are still just release candidates, so they’ll only be relevant if you’ve been keeping up with them in order to help us hunt for bugs and missing features in the leadup to beta.</p><p>And lastly, <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">we've got another developer course coming up!</a> If you wanted to attend the first one but couldn't, now's your chance — it's all online and happening in March.</p> Releasing a full DWeb app dev stack, piece by piece <p>Because Holochain is a full development stack for P2P apps, dev tools are important. And with every change in the core runtime and its APIs, all those tools have to be updated and re-released. We learned a lot of valuable stuff about what this means after our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/full-featured-holochain-beta-rc/">first release candidate</a> in December — it was the first time we tried to update all the components in sync with each other. It became a dress rehearsal for 0.1.0-beta, and we feel well prepared now.</p><p>Last week we released Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.3 and rc.4. We intend for rc.4 to be the final one before beta, which should happen later in the week — 26 January is the date we’re aiming for.</p><p>‘Beta release’ means simply that there will be an <code>0.1.0</code> release tag on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/">GitHub</a> (note the absence of <code>-beta</code>), along with downloadable source code so you can compile your own binaries.</p><p>After that, devs will be able to update all the things that depend on it — specifically developer and user tooling. We’re anticipating that this will take a couple weeks, which should mean that everything will be ready to use by 9 February.</p><p>Here’s a roughly sequential list of everything that needs to happen for a ‘minimum usable release’:</p>  Holochain 0.1.0 release: A particular commit in the Git history is marked as the official release. It includes the conductor runtime, the host SDKs (HDI and HDK), the proxy service binary, and the <code>hc</code> dev tool. You’ll be able to see it on our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/">GitHub releases page</a> and download the source code to compile yourself. Binaries will appear on crates.io a day or two afterward, along with the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi">HDI</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk">HDK</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api">conductor API</a> documentation reference.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">Rust</a> clients, for building application front-ends, will be updated, released, and made available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">NPM</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_client">crates.io</a>. Many core parts of the dev and user ecosystem rely on these clients.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> test framework, used to write tests for your hApps and ours, will be updated, released, and made available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama">NPM</a>.  After the above components are updated, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">scaffolder</a>’s templates will be updated to include any changes. This is a new iteration of our rapid app development tool that can generate boilerplate back-end and front-end code for your hApp, along with tests and a Holonix dev environment setup to match your project’s Holochain dependencies.  The <code>hc launch</code> dev command will be updated. This runs a bare-bones version of the Launcher to provide a minimal conductor environment, UI, and one or more agent nodes to test your full hApp.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub">DevHub</a>, a hApp package repo (that’s right, a hApp for distributing hApps) will be updated to support any changes in Holochain, and will be incorporated into the Launcher. Internal QA testing will make sure it all works.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Launcher</a>, an easy-to-use container for downloading and running hApps, will be updated and released, with installers for Linux, macOS, and Windows available on GitHub. Launcher includes DevHub so devs can upload apps and users can download them.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix">Holonix</a>, a shell environment that includes all the software needed to develop and test hApps, will be updated to include all of the above. It will be made available via the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install">quick start installation</a> method.  Time to start building!   Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.3: Bugfixes, zome name included in signals <p>Release date: 17 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1, 0.2.0-beta-rc.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1, 0.1.0-beta-rc.2<br>Breaking changes: app API</p><p>This is mostly a bugfix release, with one breaking change requested by hApp developers.</p>  Breaking (app API): App-generated signals now include the name of the zome that generated them, along with the existing cell ID. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1750">#1750</a>)  New/bugfix: Pressing Ctrl+C on the command line gracefully shuts down the conductor, processing and cleaning up remaining cell tasks. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1761">#1761</a>)  Bugfix: Calling <code>emit_signal</code>` from a <code>post_commit</code> callback caused a panic; now it succeeds. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1749">#1749</a>)  Bugfix: Disabling and re-enabling an app caused all of its cells to become unresponsive when it tried to access the DHT. This happened because the agent had a zero storage arc when they rejoined; now their storage arc is recreated. Known issue: cells are still occasionally unresponsive when they’re re-enabled; the workaround is to disable and re-enable the whole hApp again. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1749">#1744</a>)   Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.4: WASM metering, host API versioning, bundle format change <p>Release date: 20 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.2.0-beta-rc.3<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3<br>Breaking changes: admin API, app API, host API, hApp bundles, HDK</p><p>In addition to some new and clarified content in the documentation (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1778">#1778</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1765">#1765</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1767">#1767</a>), there are a few bugfixes and some low-level WASM, host interface, and bundling format changes that will require rebuilding your hApp but probably won’t require you to modify your code.</p>  Breaking (host API): Functions in the host interface are now versioned, and are also prefixed differently. For instance, <code>__zome_info</code> becomes <code>__hc__zome_info_1</code> until its signature changes. This helps end-user hApp managers like Launcher and DevHub manage conductor/app compatibility. If you’re using the HDI and HDK, this will not require code changes; the names of the functions you use will stay the same (e.g., <code>zome_info</code>) and simply point to the newest supported underlying host function. You will need to recompile your zomes though, and of course if you’re bypassing HDI/HDK and calling the external functions directly, you will need to change your code. Also note that guest callbacks such as <code>validate()</code> are not yet versioned. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1781">#1781</a> and holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/90">#90</a>)  New, possibly breaking (hApps): WebAssembly metering has been re-enabled, this time increased from 10 to 100 giga-ops. This means that, after 100 billion WASM instructions, any zome call or callback will terminate, preventing buggy or malicious zomes from using up a machine’s resources. While this is 10× higher than the previous limit, we’re still asking you to test your code to see if it hits this limit. Also note that you’ll need to recompile your zomes, as the means of getting and setting input and output data has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1781">#1781</a> and holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/88">#88</a>)  Breaking (admin API, hApp bundles): The <code>resources</code> of a bundle are now encoded as byte arrays rather than sequences of numbers, changing the format of hApp bundles. You’ll need to repackage your hApps to update them. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1723">#1723</a>)  Breaking (app API): Each <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/enum.CellInfo.html"><code>CellInfo</code></a> variant has its own cell type now: <code>Cell</code> is split into <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/struct.ProvisionedCell.html"><code>ProvisionedCell</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/struct.ProvisionedCell.html"><code>ClonedCell</code></a>. Additionally, <code>CellInfo</code> enum variants are snake-cased during de-/serialization. The <code>CreateCloneCell</code> and <code>EnableCloneCell</code> endpoints now return <code>ClonedCell</code> instead of <code>InstalledCell</code>. The unimplemented endpoint <code>SignalSubscription</code> has also been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1763">#1763</a>)  Breaking (app API): The <code>AppInfo</code> endpoint now includes the agent public key used to instantiate the app in its return value. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1786">#1786</a>)  Breaking (admin API): The <code>StartApp</code> endpoint, meant as a companion to the already removed <code>PauseApp</code>, has been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1785">#1785</a>)  Breaking (HDK): Links returned from <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.1.0-beta-rc.3/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now contain the agent key of the author. Note: this means that otherwise identical links (that is, whose base, tag, and target are the same) are not deduplicated, unlike entries. This was the behaviour already; the new <code>author</code> field merely makes that more explicit. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1782">#1782</a>)  Bugfix: When you tried to install a hApp for an existing agent and one of the cells being created already existed in another hApp, it would allow it. Now it returns an error. This error was unlikely to be encountered in daily use, because the usual method of installing a new hApp involves creating a new agent. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1773">#1773</a>)  Bugfix: Disabled clone cells were being reenabled on conductor restart; now they stay disabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1775">#1775</a>)  Improvements: The number of warnings in the conductor log has been reduced (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1779">#1779</a>) and failed zome call errors have gotten more informative (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1783">#1783</a>).  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20230120225800">Read the full changelogs</a> for the last two releases.</p> Known issues   There are still intermittent issues with re-enabled hApps becoming unresponsive when they’re trying to access their DHTs. The current workaround is to disable and re-enable the hApp again.  Disabling cells should now make them unresponsive, but some activity will continue in the background, namely they will continue to gossip. We intend to release a fix for this soon, though it may not go into the beta.  As mentioned above, the new WASM metering might cause CPU-heavy zome functions to terminate early. This is not a bug but a new constraint to test your code against. We’re currently testing it against our own DevHub, which does some CPU-heavy data crunching in its zomes.   Client release notes  Javascript client 0.11.10: Signal handler changes, updated types <p>Release date: 11 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p>  New/breaking: App-generated signals now carry the name of the zome they were generated by.  Breaking: A lot of changes have been made to various admin and app API types.  Breaking: The final parameter, a signal-handling callback, has been removed from WebSocket-based connection-establishing functions, leaving only the traditional JavaScript-style <code>.on("signal", cb)</code> event-registering function.  Changed: All Launcher environment properties are now optional.  Bugfix: Signals are now only emitted to the <code>AppAgentClient</code> that is set up to communicate with the cell the signals came from.   JavaScript client 0.11.11: Async crypto imports <p>Release date: 14 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p>  New: Utility functions that depend on crypto are now imported asynchronously.   JavaScript client 0.11.14: Zome name in signals, API documentation <p>Release date: 19 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3</p>  New/breaking: App-generated signals now carry the name of the zome they were generated by.  Bugfix: The cell provisioning strategy type for clone cells has been fixed.  New: The API now has auto-generated documentation, available <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/develop/docs/client.md">in the GitHub repo</a>.   JavaScript client 0.11.15: Bundle resource serialisation change <p>Release date: 23 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>The changes in this version are all to keep compatibility with the rc.4 release of Holochain.</p>  New/breaking: In-line binary resources in a hApp bundle passed to <code>InstallApp</code> are now encoded in a <code>UInt8Array</code> rather than an array of numbers.  Breaking: <code>CreateCloneCell</code> and <code>EnableCloneCell</code> return a <code>ClonedCell</code> object instead of <code>InstallledCell</code>.  Breaking: The unused admin API endpoint <code>StartApp</code> has been removed.  Breaking: Wherever <code>Cell</code> was previously returned from an API end point, it’s now a union type that can be either a <code>ProvisionedCell</code> or <code>ClonedCell</code>.  Breaking: <code>CellInfo</code> variants are renamed to snake case.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">Read the full changelogs</a>.</p> Test framework release notes  Tryorama 0.10.2: <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> exposed <p>Release date: 15 Jan 2023<br>JavaScript client compatibility: 0.11.11<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p><p>Along with an update to the JavaScript client, this release brings:</p>  New: The <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> is available to the local conductor object via a <code>conductor.appAgentWs()</code> getter function. This is now used by default by <code>Scenario.addPlayerWithApp()</code>.  Removed: In line with the JS client update, signals no longer have <code>type</code> and <code>data</code> properties.   Tryorama 0.10.3 and 0.10.4: JS client updates   0.10.3, released on 16 Jan 2023, updates to the unreleased bugfix JS client 0.11.12.  0.10.4, released on 16 Jan 2023, updates to the unreleased bugfix JS client 0.11.13.   Known issues <p>Tryorama hasn’t yet been updated to support the breaking changes in Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.4.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases">Read the full changelogs</a>.</p> Holochain Developer Training again — this time it’s online! <p>A lot of people have asked us when there’ll be another dev training course, and specifically when there’ll be an online one. Well, we now have an answer for you: in March! It’ll be a six-day course spread out over two (long) weekends, and will have the same all-day intensive format as the in-person course last July.</p><p>This course won’t cover Rust, so it’ll be the best fit if you’re already familiar with Rust and are ready to jump right into Holochain. If you want to learn Rust so you can attend, the Rust website has three great <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">getting-started resources</a>.</p><p>Having attended the course in July (mostly to take photos and cook soup), I can say that the instructors have created a really effective course. Their goal is to leave nobody behind, and the lead facilitator Marcus has developed a unique course format over the last decade to do exactly that. He co-founded and led the famous <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> boot camp, which enjoys a remarkable amount of success equipping devs to be ready to build real software. Marcus and his co-facilitators are really excited to be adapting this format for teaching Holochain.</p><p>Learn more about the course on <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">our website</a> and <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">apply here</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/fr/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> SpaceX</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/uj3hvdfQujI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  <p>Privacy was a major topic of conversation in 2022 — beyond just keeping personal data out of the hands of cybercriminals. Privacy now ties into many adjacent areas, including Zero Trust security, antitrust concerns, usage of services provided by "Big Tech," and biometric authentication. As the conversation around privacy progresses beyond a focus on security infrastructure and best practices for preventing data breaches, regulations are working to catch up.</p>

<p>In 2023, the larger implications of privacy — including the ethics of using artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics, the management of consumer-to-business relationships, and public issues such as consumer protection — will become much clearer through regulatory and legal action.</p>

<p>With today marking the start of Data Privacy Week, and <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/programs/2023-data-privacy-week-champions/">ForgeRock proudly championing</a> the cause, it's an ideal time to explore what to expect now and in the future in the evolving world of data privacy.</p>

 A Whole New World of AI, Consent, and Personal Data Management 

<p>What if AI could be used to power user consent, making life easier for individuals and businesses alike by enabling "smart" choices at the right moments? Offering personal data controls through AI could turn the tables on ethical concerns about this technology. A challenge is that privacy regulations typically expect consent to be concrete — explicit and specific to a purpose — and they look askance at automated data processing.</p>

<p>This is where the new UK <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) offers hope. This bill allows for "automatic consent," which opens the door to more abstract forms of user permission that can smartly bundle up related usage patterns for consent and make it easier to manage consent in IoT environments, such as home automation and connected cars.</p>

<p>As organizations navigate the complex new world of AI, we recommend the following best practices to remain compliant and bolster data privacy measures:</p>

  Make user permissions for initial data sharing necessary and meaningful. That means letting people choose – and change their minds –&nbsp;without constraints or pressure. Allowing people to make consent decisions at times far removed from critical data-sharing moments and offering dashboards for monitoring and revoking consent help to make consent more meaningful. 
	 Enable data permissions that usefully anticipate the user's intentions. It may be impossible for an individual to say "yes" or "no" honestly to each request for data collection in the course of an average day, particularly when interacting with smart devices. Being asked for consent for a new purpose of use while in the middle of navigating one's car, for example, could be an extremely dangerous experience. Therefore, identity and access management (IAM) technologies and other systems must generalize rules for permissions and anticipate the user's intentions. This is where AI-first data management will derive new consents based on previously granted permissions, or by offering users simplified consent options that will justify actions for related permissions. 
	 Design AI-enabled permission experiences that can grow as the data collected about the user grows. Permissions need to scale so that the sheer amounts of data collected and generated by users, services, and devices can be automated and empower users to make more informed choices about the use of their data. 
  What's Next? Data Privacy Takes Center Stage in 2023 and Beyond 

<p>With the new year officially upon us, and with data privacy finding common cause with trends such as Zero Trust security, consumer protection, and even Web3, we're predicting that privacy makes dramatic inroads as a motivator for every organizational stakeholder, enabling solutions that address multiple problems at once. Here are some predictions about these adjacent areas:</p>

  More passwordless authentication: As organizations take advantage of digital wallets for payment, biometric authentication, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, we can expect to see more pressure on technologists to adapt. They must ensure high authentication assurances in every user journey, while keeping the customer experience within and across channels seamless. 
	 Decentralized identity will get a boost: This year, decentralized identity will solidify its role in society as wallet technology becomes more broadly adopted for identity purposes. This will open up opportunities both for strong, passwordless authentication to merge with wallet tech and for better methods for user control of personal information. 
	 AI at the heart of identity: In 2023, we'll see increased adoption of AI to secure identity and access management. AI, when made explainable and when appropriately paired with human oversight, has the potential not only to make identity safer for consumers and employees, but also to improve the lives of the cybersecurity professionals who must make sense of massive amounts of data. 
 <p>Let's make 2023 the year enterprises step up to become leaders in privacy — to compete, not just comply, and take proactive action to better secure and respect the personal information in their custody.</p>

				<p>At Trinsic we believe in a “one tap future” where people can prove statements with a single click of a button and gain access to what they need. Past attempts at this vision have had to compromise on privacy by using things like “sign in with Facebook”, leading to user data centralized on big technology company servers. Emerging technology standards like <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers</a> present the opportunity to put users at the center of their internet experience, while offering more convenience and ease of use.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Great Product Experiences Are Key to Adoption  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The standards, protocols, and infrastructure for using verifiable credentials are ready to support millions of people every day, but we haven’t seen adoption take off yet. In short, it’s because it’s been very hard to build great product experiences until recently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Requiring users to download new applications and scan QR codes was how many decentralized identity platforms, Trinsic included, have shown proofs of concept. The <a href="https://trinsic.id/moving-toward-identity-technology-ready-for-mass-adoption/">user experience that is ready for mass adoption</a>&nbsp;is one that is more seamless for the everyday internet user and offers major convenience benefits without sacrificing privacy.</p><p>When a user accesses an app powered by Trinsic, they don’t have to make an account, create a username, or remember a password. They simple enter an identifier (like an email), verify ownership of that identifier, and now they can utilize any credentials associated with it.</p>

				<p>The need for better digital identity spans industries from education to workforce to social media, healthcare, finance, and more. Because of this, most entrepreneurs and developers won’t always define what they’re building by its implications for identity. Instead, the most successful builders are hyperfocused on solving a specific user problem in a given niche. So here’s our guide on how to get started and help usher in a new wave of IDtech products that put users at the center of their identities and come with privacy and consent built-in.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 1: Define the Niche Problem You Want to Tackle  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Every great idea starts with a focused audience. Facebook started on a singular college campus, where it captured significant market and expanded out from there. Here are a few sample problems you could tackle with verifiable credentials, but recognize that even if you choose one of these ideas, you will have to narrow it down to a more specific problem and audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sample identity problems in specific sectors:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Education: Students don’t have ownership of their diplomas and must request them from institutions whenever they apply for a new job.  Workforce: Anyone can claim anything on LinkedIn, like saying they went to a certain college or worked at a certain company even if the information is false.  Social media: You can’t prove and reward fans based on how early they followed you and supported your content.  Healthcare: Every time you go to a new doctor’s office you have to fill in lots of repetitive paperwork.  Finance: You have to re-scan your license or passport every time you want to open a different account.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are all problems that entrepreneurs could address by building an IDtech product. If you’re serious about starting a company, you’ll want to do customer interviews, talking to dozens of people to more deeply understand the problems they face. But for now, let’s imagine you’re already an expert in one of these fields, you’ve done the user research, and you have a unique insight that you’re going to translate into a product.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 2: Formulate Your Value Proposition  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once you’ve developed a deep understanding of a specific problem, now you have to imagine the kind of solution that would solve this problem. Carrying forward our sample identity problems from before, here are some potential value propositions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sample value propositions in different sectors:<br><br></p>  Education: Giving students ownership of their diplomas will make it easier for them to prove their learning achievements.  Workforce: Utilizing verifiable credentials to prove your work history on a social media site like LinkedIn would make hiring more efficient.  Social media: Allowing fans to prove their loyalty and fanhood will let creators reward their supporters for finding them early.  Healthcare: Giving patients an easy way to hold their medical history and selectively share relevant information will reduce friction in getting quality healthcare.  Finance: Storing a verifiable credential of your proven identity would allow you to more seamlessly access and open new accounts.  <p><br>These are the types of insights that you could start prototyping concepts around using Trinsic’s platform. Since you’ve defined a problem and imagined a potential solution, the next step is to start sketching out how the product interactions would look.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 3: Determine the Information You’re Going to Represent as a Verifiable Credential 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>At the core of any IDtech company is giving users ownership of their information in the form of a verifiable credential. For each of the potential scenarios above, there is a foundational credential that would begin to unlock value for the user. In the education example, you might be representing a diploma as a credential. Or in the social media example, you are going to allow users to prove that they followed a creator in their first year of being on YouTube.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/">Trinsic’s dashboard</a>, you can define a verifiable credential schema, specifying the data types and which fields are required and optional in the credential. In the provable fanhood example, your credential schema could be something simple like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Fan username  Creator username  Date followed  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 4: Determine Your Data Source + Start Issuing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once you’ve defined a credential template, you’ll need to figure out how you’re going to populate credentials with the correct information. If you’re in the proof of concept stage, you can issue credentials manually through the Trinsic dashboard. As you develop your use case further, you will likely need to integrate with other APIs or existing databases in order to programmatically populate credential information and issue them to the corresponding users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have this all set, you can start issuing credentials. Right now you can issue credentials to a user’s email, and they’ll receive a notification that they have a new credential. The real value comes from utilizing the credential though, so the critical next step is building out the verification experience.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 5: Build Your First Verification Experience  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The point of putting information in a verifiable credential is so someone can present it, prove a statement, and gain access to something they want. So what will you give your user access to? It depends on the use case, but let’s first think about the social media example. If you’re a creator, maybe you will give your first 100 YouTube followers access to a merchandise store with a 50% discount applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, you’re going to build a way for an e-commerce store to show a discount based on information shared in a credential. Luckily we already built a demo of how this would work with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.notion.so/Interactive-demo-idea-gathering-04ef351a5a694ea3b710b4c12c5c2612">OkeyDoke</a>&nbsp;e-commerce store.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 6. Consider Trust and Governance  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Now that you have a rough prototype of how you will issue credentials and how users can verify them to gain access to something they want, you’ve probably realized there is an opportunity for fraud here. Without a list of trusted credential issuers, what is to stop someone else from issuing themselves a credential that “proves” they were one of the first 100 subscribers on YouTube?</p><p><br>Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> service and dashboard governance feature make trust establishment easy. The core function here is to establish a list of which issuers are allowed to issue which credential schemas. Once you’ve put your trust registry in place, credential verifications will fail if the issuer is not trusted to issue the schema that is being checked. While the potential for abuse in a testing environment is relatively low, once your application launches to more users, you will have to carefully consider the implications of how your trust ecosystem is designed.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 7. Test and Get Feedback on the Product  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Building out your proof of concept is just the first step toward developing a successful IDtech product. Hopefully with Trinsic’s platform you’ll be able to spin up prototypes in a matter of weeks, rather than months. This gives your team more time to seek feedback from early users and potential customers in order to refine the experience. Being able to show early traction and even beta customers can be the strongest proof point when pitching to investors.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 We Need Great Identity Products 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>It’s time we take identity back from big technology companies and put users at the center of the internet experience. If you’re considering building an identity product, this framework should help you prioritize what’s important to get your ideas to market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one tap future is coming. The opportunity of a generation is building products that establish digital trust and bring more safety and privacy online.

There are thousands dotted around the countryside making horse shoes, stirrups, ploughs, pitchforks, shovels and so on. Every manor has&nbsp;one.</p><p>Now fast forward to today, a society and economy dependent on metal working in bridges, skyscrapers, cars, trains, planes and cranes, plus a phantasmagorical array of machines, gadgets, utensils and devices enabling us to do a breathtaking range of&nbsp;things.</p><p>You could say nothing has changed. After all, it’s all just metalworking isn’t it? Or you could say our world has been utterly transformed. The nature, scale and scope of metalworking today makes it qualitatively different to what came&nbsp;before.</p><p>The same is happening today with data. People have gathered, shared and used information ever since there were people to do so. Today, we have data gatherers and users dotted right across our land — a myriad of different organisations and service providers collecting and using personal data to do a wide range of things. Like mediaeval blacksmiths. Yet in many ways, compared to what’s still to come, it’s just a tiny beginning.</p> Just imagine <p>As with that blacksmith, many people find it hard to imagine or countenance the changes that are now unfolding.</p><p>This is the realm of innovation and growth — two words that are bandied about so casually and so often that often they’re little more than meaningless cliches. Yet the innovation and growth that’s now being made possible by the personal data store — new ways of collecting and using personal data — are real and important. Just like today’s metalworking versus that of yesteryear.</p><p>Four critical developments are now coming together to trigger an explosion in personal data-driven innovation. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Radical cost reductions <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">made possible by personal data stores</a> stripping out the FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) of data use by enabling its safe, efficient sharing and re-use. (Most people don’t think of this as ‘innovation’, but as we explain below, it’s the essential foundation and&nbsp;driver.)  Making individuals the point of integration of data about themselves. Currently with today’s data systems, individuals’ data is dispersed across the hundreds of separate, different organisations that collect data about them, With each organisation jealousy guarding the data it has collected, it can never be brought together to create a rich, rounded picture of that individual (without creating horrendous privacy problems). This is a fundamental design flaw. It makes it structurally impossible to create a complete, holistic data picture of each individual. By enabling individuals to aggregate data about themselves safely and privately, personal data stores create an entirely new-to-the world, incomparably rich source of data about people and their lives — one that has been impossible to create up to now. It has the potential to act as a sort of ‘stem cell’ driving all future service provision, including a dazzling array of new person-centric services.  A proliferation of new sources of data generation. If you had told that blacksmith that one day you could walk around with a metal device in your pocket that automatically counted the number of steps you take, he’d have said you are barking mad. But every smartphone can do that. And this is just a small beginning of the (highly personal) data that smart, internet of things enabled devices can and will soon be generating.  Individuals in control of their data. Such a world of data proliferation could become — indeed risks becoming — a totalitarian, exploitative nightmare where super-powerful predatory corporations hoover up all the data there is, to exercise control over all and sundry, and extract whatever value they can. But if individuals are empowered with their own data, so that any sharing of such data remains under their control, the nightmare scenario can be avoided and benefits achieved, both efficiently and&nbsp;fairly.  <p>It’s always hard to imagine a world that hasn’t come into being yet. That’s precisely the point about innovation — that it hasn’t happened yet. So what sort of innovations, and growth, are we talking&nbsp;about?</p> Innovation as democratisation <p>The first key point — the one most routinely overlooked — is that ‘innovations’ remain irrelevant until they are democratised. Until that is, they scale by becoming affordable and available to ordinary people. It is this that generates social and economic&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Take the motor car. It remained a plaything of the super rich until Henry Ford found a way to slash its costs of production by well over 90% — so that ordinary people could start buying and using cars. The same is true of every life-changing, transformational innovation: access to electricity, air travel, the internet.</p><p>The Internet was a social and economic irrelevance when it was a tool for geeks working in physics laboratories. Email was marginal when it was only for academics in universities. No matter what technology or innovation you are talking about, unless and until it is made safe, easy to use, affordable, and accessible/available its social and economic impact will be&nbsp;limited.</p><p>That is what personal data stores are doing with personal data: making it safe, easy to access and use at very low cost for all those wanting to use it — individuals themselves and services working for them. Personal data stores are turning something that was once reserved for the super-rich organisation — the collection and use of data — into something everyone can do, every day of their lives. That is transformational in&nbsp;itself.</p> Innovation as enrichment <p>Now factor in the individual as the point of integration of their own data. There are countless services today that either only exist in peoples’ imaginations or eke out a survival in the margins because the costs and complexities of amassing the data needed to provide them are currently too&nbsp;great.</p><p>Take something as simple as financial advice. To provide good financial advice, an advisor needs to access data held by many different parties in many different places (e.g. current accounts, savings accounts, loans, investments, pensions, assets owned, legacies and so on). Today, most of the costs of providing advice are absorbed by the costs of acquiring the data needed to inform it, not of arriving at the advice&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Personal data stores will transform the cost (and quality) of such advice, democratising it as they do so. The same is true of all aspects of our lives. For example: joined up, integrated health and care services that take full account of individuals’ particular genetic make up, medical histories, lifestyles, exercise regimes and so on; or integrated, joined up. life-long skills and career planning services that take full account of all the individual’s educational and training attainments, their personal skills, their work and life experience and their personal goals. And so on. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Now add in new sources of data. Not just the Fitbit data that may inform health advice. What about electronic receipts that enable you to automatically record every item you purchase, to see trends, to dig deeper into the quality, materials and provenance of particular items, to manage warranties, build personal asset inventories, compare prices, plan future purchases, identify possible substitutes, and so&nbsp;on?</p><p>You could, for example, generate a carbon footprint of every item purchased and every activity undertaken to identify your personal carbon footprint, with carbon concierge services offering ways of reducing this footprint.</p><p>New sources of data, made available safely and cheaply, making completely new services possible.</p> A social and economic transformation <p>Back in the 20th century, western societies and economies were transformed by what came to be known as the consumer goods revolution. Thanks to the advent of electricity national grids which made universal access to electricity possible, plus a productivity revolution in manufacturing made possible by Henry Ford-style mass production, suddenly people had affordable access to a dazzling array of devices, gadgets, machines and services that transformed their lives: washing machines, fridges, vacuum cleaners, kettles, radios, TVs, central heating, microwaves, computers, mobile phones, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The washing machine saved (mostly) women seven hours of labour a week. Central heating removed six hours a week shovelling coal and dust. Fridges helped people reduce time spent shopping and food waste. We can’t imagine our lives now without computers, the internet and mobile phones. Providing these new gadgets and devices created new industries with millions of new jobs and tax revenues to&nbsp;boot.</p><p>All this was made possible by democratising the machine.

<p>Dear community,</p><p>Metadium started five years ago as a blockchain platform focused on Decentralized Identifier (DID) technology, and it has continued expanding in the web3 market. Over the years, Metadium’s technology has been used in multiple services and solutions, ranging from identification and authentication to mobile payment and transportation services. Our ecosystem is constantly growing and has recently reached industries like logistics, automotive, tourism, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>We are happy to share with you Metadium 2.0’s roadmap as well as the plans for our&nbsp;future:</p> Metadium 2.0 <p>Blockchain Identification for&nbsp;All</p><p>Metadium is an open-source public blockchain that provides identification by issuing, authenticating, inquiring, verifying, and managing history through various services based on decentralized identifier (DID) technology.</p> 1. Platform Technology <p>Ethereum equivalence support and EVM compatibility</p>  The Metadium platform is developed with the expansion of META ID and the availability of smart contracts as a top priority.  Provide EVM compatibility for an easy onboarding process and the smooth processing of tasks (deployment, execution, etc).  Reflect Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to ensure an environment that promotes Metadium ecosystem’s growth and contributes to the blockchain ecosystem with open source library&nbsp;updates.   2. Governance   Enable active governance operations through an autonomous authority configuration to develop and grow the Metadium ecosystem.  Optimize Metadium’s cloud infrastructure and governance contracts for more active participation and platform utilization of node authority.  Create an environment where everyone interested in blockchain and its services (DApps), including Metadium users, can make suggestions and be considered.  Evolve Metadium’s global vision of DAO organizations with a more professional and detailed operational direction.   3. META ID&nbsp;2.0 <p>Scaling up through META&nbsp;ID</p>  Provide a stable and seamless user experience and META ID smart contracts despite a growing ecosystem and the number of&nbsp;users.  Expand Metadium’s ecosystem with Decentralized ID (META ID) and ID Hub infrastructure.  Provide an environment with functions and information about the decentralized ID (META ID), and ID Hub can be applied to each of the DApp’s settings&nbsp;. It also provides model discovery and functionality that combine blockchain information and user authentication information like META ID user labeling and inter-blockchain VC.  Increase scalability by taking a “Hub” role that connects authentication information, such as user KYC and other credentials, through a Metadium-based bridging technology that can interoperate with other blockchains and services.   4. Development Support   Create an open and developer-friendly environment for onboarding various projects into the ecosystem.  Simplify the onboarding process by providing SDK and open source that can be easily deployed and META ID &amp; ID Hub packages in a library format that includes the W3C standard.

 What is Blockchain Verification &amp; Validation? 
<p>Modern network infrastructure is turning towards decentralized models of record keeping. Authentication and identity management are no different.</p>
<p>What is blockchain verification? Blockchain verification uses private blockchain technology to store and verify identity credentials.</p>
 What Is a Blockchain? 
<p>A blockchain is a relatively new ledger and database technology invented to support decentralized information management. Initially conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto in their Bitcoin whitepaper, the blockchain serves as a solution to two specific problems–one, to avoid record duplication in the ledger, and two, to provide a decentralized mechanism for verification modeled on peer-to-peer transactions.</p>
<p>While the internal workings of a blockchain can get quite complex, the simple application of any  blockchain is in contexts where users or organizations want decentralized records management. Users collectively provide resources to verify credentials and other information via built-in cryptographic standards. At the same time, they get to retain their information without relying on monolithic databases. </p>
<p>Several blockchain types serve this purpose, all of which fit into different contexts. These blockchains include:</p>
 
 Public: Public blockchains are (obviously) public ledgers in which any user may participate in transaction verification and (if the blockchain supports it) information exchange. Centralized organizations do not maintain these blockchains, although an organization may participate as users. Common examples of public blockchains include most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
<p>The advantages of public blockchains are that they are open and trustable because no one can alter records independently. Conversely, they tend to be inefficient in terms of energy consumption and performance, and they don’t scale as well as their private counterparts. </p> 
 Private: <a>Private blockchains</a> adopt the decentralized approach of the blockchain on a smaller scale, typically within an organization or application. It still relies on peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized data management, but there are often additional controls in place managed by a central authority.
<p>While not as free or transparent as their public counterparts, private blockchains are typically scalable, secure, and fast.</p> 
 Consortium: Consortium blockchains are a collection of blockchain systems owned by private interests used to streamline information sharing and workflows. 
 Hybrid: A combination of public and private systems where an organization (or group of organizations) may segregate private blockchain data internally while sharing public data on a public blockchain system. 
 
<p>Additionally, two significant access categories may apply across different blockchain types:</p>
 
 Permissionless: Permissionless blockchains allow any and all users to join and participate in the network without centralized control. Almost all public blockchains are permissionless, but it is possible to have permissioned, public systems.  
 Permissioned: These blockchains are those where users must follow specific rules and regulations to participate. This participation is almost always predicated on the authority of a central organization or consortium. 
 
<p>These categories are not exclusive to a blockchain type, but more often than not, a public blockchain will be permissionless while private chains are permissioned.</p>
 How Does the Blockchain Support Identity Verification? 
<p>Traditionally, authentication and identity verification work through a series of applications and databases–a centralized store of user information and credentials. </p>
<p>This presents a few problems: </p>
 
 Honeypots: Singular databases are known as “honeypots,” or attractive targets for hackers. If an identity database is compromised, then every user’s identity is threatened–including any connected information throughout that system. 
 Ownership: Individual users do not own or manage databases… large companies do. As such, it’s increasingly difficult for users to disentangle their personal information from large companies that store it. Blockchain schemes allow users to manage their own information within a blockchain system without relying on a major company. 
 Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Devices: The increasing adoption of smart devices and Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) work models makes centralized authentication and verification challenges. A <a>blockchain authentication</a> model can help make these networks more scalable and secure. 
 
<p>A blockchain can address these issues through decentralized management and user-focused participation. </p>
 Benefits of Digital Identity and Blockchain Verification 
<p>Because blockchains address questions of security, distribution, and scalability, they bring significant benefits to organizations that adopt them.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits include:</p>
 
 Self-Sovereignty: A major strength of the blockchain is that users own their own data on their devices. Rather than rely on large databases, the system can authenticate user credentials against those stored locally on a user’s device.
<p>We often lose sight of the importance of data ownership, and blockchain verification can go a long way in foregrounding self-sovereign <a>identity management</a>.</p> 
 Transparency: Blockchains are essentially transparent–that is, anyone participating on the chain has access to information relevant to the chain. Likewise, these records are under the user’s control, which means they know exactly what information is on the network and, if necessary, correct or remove it.  
 Portability: Modern security standards emphasize data portability, or the capacity to move data from one location or system to another. With blockchain verification, it becomes much easier to move information between compliant systems without having to have, for example, multiple accounts or worry about data format and compatibility.  
 Security: Additionally, such portability will strengthen the security around modern authentication approaches like federated identity management and Single Sign-On (SSO) schemes. Rather than having shared databases and complex APIs, blockchains could make moving between participating systems much easier–all while providing more control over what data is and is not exposed.  
 Decentralized Key Management: A major issue in security and cryptography is key management, or the secure sharing of decryption keys so that users can keep their data obfuscated without impacting their usability or compromising overall security. A blockchain can provide a resilient form of key management that doesn’t present singular points of failure.

   Predictions on insider threats, passwordless authentication, artificial intelligence, and more 

<p>Few industries move as quickly as cybersecurity, broadly, and the identity and access management (IAM) segment, specifically. There is a constant barrage of novel threats that can lead to costly breaches — and innovative, new ways to combat them. Seismic changes in the workplace push IAM leaders to create solutions that protect employees and data no matter where they are. And an evolution in the way people consume apps and services — conducting more and more of their personal business online — means we must help our enterprise customers meet new expectations for security, personalization, and seamless digital experiences.</p>

<p>The changing nature of the industry is why it's become something of a tradition to look at emerging trends and predict where they may take us in the coming year.</p>

<p>Recently, ForgeRock executives shared their views on trends related to digital identity and the challenges organizations will face in 2023. Their perspectives are based on their own expertise along with what they're hearing from extensive discussions with customers and what they're observing across the industry at large.</p>

	 Sweeping corporate layoffs will cause insider threats to rise 
	
<p>As we head into 2023, the security risk associated with third parties is not going away. With the threat of an economic downturn, many companies are conducting hiring freezes and, unfortunately, massive layoffs, causing insider threats to rise to crisis levels. To fill in workforce gaps, many companies will turn to consultants to get them through this tumultuous period of economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>However, consultants and contractors can bring the unintended risk of breaches to an organization's doorstep. They often get access to sensitive information and are allowed on company networks, but their security practices and training may differ from full-time employees. If a consultant's device is compromised, it's too easy for malware to make its way into an organization's network and spread to other devices, putting the whole organization at risk.</p>

<p>One solution is a more robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">governance</a> solution to give enterprises better visibility into who has access to what information, on what device, and from any location. For large enterprises, the only way to truly manage this governance is with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p>

	 
		 
		 
		 Peter Barker 
		 Chief Product Officer 
	 

		 Artificial intelligence adoption in identity will accelerate 

<p>The integration of AI has been growing in cybersecurity and we can expect to see further adoption in the identity and access management space in 2023. The massive transformation to digital engagement, paired with the remote nature of our working lives, has opened the door for new and more relentless types of attacks, like account takeovers, inappropriate access, and fraud. Alongside the widening skills gap facing the cybersecurity industry, and the increasing sophistication of threat actors, enterprises need to transform their solutions to stay ahead.</p>

<p>Enterprises should use all the tools at their disposal to stay ahead of cyberattackers and secure their systems, while ensuring a seamless experience for end-users. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-powered cybersecurity</a> defenses are among the strongest tools organizations have in their arsenal against cybercrime and will be front and center in the next big tech wave for preventing cyberattacks.</p>

	 Retailers will blaze the trail in implementing passwordless authentication for consumers 

<p>Passwordless has been in our crystal ball for a very long time – but never has it been closer than now. Retailers, in particular, are facing increased security, fraud, and account takeover threats as they adopt new digital channels and technologies. We see them leading the way in implementing broad consumer adoption of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>.</p>

<p>Digital wallets and biometrics have become critically important for unlocking consumer devices and enabling easy next steps such as purchase approval. In self-checkout scenarios, retailers face unique challenges since physical fraud can also be a major concern. Many retailers are feeling the pressure to go fully self-service in a legally compliant way even in the case of selling age-restricted goods such as liquor. Typically, such purchases require intervention by staff to check someone's physical ID, which slows checkout.</p>

<p>In these scenarios, digital wallets are getting a second look as a source of not just payment, but also verified user information presented in a format that the user can't tamper with. As more retailers adopt passwordless and make it more mainstream, we're going to see more and more consumers pulling it into their everyday lives. This is the nail in the coffin for passwords long-term, and in 2023 retailers will make more deliberate efforts toward the integration of the passwordless society we've been working toward for so long.</p>
	
	 
		 
		 
		 David Burden 
		 Chief Information Officer 
	 
	
	 Workplace volatility will shift cybersecurity practices in 2023 
	
<p>Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-18-gartner-unveils-top-predictions-for-it-organizations-and-users-in-2023-and-beyond">predicts</a> that by 2025 "labor volatility" will "cause 40% of organizations to report a material business loss, forcing a shift in talent strategy from acquisition to resilience." I believe we're going to see this truly begin in 2023, and it's going to put an even greater emphasis on the identity perimeter as related to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workplace</a>.</p>

<p>As more cybercriminals target employees to gain unauthorized access to the greater organization, businesses will take measures to reduce vulnerabilities that attackers are slipping through. Overprovisioning, rubber-stamping access requests, and out-of-control shadow IT are putting a strain on enterprises and their ability to manage the volume and velocity of IT requests. Prepare to see more passwordless technology gaining traction in the workplace, plus greater security measures related to things like physical access to buildings, registering for hotdesk using software, digital access to services, and collaboration tools.</p>

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley, co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, September 2022. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>My first article, in the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/002.pdf">June 2022</a>&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;Unredacted, introduced some initial concepts around decentralized identity – the new technology that’s giving users greater control over their personal data and identity. Here, I’ll expand on those initial concepts and focus on decentralized identity blockchains—the&nbsp;trust&nbsp;foundation for decentralized identity-based applications and an essential part of the decentralized identity story.&nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain = verifiable data registry 



<p>The technical term for the decentralized identity component that provides the trust foundation for the whole system is a&nbsp;verifiable data registry (VDR). Similar in its application to&nbsp;centralized&nbsp;public key infrastructure (PKI), the VDR allows users and services to verify their authenticity by proving they hold the private key corresponding to the public key written to the VDR. It is often called a decentralized PKI.</p>



<p>Most people don’t use the term VDR, but rather the more widely known terms distributed ledger or blockchain, to describe how the component is implemented in the system. In reality, there are over 100 distinct VDRs available, built using well-known technologies such as Hyperledger Indy, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos, and so on.</p>

<p>The most successful VDR is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Created within the Linux Foundation, Indy is a public ledger designed specifically and only for privacy-preserving decentralized identity (also called&nbsp;self-sovereign identity). The Hyperledger Indy ledger is for credential issuers to publish data necessary for issuing verifiable credentials, and for holders to construct presentations based on those verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs supports and maintains validator nodes for both the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>&nbsp;Hyperledger Indy networks. Let’s look at Hyperledger Indy’s characteristics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Public ledgerAnyone can read the data on the ledger.Permissioned networkThis statement has two different aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The Hyperledger Indy network comprises a set of validators that have been approved (permissioned) to run the network. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;Foundation approves validators to run on its three networks (Dev, Staging, and MainNet).&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The ability/permission to write data to the Hyperledger network, which allows for writing decentralized identifiers (DIDs), schemas, credential definitions and other decentralized identity-related items. To write to the ledger, an organization must have endorser permissions (which includes paying the appropriate fee to become an endorser).&nbsp;Consensus algorithmJust like Bitcoin, validator nodes must come to agreement (consensus) before anything is written to the Hyperledger Indy network. Indy uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://lig-membres.imag.fr/aublin/rbft/report.pdf">Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT)</a>&nbsp;consensus algorithm. Indy networks typically have 24 validator nodes.GovernanceHyperledger Indy uses an offline and centralized governance model. In practice, that means people work together to create the network’s governance policy, write policy documents and have validators and Endorsers sign the agreements. These governance activities happen in the physical world.Economic modelApplication developers pay the organizing company or foundation (e.g. Sovrin) for permission to write to the network.



<p></p>



 Cosmos 







<p>Anonyome Labs runs a Cosmos validator node on the&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;network. For comparison with Hyperledger Indy, here are some characteristics of a Cosmos-based VDR network:</p>



Public ledgerAnyone can read the data on the ledger.Permissionless networkThis statement has two different aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Any organization can join the network as a validator.2) Any organization can write to the network.Consensus algorithmCosmos uses&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938">Tendermint&nbsp;Byzantine Consensus Algorithm (BCA)</a>&nbsp;to establish a consensus between validator nodes.GovernanceCosmos uses an online and decentralized governance model. In practice, that means that any validator can submit a governance proposal to the network, which validators will vote on and either approve, decline, abstain, or veto. All this happens online.Economic modelCosmos has a very well-defined crypto-economic model:&nbsp;Validators earn tokens through&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-a-validator-commission">commissions</a>&nbsp;to help run the network.Writers to the network spend tokens.&nbsp;Cosmos also has an&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-3-payment-models">economic model for verifiable credentials</a>.

 DID methods 



<p>DID methods define how to interact with decentralized identity networks. Since Hyperledger Indy networks are so popular, I’ll focus on the Indy DID method.</p>



<p>Written as&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">did:Indy</a>&nbsp;this DID method describes how to interact with a Hyperledger Indy network, including creating decentralized identifiers and issuing, verifying, and revoking verifiable credentials. It is proposed that in the future there could be hundreds of separately run Hyperledger Indy networks. The purpose of the did:indy method is to facilitate full interoperability between each of these networks.</p>



<p>The Indy DID method defines methods for writing the following data:</p>



 Decentralized identifier (DID) 



<p>A DID is the fundamental identifier of a decentralized identity in the network. It may be the identifier for a user, a verifiable credential issuer, a service, an IoT device, etc. The DID structure is similar to a web URL.</p>



<p>The DID has four components, which are concatenated:</p>



 
 DID: The hardcoded string&nbsp;did:&nbsp;indicating that the identifier is a DID 



 DID Indy method: The hardcoded string&nbsp;indy:&nbsp;indicating that the identifier uses the Indy DID method specification 



 DID Indy namespace: A string that identifies the name of the primary Indy ledger, followed by a colon. The namespace string may optionally have a secondary ledger name prefixed by another colon following the primary name.&nbsp; 



 Namespace identifier: An identifier unique to the given DID Indy namespace.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The components are assembled as follows:</p>



<p>did:indy:&lt;namespace&gt;:&lt;namespace identifier&gt;</p>



<p>Some examples of did:indy DID method identifiers are:</p>



 
 A DID written to the Sovrin MainNet ledger:
 
 did:indy:sovrin:7Tqg6BwSSWapxgUDm9KKgg 
 
 
 



 
 A DID written to the Sovrin StagingNet ledger:
 
 did:indy:sovrin:staging:6cgbu8ZPoWTnR5Rv5JcSMB 
 
 
 



 
 A DID on the IDUnion Test ledger:
 
 did:indy:idunion:test:2MZYuPv2Km7Q1eD4GCsSb6 
 
 
 



 DID documents (DIDDocs) 



<p>DIDDocs contains two primary data elements:<br></p>



 
 Cryptographic material the DID owner can use to prove control over the associated DID (i.e., public keys and digital signatures) 



 Routing endpoints for locations where one may be able to contact or exchange data with the DID owner. 
 



<p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-did">DID resolution</a>&nbsp;is the process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID.</p>



 Verifiable credential schema 



<p>A schema object is a template defining a set of attributes (names). A schema is bound to verifiable credential definitions in a Hyperledger Indy network. The bound schema restricts which claims an issuer can include in the credential. Schemas have a name and version, and an issuer or authoritative organization (e.g. government authorities defining license schemas) normally writes them to the ledger. Any client can read schemas from a Hyperledger Indy node.</p>



 Verifiable credential definition 



<p>A credential definition contains data required for both credential issuance and credential validation. Any Hyperledger Indy client can read it. A credential definition references a schema and the issuer’s DID. The issuer’s public key is included within the credential definition in order to enable validation of the credentials, which are signed by the issuer’s private key. When credentials are issued using the issuer’s credential definition, the attributes (names) of the schema must be used.</p>



 Revocation registry definition 



<p>A revocation registry definition contains information required for verifiers to determine whether the issuer has revoked a (revokable) verifiable credential. Revocation registry definitions are required for revokable verifiable credentials and are written to the ledger during creation of the credential definition. Any client can read them from a Hyperledger Indy node.<a>[1]</a></p>



 Revocation registry entry 



<p>A revocation registry entry marks the current status of one or more revokable verifiable credentials (i.e., “revoked” or “not revoked”) in the ledger in a privacy-preserving manner. The owner of a revocation registry definition writes a revocation registry entry whenever they wish to make a batch (possibly only one) of revocations public and detectable.</p>



<p>Any Hyperledger Indy client can read any revocation registry entry.</p>



 



<p><a>[1]</a>&nbsp;The registry definition isn’t ever updated after creation. It binds immutably the revocation detection mechanism (currently the Tails File) to the credential definition. There is an m to 1 relationship between revocation registry definitions and credential definitions. This is because a new revocation registry definition is created whenever the Tails File number of entries is exhausted and a new one needs to be created; the new one will still point back to the original credential definition. The revocation registry entry is updated when credentials are revoked.</p>

  Australia launched its CBDC pilot in January&nbsp;2023.  More than 80+ financial entities enter proposed use cases in e-commerce, offline payments, and government payments.  It received over 140 use case proposals in e-commerce, offline, and government payments.  <p>Intense discussions around CBDC, gained momentum in Australia in August last year. It was when Australia’s Central Bank announced its plans to scrutinize the economic benefits of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency to the&nbsp;country.</p><p>The Reserve Bank of Australia declared that it would conduct a year-long pilot project to explore “innovative use cases and business models” for a CBDC. The authorities were keen to understand the technological, legal, and regulatory boundaries within which the CBDC will operate in Australia.</p> The Pilot: Schedule, Attributes, Constraints <p>The initial announcement by the RBA made it clear that the pilot would be executed in partnership with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, the&nbsp;DFCRC.</p><p>The DFCRC is a government-supported industry group. It was to invite industry players who should demonstrate how the CBDC could act as a payment and settlement service to household consumers and businesses. With this, the RBA also prepared a detailed schedule of how they would like to conduct the&nbsp;program.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/china-leads-the-digital-currency-future">China Leads the Digital Currency&nbsp;Future</a></p> The Schedule <p>While the project timeline kicked-in in September 2022, the RBA decided to run the CBDC pilot and selected use cases between January and April 2023. After it ends in April, the RBA will publish a report with findings.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/chainsawdotcom/status/1574937101090508800?s=20&amp;t=HV1awZPmBc210iLekUT3nA">Image Source</a>) e-AUD: Attributes and Constraints <p>The RBA decided to call the CBDC eAUD, which will appear as a liability on the RBA’s balance sheet, denominated in Australian Dollars. The RBA will fix the upper limit of the eAUD issue as deemed fit for specific use case providers. It will pay no interest on any holdings of the&nbsp;eAUD.</p><p>Only Australian resident individuals and Australian-registered entities will be eligible to hold eAUD and have to comply with certain requirements. For instance, each eAUD holder has to have a project participation invitation from an approved use case provider. The use case providers need to run are identity validation of the holder, and they themselve to be an approved KYC service provider.</p><p>The storage of eAUD needs to be either a custodial wallet provided by a use case provider or a non-custodial wallet held directly by the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/indias-cbdc-project-what-is-it-upto">India’s CBDC Project: What is it&nbsp;Upto?</a></p> Response to the&nbsp;Pilot <p>According to information published last month, the pilot program received over 140 use case proposals. More than 80 financial entities proposed use cases across e-commerce, offline, and government payments.</p><p>In response to the overwhelming interest from the finance industry, the RBA raised caution in advance, though Australia is not new to virtual assets. nearly one in five Australians bought digital currencies in 2021, with 43% of Australians investing in crypto for the first time in 2021, found out a report by the US crypto exchange&nbsp;Gemini.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/hunterxnicholas/status/1450658087606669312?s=20&amp;t=HV1awZPmBc210iLekUT3nA">Image Source</a>)<p>Hedging against inflation and a means to asset diversification were the primary reasons why most Australian crypto users showed interest in digital assets. 81% chose to hold their crypto investments for the long term, while 54% chose to diversify their portfolio. Nearly 25% of Australian investors aged 18–34 had at least one-tenth of their portfolio invested in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Despite such enthusiasm, the RBA contemplated two potential concerns. First, the capability of CBDC to disrupt bank intermediation and monetary policy transmission in normal times. Second, CBDC’s potential to give rise to bank runs in stressed conditions.</p><p>So far, CBDC’s potential benefits seem to outweigh its drawbacks. For instance, the CBDC could yield privacy benefits, according to the RBA. It could help protect monetary sovereignty, and it could also enhance the resilience of the country’s money and payments system and increase competition and efficiency while reducing user&nbsp;costs.</p><p>There are still a few months to wait till the pilot summary report comes out in the middle of 2023 and understand which direction the Australian CBDC wind&nbsp;blows!</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

				  Our regular review of recent news from around the decentralized identity community. In this edition, we look at some predictions on what 2023 will hold for digital identity, increased interoperability between countries, and an interesting new intersection of AI and digital identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/01/6-digital-identity-predictions-for-2023/">6 Digital Identity Predictions for 2023</a>, Mike Engle, Security Boulevard</p>
<p>This Security Boulevard article by Mike Engle offers several useful insights into the ties between digital identity and security for 2023; we’re going to summarize the top two.</p>
<p>1.” US regulators will require tech giants to adopt non-proprietary identities.”</p>
<p>Proprietary identities are widely used across the internet today; they refer to any time you log in with a third-party application — such as Apple, Facebook or Amazon — and a defining trait of these identities is that all your data is stored centrally on one of the provider’s servers. Non-proprietary identities give more control to the user over where their data is stored — usually locally on one of their devices — and how much is shared with others when interacting online. Pointing to the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58585">Improving Digital Identity Act</a> nearing passage, and federal government agencies already transitioning to a more secure approach to identity management, Engle thinks it is only a matter of time before regulations hit large corporations to drive more secure identity practices for all consumer-facing businesses.</p>
<p>2. “VPNs will give way to identity-based perimeters for the virtual workforce”</p>
<p>Engle’s main point here is that there are simply too many people using corporate networks from insecure locations, and VPNs are almost worthless if login credentials have been compromised. Offering some terrifying statistics such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/over-two-billion-passwords-were-leaked-by-hackers-in-2021">2 billion passwords were leaked in 2021 alone</a>, and that roughly <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/03/08/exposed-data-trends/">70% of breached passwords are still in use</a>, it’s easy to see how an identity based solution with more robust verifiable credentials tied to biometrics might be a better way forward. (Chase Cunningham —aka, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/drzerotrust/id1570251081">Dr. Zero Trust</a>— recently did a more in-depth look into this issue in an <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralization-and-the-future-of-enterprise-security/">article</a> for Indicio.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/deal-between-philippines-and-singapore-could-herald-more-digital-id-interoperability">Deal Between Philippines and Singapore Could Herald More Digital ID Interoperability</a>,&nbsp;Chris Burt, Biometric Update</p>
<p>Chris Burt reports for Biometric Update that the governments of the Philippines and Singapore recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that will allow each nation’s digital ID to be recognized in both countries.</p>
<p>“The MOU covers digital cooperation on digital connectivity, particularly in inter-operable systems and frameworks that enable electronic documentation; cybersecurity, such as organizing training courses and technical programs through the ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence to develop and enhance skills related to cybersecurity; and digital government/e-governance, such as in the areas of digital government strategy, digital government services, and digital identity,” — Singapore Minister for Communications and Information, Josephine Teo.</p>
<p>This announcement mirrors the global trend of governments looking to make their digital credentials more interoperable with one another and, therefore, more useful to their citizens. For example, the Philippines has also signed deals with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/philippines-to-collaborate-with-belgium-china-on-digital-id">Belgium and China</a>, and Singapore is exploring opportunities to <a href="https://theprint.in/economy/singapore-exploring-collaboration-opportunities-with-india-on-digital-public-infra-official/1318984/">collaborate with India</a>. These partnerships are hugely important for the advancement of digital identity, offering the opportunity for interoperability, but also for nations to learn more from each other about technical approaches and best practices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/nvidias-ai-based-digital-fingerprinting-addresses-identity-attacks/2023/01/">Nvidia’s AI-Based Digital Fingerprinting Addresses Identity Attacks</a>,&nbsp;Nancy Liu, sdx Central</p>
<p>This article by Nancy Liu, Editor for sdx central, takes a look at a different approach to security just announced by Nvidia — Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Digital Fingerprinting. This AI is designed to build a digital profile of the data you typically interact with at work, and how if you — or someone with your credentials — does anything suspicious or out of the ordinary, the security team at the organization will be alerted.</p>
<p>As the team looks ahead, Bartley Richardson, director of cybersecurity engineering and R&amp;D at Nvidia, predicts “a detailed digital identity model [using AI] that knows how fast a person types, with how many typos, what services they use, and when they use them” for creating secure digital identities.</p>
<p>This is an interesting probabilistic approach to digital identity. At Indicio, we have been working on a decentralized digital identity approach to <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-works/">employee verification</a> in an effort to provide additional security for organizations, require little maintenance, and also to put that data back in the user’s hands. This AI based solution is still in its early days but will certainly be one to watch.</p>

<p>Derek Robertson, a reporter for Digital Future Daily and contributor to Politico Magazine, discusses a conversation he had with Jordan Shapiro, an economic and data analyst at the center-left Progressive Policy Institute, in which she weighs in on where the American government stands now in terms of IT, and what generally gets in the way of keeping its systems modernized and accessible.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest issues Shapiro calls out for the government are that there are hundreds of agencies, all with their own technologies to keep updated, and that there are so many new solutions coming out that regulations are being created often without proper research or knowledge of how they will affect the real world. She also discusses how the businesses creating these products and the government have inherently competing interests, with the businesses often focusing on income and productizing as much as they can, and the government focusing on safety and privacy.</p>
<p>With the government’s main priority being security, safety, and privacy they are often slower to adopt new technologies. Shapiro points to President Biden’s recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/">executive order</a> and the “time tax” — the sheer amount of paperwork necessary to enroll in benefits such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Health and Human Services — Biden calls out as being problematic for Americans in the document. One solution Shapiro proposes is better digital identity systems to fix this problem, providing a more streamlined and secure process for accessing government programs.</p>
<p>The good news is that some governments are already hard at work on implementing these solutions! For more information about ongoing efforts you can watch the video of a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5eCKV6Jh0&amp;t=1228s">Indicio Meetup</a> where Indicio’s CEO, Heather C Dahl, sat down with representatives from several different government organizations to discuss their efforts to use decentralized digital identity and how they arrived at this solution.</p>

				 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-service/">Trust Registries</a> are a powerful technology organizations can use to increase trust and streamline business operations in various industries. One of the most innovative uses of this technology can be found in the financial sector, where trust registries are being used to combat the threat of financial fraud.<p></p>
<p><a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a>, an innovative financial technology company, has developed <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass®</a>, a solution that proactively protects credit union members from becoming victims of financial fraud. MemberPass®&nbsp;allows member institutions (credit unions and other financial institutions) to issue credentials to their members. When a credit union verifies their members, they use cryptography, self-sovereign identity credentials and communications to prove the following key things:</p>
 
 The connection is the same private connection that was established with their own member (this is two-way – the member knows this too). 
 The member still holds the credential. 
 The contents of the credential haven’t been tampered with.&nbsp; 
 The credit union signed the credential using its Decentralized Identifier – its DID. 
 
<p>Getting cryptographically secure facts like these helps the credit union and their member be sure they aren’t talking to bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when another institution starts to use a credential, the cryptography can only go so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another institution can know that:</p>
 
 The person holds the credential (they aren’t a member of that other institution). 
 The contents haven’t been tampered with. 
 A DID signed the credential. 
 
<p>What we don’t know is whether the DID that signed the credential is really a trusted credit union or not.</p>
<p>To know that the institution checks the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®. The trust registry is maintained under Bonifii’s governance framework, and Bonifii has a solid process that validates the institutions listed in the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®.&nbsp;</p>
  Increase Trust and Streamline Operations 
<p>The use of a trust registry allows new institutions to join the MemberPass®&nbsp;network and quickly validate the information from any participating member institutions.&nbsp; Further, it provides for the efficient sharing and verification of information among credit unions and their partners, increasing trust and streamlining business operations.</p>
<p>The operational ecosystem, anchored by the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®, provides Bonifii with a comprehensive solution for managing its identity verification data and interactions. MemberPass® offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface that allows members to easily manage their digital identity, including adding and removing authorized credentials, viewing transaction history, and monitoring for suspicious activity—allowing members to easily and securely access their financial accounts and complete transactions.</p>
<p>The implementation of Trust Registries in the financial industry, as demonstrated by Bonifii’s MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®, is a powerful example of how this technology can increase trust and streamline business operations. Trust Registries provide a significant step forward in the efficient and secure management of identity verification data and interactions in the credit union industry.</p> 
			        
				
				
				
				
				 <p>About Bonifii: By providing a safe, secure, and convenient identity verification solution, MemberPass®&nbsp;is solving one of the credit union industry’s biggest problems by reducing member friction and injecting trust in digital interactions. The use of a decentralized trust registry in MemberPass®&nbsp;is a real-world example of how organizations can use this technology to increase trust and streamline business operations.</p>
<p>About Continuum Loop: As a leading consulting firm, Continuum Loop played a vital role in the development and launch of MemberPass®&nbsp;and the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®. Darrell O’Donnell was embedded as the CTO, providing crucial expertise and leadership. Through their partnership, Continuum Loop and Bonifii successfully deployed the first-ever Trust Registry for MemberPass®, significantly enhancing the platform’s security and user convenience.</p>

<p>In the first part of this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we welcomed Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol, for the second time on our show. During this two-episode series podcast interview, we spoke about the Ocean roadmap for 2023 and the project’s focus on newer use cases, including DeFi. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Focus of the Ocean Protocol core team in&nbsp;2023</p><p>Ocean Protocol as a project was conceived in late 2016. For the first five years, it was steadily building the infrastructure needed to solve a bunch of different tough problems such as sovereign data ownership, solving private data reconciling with crypto, pricing data, and many other related things. The project launched different versions–V1, V2, V3, and V4. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/datatokens-daos-and-nfts-14aedce1bba7">Trent briefly spoke about these versions in another appearance of Voices of the Data Economy as&nbsp;well.</a></p><blockquote>“The focus is now doubling down on traction. How we measure traction is by ‘data consume volume,’ which means how much data is being bought and sold in any given week or month through the Ocean ecosystem, on the Ocean Market, and other markets powered by Ocean contracts. We have more focused projects now like <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/bounties">data challenges</a> (for predicting the price of Ethereum) and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> (an incentive program where the objective function is data consume volume).”</blockquote><p>Trent quickly recaps the different versions of Ocean: Ocean V1 solved data sovereignty; Ocean V2 solved data privacy through privacy-preserving AI, and Ocean V3 solved a few things at once: How do we simplify things? How do we have really crazy interoperability for the custody and management of data? How do we automatically price&nbsp;data?</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">Here you can find an overview of Ocean V4</a>. It got shipped in the spring of 2022. The three things that got shipped in V4 are Data NFTs, in addition to datatokens to map, base IP, and licenses against the base IP; solving rug pulls on the pools, and finally, better monetization for the community.</p><p>Users of Ocean Protocol. Who are&nbsp;they?</p><p>The users of Ocean Protocol can be divided into three segments — by verticals, by profession, and then there are individual or higher level groups. By vertical, it applies to multiple streams — like automotive data, could apply to personal social media data, or health data&nbsp;etc.</p><p>There are several projects within the Ocean ecosystem that focus on personal data, typically via DAOs. Most people don’t want to manage their data themselves — so you can have collective bargaining around that- this is handled via projects like the <a href="https://www.dataunion.app/what-is-a-dataunion/">DataUnion app</a>.</p><p>The relatively larger groups are NGOs, small businesses, large enterprises, and then cities, provinces, and countries — any of those slices of civilization can use Ocean in various ways. It goes up and down different levels; for example, <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/proposal-deltadao-creating-an-ocean-protocol-use-case-and-pitch-deck-library/618">one collaboration is actually via deltaDAO collaborating with the Berlin Library ecosystem.</a></p><p>Data Scientists as Ocean Protocol users and why&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>The main user that Ocean serves the best right now is data scientists, because it’s data scientists who work with data and know how to create value from data, typically by building AI models or just simple machine learning models. Then making predictions, choosing actions, selecting actions, and then executing those actions. One example is DeFi, where you can predict the price of ETH in 10 minutes from now. And if you are right more often than you are wrong - you can make a buying or selling&nbsp;action.</p><blockquote>“I believe that Ocean will become ubiquitous, and we are on track with that. How do you get to the ubiquity and its sustained growth over long periods? Facebook has become ubiquitous right now. It started with just college students and Harvard. But then it spread itself one university at a time. And eventually, after years and years of sustained growth, it became ubiquitous. And hopefully, it won’t be ubiquitous forever because it’s centralized. And typically, things fade. Ocean, though, I hope, becomes ubiquitous and has decentralized goals. It is an infrastructure for civilization, just like TCP/IP with web protocols on&nbsp;top.”</blockquote><p>While deciding on vertical focus, one good metric is the time needed for going through the data value creation cycle. For DeFi, it can be as little as 10 minutes, and for areas like drug discovery, it can be as long as ten years for data to get monetized with all FDA approvals etc. In those terms, the lowest-hanging fruit is decentralized finance.</p><p>Build, build, build: V4, veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming</p><p>With the launch of V4, Ocean solved these three problems: base IP NFTs, rug pulls, and much better monetization for the community. But before that, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean had already launched Data Farming</a>. In Trent’s words, Data Farming incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (stakers) as a function of consume volume and liquidity. It’s like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for data consumption. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Questions at that point: How do we solve the problem with free assets for Data Farming, fixed price assets for Data Farming, and the pool draining attack? The solution to this was built and shipped by Ocean in the fall of 2022: veOCEAN. It stopped all the issues from before. Read Trent’s blog here on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing </a>veOCEAN and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">how Data Farming continued with the veOCEAN&nbsp;launch.</a></p><blockquote>“There’s a macro-level problem in crypto. How do you reconcile near-term greed with long-term incentives? You’ve got the people who want to ape into something, make their 2x in a week or a month, and then ape out–take your profits and go. If you would have asked me three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, I would have said just ignore those people. But the fact of the matter is in crypto, they exist, and you should try to make your system somewhat attractive to them, even if they’re not your main target. You still want to be interesting to them, if you can. But for the long term, I still really want to make sure that we serve the builders around data, the data scientists,” concludes Trent in the first part of this interview.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of different topics discussed during the two-episode series interview:</p>  The focus of the core Ocean team in&nbsp;2022  Different user groups of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol  How Data Scientists can use&nbsp;Ocean  Ocean’s focus on constantly building: veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming  Different use cases in DeFi and&nbsp;Ocean  Trent’s view on the future of AI in&nbsp;2022  Trent’s take on 2022 as a year for the crypto industry and what to look forward in&nbsp;2023  <p>We will release the second part of the interview soon.

 DIDs Prove Control with Private&nbsp;Keys <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a way to identify and authenticate devices. Unlike traditional unique identifiers, DIDs have a private key associated with them that proves control of the identifier. This is especially useful for devices, as they can hold their own private key and make assertions about their authenticity.</p><p>One way to secure devices is to use a hardware-protected private key, such as a TPM (trusted platform module) or TrustZone in an ARM processor. This ensures that the private key is not extractable and can only be used to make signatures in a trusted execution environment. The public key, on the other hand, can be stored on a verifiable data registry and associated with a DID, allowing it to be retrieved upon&nbsp;request.</p> Keys Can Be Generated at the Beginning or Middle of Device Arbitration Process <p>The timing of public/private key generation on a device depends on the specific use-case. For example, if the device needs to be authenticated as a genuine product from a particular brand, the keys may need to be generated at the time of assembly. On the other hand, if the device is being provisioned for a specific use-case, key generation may take place during the provisioning stage.</p> Using Key Generation to Protect User&nbsp;Privacy <p>It’s important to consider privacy when using DIDs and hardware-protected keys to authenticate devices. In cases where devices are being sold to the general public, it’s best practice to generate new keys to preserve the privacy of the&nbsp;user.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benjamincoll875">Benjamin Collins</a>, Transmute’s Technical Product Owner, spent 10 years working with Linux and Open Source as the creator of DashGL.com, a site which provides tutorials for writing simple games for Linux in C using OpenGL and the GTK&nbsp;toolkit.</p><p>Connect with Ben on <a href="https://twitter.com/kion_dgl">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/BenjaminMoe">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasend/">Sasen D</a>, one of Ontology’s Loyal Members. I’m from Sri Lanka. I joined Ontology’s community in April&nbsp;2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your hobbies? Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I am a passionate sales and marketing professional with over 11 years of experience in the field and I have completed some professional certifications related to the subject. I am also married and have a child. I love animals and have a cat, but other than that, my hobbies include music and playing football.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I work mainly on an online basis, working freelance with the crypto and blockchain communities, outside of my professional role in marketing and sales. I was part of the Ontology member base in 2020, and I attended as many events as I could. This is really how I got so closely involved with Ontology. Because of this, Ontology named me as its first Loyal Member of the team. Now I deal each week with Loyal Member discussions, join Twitter Spaces, and continue to play a role in the wider Ontology community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I believe that Ontology’s node staking performance is the highlight of its offerings, as well as its trusted decentralised solution, easy to manage platforms, and 24/7 online&nbsp;support.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The weekly Loyal Member discussion is the most exciting part of Ontology for me. Seeking out new ideas, topics, and opinions to discuss each week and share with the community increases my personal knowledge. Additionally, engaging in discussions with the community allows me to develop ideas with them and contribute to Ontology’s innovations.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>That is quite an interesting question. I got a huge amount of value for my work in sales and marketing when I worked at a private university. Career-wise, this was probably my best personal accomplishment to&nbsp;date.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to be an Ontology Harbinger and have the opportunity to share my enthusiasm for the project with&nbsp;others.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>We can expect to see more creative uses for digital currency over the coming years, which could have a meaningful impact on many people’s everyday lives. Web3 will be the main cause of this so Ontology will naturally play a large part. Furthermore, decentralized identities are the future. This is something that may be a core part of Ontology’s strategy over the next five&nbsp;years.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-loyal-ontology-community-member-sasen-71ea2e9c79da">Meet the Team: Loyal Ontology Community Member, Sasen</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

In fact, <a href="https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/research/true-cost-of-financial-crime-compliance-study-global-report">globally financial institutions spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year</a> on anti-money laundering compliance and technology solutions that help protect and authenticate consumer identity (I.e., identity proofing, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication to name a few).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Creating and implementing effective customer identity verification processes</a> is essential to reducing the risk of fraudulent transactions and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>One such approach is to share information among banks and governments through a multi-step model called Know Your Customer (KYC) – which may involve a central database maintained by a consortium of banks like <a href="https://www.swift.com/">Swift</a> whereby consumer data is used to verify their identity and identify any potential risks of doing business with them. self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new decentralized identity model that can help banks to solve the existing challenges of sharing KYC information securely and cost-effectively.</p>
<p>With decentralized KYC, the customer can be issued a KYC verifiable credential that can be cryptographically verified and stored on the customer’s mobile wallet. Verifiable credentials are trustworthy, tamper-proof, and machine-verifiable digital identity documents. The verifiable credentials can be issued by KYC providers and verified by other service providers for authenticity and ownership. The customer may proactively trigger issuance of such credentials or as part of an existing KYC process. KYC verifiable credentials provide a strong benefit to all involved – a seamless customer experience, as well as a simplified and more cost-effective processes for banks and service providers.</p>
<p>A lot of progress has been made in recent years in the field of self-sovereign identity:</p>
 
 Ratification of standards like W3C VC, and DID 
 European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) framework matured with POCs and pilot projects under way 
 eIDAS 2.0 close to being released 
 British Columbia Government launches VON (Verifiable Organizations Network) 
 Increased number of SSI networks all around the world 
 
<p>eIDAS 2.0 will mandate business and government organizations within the EU to accept decentralized identity verifiable credentials stored in digital wallets. KYC providers must ensure they are ready to integrate with the EBSI framework.</p>
<p>Benefits for all when KYC verified credentials are implemented</p>
<p>Incremental deployment of AI/ML technology has enabled online KYC checks that provide a significant improvement over the manual KYC process. With the manual KYC processes, a considerable amount of time and resources are spent on reviewing checks for the same user repeatedly.</p>
<p>Imagine a user onboarding experience using a verifiable KYC credential as follows:</p>
 
 Customer visits service provider website 
 Customer scans a QR code with their mobile wallet 
 A secure encrypted channel is established between the mobile wallet and website 
 Service provider requests KYC credentials 
 Customer consents to sharing their verifiable KYC credential 
 Service provider website lets them in 
 
<p>And this process only takes a few seconds!</p>
<p>The reusable nature of KYC verifiable credentials and user control of their own data lends itself nicely to an exceptional user experience and builds confidence around privacy. Additionally, the reusable KYC credentials enhance business process efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Repeated cost of passport and driver license scans, facial recognition, and liveness detection for KYC can add up and impact the P&amp;L significantly. With KYC verifiable credentials, the cost is reduced significantly, and that financial benefit can be passed on to the banks by KYC providers while maintaining higher margins.</p>
<p>As decentralized verifiable credentials are stored in mobile wallets, there is significantly reduced risk of data being stolen. Mobile wallets enable user consent to ensure no information leakage, as well as maintaining a strong security and privacy posture.</p>
<p>With rapidly increasing adoption and acceptance of&nbsp; decentralized identity (~27% CAGR), KYC providers can benefit from issuing KYC verifiable credentials.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Come and meet the Ubisecure team at the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit, in London, on the 6th and 7th of March. To find out more, take a look at the Ubisecure events page, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/events/" title="www.ubisecure.com/events/">www.ubisecure.com/events/</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us to this first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this New Year, 2023. And we want to start hearing very futuristic things about a future, very futuristic. We have a really amazing guest to start this year. Let me introduce you, Dr Mark van Rijmenam. He is the digital speaker, he is a leading strategic futurist who thinks about how emerging technologies change organisations, society and the metaverse.</p>
<p>He is the founder of the Digital Futures Institute with a mission to ensure a thriving digital future for businesses and society. Van Rijmenam is an international keynote speaker. He is five times author, and his latest book is Future Visions, which was written in five days in collaboration with artificial intelligence. I definitely want to hear more about that. Hey, Mark, welcome.</p>
<p>Dr Mark van Rijmenam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me on the show. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely our pleasure. Well, happy New Year.</p>
<p>Mark: Happy New Year to you, too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, we are still in the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Please tell us about yourself and how – what was your journey to this world of identity, metaverse and everything that you are doing today.</p>
<p>Mark: I’m sure it sounds good. Well, obviously you already gave a very nice introduction, but I’ll add some things to it. So, I’ve been a keynote speaker for over a decade. I am a strategic futurist, so it means I really think about emerging technologies, and I try to understand what these technologies, these emerging cutting-edge technologies mean for you and me, for organisations, for society, and how we can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Because these technologies are constantly evolving. So, I’ve been doing this for over a decade. I’ve been speaking all around the world about that. I’ve been, as you said, five books. And I really try to always practise what I preach. And so that means that I – when the pandemic hit, I created myself an avatar, created myself as a hologram to deliver keynotes as such.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on building a digital twin of myself to understand – what are the consequences of creating a digital twin of yourself? A synthetic human, so to say. And how does it influence whatever we do? And I am very much involved in, you know, big data blockchain, artificial intelligence and the convergence of these technologies, which we are all coming together in the metaverse of, which was my fourth book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-step-into-the-metaverse/">Step into the Metaverse</a>, where a big part of that is also focused on identity. Because I believe that the metaverse will unleash a sort of a Cambrian explosion of identity, and it’s very important how to deal with that.</p>
<p>I’ve also been involved in a start-up, which unfortunately failed, but that’s the start-up life. Focused on identity, focused on fighting misinformation with reputation-based system. It’s very challenging to do anything in this space because we are very much used to a certain identity system that we have in our society. And shifting that is quite challenging, but I’m sure we’ll get to that during this episode.</p>
<p>So yes, that’s basically what I do. And yeah, indeed, my latest book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-future-visions/">Future Visions</a>, written, edited and designed by AI, I’m sure some of you have heard of ChatGPT, which is taking internet by storm. And the moment it arrived, I thought, I’m going to grasp this opportunity to write a book with it.</p>
<p>So, I literally wrote it in five days, and I didn’t change a word. I didn’t – I maybe like five or ten words that I changed myself, but the rest is exactly written by AI. And it was an experiment for me to understand what is possible with off the shelf technology, and it’s quite surprising how good it is, but also how not good it is. It’s not the Holy Grail. It’s fantastic technology, but there are definitely some caveats. And it was a fantastic experience to do.</p>
<p>Oscar: That, that sounds very interesting. So, you wrote a full book just using the ChatGPT that many people are talking about these days for the last, at least, last two months, I would say – quite a lot about that. And yes, super interesting journey you have had.</p>
<p>One of the last things you said is about the misinformation that – every time I hear that word like, we really have to do more about that – and it’s not easy, right? It’s definitely not easy.</p>
<p>That will come also on the metaverse, which is actually the main thing we’d like to discuss with you. So, it’s skimming through the pages of your last, second book, Step into the Metaverse, How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion Dollar Social Economy. So, I read part of your book it is very interesting, so let’s go into that – to start with a common idea – please, could you give me your definition of metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Yes. That’s a very good point to start because the metaverse is a very, very abstract concept which many people have different perspective of what it actually is. And for the book I did about 100 in-depth interviews with the stakeholders who are building the metaverse. I did about 150 surveys, and interestingly enough, I got like almost 250 different definitions of what the metaverse is, which sort of shows you how difficult of a concept it is.</p>
<p>I sort of derive my own definition from this, and to me, the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging. And where the physical moving to the digital the digital moves into the physical. Now, that’s a lot of information there. And so, we can briefly unpack it a little bit.</p>
<p>So, if we start with the first one, you had a physical move into the digital. Basically, this conversation that we have, you could argue, is part of a very, very early phase of the metaverse because you are physically in Finland. I’m physically in Australia and we are digitally connected through our computers, and we have this conversation. It’s a 2D connection. So yes, our screens are 2D. These are not immersive.</p>
<p>But you could argue this is part of the metaverse. Other parts of the metaverse are, which I think are very, very important, is, for example, digital twins now. Where we create a digital replica of a physical asset that we can interact with in the digital world and we can just monitor it, or we can actually interact with it and then any changes that we make in the digital world, we will have an effect in the physical world. And that’s also part of the metaverse. And often people think that virtual reality is the most important part of the metaverse, but to me it’s only one channel to access the metaverse in an immersive way.</p>
<p>The other part, the other channel so to say, is augmented reality, where basically which means that we bring the digital into the physical world. I think that part is going to be much more important and much bigger because it allows us basically to create like infinite layers on top of reality. And this layer can be for entertainment, so you can have a flying purple dragon above the Opera House here in Australia, or you can use it to understand when you’re driving to have, augmented reality where there’s a parking space available or whatever you can come up with. And I think that’s also a very, very important part of the metaverse.</p>
<p>I think in the next decade or so we will see that computers will disappear, smartphones will disappear, tablets will disappear. They will all be replaced by headsets at first, augmented reality headsets I think, they will become a miniaturised, very sleek glasses that you can wear. And you don’t need a laptop anymore, you don’t need a smartphone anymore because you have it all in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>So, the metaverse is the immersive internet, and this internet will become as pervasive as the air we breathe. And it will mean it will move from making a conscious decision to go on the internet – so, if you want to go on the internet today, you have to grab your phone and start doing something. And it will switch to being “in” the internet. So being fully immersed and being part of the internet. By the internet being as pervasive to the air we breathe or energy that we use. This internet will be 3D, and that’s much more in line with what we humans are used to because we are 3D humans.</p>
<p>So, we thrive in a 3D environment much more so than a 2D environment. So that’s sort of what’s going to happen. There’s a lot of information, but in short, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging, creating this immersive 3D internet that we can connect with and can be part of.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, you said that for writing this book on the metaverse. You have interview at least 100 of entrepreneurs who are building some their metaverse versions or some product related to the metaverse. So, I like to know from those conversations that you have had – so what has been their main motivation, why they are spending their time building those and not something else. So, what are, let’s say, the main motivation did you find in common amongst these entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think it’s a very good question. And I think what I noticed is that everyone that I spoke to, understands that the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet. It is the future. Whether we want it or not, whether we believe in it or not, it will define the next ten, 20, 30 years, if not more.</p>
<p>And so, any smart entrepreneur should dive headfirst into that because if you would have done that in the 1990’s, you would have been, you know, had a good chance to be the next Amazon. And that’s what I think is happening here because first we had one, then we had like sort of the mobile app with the launch of the iPhone. We had the social web, with the launch of all the social media platforms and now we move to the immersion web.</p>
<p>So, there’s a ton of work to be done. There’s a ton of money to be made because, you know, several banks and a major strategy consultants say that by 2030, the metaverse will drive between 5 and 13 trillion dollars for the global economy.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s going to be a lot more, simply by looking at the impact that the internet had already on our society. So, it makes just good business sense to dive into the metaverse to see what you can contribute to this next iteration of the internet.</p>
<p>Besides, firstly, I think that the metaverse is a fascinating environment to work in, because it’s all novel, it’s all magical, it’s all – all the things that can become true in the metaverse. There are no laws of physics in the metaverse, so you’re not – we don’t have any restrictions on what we can build in the metaverse. And I think we can create this magical world, this magical virtual world, with these magical augmented digital experiences that are not possible in the physical world. And I personally find it fascinating.</p>
<p>So, I really enjoy being part of that. And I think over time when – the more we step into the metaverse, because mind you, the metaverse is still a few years out. The more a society steps into the metaverse, the more people will experience this magic as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: So different motivation. It sounds to me – it’s most like, I know there will be this new paradigm so that the technology is coming anyway. It sounds like that, and the entrepreneurs have to be there. Sounds like those are the main motivations.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, I want to add one to that because it’s – so my book has been, I’ve meant it as a blueprint for an open metaverse. And an open metaverse is really focused on – how can we create a metaverse that’s there for us, for you and me, consumers. And that’s owned and controlled by us and not necessarily controlled by big tech or very, very tiny elite who controls whatever we do online, which currently the current internet is like that.</p>
<p>We don’t control our own data; we don’t control our own digital identity. The internet is basically controlled by a handful of very, very powerful, very big technology companies. Now, with the metaverse, with the amount of data that you create in this immersive internet, which will be 100 times more than we do today, if not even more. I think it’s crucial that we own and control our own data, that we control our own digital assets, and that we control our own identity and reputation. Because we don’t want to live in a world where the Zuckerberg’s of this world can decide whether or not you have access to this immersive internet or not. And I think that’s something really, really important.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to build it in the correct way, because you know, with building something decentralised also come a lot of challenges. But that’s what I did for the book and most people that I spoke to, they tried to do that as well. So, for a lot of people that I spoke to, they’re driven by this quest of building an open metaverse that’s there for us. And to change the paradigm from a centralised internet to a decentralised.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that’s something I read in your book, the concept of the Open Metaverse. So, it’s great that many of these entrepreneurs have that in mind. So, something else that you just mentioned is – it’s about, of course, identity. Again, thinking of the companies who are now building the metaverse. How in top of the mind is digital identity? So, it’s a component that they are thinking every day, like yes, this is part of metaverse or something that is neglected? So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think that the digital identity is a very, very important part of the metaverse. And it was also confirmed, to the very people that I talk to. Simply because, as I mentioned in the start in the metaverse, we can be whomever we want to be, whether that is, I don’t know, a flying dragon, whether that is a walking piano, whether that’s a talking mushroom, it really doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You can literally be whoever you want to be. And identity in the metaverse is really, really important, much more important than we think today. And if we ask Generation Z, those born after 95 or Generation Alpha, those born after 2010 to them, and this has been done to them, their digital identity is as or even more important than their physical identity.</p>
<p>Let that sink in a bit because that’s the paradigm shift. Your digital identity being more important than your physical identity, completely shift of mind and mindset. And therefore, we see that in the metaverse, digital fashion is really important because just like in a physical world, you want to dress a certain way to showcase who you are, to display your identity. You also want to do that in the metaverse. So digital fashion is a multibillion industry of for people to do that.</p>
<p>Now, what research also has shown is that the moment people can be whoever they want to be in the metaverse, they start experimenting with their identity. And there’s research that people switch gender just to understand what that means. There’s also research which showed that if you are an introvert person in the physical world and you use an extrovert character in the metaverse or in virtual reality, and you play with that character for a couple of hours. Then you will continue to display those extrovert characteristics in the physical world afterwards. Fascinating I think, how that works the digital, our digital identity can affect our physical identity.</p>
<p>So now, of course I think when we talk about identity in the metaverse, we also have to think about the challenges that come with it. Because if you can be walking a piano for that matter, how do I know that that walking piano is Oscar, you know, how do I know that? How can I be certain that I’m not dealing with this with someone else who has stolen your identity?</p>
<p>So digital identity or in this case I would argue Self-Sovereign Identity is very, very crucial for a metaverse, especially in open metaverse. Less so a closed metaverse, which is controlled by companies because they can do your identity check and they can verify that you are a real person. Your identity can still be hacked and be stolen, but that it’s more easy to control it.</p>
<p>That’s also has problems to it. In an open metaverse self-sovereign identity is really, really important because it allows us to control who has access to our data, for how long, to which data, and have full control over assets and our identity. So, I think if we think that identity is important on the current web, we have to think twice because it will be a lot more important in the metaverse. And for many millions of kids and teenagers that digital identity is already more important than the physical identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that thing that you just said for a second time. It’s very, very important to think about because we need to protect those identities. Because the big bunch of the people who are going to be in when metaverse is more ubiquitous, as we call it, in the next 10/ 20 years. Will be using heavily, and we have to protect those, those identities.</p>
<p>Another thing you mentioned is if you have some of these, what example? Like a flying dragon, for instance, Oscar is a Flying Dragon in some metaverse. Right? So, people who are inside a metaverse will see the Flying Dragon, my name, maybe. But how do I enter to this metaverse? So that’s a point that many people don’t think right? I should have been, call it, logged in or authenticated properly in order to enter to that that metaverse.</p>
<p>Mark: Well, that’s a major technical and cultural challenge that you just mentioned, because what we don’t want is that if I go to Fortnite and into Roblox, into Decentraland and into the sandbox and to whatever other virtual world. That I every time I have to recreate my flying dragon, every time I have to create a new account, just like we do in the real world, actually.</p>
<p>So that’s not what we want to happen. Now in order to achieve that, we need interoperability. So, you need to be able to have an identity that you can take to a place just like you take your identity to a pub or a restaurant or club or whatever, in the physical world. So, we need to have that same approach.</p>
<p>But there are some companies are working on this. Ready Player Me is a company that’s building an avatar tool so that you can create your avatar ones and then you can use that avatar in over a few thousand platforms already. So that’s a start. It’s a centralised company’s nothing self-sovereign identity with it, is nothing blockchain, nothing decentralised. So, you actually don’t control your identity, but at least it’s the first step that you create one account to do this.</p>
<p>But we already have that in the 2D world, which is called a Facebook login in or a Google login, you know. Login with Google account, login with your Facebook account, which by the way, I would recommend not to do. Because yes, it is easy, but it also means that your data goes to Facebook, goes to Google, and they have even more access into what you are doing. So please don’t do that. I know it’s easy, but just don’t do it.</p>
<p>And so from that perspective, your identity is really important and we need to be able to build this interoperability so that you can take your avatar, your identity, that you create – yours, your flying purple dragon that you’ve created to all these different platforms and all these different platforms have different graphical requirements, different computational requirements, which makes it really, really challenging to do that.</p>
<p>You know, if you go to platform A, it might be hyper realistic and your dragon looks really, really hyper realistic, but then you go to a platform like Minecraft or Roblox is very, very blocky, and how do you adapt that? How do you have that one identity work in both worlds? That’s a massive technical challenge, that’s definitely not solved yet and that does require probably quite a bit of work to achieve that. But yes, what we need to have is interoperability, that you can take your avatar, you can take your flying dragon, and you can fly from one world to the other.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, exactly. Now mentioned flying from one world to the other. How open these companies, like Fortnight, say Disney or whichever is the other, Minecraft, no? Are they open to that interoperability? What do you feel that they’re open, to have that? Would they prefer to have it closed?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, most likely they will prefer to have it closed, which I think is a very short-sighted approach. Yes, having a closed network offers you a lot of value. We can only have to look at a mobile, a mobile messaging. WhatsApp was sold for $19 billion in 2014 for a reason because it’s a closed network and you can’t send a WhatsApp message to your signal or to your telegram.</p>
<p>In Europe, that’s going to change with the new laws. Investor rule probably not. So, we are very much used to not having this interoperability because for such large companies it offers a lot of value. If we do have that interoperability for society, it brings a lot of value.</p>
<p>We only have to look at email, we are able to send an email from a Gmail account to a Hotmail account. Imagine that would not be possible or imagine that we, we don’t have interoperability for websites that you can only build a website for, I don’t know, Chrome and then you have to build a completely new website for Internet Explorer, and you can’t just switch between. Imagine what that would mean for the world, it would just ruin the internet.</p>
<p>And email is so successful because I can use Gmail, you can use Hotmail and we can communicate. So, I think it’s very short-sighted for these companies – I understand why they think like that, but I think it’s very short sighted and very selfish almost, to work on value extraction instead of value creation for society.</p>
<p>So, interoperability will add a lot more value to all these platforms. If you really make it easy and make it nice and easy for people to come and also leave, you will see that if you offer the best product, the best service then people will still come, and you will still make money. It’s a different approach, it’s approach from a short-term share approach to a long-term societal stakeholder approach.</p>
<p>And I think as a society, we need to make that shift from a short term to long term. And I argue and I call every organisation to, to make that shift. However, I’m also a realist and I know that that’s not very likely and that most likely regulation will have to step in to force these people because they probably will not do it by themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. I couldn’t agree more with this point about that, and I hope they are listening to. They are listening to Mark and everyone else who is.</p>
<p>Mark: I hope so too.</p>
<p>Oscar: You already mentioned self-sovereign identity. Would you say that this is going to be the dominant paradigm in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I hope so and I think it should be, because it’s a way that we control who has access to our data. And the best example here is, of course, if I go to pub and I need to show that I’m over 18 currently in the world, I have to show my driver’s licence. On my driver’s licence there’s a ton of information that’s not relevant for the question. Are you over 18, yes, or no? Which is a, just a very simple question and a self-sovereign identity allows, would allow us to answer that question, that we can trust, without providing all that information. And I think as a society, I think we should want it.</p>
<p>We should be able to live in a world where we are not controlled by a centralised entity because generally centralised entities, they corrupt or they get if they become too powerful – in terms of countries, democracies change to non-democracies. So, I don’t think that’s the right direction. So, for me, for a humanity perspective, I think a self-sovereign identity is the best approach.</p>
<p>Now obviously there’s also a lot of challenges to it because if you own and control your own digital identity and it works with the private key and public key, and your private key is 128 bits, whatever, or even ideally more whatever. And you’re going to lose this long string of numbers because people lose passports and smartphones all the time. How are we going to deal with that?</p>
<p>That question hasn’t been answered yet and people will lose their private key. And if your self-sovereign identity is everything that you do and you lose it, then you are in really, really deep trouble. So, we need to solve that.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been solved and we need to – because it’s almost an oxymoron. You know, I am I going to store my private key with a centralised entity. So, then your private key is, you know, your self-sovereign identity is no longer self-sovereign.</p>
<p>And we saw that with that with the collapse of the various crypto exchanges, if you don’t own your private keys, the money is not really yours. Because it can just disappear. And so, this is self-sovereign identity, very, very important. It hasn’t been cracked yet and there’s still quite some technical challenges that we need to resolve here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe so. It’s super important to solve that problem. Absolutely. We’ve been talking about – you illustrate very nicely all these scenarios mostly for individuals, I would say. But if we now focus our attention a bit more into businesses, even government, for instance, organisations just in general. So, what are the opportunities or some scenario you can see the metaverse for, yes, for organisations and businesses?</p>
<p>Mark: Well as I mentioned earlier, you know, the metaverse will contribute trillions and trillions of dollars to the global economy. So, there are enormous amount of possibilities.</p>
<p>There are possibilities for consumer B2C, digital fashion, multibillion dollar industry, entertainment, immersive sports, watching sports or using augmented reality to bring a TV show into your living room. Well, Disney recently released a sample of that, which looks amazing. Education, you know, if you can learn something, immersive world, if you can walk around Rome for your history classes and pause whatever is happening to have a discussion with your teacher, that, of course, is a lot more powerful, but also from an enterprise perspective, you know, if I am able to collaborate in a virtual world, in a world that works, in a 3D world that’s a lot more intuitive and much, much more logical for us humans to operate in.</p>
<p>And that will have a big, big impact. Early last year in 2022, I was part of a training done by almost a dozen police forces around the world. And they were doing an exercise in the metaverse, in virtual reality and working with, you know, physical evidence and digital evidence. Everyone was in their own location in Singapore, in UAE, Bahrain, Senegal, France and several other countries.</p>
<p>And they were able to, to solve this scenario, which was a terrorist attack in a hypothetical country. And they all said afterwards that being able to collaborate in a virtual world is really nice and it’s really easy to get along with and also because there was no hierarchy, because all the avatars look the same that help the police forces are very hierarchical that, of course, and that really helped as well.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of benefits to this. You also see it, for example, in design companies, car companies Volvo is doing a lot by using virtual reality or even mixed reality to design cars with remote teams. So, sort of building a claim model in a physical location, you build a digital model with your design team just living or working anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where they are. All these things will have a big impact. And that will also have a big impact on society because, you know, if we think that the pandemic changed working from home, the metaverse will enable working from anywhere and where you can be literally anywhere you want in the world and eventually in early next decade, I have the feeling as if you are physically present in the office by but you are on a tropical paradise in the Pacific.</p>
<p>And that that’s something where we are going to still far, far away.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, from sounds nice. Final question, Mark, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Mark: Educate yourself and because the world is changing so fast at the moment, if you blink your eyes, you’ve missed a train. And we could have seen that. We did that with the AI, all the generative AI stuff that is happening at the moment, even for me. And it’s my job to be in to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>Even for me, it’s sometimes difficult to understand and to follow and to be up to date of what’s going on because the developments are going so fast. Now, if this is not your core job which for 99.99% of people, it isn’t. And it often ends up on a very long to do list at the bottom.</p>
<p>But you need to understand what’s happening and you need to understand ideally as an organisation, I would also start experimenting with this stuff, small experiments, just to understand what’s happening. And then you can, you can take it from there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Excellent. And as you say, your, um, you do what you preach. So, like your last book, just in doing your due diligence, doing this kind of stuff. Yeah, I think I have to do some experiments like that myself.</p>
<p>Mark: Well 100%, and for me doing these experiments, they help me to understand, to better understand these technologies. And so, if you want to understand what technology, X, Y, Z means for your business, start experimenting with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thanks a lot Mark. What’s been really fascinating conversation, going for moments very deep into the digital identity, which is something that we are very passionate about, that. And you gave us really good ideas and updates what’s going on. But let us know if someone would like to follow the conversation with you or get more about what you’re doing. What are the best ways?</p>
<p>Mark: So, I’m pretty visible online, so the easiest ways to go to find me on my website, which is <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/">thedigitalspeaker.com</a>, you’ll find my books there, my academic papers, my videos, my articles. I have almost a thousand articles about these topics all available to consume, feel free to email me, connect with me on LinkedIn, on Twitter. I’m happy to connect with anyone.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic and&nbsp;again, it was a pleasure talking with you, Mark, and all the best.</p>
<p>Mark: Thank you very much for having me, Oscar. It’s been a great conversation.</p>

<p>Modern identity management relies on multi-factor authentication to maintain account security above and beyond simple passwords. One-Time Passwords (OTPs) are a vital part of this effort.</p>
<p>What are Time-Based OTPs? TOPTs are one-time passwords that use synced clocks to generate and cycle through authentication tokens for added system security.</p>
 What Is a One-Time Password? 
<p>A <a>One-Time Password (OTP)</a> is a form of authentication in which the authentication system generates pseudo-randomized tokens, or strings of alphanumeric characters, to verify user identity. A common form of <a>multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA), one-time passwords fill the role of “ownership,” or proof that the user has access to a particular device or delivery method.</p>
<p>In an OTP scheme, the authentication system generates a secure one-time authentication token, often in the form of a string of numbers, to which the user has access. This token is unique to the transaction at hand and will only be known through the ownership of the delivery mechanism of the password (which can be both hardware- and software-based). </p>
<p>OTPs provide users with a secure form of MFA because they are generally easy to disseminate and use as a second authentication factor. Currently, several common forms of OTP delivery exist in enterprise and consumer markets.</p>
<p>These forms of token delivery include:</p>
 
 Email/SMS: By far, the most common OTP method is the delivery of a token via SMS text or email. The authentication system uses the user’s credentials to send an OTP to one of these services, requiring the user to input the OTP once received. This approach is generally more secure than single-factor authentication, with the caveat that it is useless should users have access to their devices or email stolen. 
 Hardware Tokens: Some strict security schemes require users to have physical tokens. These devices may resemble a badge, keychain fob, or USB key and generate keys synced to the conditions of the authentication server. However, they do not require Internet access and can only be compromised if the device is lost or stolen. 
 Software Authenticators: A common alternative to hardware keys are software authenticators that generate tokens. Common mobile apps like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator provide added security by eliminating the need to send OTPs across SMS or email.  
 <a>Push Authentication</a>: Modern OTP systems can use push notifications on a mobile phone to send a one-time password or even bypass the need for an OTP entirely. 
 
<p>With all the possible ways to send an OTP, it’s still critical that these passwords are random and secure–if a hacker could guess an OTP, they are next to worthless. To avoid that issue, there are several ways that OTPs are generated:</p>
 
 Hash-Based: Hash-Based OTPs (HTOPs) are generated using a hashing function that often includes a secret key and a “moving factor” to create pseudo random tokens. This moving factor is pulled from the environment to make guessing OTPs or their generation mechanisms impossible.
<p>Generally, general HTOPs can draw from information gathered during an initial transaction (i.e., the initial password-based authentication in an MFA verification request). Additionally, some hash-based systems will utilize “hash chains,” or sequences of OTPs based on the values of previous one-time passwords.</p> 
 Challenge-Response: Challenge-response systems will use user input as a moving factor in OTP generation. This moving factor could be the password the user provides or the answer to a specific security question. 
 Time-Based: Time-Based OTPs (TOTPs) use system time and other factors to create and cycle through one-time passwords for additional security. 
 
 How Do Time-Based One-Time Passwords Work? 
<p>Time-Based OTPs are those created using a synchronized timestamp as a moving step to seed a random key. This moving step is used to regenerate a new OTP once per interval, so the actual OTP required for multi-factor authentication changes each interval.</p>
<p>The result is a continuing cycle of OTPs that don’t rely on a specific input to generate. This generation cycle can continue unimpeded such that, at any given time, a user may access a pseudorandom OTP for MFA purposes. </p>
<p>The fluid nature of TOTPs provides several significant security benefits to enterprises and users by protecting against specific attacks, namely:</p>
 
 Brute-Force Password Attacks: Brute-force attacks are those that involve, as the name suggests, hammering authentication systems with password lists (usually dictionaries or lists of common or default passwords).
<p>This is a general feature of most MFA systems, but OTPs circumvent even the possibility of password guessing by requiring access to a service account or device.</p> 
 <a>Phishing</a>: Phishing attacks count on users giving up passwords via email or SMS so that hackers can gain access to important accounts. OTPs mitigate this possibility by requiring that hackers also have access to an OTP to authenticate.<br>
In the case of TOTPs, this challenge is amplified by the fact that the hacker would need to own either the token-generation device or an end-user’s token authenticator (such as a software app) at the exact moment of verification to get the right token. 
 Replay Attacks: Replay attacks are when a third party intercepts credentials and attempts to insert them into an authentication process to spoof their identity, usually soon after the original transaction. Because TOTPs require time-sensitive tokens, there’s no way to spoof credentials in a time-sensitive way accurately. 
 
<p>While TOTPs prevent several attacks, they are still vulnerable if a token generator (hardware or software) is stolen. For example, if the user has an OTP application on their phone and the phone is stolen, then the benefits of TOTPs are largely irrelevant.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of TOTP? 
<p>TOTP, and MFA writ large, provide significant business and security advantages over single-factor authentication. Additionally, a TOTP system can address significant issues with authentication security–namely, implementation, onboarding, and adoption.</p>
<p>These benefits include:</p>
 
 Cost Reduction: OTP systems generally are common and relatively easy to implement. Using TOTPs involves very little investment above and beyond typical MFA systems. Finally, even third-party authentication and identity providers can offer robust MFA and OTP support for a straightforward monthly fee. All of these factors combine to reduce costs (in terms of both time and money) for advanced security.  
 User Friendly: OTP systems integrate well with mobile and networked technologies. Software TOTPs are readily available for tablets and smartphones, so your employees can easily install and use the technology without changing their normal computing habits. This reduces the complexity of onboarding or adoption–often serious issues in adopting proper security methods. 
 Scalable: OTPs, and TOTPs, are easy to scale. You only need an authentication server and delivery methods (apps, hardware tokens, etc.) to distribute. That’s it. 
 Secure: TOTPs provide a critical layer of time-sensitive security that can thwart some of the most common and challenging threats facing enterprises today, specifically phishing and other social engineering attacks.

 A new paper describes harms rising from digital identity, and accountable responses for 2023.&nbsp; 



 

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfNotjE_Vk">Video of Nicky Hickman and Phil Wolff introducing the paper</a> at the Trust Over IP All Hands meeting on 25 January 2023. 20 minutes of presentation and 20 minutes of Q&amp;A. 



<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/17/why-the-digital-identity-juggernaut-needs-safety-belts/">announced today</a> their “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-in-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2022-11-16.pdf">Overcoming Human Harm Challenges in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>” paper for review. <a href="http://linkedin.com/company/widerteam">Wider Team</a>’s <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/philwolff">Phil Wolff</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/come-to-the-edge/about/">Come To The Edge</a>’s <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickyhickman">Nicky Hickman</a> wrote it with a large team of contributors including <a href="https://th.linkedin.com/in/pyrou-chung-4558b59b">Pyrou Chung</a> of the <a href="https://ewmi.org/">East-West Management Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Six cases track ways people have been hurt when digital identity ecosystems were abused, done poorly, or attacked. </p>



 
 People went hungry, broke, and even died because of digital identity failures.&nbsp; 



 Organizations wrote to the World Bank last year with ‘grave concerns’ about the Bank’s ID4D program and its “<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/advocacy/4945/letter-global-csos-world-bank">potential for abuse and exploitation</a>.”&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/">Internet Safety Labs</a> lists more than <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/digital-harms-dictionary-2-0/">seventy specific ways harms happen in their Digital Harms Dictionary</a>. The sheer diversity of harms makes them harder to identify.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Many of these harms are preventable by standards&nbsp;bodies, developers, and makers of identity systems. Preventable by customers, the enterprises who configure, deploy, and use identity ecosystems. Preventable by public policy makers and the regulators who enforce them. </p>



<p>Despite human harms being preventable, few are doing anything about it.&nbsp;</p>



 So what?&nbsp; 



 
 The coming backlash may devastate open standards efforts. The identity community risks fallout as public cases of outrageous harm pile up. We all rely on vigorous open standards bodies.  



 Backlash hurts identity businesses. When biometrics and AI hit their trust and ethics crises a few years’ ago, they faced regulatory interventions, stalled sales, and investor skepticism.  



 Blamestorms hurt identity ecosystem cohesion. Media outrage blames the closest business or agency. A hospital gets blamed for a vendor’s patient data breach, for example. So shaming and blaming of any ecosystem member will tarnish the rest, and drive abandonment and defection from that ecosystem.  
 



<p> However…</p>



 
 Accountability mitigates backlash. The more we build accountability into ecosystem governance and technology, the smaller the backlash, hopefully.&nbsp;Accountability By Design could be our watchword.  



 Identity can use proven accountability tools and practices. Other technologies and industries dealt with their negative externalities. Drug tampering led to safety caps. Toxic food led to traceability through food supply chains. Racist AI led to ethical AI standards for training ML systems. Environmental pollution led to… well we’re still working on that. So, let’s adapt effective ideas and practices.&nbsp; 



 Next? What can identity technologists, industry, regulators, and standards groups do now? The paper lists low-hanging fruit and suggests first steps.&nbsp; 
 



 Preventable side effects offend me.&nbsp; 



<p>My head hurts over these six identity harms case studies, and the many we didn’t include in the paper. I can’t count the number of aspirational manifestos and value statements by folks who work on self-sovereign identity. We frame identity as a human right, a civil right, a duty of good government, a way to empower the excluded, the poor, and the dispossessed. We champion our digital identity technologies and governance in the name of serving humanity, and business progress, and enabling society, and healing our planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite our pure motives and hard work…&nbsp;</p>



<p>These new, richer identity tools can be abused just as much as old ones. It is human nature that every identification technology will be abused. My cynical take on human nature is grounded in history. </p>



<p>Today’s widely used digital identity tools suffer from cultural blindness and dissonance. <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Asia-Pacific">ToIP’s Asia Pacific Human Experience working group</a> shared stories where Western models of personhood, encoded in nearly all digital identity systems, exclude and distort how identity works for millions of people. The paper tells more about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at identity systems that enabled predators to hound a child to suicide. To facilitate gambling addiction. To leave a refugee in limbo. All without a responsible person to blame. Without even a single company or policy or technical artifact to blame.&nbsp;</p>



 These harms don’t arrive with accountability.&nbsp; 



<p>Digital identity systems are fundamentally “ecosystems.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are made from many parties, in a complex, diverse, fluid, multijurisdictional web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like cities, identity ecosystems are built up over time, with legacies of cultural assumption and prejudices, of old choices and narrow contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those of us who have worked with trust frameworks, who bring identity ecosystems into being or refine them, we have not held ourselves morally at fault when they do harm. No more than those who make cars or airplanes or firearms are responsible when those goods result in injury and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won’t trace those harms back to an open standard committee meeting or to an identity ecosystem rollout any more than you’d trace a spent bullet back to the factory operator that machined it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When chains of causality are hard to map, or are untraceable, the root causes of these harms are unaccountable.&nbsp;</p>



 Inciting action, building in accountability, will be difficult.&nbsp; 



 
 The identity technology community is in denial about downstream risks. Few in the identity professions and industries believe these human problems exist.&nbsp; 



 Untested business cases. Nobody believes this matters enough or matters to them personally or matters urgently.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Anecdotes, not statistics. These threats are mostly uncounted and unmeasured; a weakness in quantified policy and management circles.&nbsp; 



 No ownership. Nobody owns these problems outright. Neither the toolmakers nor any of an ecosystem’s parties own the side effects of a system’s broken trust.&nbsp; 



 Scopes of responsibility are too narrow. Our definitions of “ecosystem” leave out many kinds of people affected by the ecosystem, and harms inflicted on them. Although governance practices include responsibility to other members of an ecosystem, they rarely name negative externalities or speak to accountability for them.&nbsp; 



 Ethics are unevenly distributed. The abilities to discover harms swiftly, make sense of them, and respond well are unequal within an identity ecosystem. They will continue to be. Those who are most ready and able to respond are unlikely to be the only parties generating those harms. And some ecosystem parties will trigger harms emitted by others.&nbsp;“Ethics are unevenly distributed” seems like a universal law that begs for corollaries.  



 IAM industry consolidation reduces individual companies’ fear of side effects. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters">Thoma Bravo buying Forgerock, Ping,and Sailpoint</a> cuts the odds these issues make it to any of their executive OKRs.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This is blue ocean territory: I haven’t found anyone in our space investing to manage these business risks. No companies, government agencies, or NGOs are actively working on human harm reduction, response, or regulation. After my year on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnYTXKD6yFkhcyE7JO6UawK9doE5AS3Xi">Human Experience Working Group</a>’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/SSI+Harms+%28BGBU%29+Task+Force">Harms Task Force</a>, I hope this paper helps folks understand the range of risks digital identity brings. And that we act now, in concert.&nbsp;</p>

Our SDKs and protocols have been integrated into many edge apps, including <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/capyloon/">Capyloon</a>, <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3.storage</a>, and <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought">Noosphere</a>. </p><p>The Webnative library provides:</p>
 
 User accounts using the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</a> or a blockchain wallet using the Webnative <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative-walletauth">WalletAuth</a> plugin 
 Authorization using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> 
 Encrypted file storage using the <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs">Webnative File System</a> backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> 
 Key management using the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol to link devices 
 Platform APIs for publishing apps from the browser 
 
<p>Let's break each of these down.</p> User Accounts <p>Developers can choose whether they would like the browser or a blockchain wallet to store a user's encrypt and decrypt keys. The best choice depends on what kind of user experience the developer would like their users to have. For example, if they are building an app for a blockchain audience, using the blockchain wallet user account is likely the best option. </p><p>Our team is also currently working on a third user accounts option - passkey support. Passkeys are secured by the device's OS.</p> Authorization <p><a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> stands for User Controlled Authorization Network. UCANs are a way of doing authorization (“what you can do”) where users are fully in control.<br>There’s no all-powerful authorization server, or server of any kind required! Everything that a user is allowed to do is captured directly in a key or token, and can be sent to anyone that knows how to interpret this format.</p>The UCAN mascot Encrypted File Storage <p>The Webnative library provides developers the tools to make their edge apps work seamlessly offline while being encrypted at rest. We created an encrypted file storage system called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/diving-deeper-webnative-file-system/">WNFS</a>, which is built on top of the <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> protocol and backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>, making it interoperable across the Web.</p>Winnie the WNFS mascot Key Management <p>Device-linking is a breeze with the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol. AWAKE is an authenticated key exchange that provides a way to know something provable about what the other party can do, even if they have no sure way of knowing who the party is. To do this, the protocol leverages UCAN capabilities that don't require a root source of truth. </p>The AWAKE mascot Platform APIs  <p>As well as using the <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes/developers/cli">Fission CLI</a> to register and publish apps, developers can create web apps that publish an app directly from the browser.</p> What's New <p>Webnative version 0.35 is a major rewrite to improve the reliability and extensibility of Webnative. Here are a few of the big changes:</p> Namespaced Apps <p>Webnative can now have many apps run on the same domain without any conflicts. Each app is namespaced by default and has its own accounts and WNFS. This should help developers when building apps on the same localhost port. </p> Customizable + Extensible <p>A new component system makes it possible for Webnative to run independent of Fission infrastructure. For example, you can use the web3.storage IPFS platform to host your encrypted data. This system also enables the webnative-walletauth plugin.</p> Increased Reliability <p>We've made improvements to the device-linking feature so it works smoothly across multiple browsers.</p> Temporary Filesystems <p>Multiple filesystems can be loaded at the same time now that conflicts with identifiers have been resolved in the latest version. This allows users to access a temporary filesystem until they are ready to create their own account. When the user ends their session, the developer can give them the option to either store their files locally or create a new account.</p> Next Steps <p>Learn all about the latest version of Webnative SDK by reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative/blob/182a8157d1c0d3c30df7c349fe3c87a348057853/CHANGELOG.md#v0350">changelog</a> and <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers with existing Webnative apps will need to make some changes in order for their apps to be compatible with the latest version. Details on what needs to be updated are available on the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/migration#version-0.35.0">migration page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://fission.codes/blog/webnative-app-template/">Webnative App Template</a> is up to date and ready to use with version 0.35, so now is a great time to take Webnative SDK out for a test drive.<br></p>

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol that unlocks data for AI, is excited to announce the launch of DesightsAI, a web3 platform bootstrapped by the community and built on top of Ocean’s technology to crowdsource business solutions to toughest data and AI challenges.</p><p><a href="https://desights.ai/">DesightsAI</a> is built on the Web3 principles of self sovereignty over data where creators and contributors have complete control over their creations. For each submission to these challenges, DesightsAI uses Ocean’s technology to create a unique ownership in the form of ERC721 token and allows for a royalty structure to be added around that submission. This has the goal to allow all contributors to own and earn revenue from their creations without any middlemen.</p><p>Bruce Pon, Founder, Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Protocol data challenges</a> have been designed to help data owners discover contexts around their data, and turn ideas into a commercialisable reality. By leveraging the Ocean stack, DesightsAI strengthens our value proposition for data owners, whilst giving more control to data scientists so that everyone can be an active participant in the new Data&nbsp;Economy.</blockquote><p>Manan Patel, Founder, Desights&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>We’re excited to play a leading role not only in furthering the growth of the Ocean ecosystem but also in creating an entire supply chain of datasets, models, and algorithms that will allow the best data scientists on the platform to thrive from the new data&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><p>DesightsAI starts as a data challenges platform but has an ambitious lineup of innovative tooling for data scientists in the roadmap. Its goal is to build a decentralized community of data scientists and like minded individuals that, together, can spin off innovative AI/ML concepts and take ideas from generation all the way to execution in just a few simple&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The platform launches today in closed Alpha, and kicks off the <a href="http://bit.ly/3w4Wt93">third round</a> of the Predict-ETH data challenge series. This data challenge will be available in early access mode to community members that have previously taken part in the&nbsp;program.</p><p>To claim and/or request access to DesightsAI please visit their discord&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/uBhKRmQ5H6">here</a>.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a New Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner by giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing&nbsp;it.</p><p>About DesightsAI</p><p><a href="https://desights.ai/">Desights</a> is a web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to toughtest Data and AI challenges. Organisations/DAOs can fund these challenges and invite brightest minds in the Data and AI industry to solve these challenges.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Customers need solutions, not SSI technology. We will struggle in fostering adoption if we try to sell SSI technology to end customers. We should rather focus on selling them solutions to business problems. For example, Slack sells productivity/collaboration tools to enterprises, not Internet technology or communication protocols. The same approach should be taken but us identity folks!</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Riley Hughes, we discuss,</p>
 
 
 Since we recorded the last episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/building-digital-trust-ecosystems/">Episode 10</a>), how have the value propositions and adoption of SSI changed? 
 
 
 What are the different ways that SSI adoption is happening, and what ways are easier than others to push adoption? 
 
 
 <p>Taken from “Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be Adopted” (https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb)</p> 
 
 
 Do Enterprises see any incentive to issue digital credentials? 
 
 
 Why the term ‘Digital Wallet’ is a bad analogy for what they actually are, and why it’s not positioned well to be a solution to business problems? 
 
 
 Does Digital Identity still have an Identity problem? Why is terminology important to be used under the right contexts?

<p>2022 was a big year for us.</p><p>In this recap (not ReCap… read on to learn about ReCaps), we’ll share a non-exhaustive list of some of our accomplishments from the past year, starting with our company updates, then highlighting key development work across our open-source products and libraries. </p><p>As the builders of open-source software (essentially public goods), we have to toot our own horn a little bit.</p> Our Company <p>💡Fundraising</p><p>In April, we announced a $34M Series A round led by a16z crypto. This funding enables us to lead research efforts in cutting-edge privacy and usability technology for identity, while growing our product teams and executing partnerships across the Web3 ecosystem. You can learn more in our announcement <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-raises-34m-to-unbundle-the-login-for-a-user-controlled-web/">here</a>. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-raises-34m-to-unbundle-the-login-for-a-user-controlled-web/">  Spruce Raises $34M to Unbundle the Login for a User-Controlled Web  We’re excited to announce that we have raised $34 million in a Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Spruce enables users to control their data across the web as the world becomes increasingly dependent on cryptography, networks, and digital economies.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>🌲Our Team</p><p>Our Spruce team grew in 2022, but we’re still small and mighty! Spruce is currently across three continents and eight countries. </p><p>Our team is globally distributed and remote-first. Rather than having a physical office, we gather in different locations twice per year for multi-day workshops and team events. </p><p>🎉Events and Hackathons</p>  We sponsored bounties at ETHDenver, ETHAmsterdam, and Graph Hack, working with developers to apply Sign-In with Ethereum to core workflows in hackathon projects.  We also sponsored the event dinners and were the Diversity &amp; Inclusion sponsor for the Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California.  We attended and spoke at various conferences around the world, including Devcon, Oktane, and more.  <p>🌍Standards and Working Groups</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups and has implemented and architected various global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more. Here are some highlights from our participation this year:</p>  We co-authored, built, and supported Sign-In with Ethereum (EIP-4361), which moved from “Draft” to “Review” in July on the Standards Track.  We authored and built additional specifications that extend Sign-In with Ethereum, with one being &nbsp;ReCaps (EIP-5573), enabling SIWE to include human-readable authorizations.  We participated in the <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/crossword-security-cyber2022.html">Jobs for the Future (JFF) Plugfest</a> to demonstrate the interworking of Verifiable Credentials with Decentralized Identifiers for learning and employment records (LERs) to be used for proving career qualifications.  We participated in the ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL Interoperability Party in Brisbane to demonstrate interoperability with solutions from Microsoft, Ping, and Panasonic for online presentation of driver’s license data to websites in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.  We <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/casa-presentation-extending-sign-in-with-ethereum/">spoke about extending Sign-In with Ethereum</a> at the Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) Gathering in April.  Spruce and TBD <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-and-tbd-demonstrate-decentralized-identity-interoperability/">demonstrated support</a> for all defined JWS algorithms for Data Integrity and JWT proofs for W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and W3C Verifiable Presentations (VPs), which is a significant step towards vendor interoperability.  We participated in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts from different national ISO bodies to work on the mobile driver's license (mDL) and, more generally, the mdoc (mobile ID) standards.  We participated as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the next version of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model &nbsp;(VCDM) standard.  We participated in the DIF JWT interoperability presentation profile initiative and demonstrated interoperability with MSFT, Avast, Workday, and IBM at the IIW demo table.  We participated in the OpenID Foundation AB/C WG as co-editor of the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP) and contributors to the OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI) to help advance the specifications.  <p>As a company, our most important achievements this year were in the products and libraries we built and maintained, bringing us closer to a future where users control their identity and data across their digital interactions.</p> Our Open-Source Products <p>🏠SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything):</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">launched SSX</a> in November based on feedback from the community about their experiences installing Sign-In with Ethereum and additional capabilities they wanted. SSX will be the gateway to decentralized identity, combining our core libraries to power user control across the web. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a>  We made SSX the easiest way to install Sign-In with Ethereum and reduced the amount of code it takes by up to 80%.  We pioneered DAO login via a collaboration with the Safe team.  We added support for various frameworks to ensure as easy of a developer experience as possible.  <p>🚗Credible:</p><p>With Credible, we are <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">creating a solution</a> to provision mobile driver’s licenses to a smartphone application using ISO/IEC 18013-5, along with the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, and OpenID for Verifiable Credentials to create secure, privacy-enhancing, and tamper evident identity solutions. We have exciting work underway that we will be able to share soon.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">  Credible: Introducing Mobile Driver’s Licenses  We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet. That’s why we’re excited to share a new solution we’ve been working on with early partners as a part of our new Credible Product Suite.  SpruceElissa Maercklein    </a> <br>Our Open-Source Libraries <p>🧱Sign-In with Ethereum:</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  Built the <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">Sign-In with Ethereum developer portal</a> with a quick start guide and installation instructions.  Released libraries for multiple languages, including <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go">Go</a>, and more, ensuring any developer can easily get started.  Released a <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth">Discourse plugin</a>, which enables any self-hosted Discourse forum to enable Sign-In with Ethereum.  <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/">Launched a SIWE integration</a> in the Auth0 (powered by Okta) marketplace, leveraging our OIDC Identity Provider Server.  Launched the first community-hosted OpenID Connect Identity Provider Server <a href="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep10-executable-a-dao-governed-identity-server/11125">in collaboration with the ENS DAO</a>.  Specified ReCaps as an extension to SIWE as <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573">EIP-5573</a>.  SIWE received shout-outs from Vitalik, Bankless, and other thought leaders as a top trend to watch in 2023.  SIWE is currently used by or in the process of being incorporated by hundreds of projects and individual developers - with examples including Tally, Lens Protocol, Unlock, Boardroom, wagmi, WalletConnect, and many more.  <p>🧱DIDKit and ssi:</p><p>DIDKit is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Verifiable Credentials, W3C Decentralized Identifiers, and a variety of related data models and protocols.</p><p>DIDKit is in production use, powering credential workflows such as those found on <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Passport</a>. We plan on continuing to enhance and refine DIDKit this year to make it even easier for a developer to get started using W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>  We restructured our ssi library into constituent workspace crates to make it easier for developers to import and use.  We enabled the external signing of verifiable presentations in DIDKit-WASM and VP holder bindings.  We implemented <a href="https://demo.spruceid.com/2022/holder-binding-specs/cacao-delegation-holder-binding-spec/#cacaodelegationholderbinding2022">CacaoDelegationHolderBinding2022</a> with Sign-In with Ethereum, CACAOs, and ReCaps.  Added a basic UCAN implementation, a CACAO-ZCAP integration, and contexts for the JFF VC-EDU plugfest.  We added and improved support for multiple did methods included in DIDKit.  <p>🧱TreeLDR:</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-treeldr-a-canopy-across-your-data-schemas/">released TreeLDR</a>: a developer tool plus DSL that makes managing data schemas as easy as defining data structures in your favorite statically-typed language. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-treeldr-a-canopy-across-your-data-schemas/">  Introducing TreeLDR: A Canopy Across Your Data Schema Dreams  TreeLDR is an open-source developer tool with a DSL that makes managing data schemas as easy as defining data structures in your favorite (sane) statically-typed language.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a><p>🧱Rebase:</p><p><a href="https://app.rebase.xyz/">Rebase</a> is a decentralized service that allows people and organizations to map their identities to cryptographic keys using social media in a user-centric and publicly auditable way.</p>  We deployed the first reference implementation of a Rebase frontend that allows users to go through workflows to receive Verifiable Credentials.  We’ve added support for workflows to verify Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, DNS ownership, Ethereum account ownership, Solana account ownership, Reddit accounts, SoundCloud accounts, and email addresses.  <p>🧱Kepler:</p><p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We demonstrated how a user can Sign-In with Ethereum to authenticate with Kepler, use session keys, and store files privately.  We implemented a capability subsystem, which provides a registry of delegations, invocations, and revocations.  Rewrote the core SDK functionality in Rust and added a WASM-based SDK, wrapping around the new Rust SDK.  <p>Kepler is currently undergoing active development, and we plan on releasing more information soon on how you can get started using it!</p> <p>2022 was a banner year for Spruce, but 2023 is shaping up to be even bigger. We share developer updates monthly here that cover all the upgrades, features, and updates to our open-source products and libraries. <br></p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>It’s 2023—do you know what your identity is doing? As the adoption of digital channels continues to be matched by corresponding levels of fraud, the ability to achieve digital identity verification will take on new urgency in the coming year. At least, let’s hope so.</p>
<p>According to Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, fraud costs consumers and businesses <a href="https://javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report">$52 billion per year</a> in just the US. Worldwide, the figure could be as high as <a href="https://martechseries.com/analytics/customer-identity-management/new-report-reveals-fraud-management-is-vital-to-the-business-strategy-of-most-organizations/">$5 trillion</a>. Account takeovers (ATOs) and account origination fraud increasingly play a role in these losses.</p>
<p>Thanks to never-ending credentials harvesting attacks and data breaches, fraudsters pilfered more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/how-to-protect-consumers-from-account-takeover-fraud/">$11.4 billion</a> through ATOs last year, a 90% increase over 2020. When account hijackings lead to yet another breach, the average additional cost to US-based organizations now tops <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$9.44 million per incident</a>, though it can go <a href="https://betanews.com/2022/02/21/the-most-expensive-data-breaches-of-the-2020s/">much higher</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, account origination fraud has emerged as a top attack vector. In these scams, fraudsters use stolen or synthetic identities to open new banking, credit card, or retail accounts. According to Forbes, that could spell <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2022/10/20/socure-report-examines-rise-of-synthetic-identity-fraud/?sh=6261d5295a34">$5 billion</a> in losses by 2024. With all of this in mind, here are six things to watch for in the year ahead.</p>
 1. US Regulators Require Tech Giants to Adopt Non-Proprietary Identities 
<p>With the Improving Digital Identity Act nearing passage and federal government agencies accelerating the transition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">Kantara-certified</a> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">certified biometrics</a>-certified digital identity verification systems, look for regulators to begin formalizing similar requirements for US businesses.</p>
<p>In 2023, measures will likely require US tech giants to adopt non-proprietary verified digital identities that protect against fraud and allow individual consumers to control what personal information they share with organizations they do business with online.</p>
<p>Modern digital identity technologies enable identity to be verified without storing that information centrally on servers belonging to companies like Google, Apple, Meta, or Amazon. This form of verified identity protects companies and consumers from fraud while safeguarding privacy and preventing personal information from getting hacked, sold, or shared.</p>
<p>While the GAMA companies may be first, such measures are likely to be extended to all consumer-facing businesses. It’s already the law for all companies doing business in California—effective January 1. Given that <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ecommerce/2022/the-future-of-digital-identity-verification-driven-by-technology-shaped-by-regulators/">90% of US businesses</a> are unprepared for even that change, organizations are advised to begin evaluating technologies that accept distributed identifiers now.</p>
 2. VPNs Give Way to an Identity-based Perimeter for the Virtual Workforce 
<p>When the corporate “network” now extends to every employee’s bedroom, breakfast nook, or go-to coffee bar, relying on VPNs for perimeter security is like locking the back window while leaving the front door wide open. As recent cyberattacks on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/uber-hack-mfa-cant-fix-the-problem-until-we-fix-mfa/">Uber</a> and others have demonstrated, VPNs are simply no match for compromised credentials.</p>
<p>Whether they’re to corporate systems, email accounts, or the VPN itself, the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/paypal-passwordless-authentication-apple/">2 billion login credentials</a> stolen in recent years mean threat actors have easy access to corporate secrets, data, and more. It doesn’t help that 64% of us use variations of the <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/03/08/exposed-data-trends/">same passwords</a> across multiple accounts—and often share them with colleagues.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) aren’t proving to be much of an obstacle either. As a result, look for next-gen MFA solutions to gain traction in the year ahead. Today’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/remote-workforce/">most robust offerings</a> use biometric markers tied to a registered smartphone to provide phishing-poof authentication impervious to account takeover.</p>
 3. 80% of Fortune 500 Greenlight Passwordless Projects 
<p>The same drivers behind the shift from relying solely on VPNs and traditional MFA will accelerate the push toward passwordless authentication projects in 2023. By year’s end, we predict 80% of Fortune 500 companies will have formalized and budgeted these projects, and 50% will implement it in at least two of the most commonly targeted systems—remote access and operating systems.</p>
<p>With passwordless authentication, corporate users can log in and access systems, resources, and applications without using passwords. Instead, they leverage another form of <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-ways-businesses-benefit-from-passwordless-authentication/436261">identity verification</a>. But not all paths to passwordless security are created equal.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication can involve a one-time passcode (OTP), SMS confirmation, and a PIN. But while helpful, these can be easily <a href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/information-security/breach-detection/article/21229613/how-hackers-bypass-mfa-and-ways-to-stop-them">bypassed by hackers</a>. To be successful, organizations will need to deploy <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/passwordless-enterprise/">modern MFA technologies</a> that bridge <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/how-biometric-solutions-are-shaping-workplace-security/380786">biometrics</a>, offline government-issued IDs, and device-based authentication to make it virtually impossible for systems or accounts to get hacked.</p>
 4. Transaction Signing Moves From NFTs, Crypto Exchanges to Banking 
<p>In the year ahead, transaction signing will expand from digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and crypto exchanges to traditional financial markets with major banks implementing the technology.</p>
<p>To those in the know, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/secure-second-factor-authentication-for-custodial-wallets/">transaction signing</a> introduces an additional layer of security over common two-factor authentication methods by requiring users to key in details embedded in their transactions to generate a random one-time QR code that is then authenticated with an authenticator app. This helps prevent interception or modification to transaction details from malware or viruses employing “man-in-the-middle” schemes. While the friction this creates has slowed adoption, customer demand is building.</p>
<p>Organizations using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkt6aBhDKARIsAAyeLJ1KVm2MVIwyql-Xwq-rmxozkhrmA_wfTEq72mbDzXitz0CA_hyHiJIaAiXzEALw_wcB">tamper-resistant forms of transaction signing</a> will have a competitive advantage. Investments in use cases like transaction signing of digital assets will eliminate fraudulent activities that have cost the cryptocurrency market <a href="https://finbold.com/study-crypto-hackers-stole-more-than-2-5-billion-over-three-quarters-in-2022/">$2.5 billion</a> during just the first three quarters of 2022, expanding its appeal to a wider array of high-value, high-risk transactions.</p>
 5. From Trust to Bust: Recession Brings New Boom in Fraud 
<p>The chances of an economic downturn in the next year now range between 60% and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-17/forecast-for-us-recession-within-year-hits-100-in-blow-to-biden">fait accompli</a>. If the economy does go south, there’s one thing you can bank on—a massive surge in fraud. The COVID pandemic was just the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/hackers-posing-as-cdc-who-using-coronavirus-in-phishing-attacks">lure du jour</a> for fraudsters looking for a hook. But the most relevant historical precedent for online fraud dynamics would be the Great Recession that began in 2008.</p>
<p>At the time, Reuters reported the number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-internet-idUSTRE52T6EL20090330">online fraud complaints</a> reported to the FBI jumped 33%–the first increase in three years. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/18/cybercrime-boom-fraud-tech-security-cx_ag_1119crime.html?sh=682b02522c43">Phishing emails doubled</a> from 400,000 to 800,000 a day between August and November. Meanwhile, financial services firms saw a surge in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535189/opinion--bust-out-schemes-are-a-fraud-designed-to-make-you-go-bust.html">bust-out scams</a> perpetrated by fraudsters armed with synthetic identity information. By 2014, <a href="https://www.fico.com/blogs/bad-debt-ruining-your-balance-sheet-look-bust-out-fraud">10% to 15% of all banks unsecured bad debt</a> was believed to stem from this fraud.</p>
<p>If similar dynamics play out now, the financial services industry’s shift from traditional forms of MFA to biometrics- and device-based authentication and distributed identity couldn’t come at a more pivotal moment.</p>
 6. The ‘Identity Score’ Gains Traction Over Conventional Credit Scores 
<p>As ownership and control of personal data starts to fall away from tech companies and credit bureaus, digital reputation—or our “identity score”—will be managed and nurtured by individual consumers. A likely scenario could be the ability to store personal information in a privacy-focused wallet or another decentralized verification mechanism.</p>
<p>Government identity documents, bank account relationships, and verifiable credentials or receipts that establish transaction and credit history will be held by the individual instead of a credit bureau or tech platform. When the individual opts to share this data, it can be scored without contributing any private user information or metadata to third-party providers. Or it can be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=6740c174584a">time-based</a> and deleted after a predetermined period.</p>
<p>Beyond the aspect of personal control, reputation and risk established with this kind of digital <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">identity score</a> are verified to be accurate and up to date (as in real-time), unlike current credit bureau-based reputation systems. Exactly the kind of verification that will rank among digital identity’s primary benefits in 2023—and beyond.</p>

<p>(Re-posted from MetaMask original&nbsp;blog)</p><p>Snaps is the roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel Snaps being built&nbsp;today.</p> Web3Auth Snap <p>Snap Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p><p>Why did you build&nbsp;it?</p><p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p><p>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</p>  Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private&nbsp;key.  Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads/interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions, we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.  The rest of the process can be further split into two major&nbsp;tasks:  Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests  Getting the MPC SDKs running in the Metamask Snaps SES environment  If you’re familiar with how Metamask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum-specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this&nbsp;range.  Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the Metamask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers/byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the Metamask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library/specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had&nbsp;issues.  <p>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</p><p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through&nbsp;Snaps.</p><p>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other&nbsp;wallets?</p><p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p><p>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>I think Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting&nbsp;overall.</p><p>What does Snaps mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3&nbsp;space?</p><p>In general, I think Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p><p>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask&nbsp;Snaps?</p><p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-snap-integrating-multi-factor-authentication-into-metamask-4e57f07af77">Web3Auth MPC Snap: Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication Into MetaMask</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  In the grand picture of decentralized identity, the leger plays a relatively boring role; it’s an important role however, and we’ll discuss why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>When exchanging verifiable credentials, there is information that needs to be known by all participants in the ecosystem or network; a distributed ledger, such as the Indicio Network,&nbsp; stores this information to facilitate verifiable interactions.</p>
<p>The following information — and only this information — is, typically, stored on the ledger:</p>
<p>DIDs for an Organization, Company, or Institution</p>
<p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is linked to public cryptographic keys and a service endpoint. These are used to verify credentials from a particular issuer; the endpoint allows you to communicate with that issuer.</p>
<p>Generally, public organization DIDs comprise Issuer DIDs, Verifier DIDs, and the DIDs of other well-known authorities.</p>
<p>Credential Schemas</p>
<p>A credential contains information and Schemas define the different fields containing that information. For example, if you look at a physical driver’s license, it will have sections for birth date, address, height, and weight. Each of these fields would be attributes within a Schema for a driver’s license verifiable credential.</p>
<p>TDLR: The Schema stores the definition for the attribute but not the specific values for the attribute.</p>
<p>Credential Definitions</p>
<p>These are specific to the use of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/anoncreds">AnonCreds</a> credential format with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Credential Definitions link a cryptographic key to each of the attributes in a Credential Schema. This allows a holder of a credential to share information in privacy-preserving ways, such as through selective disclosure (only a single attribute is shared) or a predicate proof (an attribute value can be numerically assessed without the actual value being disclosed, such as &gt;21 or &lt;21 for purchasing items that have legal age requirements).</p>
<p>Revocation Registry Accumulators&nbsp;</p>
<p>This provides a way of signaling which credentials are valid by keeping track of which credentials have been revoked and which have not been revoked. It is called an accumulator because the information on non-revoked and revoked credentials is compiled into an aggregate value without revealing the underlying information. As a consequence, the accumulator does not directly reveal the revocation status of any individual credential. Instead, this aggregate value is used by the credential holder to prove that their credential has not been revoked. This calculation is called a “proof of non-revocation.”</p>
<p>Put simply, the revocation registry accumulator is a way of proving your credential is valid.</p>
<p>What’s not on the ledger</p>
<p>Personally Identifying Information (PII)</p>
<p>No PII or personal data of any kind is recorded on the ledger.</p>
<p>Credential Issuance</p>
<p>No information about the issuance of any individual credential is recorded on the ledger.</p>
<p>The Verifiable Credential</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are not written to or stored on the ledger in any context.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of decentralized identity is that you can create an ecosystem of&nbsp; millions of people using millions of credentials with only three or four writes to the ledger: the credential type, the schema, the credential definition, the issuer DID, and the revocation registry</p>
<p>How do we ensure no personal identifying information ends up on the ledger?</p>
<p>Distributed ledger networks prescribe rules for who can write and what can be written (no PII!) to a ledger and these rules are enforceable through legal agreement. These governance rules typically require that writes to a ledger must be approved by a Transaction Endorser.</p>
<p>Seems complicated — why bother using a ledger?</p>
<p>The question “If you’re only going to write three-to-four things to a ledger, why have one at all?” comes up a lot. But these three-to-four things are critical to the way a decentralized ecosystem functions and as a consequence they need the following features provided by the ledger:</p>
 
 Immutability: The data cannot be changed—by anyone. Having the Schema change underneath a credential would cause chaos.
 
 Tamper resistance: The structure of a distributed ledger makes it very difficult for a malicious actor to break in and change material. For example, if you wanted to change the private key associated with a DID you would have to break into the ledgers of a significant number of network nodes, whereas in a centralized system, you would only need to compromise one database.
 
 High availability: A ledger is distributed across many nodes with each containing a copy of the ledger. If one node goes down for any reason, there are plenty of others to receive data from.
 
 Geopolitical and infrastructure diversity: By hosting the ledger on servers located in&nbsp; multiple geographic areas and by diverse organizations, network resilience to technical problems is maximized—data is capable of being written and read even if multiple nodes succumb to problems. 
 
<p>It is technically possible to run a decentralized ecosystem without a ledger. It is possible to achieve immutability and tamper resistance by using some other technology. But as of now, the technology required to provide those features is extensive and will often come to resemble a ledger anyway. With a few exceptions, it turns out that an existing, purpose built ledger is actually the perfect tool to support decentralized identity ecosystems.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Jay Baskar. Jay is a director of our solutions engineering. I’ve invited Jay to talk about deploying Passwordless authentication across the diverse IT environment. Jay, you’re joining us from Pune, India this morning, so thank you very much for taking time.</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Thank you. Thanks for having me. Yeah.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Yeah. So can you talk a little bit about the enterprise environment today and some of the challenges in deploying Passwordless solutions? Are there gaps in this approach?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. So when you take large organizations, these mega organizations. So there are a lot of solutions that are in play. So you have solutions that take care of how the identity starts. So you have the provisioning platforms that create identities or it takes the identity through its lifecycle. And you have governance platforms, you have authentication platforms, authorization platforms. So there are many, many solutions that are in play. And we need to make sure that any point a user tries to access something, the user is authenticated.</p>
<p>So there needs to be a way a user can securely authenticate, be it just a Windows authentication, opening up your laptop or your Mac, and from there you are firing up your VPN. There you are authenticating again, and then you are going onto a browser to access a cloud application. Again, the user’s identity needs to be verified there as well. So there needs to be a way to identify the user security, and authenticate the user, and all needs to be done in a manner that is more secure. And to reduce the user passwords, we need to have a platform that can address all of these different endpoints. So anything the user touches, the solution needs to have a way to accommodate a passwordless authentication for the user without compromising on the security.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So passwordless, it sounds fairly easy, but you’re talking about accessing the endpoint, accessing the VPN, accessing apps, browser-based access. How do we get to this? I mean, we talk about the latest federated apps that seems fairly straightforward, passwordless access to those, but we’re talking about environments that have been over decades. So what are some of the thorny issues that you have to deal with?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. That’s a great question. So if you are a small organization that started in 2014, security’s easy for you to build it. So you take a particular identity as a service vendor, you create your identities there, and then you get single sent onto all the apps. Every apps that you use are probably cloud apps that do modern SSO, modern ways of doing governance. But if you’re an organization that has been there for decades, you still probably have mainframes, you still have legacy applications that does form based authentication.</p>
<p>A developer probably developed the code in 1997 and then left and nobody touches the code. It just works, don’t touch it. So these kind of applications are easy targets, so you’re only as strong as your weakest link. So that’s the big problem for these large organizations. So you need to have a solution that can cover all of those as well. So legacy applications, how can you authenticate into that right now? Typically, you use your network ID and password, and that once you’re exposed, it’s easy to hack. So the solution needs to have a way to provide a password is authentication for these systems as well. So security, it’s only better if the weakest applications are also accommodated.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So I did a search on my mobile handset earlier today, and four different authenticators came up. How does a passwordless solution deal with the two-factor authentication that’s already existing within the enterprise?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
That’s a great question. So then, we speak to a lot of organizations that are like Fortune 100. And a lot of these organizations have an existing two factor solution already. And we have seen the scenarios where they want to, that there is a big push or an appetite for using a modern passwordless authentication platform, but they still have some legacy 2FA platform. So what we are seeing is some organizations have gone through this process of acquiring a modern solution, but they ended up seeing is that this modern application, the modern passwordless platform was not supporting all endpoints. It supports some cloud apps. It supports some OS authentications, but it doesn’t do some thick lines, for example, or legacy applications.</p>
<p>So what the organizations are forced to do is to have two separate sort of authentications. One is using the legacy 2FA, one is using modern MFA. So the risks there are twofold. One is you have split scenarios. So you have one set of applications using a less secure legacy 2FA and one set of applications that use a more secure way of authentication. But attackers go for the least resistance. So they will always choose the easiest way to get in, and then once they’re in, they can do some lack of movement.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Got it. Got it. So biometric authentication is now getting quite a bit of airplay. Does biometric authentication also have security gaps?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Biometrics. Yeah, you can… As a security professional, I would never say anything is the most secure and can never be hacked. So if you look at the password list, where it came from. So the passwords have been in use for since 1960s, and then the OTPs came about in the late ’90s and they were mainstreamed by early two thousands. So those two factors are something you know and something you have. But if you look at the most secure way to do authentication, which is biometrics, and we knew it all along. It’s not that we didn’t do it, so we humans knew it all along that something you are using biometrics is the most secure one. But back then the biometric authentication was only possible in some Tom Cruise movies. But now we have all these smartphones that have the capability to do biometric authentication and also your laptops have the capability. So biometric authentications using the capabilities that we already have, your smartphones, your laptops are becoming the center stage of authentication now, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
The reality is that some of these systems, you mentioned mainframes, these systems are not going passwordless, not anytime in probably our future. So, what does biometric authentication or any of this passwordless authentication have to do with these systems that cannot go passwordless?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Good question. So you are still going to be stuck with some applications that will force you to use passwords to authenticate, and they can never be compatible with any kind of passwordless way to authenticate. But what you can do is, and we are seeing organizations do this, right? So time and again, I’ve been seeing our organizations move from eight character passwords to 12 character passwords, and then increasing the complexity of the passwords.</p>
<p>And then now we are seeing organizations trying to push for a 16 character passwords. I mean, I would argue that it’s humanely impossible for me to remember a password, 16 characters with special characters. But that’s where the organizations are heading because these mainframe applications, for example, they cannot do passwords. So the only way to increase security is make the passwords more complex. But when you do that, what you inherently do is you reduce the user experience, so the users hate it and they are going to forget their passwords more and more. So the password reset becomes a bigger pain. They have already been a big pain.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to make it a bigger and bigger pain as you increase the password complexity. So you need to have a solution that also allows you to reset your password, let’s say for example, in a very easier way, like say from your smartphone, just using biometrics. So don’t ask them for their old password because that’s a pain. And then don’t ask them to pick up a phone and then contact help desk. That’s an even bigger pain. So users should be able to have everything on the tips of their fingers, on their mobile phone, use biometrics, authenticate yourself, change your password to something very secure, use it with these applications that cannot do password. And then for the rest of the applications, you just use your biometrics. You don’t need to touch anything.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Great. Well, that’s really good insight. Appreciate you sharing that. Listen, we have a webinar coming up on January 26th. It’s at 10:00 AM Pacific time, 1:00 PM Eastern. If you’re seeing this after the 26th, they’ll be available for replay on the webinar. But this is going to cover how to deploy passwordless in these complicated environments that you’ve described. I really appreciate you walking through this, Jay. Passwordless sounds easy, but when you start to deploy it, some of the devil’s in the details or God is-</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So thank you very much. Appreciate your time today.</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Thanks for having me on. Thank you.</p>

<p>You know a conference audience is thoroughly enthralled when they skip happy hour to keep chatting to the speaker.</p>



<p>That was Anonyome Labs’ Chief Architect Steve McCown’s experience when he presented at the New Mexico Technology Council’s (NMTC) Experience IT Conference in September. He was the speaker for whom the gathered audience forewent an end-of-day drink (an unlikely scenario at any conference!). And it’s no wonder they did: Steve is an interesting and engaging&nbsp;speaker&nbsp;at the best of times, but at the NMTC event, he was presenting on one of the hottest topics of our time: the new cryptographic identity paradigm known as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/one-thing-experts-always-say-about-decentralized-identity-the-metaverse-and-web3/">decentralized identity</a>.</p>



<p>Steve told the conference audience that&nbsp;data breaches disclosing sensitive medical, financial, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;have become a ‘cost of doing business’ on today’s internet. “Hackers are challenging traditional centralized identity and access management systems and exploiting compromised credentials as a leading initial attack vector. While privacy laws and fines are necessary, they are also post-breach actions made in hopes of spurring security innovation,” he said.</p>



<p>Steve explained that the new cryptographic identity paradigm known as decentralized identity (DI or self-sovereign identity) exchanges centralized architectures for a&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">modern decentralized ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the DI paradigm, identity is established using cryptographically generated decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">DIDs</a>), which can be either private or anchored in online immutable storage (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchains</a>). DIDs enable parties to communicate using an encrypted messaging protocol called&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/securing-private-communications-with-didcomm/">DIDComm</a>, which protects messages independent of any service or transport provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DI also introduces a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VC) capability whereby VCs are issued to DID owners who can assert them to verifiers using privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs, which enable instant verification of authorization, access, and revocation status,” Steve said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve explained the key innovation behind DI is that every connection is a unique cryptographic relationship, which overcomes the problems associated with contemporary credential usage and authentication methods. Along with other advancements, this helps users stop reusing passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While many of today’s attacks exploit compromised credentials, the decentralized identity paradigm protects access and communication through a new application of strong cryptographic methods,” he said.</p>



<p>Steve is just one of Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/12/why-dr-paul-ashley-is-in-demand-on-the-decentralized-identity-speaking-circuit/">executives in strong demand</a>&nbsp;on the speaking circuit discussing decentralized identity and related concepts. Read some of our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/whitepaper-blog/">whitepapers</a>&nbsp;on the topic.</p>



<p>The NMTC Experience IT conference program focused on leading trends; forward-thinking, cutting-edge IT solutions; key consumer insights; and solution roadmaps encompassing the theme of&nbsp;Resilience and Reinvention. A range of experts shared best practices around how these technologies are changing how we do business, the economy, and our lives as a whole.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Long long ago when people used “pay-phones” and listened to the music of our modems connecting to the internet, I was part of a small and curious community. We called ourselves “hackers” and enjoyed learning how this internet thing worked. We took things apart and ran a prank or two; no ransomware for us! Back then, hacking was about learning and exploring. The community was a fascinating place filled with brilliant people. But Fear of the Man meant that people in the community could not trust each other with their real-world identities.</p>

<p>So, how can a community work together and moderate itself without that trust? The answer was simple: we had anonymous identities that we used consistently.</p>

<p>I probably interacted with hundreds of people over that time, but I never knowingly met any of them. We never used our real names; we used aliases. To keep track of each other, each of us used the same alias consistently. Sometimes we’d maintain multiple aliases and have different identities in different places. We’d need to protect against impersonation because our aliases were who we were. A hacker’s alias could be interrogated and hackers could build a reputation. Reputation was earned “on the job,” by being the first to reverse engineering this or the first to gain access to that.</p>
<p>
A solid reputation would get you invited to smaller groups where we discussed more sensitive topics. These smaller circles would have strict rules that could be enforced - add/remove members, for example. Groups would be formed spontaneously, and self-organize. We had a community that was learning, teaching, and most importantly: producing (by our own definition of producing), even while everyone hid their true identity.</p>

<p>There was no secure way to prove ownership of an alias. Some might remember using `/msg nickserv identify`, to claim ownership of an alias on a specific IRC server. There could be many servers claiming to have a hacker called “NullCipher” but they might not all be equal. </p>

<p>Same with email addresses. Is <a href="mailto:bill.gates@yahoo.com">,bill.gates@yahoo.com</a> the same person as <a href="mailto:bill.gates@microsoft.com">,bill.gates@microsoft.com</a>? These identities are not portable and you don’t control them. Still, today, our digital identity is largely bound to an email address on a mail server you might not run, a specific domain over which you have only partial control. If the provider, for whatever reason, ever decides to close your account, it’s game over.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine something better than today’s email/facebook/twitter handle-as-identity and write some requirements: </p>
<p>1/ Decentralization. A user can create and manage their own digital identity without a centralized authority. </p>
<p>2/ User Control, Privacy. A user controls who has access to their digital identity. </p>
<p>3/ Security. A user can prove ownership of the digital identity and use it to authenticate to various services and applications.</p>

<p>This sounds great, right? However, something is missing. If I can create my own digital identity, verify what I created, and share it freely - who is it to say it is true? For example, how can I prove to you that I am indeed Alex who works at YeshID? Currently, the best I can do is send an email from @yeshid.com domain. By you trusting that yeshid.com wasn’t compromised (or spoofed) and is indeed owned by the company, you would trust that an email from me, from an address issued by YeshID the company (alex@), is proof I work at YeshID. It’s not much, but better than nothing. </p>

<p>To achieve this functionality with the digital identity above, we need to add some more requirements: </p>
<p>4/ Issuance &amp; Revocation. An issuer (e.g. YeshID) can issue and revoke credentials to a holder (e.g. Alex). </p>
<p>5/ Verifiability. Upon presentation of the above credential by the holder, the receiver can verify the authenticity (e.g. Alex claiming to work for YeshID, and the receiver can verify it by asking the issuer if that’s true or not)</p>

<p>So, with these requirements, I would be able to receive a digital document from YeshID that verifies I work for YeshID. I have complete control over who I share this information with, and I do not depend on the issuer for doing that - so I have privacy and decentralization. When I try to use it to log into the company bank, for example, the bank can ask the credential issuer - YeshID - if the credential is still valid or not and grant me access or not based on the credential’s validity, and maybe my role, or other parameters it needs. </p>

<p>Does that sound too good to be true? Too futuristic? It’s not! You might have encountered some of this functionality if you ever received and used a digital COVID pass (in the UK, sorry, USA.) The whole solution is built upon <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">,Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DID) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">,Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC), a couple of new standards that have undergone extensive reviews and are being recommended by <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">,W3C</a> - “The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [is] an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.”</p>

<p>In the near future, when you go to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvaystikh/">,LinkedIn profile</a>, you will see a digital credential that proves I work at YeshID. You might even be able to use that link to request more information, such as how to get in touch with me. You might also find that my YeshID persona is linked to another persona called Alex Vaystikh, decoupling the professional persona from the private person, and you will be able to use these documents to ensure you’re talking to the intended person. In the UK, health professionals in the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards/whats-happening-in-identity-and-access-management#digital-wallets-staff-passports:~:text=NHS%20and%20other%20professionals%20should%20be%20able%20to%20own%20and%20control%20their%20verified%20digital%20identity%20and%20proactively%20share%20this%20with%20NHS%20Organisations%20to%20enable%20streamlined%20onboarding%20and%20access%20to%20systems.">,NHS will use VCs</a> to improve onboarding and permission management. In Europe, thanks to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/use+cases">,EBSI</a>, you might see the advantages of verifiable credentials when moving between borders or notarizing documents. And maybe somewhere else entirely, you will find some self-issued digital identity that misses BitchX and talks complete nonsense, anonymously and securely. All of these are powered by DIDs and VCs.</p>

<p>In YeshID, we are leveraging the latest technologies to make identity and access management simple and secure, both for companies, employees, and beyond.</p>

<p>If you’re an admin responsible for the identity, access management, on-and-offboarding employees, compliance, and license provisioning, and you hate how repetitive and time-consuming it is both for you and your team, then email us at “iam” + “@” + yeshid.com, or ping Dana or me by LinkedIn. </p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/humptycalderon/">Humpty Calderon, Head of Community</a> at <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>. I’m from Los Angeles, California. I joined Ontology’s community in April&nbsp;2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied Computer Science with an emphasis on Information Technology. I owned and operated my own IT consultancy for eight years. When I have free time, I love to read, hike, and spend time with my family. I also love to build stuff. I have a wood shop where I build cabinets and shelves for my&nbsp;home.</p> Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I don’t have any pets, but I can’t help but feed a stray cat when given the chance. So I am still quite an animal&nbsp;lover!</p> What would your superpower be? <p>Some say that you’re born knowing everything, so we don’t learn new things, we’re just remembering. If I had a superpower, I’d like to be able to access the full breadth of my memories and create things with that knowledge to help the&nbsp;world.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I connect with Web3 communities, participate in conversations about meaningfully engaging these communities, and I look at how we can develop more robust incentive and governance processes. For Ontology, I onboard community members to become ambassadors for decentralized IDs and data. I also engage with developers to build with the rich DID stack that Ontology has&nbsp;built.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has, in my opinion, developed the most comprehensive decentralized identity ecosystem. ONT ID, OScore, Wing Finance, Orange Protocol, and ONTO Wallet are all incredibly powerful tools for Web3, with huge potential.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I am happy to work with incredibly talented and kind human beings who are about their work and creating a better, more secure future for everybody.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Innovation in decentralized identity is happening on a day-to-day basis at Ontology. This in itself is something very important that I’m excited to be a part of. On a personal level, since starting my podcast, I’ve been able to open doors that were once closed and develop friendships with many Web3 leaders. That has been hugely important for my&nbsp;career.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>Helping to continue onboarding community members and developers to build with Ontology’s DID stack. I think self-sovereign identity and reputation are the next big unlock of&nbsp;Web3.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>What we’re going to see is more people owning their identity and data whilst creating monetization opportunities. Both privacy and self-sovereignty are important to people, so promoting prosperity on a monetization level over the next five years is going to be very important.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-head-of-community-humpty-calderon-547ae851c73">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Head of Community, Humpty Calderon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is your identity? Who or what defines it? </p><p>Who you are is hardly defined by your drivers license or passport. And yet, this is often how we understand ourselves and others. The metrics of our birthdate, ethnicity, eye color, height. The document number linked to a government database. The photo taken on a bad hair day despite our best efforts. </p><p>Not only do these documents reduce our identifiable information to fixed numbers, they don’t hold any information about our communities, relationships, profession, skills, interests, or desires. They also lack the nicknames, in-jokes, and knowledge that comes with those connections. </p><p>I’m not sure I want my in-jokes or hobbies included in my passport, nor do I want to be defined by such a flat description as what is currently included. But identity documents are just a tool for representing ourselves, not who we are. In reality we show up as multiple, fluid identities in different settings: parent, investor, co-worker, friend, activist, and many more. Both how we see ourselves and how others see us matters in these social equations.</p><p>On the internet we also show up as multiple identities. Just think about how many separate email accounts you have and how you might use each for different purposes. I have nine I can count off the top of my head. From personal identities to school and work, to organizations and accounts I share with others. So some of my online identities aren’t even solely ‘me’ — they’re also ‘we’. A single identifier used to represent a group in digital space.</p><p>In some ways, the internet enables this multiplicity, yet it is also data-first. Everything is inherently numbers, quantified metrics that have trouble capturing nuance and flow. There is a risk of identity being reduced to digital markers, detached from the complexity of living humans.</p><p>Without answering “what is identity,” as that seems to be incredibly contextual, I want to explore with you the uses and challenges of digital identity infrastructures while holding in mind the multiple ways we can think about identity.</p> Why is Identity so Hard? <p>Developing a comprehensive identity infrastructure for the internet has proven to be a wicked problem. </p><p>One clue in the above is my nine separate email accounts. I control each of them, but in order to keep those parts of my digital existence separate, I have to keep them as distinct logins without any continuity for me as a user. I don’t need work emails in my personal inbox, nor do I want to sign into social media with the email of my collaborative writing project. </p><blockquote>Developing a comprehensive identity infrastructure for the internet has proven to be a wicked problem. </blockquote><p>There is a tension between secure, authenticated, cross-platform digital identity and compartmentalized, fluid, personas that let us show up as different parts of ourselves in different spaces. Thus attempts to develop a single identity tool that does it all face a lot of issues, from ethics to usability, that come from collapsing multiple personas into a single identity. </p><p>For instance, one issue we can imagine is that my job title might be attached to my digital identity, which makes sense in a professional setting, but which I might not want to forefront in a social setting. Now, even without my digital identity credentials providing you that information, you could google me and learn it for yourself fairly easily, but there is a little bit of friction to that interaction — you have to intentionally seek the information out. This is where the concept of progressive trust comes in. </p><p>Rather than relying solely on cryptographic trust (which is actually about developing “trustless” environments) Christopher Allen suggests <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/progressive-trust.md">Progressive Trust</a> as a model of how trust functions in-person. In different settings I’m going to present different information about myself and slowly reveal more as it becomes relevant to an interaction. This lets me disclose information at a rate that I'm comfortable with, maintaining my privacy, and for you to understand the information because you aren’t overwhelmed with every available fact about me, unable to distinguish what is important and what isn’t. &nbsp;</p><p>Identity infrastructures also raise the issue of control. Who should be able to say who I am? Should my digital identity always tie back to my legal identity? Should my digital identity be controlled by a corporation like Google, as is the case for many people’s email addresses? There are often different answers to these questions depending on the particular use case, but as these infrastructures are developed it’s important to consider who they give power to. In many situations it should be possible for users to self-assert and control their identities. Certainly, users should be able to control what information they make visible, when, and to who. </p><p>Identity infrastructures face a lot of conflicting needs. Some of those conflicts include:</p>  Anonymity and identity authentication are both important in different situations.  We want to provide information, but also seek to control how and when.  We want to compartmentalize our personas, but also want to be able to prove the continuity between them when needed.  <p>There are technical challenges to get identity to work well, but there are also social ones like usability. An identity infrastructure that allows users to manage all of these conflicts themselves risks being unwieldy. Further, we as designers, developers, and builders of all kinds face the challenge of getting down to basics and away from our own preconceptions so as to build composable systems that can hold all of these contradictions together.</p><p>How then to navigate all of these contradictions and do digital identity well? Instead of claiming to have the answers, let’s explore the technical and project landscape, consider some important critiques, and keep learning together.</p> A Brief Recent History of Identity Technology <p>When we log in to a website online we are providing identity credentials. It used to be that each site would hold data about us like our username and password in their databases and thus would be the authority over our identity. This also meant that identity was balkanized, without any continuity between digital spaces. To this day, many websites require unique login details. But a new option has become prevalent. You can sign into many websites via a third party like Apple, Google, or Facebook that acts as the authority on who you are. You gain continuity between digital spaces and the individual sites no longer hold your password — which is good for security but centralizes data into the hands of a few organizations. This is how digital identity works for most today.</p><p>Each of these solutions has approached the tradeoffs inherent to identity infrastructures from different perspectives. And over several decades of incredible work, members of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> and other organizations have continued to evolve this technology, developing capacities to balance the contradictions posed by identity.</p><p>The newest developments in the space, coming from many of the same minds, center around Self-Sovereign Identity, which comes from a desire for persistent credentials that originate from the individual. Much like data sovereignty, this is a claim that instead of external authorities holding our identity information, each one of us should be able to hold and provide all of our identity information.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity: Decentralized, Digital, and Self-Proving <p>Controlling your own identity is technically tricky. You need a unique name, a way to prove that it is your name and not someone else’s, and ways to prove information about yourself. The main standards that have been developed to solve these problems are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials which we’ll explore in a little more detail below. Additionally, I’ll talk a little about how this is playing out in Ethereum. </p><p>There are also situations where you need to not only prove your name, but that it refers to a unique person. This will be discussed in a section about Sybil Resistance. <br></p>Can you define who you are? Or is identity more tied up in defining relationships? <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/D44kHt8Ex14?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) <p>Decentralized Identifiers allow a name (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>) to be authenticated without needing to reference a central authority. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C’s specification</a> (which exists under an open, royalty-free license), describes how the holder of a DID can prove control over that name by providing a document with verification methods for cryptographically authenticating the identity. <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> (who are behind the standards Google and others use for their identity infrastructure), are <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">developing standards</a> with DIDs to allow end-users to self-issue identity credentials to themselves which they’ll be able to use to login across a variety of sites without needing a central authority like Google. </p><p>Now, these identifiers don’t only have to refer to people; they could also refer to groups, datasets, or any other digital object. They also don’t possess, on their own, a way to say what the name refers to; rather, what is important is the ability to independently verify the name itself and that the agent presenting it has a right to it. To say things about a name, we’ll have to use Verifiable Credentials. </p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#trust-model">Verifiable Credentials</a> (again defined by the W3C) are a way for credential holders to prove that a third party has said something about them and to present that information in an authenticatable way without verifiers needing to check it against the issuing party’s databases. </p><p>Take your driver license. It’s tied to your name and has tamper-resistant markings on it verifying that it was issued by the local government. It also asserts other information about you like your date of birth or nationality. At the same time the document contains its own constraints like its expiration date. </p><p>Instead of pointing to a legal name, a Verifiable Credential will point to a DID or other URI. The Verifiable Credential then is filled with all the appropriate information about the particular credential, including who is issuing it. It also includes a proof which allows a verifier looking at the document to confirm that the issuer generated the document without the verifier needing to contact the issuer for confirmation. The owner of the credential also has the ability to present only part of the information in the credential if they desire. For instance, if a verifier is looking to confirm the holder’s age, they can use zero-knowledge proofs to show just the information about their age and the issuer from a driver-license-like document without needing to reveal anything else from that document, enabling minimization of data sharing. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials provide a framework that can be used to say all sorts of different things about an agent, ranging from possession of concert tickets and club memberships to legal identity. Coupled with DIDs, they allow agents to self-assert their name and to carry authenticatable information about themselves without needing to rely on a central authority to hold that information.</p> Soulbound Tokens <p>Ethereum is doing something a little different. Because they already have wallet addresses which serve as URIs, they are operating outside the W3C’s standards to provide identity solutions that operate within their ecosystem. Soulbound Tokens have <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">been proposed</a> as a way to hold credentials and other attestations in a crypto wallet which make them similar to a non-transferable NFT. Like with Verifiable Credentials, issuers can attest any sort of information about an agent, in this case by minting a Soulbound Token directly into the agent’s wallet. &nbsp; </p><p>Binance for instance recently <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-to-launch-binance-account-bound-bab-token-the-first-ever-soulbound-token-on-bnb-chain-0fe1e7c8781844e29f56cb674231dfd7">released an implementation</a> of Soulbound Tokens as an identity credential to their customers who completed KYC. This token effectively ties user’s wallet addresses back to their legal identities through Binance’s KYC databases, making the company the trusted authority for other projects that want to accept that identity credential. </p> Sybil Resistance <p>Fake identities and bots abound on the internet and are often used to disrupt spaces or give individuals undue influence like in a vote. These are known as Sybil attacks and create an issue for identity infrastructures. After all, I shouldn’t be able to use all nine of my email accounts to create fake social media profiles and repeatedly ‘like’ one of my own posts.</p>Distinguishing humans from bots is an increasingly difficult and important task. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/46n7zVCoFHk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a><p>So how do you prove that a particular DID or wallet address refers to a unique individual? Many current digital identity infrastructures tie to legal identity in some way or another depending on the level of security needed. For instance, verifying your phone number on Google or Discord ties that account back to the phone company. For more secure implementations like KYC on exchanges and the like, you have to provide direct confirmation of your legal identity by uploading images of your state issued ID or similar documentation. </p><p>You could theoretically authenticate your legal identity in a similar way under a Self-Sovereign paradigm by getting the phone company or government to give you a Verifiable Credential authenticating your legal identity. There are even government projects working towards this like <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">Ontario’s Digital ID</a>. </p><p>In the web3 space there are also projects attempting to develop alternative methods of sybil resistance that let individuals prove that they are unique human beings without needing to rely on legal identity. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.590171/full">This 2020 paper</a> reviewing approaches to “Proof of Personhood” is a helpful introduction to the space. The methods they use feel more like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party">key signing parties</a> of old, but updated for the modern internet. So instead of getting together in person to check each other’s public keys, they authenticate identity on a peer-to-peer basis via video chat or recorded attestations. The protocols also utilize social graphs or other mechanisms like financial incentives/penalties to help weed out bots and fake accounts. </p><p>Without taking the narrative too deep into the pros and cons of different implementations, I will say that I love the idea of peer-to-peer authentication of identity, but that we are still on rocky terrain that needs to be navigated carefully.</p> Generative Identity: Critiques and Opportunities <p>From this broad overview of Self-Sovereign Identity projects, you can see that the tools for a secure, authenticated, cross-platform digital identity are in development, and while there is ground yet to cover, a lot of promising work has been done in this space. But you’ll also notice that there is little discussion of the other face of the coin. The multiplicity and contextuality of identity and the need for compartmentalized, fluid personas is really missing from the technical developments and conversation around them. And this is where a lot of the following critiques come from. </p><p>Philip Sheldrake has proposed <a href="https://generative-identity.org/">Generative Identity</a> as a framework for thinking about digital identity from a perspective that allows for evolution, change, and fallibility. It builds on Self-Sovereign Identity and makes a call for transdisciplinary work that moves beyond code in order to design from a holistic perspective. The following is largely in reference to his work and is presented here to help us consider how to design identity infrastructures that are better suited to meeting our conflicting needs.</p>Generative Identity asks us to dig into the messy, contextual, and interpersonal. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/9bnJPZdU_pU?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a> A Verb not A Noun <p>One way of thinking about the contradiction of identity is to ask whether it is a noun or a verb. Is identity a thing? Or is it a series of living processes that we enact? And if identity is something we do, then how do we build infrastructures that are representative of that? </p><p>One danger of digital identity is that our multiple identities, which are always shifting as we act them out over time, could be collapsed into a single, definitive document which is used to define “who we are.” Now, this happens some with legal identities, but legal identity is limited to a narrow set of use cases. The diversity of ways that we interact online don’t all require legal identity, and many would be negatively affected by it. Unfortunately a lot of identity projects are developed with a legal conception of identity. After all, “code is law” is a pervasive refrain. &nbsp;</p> Cultural Pitfalls of a Datafied Self <p>Let’s look at an example of how this could play out. </p><p>Imagine that Bob and Alice meet on a dating site. Now, in order to ensure that everyone on the site is a real person and relatively safe, the site requires them to link their Self-Sovereign Identities which have been through a KYC process. If progressive trust tools are in place and everyone has the ability to keep their information private (while sharing certain details with the platform for safety) then the site might function fairly similarly to how dating sites do today. But if those tools aren’t in place, or if there is a culture that doesn’t prioritize them, then we might expect some serious privacy issues. For instance, if Alice is a whale and has her crypto accounts linked to her DID, Bob might have ulterior incentives for asking Alice out. They might also judge each other based on their college degrees, height, genetics, or any other metric that might be attached to their identities via a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>As Sheldrake has <a href="https://generative-identity.org/the-dystopia-of-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/">stated</a>: </p><blockquote>“If you fail to offer up the requisite verifiable claims then you fail to get to ‘trust building’ first base in the SSI century. (Note: this is in fact trust avoidance not trust building.)” </blockquote><p>Part of what is happening here is the decontextualization of information. Shared merely as verifiable facts rather than as rich accounts, we lose sight of the person at the center of these data points. If Bob never finished a college degree, the story of ‘why’ might be really important to who Bob is, but it’s entirely missing from his identity credentials. </p><p><a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-acceptably-non-dystopian-self-sovereign-identity-even-possible/#the-trilemma-of-digital-identity">Molly White</a> warns about the social divides this could accelerate. If our college grades or criminal records are no longer locked up in frustrating bureaucratic processes and are rather tied to our digital identities, they become available as requirements and disqualifiers for access to any number of activities and spaces. &nbsp;</p> Interpersonal Information <p>Part of this loss of context comes from a focus on “personal data.” Most information is in fact interpersonal. Our identities are bound up in the ways that other people identify and experience us. My trust in someone is also solidified much more by the recommendation of a mutual friend then by seeing their legal ID. It’s our relationships who really make us who we are. </p><p>This is a lost opportunity as well. “Big Data” knows that interpersonal information is valuable, thriving off of the overlap in our data trails and looking at the ways we are interconnected. Now, I’m all about data sovereignty, but I also want our shared data to be used in productive ways that help our communities. Data cooperatives, data commons, and other similar projects feel like a positive middle ground between data extraction and private data silos. Similarly, I am wondering how identity might take on similar patterns.</p> The Fable of Rationality <p>Finally, I want to warn against assumptions of rationality. A lot of identity projects are well designed for people who act in their own best interests. But we are all fallible, and it’s not just technical systems we have to navigate but social, legal, and cultural systems as well, each with competing goals and rules. My best interests in a cultural sense might be directly opposed to the actions I need to secure the technical privacy of my digital identity. I might be compelled to give up information or rights I would normally protect fiercely, if it meant I could access valuable cultural or economic opportunities. This is not to disparage the capability of end users but rather to recognize the complexity we all exist within. It’s always wise to design for humans who make mistakes.</p> Complexity: Holochain’s Perspective <p>Learning about this topic, I was reminded of how we at Holochain talk about Mutual Sovereignty. Holochain is designed to protect and enable both the agent and the community. These parties are always bound together in responsibility and agency. Digital identity seems to have a similar dynamic with the tension between identity infrastructures and our multiple lived identities. </p><blockquote>Holochain is designed to protect and enable both the agent and the community. These parties are always bound together in responsibility and agency.</blockquote><p>Rather than a proper conclusion, I want to leave this article with an invitation to think expansively and critically about identity, and to join us as we continue to explore digital identity and how Holochain might factor in. As always, Holochain is committed to holding space for the complexity of these issues and is looking to approach identity with sensitivity and intention. We obviously have strong beliefs about the matter, but I don't want this to be a one-sided conversation led by supposed experts — I want it to be a starting point for discussions which will lead to much richer answers than we could come up with alone. More soon.</p>

 Cooperation enables identity verification of users and signing of documents directly in Microsoft Teams 



<p>Warsaw and Munich, 12 January, 2023 – <a href="https://billennium.com/">Billennium</a>, a global IT solutions provider for businesses, has announced that it is partnering with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe. Thanks to the cooperation, Billennium’s Inperly app allows Microsoft Teams users to check identities and sign documents with qualified electronic signatures, using ID documents from 200+ countries. </p>



<p>Inperly, an application developed by Billennium, supports remote customer service, consulting, and sales processes on Microsoft Teams. Billennium has recently implemented automated identity proofing and e-signatures services from IDnow into its app. The new feature allows the issuing of a one-time qualified signature (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">QES</a>), equivalent to a handwritten signature within the European Union. The feature can be used in most EU countries.</p>



<p>“By integrating Inperly with IDnow solutions, companies and institutions can conveniently, quickly, and securely verify a user’s identity and sign documents with qualified signatures within Microsoft Teams. Our solution helps companies in the digitalization of documentation workflow and prevents fraud attempts. It can be successfully used in government institutions, banks, insurance companies, universities, HR firms and other organizations offering their services remotely,”&nbsp;commented Tomasz Goźliński, Head of Products at Billennium.</p>



<p>“Helping build trust in the digital world is one of our main goals and enabling our partners to create secure and trustworthy relationships is part of our mission. Our all-in-one solution with a qualified electronic signature is paired with remote identity proofing and is compliant with Anti-Money Laundering European Regulation, which ensures secure conversations with Inperly on Microsoft Teams for all parties. Checking or proving who you are is fast and easy, thanks to automated verifications based on AI. This cooperation thus helps to prevent identity theft by biometric checks and electronic signature,”&nbsp;said Bertrand Bouteloup, Vice President of Sales at IDnow.</p>

<p>You didn’t hear it here first, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6935746692759609344/">because LinkedIn</a>, but the folks at <a href="https://aueb.gr/">Athens</a> and <a href="https://www.aalto.fi">Aalto</a> universities were recognized for their “Capabilities-based access control for IoT devices using Verifiable Credentials” paper. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Abstract — Capabilities-based access control is a promising paradigm that can handle the particularities of IoT systems.<br> <br>Nevertheless, existing systems are not interoperable and they have limitations, such as lack of proof of possession, inefficient revocation mechanisms, and reliance on trusted third parties.<br> <br>In this paper we overcome these limitations by designing and implementing a system that leverages Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to encode the access rights. Our solution specifies protocols for requesting and using VCs that can be mapped to OAuth 2.0, includes an efficient and privacy preserving proof of possession mechanism, and it supports revocation. We implement and evaluate our solution and we show that it can be directly used even by constrained devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://wider.team/tag/widerpov/">WiderPoV</a>: The context for this is interesting. </p>



 
 First, we have some very IoT-specific challenges. Like teaching devices which humans to trust. And fitting more complex auth into a device’s tiny footprint.  



 And then you have interop challenges, like helping a cloud service manage diverse device fleets.  



 While Verifiable Credentials can do much more than access control, for many industries, IoT interop and access control seems to be the gateway drug.

  <p>Creating secure applications requires authentication. Delegating all the tedious details of the sign-in process to Okta is the most secure method to authenticate, not to mention speedier for development. So you’ll see us advocating for and using the Okta-hosted sign-in page in our blog posts.</p>

<p>But the default sign-in page can look too different from the personality you have in your application. And the login URL redirects to a domain outside your application, which is also different from what we want. Fortunately, you can add some flair to your Okta-hosted sign-in page, allowing your application’s character to carry through in the user authentication process while maintaining the highest level of security. In other words, winning with the best of both worlds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This post walks you through how to customize your sign-in page using a custom domain and by selecting fun styles using Okta-hosted redirect model. We’ll use a pre-existing e-commerce cupcake site built using an Angular Micro frontend application and customize the sign-in page to be full of mouth-watering cupcakes. 😋</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note
The process outlined in this post is not Angular-dependent, so feel free to substitute the web app with your favorite SPA application.</p>

 Prepare your Okta account and Okta application 
<p>You’ll need an Okta account. If you already have one and an Okta application you want to use for this tutorial, feel free to skip this section. Otherwise, let’s continue!</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Note the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You’ll need those values to configure Okta in the web app.</p>

 Theme the Okta-hosted sign-in page 
<p>Let’s make the sign-in page more enticing by beautifying it with a cupcake or whatever theme sparks joy.</p>

<p>You can make these customizations in the Admin Console through the Okta Dashboard or API calls. We’ll use the Okta Dashboard in this post, but let me know in a comment below if you want to see the API calls’ instructions.</p>

<p>To get to the Okta Dashboard, navigate to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">developer.okta.com</a> and sign in. Notice the sign-in page looks neutral. It will look much more delightful after we apply the customization changes.</p>

<p>Once you’ve authenticated, you’ll see your Okta Dashboard.</p>

<p>Access the Admin Console by pressing the Admin button in the toolbar at the top of the page. You’ll encounter a sign-in challenge, and once you emerge victorious, you’ll be in the Admin Console.</p>

<p>Navigate to Customizations &gt; Branding on the sidebar. Here you can theme your login page. Select your primary and secondary colors used within the sign-in widget. Add a logo, a favicon, and optionally add a background image. Press the Edit button for Okta-hosted Sign-In Page, select your background style and save your changes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My selections are full of colorful, happy cupcakes — a theme that sparks joy for me and matches the personality of my cupcakes e-commerce site.</p>

<p>Sign out of the Okta Dashboard and sign back in to see your new sign-in page in action! My sign-in page makes me smile. 😊</p>

<p></p>

 Customize the sign-in URL with a custom domain 

<p>Next, let’s tackle the sign-in redirect URL to have a domain name that matches our application. Feel free to skip this section to see the themed sign-in page in a web application if you don’t have a custom domain.</p>

<p>In the Admin Console, navigate to Customization &gt; Domain in the sidebar. Press the Edit button to start the customized URL process. Be sure to have access to your Domain Name Registrar so you can make the required modifications. You will also need to allow Okta to manage a TLS certificate or provide your own. In the following steps, we’ll have Okta manage the certificate. Press the Get started button to continue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next screen, add the domain name you want to use for the sign-in URL and select Okta-managed for your certificate. Staying true to my cupcake theme, I have a cupcake-based domain name and added a subdomain for the sign-in URL. Press Next.</p>

<p>The next screen has instructions for you to update the DNS records in your Domain Name Registrar. The instructions to do so depend on your registrar, so you’ll need to follow the instructions your registrar provides. 😅 You’ve got this! 💪</p>

<p>The final step to customize the URL for your domain is configuring your Okta application. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and find the Okta application you’re using in this tutorial. It might be the one you created earlier in the post or already had. Navigate to the Sign On tab. You’ll see a section for OpenID Connect ID Token where you’ll select the URL. Press Edit and choose your URL for the Issuer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The DNS changes may take a few minutes to propagate, so prepare a soothing cup of tea to decompress from that DNS work while you wait. Let’s see how the sign-in page looks in a web app with a matching theme!</p>

 Set up the Angular Micro-frontend site and add Okta 
<p>To reduce the overhead of creating a web app, we’ll use an existing sample cupcake e-commerce app. Grab the pre-built <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/deploy">Angular application from the GitHub repo</a> by running the following commands in your terminal:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch deploy https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Open the project in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>The site already includes the libraries required to authenticate using Okta. You’ll need to configure the app with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code>.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app.module.ts</code>. Find the following code block and replace <code>{yourDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientID}</code> with your Okta application values. If you used a custom domain, the <code>{yourDomain}</code> domain value is the issuer value from the previous step. If you didn’t set up a custom domain, <code>{yourDomain}</code> is the issuer value generated in the output of the Okta CLI.</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{yourDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});
</code>   

<p>Now we can run the site. Start the app by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>This command opens three tabs in your browser. Find the one running at port 4200 with beautiful pictures of cupcakes and try signing in. The Okta-hosted sign-in page looks more themed, and better matches the application! If you set up a custom domain, you’ll see the domain name matches your application too! 🧁</p>

<p>With the EU becoming a major economic player, its rules and regulations are being felt around the business world.</p>
<p>What is GDPR? GDPR is a set of regulations specific to businesses in the EU governed by seven principles to protect individual data rights in a data-driven world.</p>
 What Is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? 
<p>GDPR is the governing data privacy and security standard in the European Union. Unlike many other standards outside of the EU, GDPR emphasizes the rights of individuals over their personal data and attempts to balance these rights against legitimate businesses interested in data collection and processing.</p>
<p>At the heart of GDPR exist several core ideas that inform every requirement. These include:</p>
 
 Data Ownership: Individuals from or inside the EU, known as “data subjects,” own their private data. As such, they have certain rights over that information, including the right to see all information an organization has from them, the right to correct errors in that data, and the right to demand the deletion of that data (the right to be forgotten). 
 Consent: Marketing isn’t a free-for-all in the EU. Any use of data for marketing purposes (collecting email addresses for a mailing list, using cookies to track behaviors, etc.) must come with an explicit consent given by the data subject. 
 Business Limitations: Businesses may only use data pursuant to the reasoning given for collecting that data. That is, businesses must disclose to data subjects the reason for collecting data to receive consent, and they may not process that information outside of that reasoning. 
 EU Locality: GDPR governs businesses and individuals inside and sometimes outside of the EU. Broadly, if a company collects or processes data in the EU, or collects or processes data from EU citizens (regardless of their current location), they must follow GDPR rules. 
 
<p>Thus GDPR is an expansive and rather strict set of laws that fundamentally shape how organizations do business within the EU.</p>
 What Are the Seven Principles of GDPR? 
<p>To expand on these broad ideals, the language of the law within GDPR will align with seven basic principles. These principles cover business operations, IT infrastructure, and interactions with individual data subjects. These principles are defined in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> of GDPR.</p>
<p>The seven core principles of GDPR are:</p>
 
 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: Article 5 of GDPR states that organizations must collect and process data legally and transparently. This means that they cannot break any laws, and their collection and processing operations must be open and transparent to regulating bodies and data subjects. 
 Purpose Limitation: Organizations collecting information from data subjects must gain consent, and part of that consent is that the reasoning for collecting that data is made clear to the individual. Furthermore, the organization may not use that information for other business reasons–all data processing must be explicit, specific, and for legitimate purposes. 
 Data Minimization: Organizations collecting information from data subjects may only gather the minimum data adequate and relevant to the stated purpose. Data retention should continually adhere to the minimum information required to perform the specified processing purpose. This excludes collecting data for future potential business purposes. 
 Accuracy: Organizations must keep data up-to-date as much as possible. Furthermore, any requests from a data subject to change incorrect data must be fulfilled as soon as possible (within 30 days). 
 Storage Limitation: Any data storage must maintain protections such that the exposure of private information is limited to a time frame no longer than necessary for the stated processing and business purposes. Additionally, once those purposes are completed, the organization must delete that information or justify governing GDPR bodies as to why retention is still necessary. 
 Integrity and Confidentiality: All data storage and processing must be done with consideration of appropriate security and privacy measures, including protection against unauthorized disclosure, loss, destruction, or damage to integrity. Privacy measures must include proper encryption, authentication and authorization controls, and privacy practices. 
 Accountability: Organizations must adhere to these principles, including demonstrating compliance. 
 
<p>There are benefits to complying with GDPR, but primarily any data-gathering and processing operations impacting individuals from or in the EU face mandatory compliance.</p>
 
What Happens If I Don’t Meet These Requirements? 
<p>It’s not uncommon for large enterprise organizations to weigh the risks of security breaches against business needs and the costs of non-compliance–including fines and legal expenses. This typically isn’t the case for GDPR, where steep fines are the norm.</p>
<p>The penalties for non-compliance with the seven principles of GDPR include:</p>
 
 Tier 1 (Less Severe Infringements): Organizations that don’t adhere to the lawful basis of processing data, auditing organizations that don’t correctly certify organizations, and other general non-compliance will result in fines up to €10 million or 2% of the organization’s worldwide annual revenue from the previous year, whichever is greater. 
 Tier 2 (More Serious Infringements): Violations of processing or security principles, data subject rights, consent rights, or the transfer of EU data to third countries will result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of the organization’s worldwide annual revenue from the previous year, whichever is greater.

<p>Today we <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/entrust-names-harini-gokul-as-chief-customer-officer">announced</a> that we have named Harini Gokul as our first Chief Customer Officer at Entrust.&nbsp; We wanted to share a bit of why we’re doing this.</p>
<p>Of course, Entrust has always been committed to ensuring customer success. We have been in the business of protecting identity, payments, data, and digital infrastructure for decades. At its core, our business is trust − from helping customers issue credit cards and smart ID cards, encrypting transactions, to ensuring secure network access for employees, consumers and citizens and so much <a href="https://www.entrust.com/identities-payments-data-protection">more</a>.</p>
<p>Now, with digital transformation well under way, organizations are looking to leverage their cloud investments to provide digital-first customer experiences; enable hybrid work, and accelerate operations to drive growth and change. All of this is happening in an environment with increasingly sophisticated threats and a challenging economy.</p>
<p>In this changing environment, we want to structure our teams in a way that best supports the needs of our customers, helping each realize the full potential of the Entrust solution.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>The addition of the CCO role signals our commitment to listen and learn from our customers, effectively identifying and understanding the needs, opportunities, and challenges our customers face, and ensure this input is proactively incorporated in how we design, deploy, and support our solutions and products.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will enable us to unite our teams with a single customer-obsessed vision, driving efforts to evaluate and enhance the customer experience at every touchpoint throughout the customer journey.</p>
<p>Finally, it will allow us to invest in capabilities, skills, and talent to bring the best of the Entrust portfolio to our customers – in a data-driven, scalable, systemic approach that positions our teams to proactively serve the needs of our growing customer base and accelerate their time to value.</p>

 Why AI and the blockchain need each-other to access the physical&nbsp;world <p>AI Oracles super empower Real World Assets on the blockchain — and super empower AI to act in the real&nbsp;world</p> In the (near) future AI Agents will become Non-Human customers for RWA Smart Contract&nbsp;Rails <blockquote>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a breakthrough technology in the past year, particularly in the development of limited AIs designed for specific tasks. These AIs, such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated significant progress in their ability to respond believably to inputs. In order for AI to reach its full potential, it needs to be able to interact with the physical world. Mattereum’s Asset Passports (MAPs) on the blockchain can provide a bridge for AI to interact with physical assets in a trustworthy way, enabling them to identify, buy, sell, track, and move things. The integration of AI and the blockchain has the potential to revolutionize industries and change the way we live and&nbsp;work.*</blockquote><p>It’s not often that you can point to the moment that the future arrives, that there’s been a phase change in reality, that the paradigm has shifted and whole new vistas of possibility have suddenly opened, but this is one of those&nbsp;moments.</p><p>As 2023 dawns, it is clear that the breakout technology of the last year has been artificial intelligence (AI). For all the hype about the Metaverse from certain tech companies, it has struggled to gain popular traction; self-driving cars have shown that they are years away from being reliable enough for popular adoption; nuclear fusion has achieved a <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-contributes-to-a-breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-energy/">crucial milestone</a>, but is a long way from practical rollout. The blockchain has gone through its frenzied bubble phase and is now undergoing its “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">Great Disinfection</a>” before finding its mature role. The blockchain’s time will come, and then it will be massive; but for the moment it’s getting purged of criminals, scams and gimmicks before being repurposed to become the world’s operating system for the future. but AI has really broken out of the pack, and it has broken&nbsp;big.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">CRYPTO AND THEORIES OF VALUE</a></p><blockquote>AIs are astoundingly better at responding believably to inputs than anything seen&nbsp;before</blockquote><p>We’re not talking about general AI, the William Gibson/ Iain M Banks sentient human-plus intelligences (yet), although Google software engineer Blake Lemoine did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/23/google-fires-software-engineer-who-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient">cause a stir</a> back in July by claiming the chatbot he was working on had achieved sentience, swiftly followed by Google firing him. It’s the more limited AIs, developed to carry out specific tasks, that have made the impact. Things like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT </a>are astoundingly better at responding believably to inputs than anything seen before, and the improvement in image generators like <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/">Craiyon</a> and <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> has been perceptible, even since the first ones went public last&nbsp;spring.</p><p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue</a></p><p>This is clearly just the start of something special — AIs are going to be doing a lot more than chatting and drawing pictures. They’re evolving fast too; when I started drafting this just before Christmas I wrote a sentence here speculating about the potential for integrating AI and search engines, and before I finished editing it, in early January, Microsoft <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-aims-ai-powered-version-bing-information-2023-01-04/">announced </a>they are adding ChatGPT functionality to Bing. Initially it’s not going to take us to completely new areas, AI is going to help people achieve their current goals more efficiently, but even that will be revolutionary. The things were roughly performing at the level of a primary school child just a year or two back; more recently, an average 12 year old; now more like a college student — there are already think pieces being written about the <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2022/12/10/23501933/does-ai-mean-the-death-of-the-college-essay">death of the college essay</a> because AIs can now write a plausible one at undergraduate level, they’ll even provide the citations.</p><blockquote>AI needs to have ways of interacting with the physical&nbsp;world</blockquote> With Mattereum, AIs can buy/sell physical things in the real&nbsp;world <p>All these uses for AI have been in the digital realm, but for AI to achieve its full potential it needs to have ways of interacting with the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sure, they could operate physical devices — waldoes, self-driving vehicles, robot bodies etc, but their reach could be far greater than those would allow, and <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP)</a> on the blockchain can give them the API to make this possible, providing the bridge to the physical world they need to make things happen. This is how the blockchain becomes the world’s operating system. To buy, sell, track and move things AI needs to identify them and be sure they are what they claim to be. MAPs provide the trustable information about physical objects, connected to warranties that are legally enforceable in 170 countries that would enable an AI to be certain that they are really dealing with a particular physical asset. With the MAPs connected to a trustable NFT on the blockchain, the AI can use these NFTs to interact with the assets in the physical world safe in the knowledge that they are actually attached to something real that will be bought, sold, tracked or moved. You can imagine AIs instructed to only use MAPs to define objects, then searching the blockchain for the ones they need and working with those. MAPs enable AI to see and grasp the real&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passports</a></p><blockquote>There are ways that Mattereum can use AI to be more effective as a&nbsp;company</blockquote><p>That’s where Mattereum can contribute to the big picture in the future; in the shorter term there are ways that Mattereum can use AI to be more effective as a company too. It’s really too early to be able to see all the opportunities that may exist for AIs at Mattereum, but it is clear that they will make a profound impact. I can make a stab at where things are likely to go though, and for certain this is an area we’ll be paying close attention to as we go forward. There are six use cases I can come up with now, and this is just the beginning — I am sure we’ll identify more as the technology evolves and Mattereum grows.</p> 1) NeoSwap <p>We have already taken steps to incorporate AI into what Mattereum does; our <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/11/24/announcing-neoswap-x-mattereum-partnership/">new partnership with NeoSwap</a> is the first step in that direction. <a href="https://neoswap.ai/">Neoswap</a> is an AI-powered framework for web3 commerce that finds optimal multiway trades that redistribute assets and currency in a win-win-win manner. Combining their marketplace with NFTs backed by MAPs opens the way to a phase shift in the way items are traded that completely aligns with Mattereum’s work to bring physical assets on-chain. NeoSwap uses AI to figure out, of all the near-infinite number of possible trades, which trades are most likely to be beneficial to both parties and therefore accepted (among other optimisations). In the limit, if lots and lots of goods were in the Mattereum/NeoSwap ecosystem, it could produce a sort of “magical river” where you just give away what you don’t want any more and things which surprise and delight you just turn up in your life: minimal environmental impact, and near-zero cost!</p> 2 ) AI Certifiers <p>I have, let us say, an AI certifier that does comic books, and my AI certifier is very, very simple; you show it the cover of the comic book, and it goes away and it comes back with comprehensive publication history for your comic — published on this day by the following people, these folks worked on the cover, these people worked on the story, this is the illustrator, the inker, this is how many were published, this is the price history and so on. I take all of the information out of the databases that I have using the AI and I sell it to you in the form of a warranty. Right? Very, very, very low risk. As long as my AI recognizer is good. I’m just giving you information that already&nbsp;exists.</p> 3) Wear&nbsp;Analyzer <p>I give the AI a picture of a handbag and it comes back and says, “mint condition, almost new condition, slightly battered, really battered, distressed and finally “Oh my god, what have you done to that thing?”. Now, that’s a little trickier because this is a judgement call and you could have somebody that disagrees and then you’ve got to have some human coming in to give a judgement about whether the AI is doing a good enough job of this or not. So, categorical identification of a thing. The first activity is an assessment about a thing based on available data, now this second activity is very, very, very, very, very fiddly, but it’s the kind of fiddly the AI is actually pretty good at. If I show it a training dataset of 50 handbags, and tell it “these ones are less worn, these ones are very worn” the AI will be able to generalise what it’s looking at. But once in a while I will show it a handbag which is intentionally distressed, but is in mint condition and the AI will say that this handbag is horribly beaten and damaged, so it’s essentially worthless. At that point we will have a problem, but that is what the warranties are for. If it’s wrong, the buyer or seller claims against the warranty and gets their money back, and the AI will learn that this particular kind of handbag is mint when it looks like most other ones do when they’ve been run over by a truck and buried for three&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>These last two functions are both AI recognizers and are basically very much like the systems that will ultimately offer you a bid on car insurance, or health insurance. They’re looking at the available data, they’re making an estimate of what something is. Some of those estimates are nice and objective and clear and clean and easy, others are very, very, very subjective and there’s a strong risk of humans coming in overturning them. The next three opportunities are more sophisticated.</p> 4) Clustering <p>This is the holistic formation of story through material objects. So I have an AI and it knows of my clothes and knows my size and when it sees something which is in my style and made in size hippo, then it just goes out there and automatically searches for things with the appropriate info in their MAPs and tells me that what I want exists and maybe even gives me multiple options for it because I’m not sure on exactly what I want. It can then even show me multiple things simultaneously — “Okay, hey, Vinay, how would you like a Penguin costume? I got a monocle. I got a top hat. I got a karate thing. I got a cane with a spike in the bottom of it and I have these really wicked white wingtip shoes all in your size and you already have the black pants and the waistcoat” and I go, “yeah, I’d quite like a Penguin costume — buy!”</p><p>Perhaps a more common use for it would be interior design; I say I want an Art Deco furniture set for my living room, I say “hey, here’s my room, get me Art Deco furniture that will fit”. It goes off, looks at the asset passports of furniture for sale and comes back with furniture set one, furniture set two, furniture set three at 350 grand, 75 grand and 175 grand and I can choose which one I like and it buys them for me. This can work in the short term too. You rent an Airbnb, unfurnished. The AI uses Mattereum asset passports to find 12 sets of potential furnishing options you can have installed for it. You pick one and it goes out and buys all that and fits them into the place. You stay for three months. At the end you leave and the AI resells all the furniture.</p><blockquote>AI provides the ability to customise the experience of&nbsp;space</blockquote><p>AI provides the ability to customise the experience of space, the AI knows what the style of furniture you choose looks like, it knows how big the place is, it knows what furniture is available, it understands what price is good, and what it does is it creates experiences for me. I know I’m getting actual Art Deco furniture and the price is good because it’s all warrantied in the MAPs so there’s no need for me to scrutinise the details, check out the individual seller’s reputations and all those kinds of things you’d have to do now. The combination of AI and MAPs makes the whole transaction fast, safe and trustworthy. Now imagine wedding planning; so you’ve just a big empty building and warehouses of furniture and people figure out what they want and it just finds stuff and arranges everything and off you&nbsp;go.</p><p>What AI is doing is synthesising multiple different streams of goods into a holistic whole, which has more value than the individual components. It could do this using the NeoSwap ecosystem now, just using seller info, but adding the MAP to the mix just makes everything more trustworthy and means it could also use regular auctions, it could use street purchases, anywhere something with a MAP is being&nbsp;sold.</p> 5) Prediction <p>This is where the AI buys stuff just as you need it, sells it when you don’t by learning and anticipating your use patterns for various things, This might be the same thing multiple times, so it buys you a bike in the spring and sells it in the autumn every year; it knows you pressure wash the car on every third Sunday of the month, so buys you a washer on the Friday and sells it on the Monday, removing the need for you to have the thing cluttering the garage in the meantime. There’s a small cost differential perhaps, but it’s the convenience cost of always having what you need when you need it and not having piles of stuff hanging around until the day you finally need it. It uses the MAP to find and verify things, and by circulating things between people when they need them removes the need for everyone to have one of everything just hanging around for the day when we need it — this reduces waste and makes the spiral economy&nbsp;viable.</p><p>This would be really effective for travel. I’m going on holiday to Ibiza and in my hotel room, when I arrive, is everything I need, given that the AI knows what kind of person I am and I’ve got an express list of preferences for the things that need to be there. I buy my ticket weeks in advance. The AI organises it and comes back and says “I’ve been unable to find white platform shoes in your size. You’re going to have to bring those yourself. I got you a couple of special bonus items too”, and they’ll be things you like because it recognises your taste and can extrapolate. So the work of having to look through the space of all possible objects to select what I want is no longer necessary, and I won’t have to cart everything and fret about airline baggage allowances.</p><blockquote>This is where AI has become a synthetic engine that can reshape physical&nbsp;reality</blockquote><p>This is the mega payoff because this is where AI has become a synthetic engine that can reshape physical reality in the same way it filters and reshapes images. Today the super-rich are the only people who can do this, they say they want something and point a hose of money at it until it happens; how much is not important because they no longer think in terms of value for money; they work on the metric of want=get and money simply lubricates that process beneath their level of attention. With AI suddenly that becomes everyone’s experience because it does all that work in the middle for you, which billionaires have gophers to do. It makes it a whole lot cheaper too, and can work within the financial parameters you&nbsp;have.</p> 6) Modelling <p>This works by the AI knowing all the new and second hand goods which are available in an area and using the information to identify a gap. In New York, there’s a roaring market for this object. The object is not currently for sale in London. The AI then proposes moving a bunch of this thing from New York to London to sell it here, or suggests you commission it to be manufactured in Bradford and sold. It can work out that if a whole bunch of fashionable teens in Nigeria like this thing, then there’s probably a bunch in London and Beijing who will too. AI can do market gap analysis based on patterns that it can perceive in culture, or based on a whole bunch of people saying they want to buy something that isn’t in the market yet. In that case I make a MAP for a thing that I wish existed, I publish it as specification and say “if this existed I would buy it”; get enough people who want that and it prompts manufacturers to make something that fits the MAP and sell it to the people who want it. Everything comes with MAPs so it is warrantied and can be tracked and this helps it to keep its value, so when the fad is over, it can still be sold on at a good&nbsp;price.</p><blockquote>There’s going to be more, much&nbsp;more</blockquote> Mattereum Provides a Marketplace for AI&nbsp;Services <p>So, this is just what I can see extrapolating from what we know about AI now; there’s going to be more, much more, but we’re going to have our hands full bringing all this to life. We’re just at the start; some AI stuff will no doubt be done within Mattereum itself, but most of it will be done by partners, like we are doing with&nbsp;NeoSwap.</p><p>What Mattereum provides structurally is a marketplace where <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p9CSjcCoLqFptogjW/ai-oracles-on-blockchain-1">companies that have AI technology can monetise it</a> by attaching it into transactions as a certifier. Imagine a bunch of kids in college; they’ve come up with some fantastically sophisticated recogniser technology. I apply it inside of the Mattereum system and we use it for something like clothing sizing. You show me a bunch of pictures of a piece of clothing with a ruler somewhere in the shot and I’ll tell you exactly what size this thing is. Rather than having to measure a piece of clothing, I download the app then just slap a ruler on a table, take three or four pictures, I upload them, and it comes back with sizing information for the clothing, and it automatically generates size warranties for every garment that goes by. They could just run that as a business because it’s far more economically efficient for customers to just lay all the clothes out and take pictures of them rather than having to pick up the garment and measure every sizing dimension.</p><blockquote>Mattereum provides a marketplace where companies that have AI technology can monetise&nbsp;it</blockquote><p>The market provides the AI creators with a way of monetizing their product because they can now take a margin on the transactions of the goods to which they’re attaching AI generated information. Without that, they wouldn’t have a market because they would have to then generate an entire ecology around their AI to be able to get access to a transaction stream, but Mattereum provides them with a ready-made market where they can very, very rapidly monetize their AI work simply by plugging it into an existing transaction stream. They’ll need to raise some capital so that they’ve got a pool of money to back the AI with when it occasionally makes a mistake and they have to pay out on certification. They need to have the funds, but if they’re good, what they’re getting is a continuous revenue stream from de-risking other people’s transactions, and they don’t need very much capital because they will want to be super reliable.</p><blockquote>There’s a whole fascinating AI ecosystem out there waiting to&nbsp;happen</blockquote><p>There’s a whole fascinating AI ecosystem out there waiting to happen, and Mattereum has the potential to form its core by using the blockchain to drive innovation through real world asset NFTs that come with Mattereum Asset Passports. The future really is here, and we aim to be part of making it more evenly distributed.</p><p>*introductory summary created by GPT3&nbsp;AI</p><p>If you are working on an AI project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via contact@mattereum.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">AI Oracles super empower Real World Assets on the blockchain — and super empower AI to act in the…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">Gambling</a> has been a hotly contested topic for many years in Germany, which begs the question: Is online gambling regulated in Germany? Yes, it is indeed as of July 2021.</p>



<p>That year saw the new German Interstate Treaty on Gambling (ISTG) or Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">GlüStV 2021</a>) come into effect, which legalizes and regulates online gambling in Germany across all 16 states.</p>



<p>The ISTG was originally established in 2012 in response to the growing popularity of online gambling, but failed to get all states on board and thus neither banned nor legalized it. That left the German market in limbo, attracted international operators, and drew consumers to a black market. The new treaty of 2021, however, legalized various forms of gambling online in Germany and set out strict regulations for gambling operators, including a ban on certain games, deposit limits, an advertising ban as well as mandatory ID-checks.</p>



<p>A newly established authority – Gemeinsame Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/en/">GGL</a>) – oversees the market and issues licenses to operators which are valid for five years. This regulatory body is based in Halle (Saale) in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.</p>



 Controversy surrounding gambling restrictions. 



<p>While the treaty has been controversial amongst operators and players, with some critics arguing that it unfairly restricts the rights of German citizens to gamble online, its main objective is to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">protect players, promote responsible gaming and prevent problem gambling</a>.</p>



<p>These are the restrictions applicable to players while gambling in Germany:</p>



  €1,000 monthly deposit limit  €1 stake limit on online casino slots  No Live Casino Games or progressive Jackpot-Slots are permitted  Reduced sports betting opportunities as live betting is not allowed  



 Different types of gambling and their regulation. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">Online gambling</a> can be categorized in online casino games, sportsbooks and sports betting as well as lottery games. Each has its own legislation that operators need to be aware of, and each requires a separate license.</p>



 Online Casinos in Germany 



<p>In 2021 <a href="https://www.statista.com/study/46614/gambling-and-betting-in-germany/">regulated online casinos yielded returns of €6.4 billion in Germany</a>. Combine this with the revenue of the still thriving yet unregulated black market, and the significance of the online gambling market cannot go unnoticed.</p>



<p>The Interstate Treaty distinguishes between online casino games such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and virtual slot games. Each federal state can decide whether to issue limited licenses to operators or impose a state monopoly to offer casino games. This means certain states could restrict providers from offering roulette, blackjack or baccarat.</p>



<p>Gambling operators wishing to offer online poker games can apply for a separate license through the GGL. The process to obtain a sports betting, virtual slot game or poker license is very similar and has only minor differences.</p>



 Sportsbooks &amp; Sports betting 



<p>Sports betting continues to grow in Germany. For example, <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1211874/umfrage/umsatzentwicklung-auf-dem-markt-fuer-sportwetten-in-deutschland/">2016 saw €6.14 Billion in revenue, which grew to €9.28 Billion in 2019</a>. The drop to €7.79 Billion in the following year was due to reduced sporting activity in the midst of the Covid-19 -pandemic. Yet, the numbers remain high and are growing year after year thanks to easier access to sports betting, for example through mobile betting sites and a versatile offering that also includes esports and virtual sports.</p>



<p>Sportsbooks are by no means a new feature in cities all around the country, though. <a href="https://www.tipico-group.com/en/">Tipico</a> opened over 1,300 franchises in Germany and Austria since its formation in 2004 and was able to move parts of its business online after <a href="https://www.tipico-group.com/en/tipico-receives-license-for-sports-betting/">obtaining a sports betting license in 2020</a>. Other big players have long been established through extensive sponsorships of professional football clubs and other sports teams.</p>



 Lottery 



<p>Lotteries have a long history in Germany, as the state lottery is very popular. States also have their own local lotteries. Private operators can act as brokers for state lottery products. Should they operate in multiple states, the gambling regulator of Rhineland-Palatine is responsible for licensing until January 2023, when the newly established GGL takes over. Bingo products fall under lotteries, too, and can be offered online.</p>

 How does the online gambling regulation affect players? 



<p>The German government has put a number of measures in place to ensure that online gambling is safe and fair for all involved. Protection of players is most important, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">prevention of underage gambling</a>. Therefore, consumers can feel safe and secure when playing.</p>



<p>Thanks to the new gambling treaty, all online casinos operating in the country are required to obtain a license which ensures that the internet gambling site meets certain security standards and implements the many restrictions that other international licensors don’t require. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority (MGA)</a> – the most popular licensor within the EU – requires no deposit or stake limits but has strict Anti-money-laundering regulations and prohibits minors from accessing real-money gambling products. This is just one example of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">how gambling regulations differ from country to country</a>.</p>



<p>Players must be aware, that they cannot deposit more than €1,000 per month and that stakes on slots are limited to € per spin. A centralized database will collect player information such as name, date of birth, address and the amount deposited. There is also an option to pause or block access to online gambling sites, should one wish to. Measures such as these are meant to promote responsible gaming and avoid gambling addiction.</p>

 How are operators affected by the ISTG? 



<p>Looking at the various restrictions of the gambling treaty, operators must be aware of the impact the Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (ISTG) may have on their business. The following should be taken into consideration:</p>



 Deposit limits 



<p>Players are not allowed to deposit more than 1,000 Euros each month across all licensed operators. This means there is a relatively low cap on potential earnings. Operators must stand out and be attractive to numerous players to be profitable.</p>



 Stake limits 



<p>Stakes are limited to €1 per spin on slots. In addition to a 5-second wait for each spin, another revenue stream for operators is restricted. Offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">the best user experience is therefore key</a>.</p>



 Games restrictions 



<p>What players may find at unlicensed casinos and sports betting sites is not necessarily available in Germany. Namely, live casino games, progressive jackpots and live bets are all prohibited according to the new treaty.</p>



 Taxes 



<p>In addition to revenue caps, there are also taxes to be paid. 5.3% stake tax applies to every euro wagered. In order to remain competitive and profitable, many operators chose to lower the return-to-player on certain games.</p>



 Advertising 



<p>Advertising is restricted. Influencer marketing for virtual slots is prohibited. Furthermore, it is not allowed to broadcast any ads promoting virtual slots, online poker and casino games between 6:00 and 21:00 on TV, radio and other medium. Most importantly, ads must not be targeted at minors or other vulnerable groups and cannot feature them in any form.</p>



 ID verification 



<p>One of the most consequential new regulations is player verification. Upon registration, players must verify their identity which seeks to prevent underage and fraudulent gambling. Operators must choose an approved ID-verification service provider and implement a seamless and simple process to keep players engaged. A tedious process leads to users abandoning the verification step and moving to another provider. IDnow is one such approved service provider that assists operators with a world-class player verification experience powered by AI.</p>

 Preventing underage gambling. 



<p>The protection of minors in a landscape such as the online gambling world is a vital task that the new Interstate treaty is addressing head-on. Whereas players at MGA-licensed sites only need to verify their identity when withdrawing winnings, German online casinos require this verification upfront to prevent underage gambling.</p>



<p>In order to obtain a license from the GGL, online casinos must meet a number of requirements. These include ensuring that they have appropriate security measures in place to protect player data, having their games independently tested for fairness, and complying with strict anti-money laundering regulations. They must prove that no minors have access to real-money casino games.</p>

 Remaining EU-compliant with AutoIdent from IDnow. 



<p>Having to verify players’ details upon registration in the online gambling sector before any deposit has been made can make or break an operator. If you fail to keep players engaged and struggle to provide a seamless, compliant and easy-to-use verification process, you lose revenue.</p>



<p>IDnow tackles this issue with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>. Thanks to the power of AI, our tool can accommodate a large number of verifications simultaneously while checking users biometric data and adhering to the strictest regulatory requirements. This remote KYC method has been approved by the Commission for Youth Media Protection (Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz – <a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/en/">KJM</a>) and is available in over 30 languages and compliant with 195 jurisdictions globally.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Passwordless authentication has become a trending topic in IT over the past two years. This comes to no surprise, with all the password-related security incidents that happened in the past years. Passwords are known as a security risks, and passwords are inconvenient to the users. Passwordless authentication bears the promise of increasing security and reducing friction. Done right, this is true. Passwordless authentication can overcome the notion of “balancing security with convenience”, which factually says that convenience goes down when the level of security increases, to a win-win approach: Security increases, while convenience improves as well.</p>
 What is passwordless authentication? 
<p>It seems to be very clear what passwordless authentication means. But the fact that some vendors claim being “truly passwordless” already indicates that there are different flavors of passwordless authentication. At the end, it is a matter of definition what is perceived as being passwordless authentication, and what not.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the user, every approach for authentication where no password is needed is passwordless. But there are solutions such as traditional Enterprise SSO where a user could use a passwordless authentication to a password vault, from where the password then is sent to an application. The same happens in privileged SSO of PAM solutions, where administrators authenticate to a console and can start session with passwords being sent in the background. These types of solutions are not in the scope of passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>There are two elements that are required for passwordless authentication</p>
 
 No password is required for user authentication (but a strong authentication is performed) 
 No password (or password hash) is travelling over the network 
 
<p>Sometimes, there is a password used for authentication, but no password is travelling over the network (more frequently, a password travels anyway for initial authentication to a server). That does not qualify for being named a passwordless authentication solution.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication means that there is a strong MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), commonly 2FA( Two Factor Authentication) happening, and no password is travelling. “Truly passwordless” then means that there is no password needed neither for initial setup nor as a fallback solution. KuppingerCole Analysts uses the more generic definition, based on the two above-listed elements.&nbsp;</p>
 Is passwordless authentication safe? 
<p>When authentication becomes more convenient, this triggers the question of whether this is sufficiently secure. Passwordless authentication, by definition, must be about a strong authentication. This, by definition, means that there must be more than one factor.</p>
<p>The common factors involved in passwordless authentication are a smartphone and the user’s biometric. In the setup a binding between the device and the user takes place, where cryptographic information that is used for the authentication is placed in a secure element – a piece of hardware that securely holds encrypted information. Modern devices such as computers and smartphones come with such secure elements.</p>
<p>This binds the user to the device. With biometric authentication enabled at the device, such as fingerprint readers or face recognition via the camera, the user can authenticate without a password, while the device binding provides a second factor. Only if it is the specific user with a device associated to him or her, the authentication is valid.</p>
<p>There are other options such as FIDO2 tokens or smartcards that can be used for passwordless authentication. We also observe an uptake of wearables such as wristbands and smart watches, where biometric authentication even becomes continuous by for instance tracking the heartbeat.</p>
<p>Done right, passwordless authentication provides a strong level of security. Saying that it is safe anyway is problematic, given that there is no 100% security. But passwordless authentication commonly provides a significant higher level of security than traditional username/password authentication and even than many of the established 2FA approaches.</p>
 What should be considered when choosing passwordless authentication solutions? 
<p>There are two main groups of passwordless authentication solutions. One are the ones that are integrated into Access Management solutions such as the ones from Microsoft (Entra Azure AD), Okta, Ping, OneLogin or one of the many other vendors in this segment. Then there are the specialized solutions, provided for instance by Beyond Identity, HYPR or 1Kosmos, to name just a few.</p>
<p>An important differentiator is that integrated solutions serve every authentication to the Access Management solution and thus to the services that are integrated with that solution. In contrast, specialized passwordless authentication solutions are focused on either specific use cases such as customer/consumer authentication, or at serving a broader variety of use cases, starting with integrated desktop authentication and a common passwordless authentication approach across multiple Access Management solutions.</p>
<p>Integrated solutions are easy to implement and come with products that might already be in place, but are, in tendency, more limited in scope.</p>
<p>That scope is one of the important differentiators. Another one is the breadth of supported authenticators. The more flexible that is addressed, the more use cases within the organization can be served. Also important are the account recovery capabilities, which define how lost, stolen or just new devices are treated in efficient processes.</p>
<p>A comprehensive overview about passwordless authentication solutions and the criteria to consider when picking a solutions is provided by the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81215/passwordless-authentication">KuppingerCole Leadership Compass on passwordless authentication</a>.</p>
 When will passwords finally die? 
<p>“The password is dead” is a saying that exists for way over a decade. Unfortunately, passwords are still ubiquitous. They will not quickly disappear. A lot of websites for customers and consumers still only provide username and passwords for authentication. However, there is a trend towards utilizing passwordless authentication, and there is a significant uptake in adoption in enterprises. But with all the legacy applications and services in place that still expect passwords, instead of supporting federation protocols such as OIDC and OAuth2 or even direct passwordless authentication with the FIDO Alliance WebAuthn protocol, we will be able to reduce passwords. Like the mainframe exists still, passwords will be here at least for decades. We will need (way) less of them, and we are able to hide them. Most will be based on passwordless authentication approaches in the future. But somewhere, there will still be passwords around.</p>

				  Indicio will upgrade Hyperledger Indy’s SDK thanks to a Code With Us challenge; plus the first ever Bifold Summit.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>2023 has started with a bang in the Hyperledger identity community as the open-source Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries projects are the focus of new development goals sponsored by the government of British Columbia in Canada.</p>
<p>BC Gov is one of the leading developers of open-source decentralized identity technology, and one of the tools it uses to do this quickly and effectively is through its <a href="https://marketplace.digital.gov.bc.ca/opportunities/code-with-us/5992f66c-b2ac-4b2a-a3a3-3eb3473e9eca">“Code With Us”</a> challenge, a procurement mechanism for public sector organizations to pay developers to code.</p>
<p>Thanks to winning one of the latest challenges, Indicio will upgrade the Hyperledger Indy SDK in all Hyperledger Indy and Aries software. This includes updating all BC Gov Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) installations still using the Indy SDK to use Aries Askar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aries Askar is an open-source project in the Hyperledger Foundation providing secure storage and cryptographic operations for Aries agent wallets. It is written in the Rust programming language and allows the creation and deletion of wallets, cryptographic key management, and generic record management. Aries Askar’s wallet implementation assists in various decentralized identity interactions such as establishing connections, DIDComm messaging, and receiving and presenting credentials. To enable all this, Indicio will create a Python script that uses an Aries Askar feature to migrate ACA-Py Indy SDK format storage data into Aries Askar format.</p>
<p>If you aren’t currently working with Indy SDK or Aries Askar, you might be wondering what this all means. For developers currently working in the space, this is very exciting news and something that will make it easier to update their projects to the next generation of open-source identity tools, functions, libraries, and repositories. This work is a milestone in the evolution of Indy and Aries to make room for further enhancements and project developments in 2023.</p>
<p>“BC Gov’s Code With Us challenge is a model for driving public sector digital transformation,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we’re deeply committed to advancing open-source decentralized identity technologies and initiatives like this really move the needle in ways that benefit everyone.We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—especially as several of Indicio’s developers have already been developing and contributing to these particular efforts even before the challenge was announced.”</p>
<p>BC Gov also selected another company for the Code With Us Challenge project to <a href="https://marketplace.digital.gov.bc.ca/opportunities/code-with-us/7febdc1a-5ae9-4c23-b022-60ee0db5db30">Implement a version of the Indy CLI based on the Hyperledger Indy / Aries Shared Components.</a> And because Indicio was also working on efforts related to this challenge, we were able to also contribute portions of our work to the team that was tasked with this project as well.</p>
<p>The Bifold Summit</p>
<p>Indicio is also involved in another open-source project, the first ever <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Bifold+Summit+2023">Bifold Summit</a>, which is focused on developing a digital wallet for using verifiable credentials. Indicio contributed the <a href="https://indicio.tech/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">initial Bifold code</a> to Hyperledger Aries after <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-is-a-finalist-for-dhs-digital-wallets-user-interface-challenge/">Indicio’s own wallet was named a finalist</a> in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface for Digital Wallets Challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By donating the user interface (UI) to Aries, other developers would have access to a baseline to develop on. Now, with over a dozen organizations and individual developers helping to grow the project, Bifold is one of the most exciting projects at Hyperledger, garnering attention from a wide range of stakeholders from across the blockchain community.</p>

<p>Functionland is a decentralized cloud alternative that puts data back in users' hands with personal servers, and profits back in developers' hands through blockchain protocols.</p> Getting Rid of the Data Middleman <p>Users today know that if they use a centralized server, there is a good chance that their data is being used to develop and sell them products. Decentralized apps put private data back in users' control, and decentralized storage solutions utilize a network of nodes to keep files accessible (both on and offline) to users. But what if you want to store your personal files yourself and for free? No middleman - just you and your own personal server?</p><p>This was the impetus for FxBlox, a storage device that is powered by open source, and built on top of Functionland's Fula Protocol (more on this in a moment). </p>FxBlox was designed by industrial designer Yves Béhar.<p>FxBlox is modular, meaning you can choose how much storage is right for you. Usually cloud storage providers offer either too little or too much storage, making it difficult for developers and users to find a solution that meets their needs. With FxBlox you can have anywhere from 1TB to tens of TB of storage capacity in one unit. </p><p>You start with a base tower - the Fula tower for the FxBlox. It includes three USB-C ports and can connect to external devices. Then you add on individual towers for more storage capacity or other features like a hub tower as a docking station. </p><p>Users engage with the Fula Network as both resource consumers and resource providers when they own an FxBlox. Owning an FxBlox is not required to access services on the network, but users will have to pay fees to FxBlox owners if they don't have one operating in the network. This incentivizes users to participate in the network so they can break free from storage subscriptions and "end the rental web", as Functionland says.</p> Fula Protocol <p>The Fula Protocol enables consumers to replace their central cloud providers with a decentralized alternative built on the IPFS ecosystem by leveraging three sub-protocols: File, Graph, and AI. Each enables users to securely receive and provide resources on the Fula Network. </p><p>Importantly, there is an abstraction layer attached to each sub-protocol. This is the final piece in the puzzle for app developers. With the Fula Network handling the back end/server and the FxBlox handling file storage, all you need is to know how to write front end code!</p><p>Functionland is currently integrating Fission's WNFS into the Fula Protocol to empower developers with a ready-to-go decentralized and encrypted file system. They created <a href="https://github.com/functionland/react-native-wnfs">a bridge for rs-wnfs</a> to enable mobile developers to use it in React Native.</p><p>WNFS is used on the client side and data is backed up on a network of connected backend devices with Graphsync and libp2p. Backups can exist on a trustless network since only the user has the keys to decrypt the files. So even when part of the network goes offline, the user can still access their data from the backups. </p><p>Ehsan, Co-Founder of Functionland, had this to say about why they chose to utilize WNFS:</p><blockquote>Functionland is on a mission to put full ownership of individuals' most important digital assets - data, photos, files, etc. - back into their own hands. We use WNFS to ensure data security, because encryption and security play a key role in Functionland's mission. </blockquote> Fotos <p>The first dapp to connect to FxBlox is Functionland's FxFotos app. <a href="https://fx.land/fotos-functionlands-dedicated-photo-app/">FxFotos</a> is a media gallery app to back up and sync media files. It can use any decentralized wallet for user authentication. As stated previously, when the app is connected to FxBlox no other back end is required and the data is stored locally and (optionally) across the entire Fula Network. The FxFotos app doesn't store any of your data, it only accesses it when you give it permission (by connecting).</p>FxFotos and FxFiles (coming soon!)<p>Our CEO Boris Mann had this to say about Functionland:</p><blockquote>It's awesome to see the IPFS ecosystem being able to adopt and implement protocols together. We've been wanting to see more mobile-first usage of the protocol stack that Fission is working on, and it's great to see Rust WNFS be live in the app store. Congrats on shipping, Functionland team!</blockquote> Explore FxFotos and Functionland <p>If you'd like to learn more about Functionland, you can visit their <a href="https://fx.land/">website</a>. The FxFotos app is available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=land.fx.fotos&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/fx-fotos/id1640008383">Apple App Store</a>. There is also a file manager app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=land.fx.files&amp;pli=1">FxFiles</a>, and plans for an identity/password manager app as well!</p>

				 <p>For our final post in our <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/category/digital-product-passports/">3-part series</a> exploring Product Passports &amp; Trust Registries, we discuss how our <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trustcontinuum/">Trust Continuum™ Methodology</a> can help organizations integrate digital product passports into a decentralized trust-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>Approaching innovation and technology is daunting – and you have a business to run. Like the experts you bring in for financial and legal advice, we augment your team to bring appropriate innovation and technology.</p>
<p>Our Trust Continuum™ Methodology helps organizations integrate digital product passports into their supply chain. We help you understand how you can use digital product passports to establish trust and accountability in your supply chain and how they can streamline processes and reduce costs. We help you assess the risks and benefits of integrating digital product passports into your existing systems and help you develop a plan for implementing them.</p>
 Improve Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 
<p>Many organizations struggle with disparate data silos across their business caused by a lack of communication and collaboration internally and with external partners. This leads to inefficiencies, errors, and duplication of effort. Our Trust Continuum™ Methodology helps organizations overcome these challenges. By doing so, organizations operate more effectively and efficiently while also gaining insight into the overall health of their products and services. Digital product passports help increase transparency in the supply chain and ensure that products are produced sustainably and ethically.

  Cybersicherheit ist zu einer zentralen Herausforderung für jedes Unternehmen geworden. Die Widerstandsfähigkeit, also die Cyber Resilience, ist inzwischen elementar für die Überlebensfähigkeit von Unternehmen. Die automatisierte Analyse und Reaktion von sicherheitsrelevanten Informationen und Ereignissen wird dabei von sogenannten SOAR-Lösungen (Security Operations and Automated Response) unterstützt, die nicht nur Informationen vergleichen und analysieren, sondern direkt „operational“ machen und automatisierte Reaktionen und nachgelagerte Prozesse wie die Incident Response anstoßen können.

 Web Assembly<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a> is a popular format for running binary applications in web browsers (with wide support).</p><p>This can have a few advantages but the interesting thing for us is that this can allow sharing of implementations of functionality: eg credential issuance, DID resolving, cryptographic functions etc which you may not want to necessarily re-implement in javascript or typescript.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk">SSI-SDK</a> is an implementation of a lot of standards for self soverign identity, so it is a great candidate to expose via WASM to web apps. </p><p>Now there is a whole lot of (lets face it: tedious) machinery to get wasm to be compiled from go (ok if you are really curious you can <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265/">read the code</a>), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from javascript, that look and feel like javascript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from golang).</p><p>Say you had a function in golang land which looked like this: </p>   <code>// Resolve attempts to resolve a DID for a given method<br>func (dr Resolver) Resolve(did string, opts ...ResolutionOptions) (*DIDResolutionResult, error) {<br>  ...<br></code>   <p>You could call it from the web via:</p>   <code>console.log(resolveDid("did:peer:0z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH"));<br></code>   <p>and it would Just Work thanks to WASM!
Well, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue. </p> ChatGPT<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>But the boring glue is what I am hear to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue. </p><p>(If you have been under a rock and haven't heard of ChatGPT - google it now and then come back)</p><p>So firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JS type world and the Golang type world: </p>   <code>// 1. Simplest function - note we wrap things with js.ValueOf (if a primitive you don't technically need to)<br>func sayHello(_ js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {<br>    return js.ValueOf("Hello from golang via wasm!")<br>}<br></code>   <p>This gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality.
Now I am a pretty ordinary golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me. </p><p>Helpfully the ssi-sdk has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the api I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the api.
The functionality was the "Resolve" function above, and the test code showed how to use it. </p><p>I then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:</p><p></p><p>To do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM.
As yoyu can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking. </p><p>I was able to tidy it up and include it in the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265">pull request</a>. Handy - thanks ChatGPT!
Moreover, as I am an ordinary golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling): </p><p></p> Parting thoughts<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>WASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 First at all: What is Decentralized Science: 
<p>Decentralized Science (DeSci) is a new approach to scientific research that utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. The goal of decentralized science is to create a more open and transparent scientific process that allows for the free exchange of ideas and data, and to ensure that the research is conducted in a fair and impartial manner.</p>
 Main benefits and advantages of DeSci: 
<p>One of the key benefits of decentralized science is that it allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. Traditional scientific research often relies on centralized institutions, such as universities and research labs, which can create barriers to collaboration and data sharing. By using decentralized technologies, scientists can collaborate and share data in a more seamless and efficient manner, regardless of their location or affiliation.</p>
<p>Another advantage of decentralized science is that it can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism. With decentralized technologies, it is easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. This can help to increase the integrity and reliability of scientific research.</p>
<p>Decentralized science also has the potential to democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. With decentralized technologies, these researchers can more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world and contribute to the scientific community.</p>
DeSci – Decentralized Science
 More benefits and challeges for Decentralized Science implementation 
<p>There are already several projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. For example, the Open Science Chain is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of decentralized science, there are also some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the issue of trust. With traditional scientific research, scientists rely on established institutions and peer review processes to ensure the reliability of research. With decentralized science, it may be more difficult to establish trust in the research process.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the issue of data security. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, can provide a high level of security, but there is still the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks. Scientists will need to take steps to ensure that their data is protected and secure when using decentralized technologies.</p>
 Some cases of DeSci in the real life: 
<p>There are several examples of decentralized science projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Open Science Chain: This is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world. 
 Science Token: This is a platform that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized marketplace for scientific research. Scientists can use the platform to fund their research projects and to receive rewards for their contributions. 
 DataCoin: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to ensure the security and integrity of the data. 
 Researchpool: This is a decentralized platform that connects researchers with funding sources and allows them to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 Zencity: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to collaborate on research projects and to share data in a secure and transparent manner. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 
 DeSci future potential and importance: 
<p>Decentralized science has the potential to revolutionize the way that scientific research is conducted. DeSci utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. Some of the reasons why DeSci is important include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Increased collaboration: DeSci allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. This can lead to faster and more impactful research, as scientists can more easily share ideas and data. 
 Increased transparency: DeSci can create a more open and transparent scientific process by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 Greater accessibility: DeSci can democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. DeSci can help to level the playing field and allow these researchers to more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world. 
 Reduced risk of scientific misconduct: DeSci can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism, by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 
 Overall

 With crypto fraud at an all-time high, the UK’s National Crime Agency announces a brand-new dedicated unit. 



 



<p>The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) will form a brand-new division specifically designed to tackle crypto crime, in the latest sign of crypto making inroads into the mainstream, with both good and bad results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NCA’s ‘Crypto Cell’ will initially contain just five officers who will be solely responsible for providing support on new and existing crypto-related investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK’s decision to create a dedicated unit for the crypto sector, rather than merely having a national crime agency that also investigates crypto, is a forward-thinking move, especially considering its April 2022 pledge to make the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">UK a global hub</a> for crypto asset technology and investment. In May 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it would add 20 new positions to its renamed Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (formerly the Cyber Unit).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new UK initiative comes at just the right time, following recent reports that from 2021-2022 <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/crypto/crypto-fraud-leaps-in-uk-as-scammers-target-unwary-amateurs?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=CRNW&amp;utm_campaign=00000184-be95-dc5a-ad8f-feb5066e0003">cryptocurrency fraud in the UK</a> rose by 32%, from £171 million to £226 million. The stark rise has been attributed to the cost-of-living crisis, with people more desperate and therefore susceptible to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/top-crypto-scams/">crypto scams</a>, such as Phishing Scams, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">Romance Scams</a>, Investment Scams, and some even being duped into using fake crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Against the backdrop of 2022 being a turbulent year for crypto, 2023 promises to be an interesting time for crypto, not least for the UK with its aspirations in becoming a global crypto hub. Such aspirations can only be achieved through robust, well-defined regulatory frameworks. UK crypto firms can expect to need to register with the FCA under its crypto AML / CTF regime.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>In fact, in 2022, the global crypto asset market spent so long underneath the spotlight that it almost caught a suntan, with crises including Bitcoin falling below $29,000 in May; its lowest valuation in 16 months, and Three Arrows Capital earning the dubious award of becoming the year’s first (but not last) cryptocurrency company to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-hedge-fund-three-arrows-liquidator-begins-taking-control-assets-block-2022-12-02/">go bankrupt in July</a>. The year ended much like it began with a crypto catastrophe. In November, cryptocurrency company FTX collapsed during a liquidity crisis, triggering widespread anxiety and igniting calls for stricter regulatory supervision of the sector.&nbsp;</p>



 Fear, Fines and Fraud: The great British hope.&nbsp; 



<p>When the UK government announced plans to become a pioneer for crypto asset technology and investment, at-the-time Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub">Rishi Sunak said</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>While creating an environment that attracts exchanges to the UK is important, having clear regulations, along with swift punishment for institutions that do not comply is equally as integral in ensuring users feel safe and secure when using UK-based crypto exchanges. To become a global hub for crypto is a bold aim, especially considering how painfully prohibitive the UK crypto money laundering registration can be, and how difficult competing on the global stage will soon become as UK crypto exchanges juggle both domestic and European regulations. The NCA’s new unit is only likely to make the UK’s crypto landscape more perilous to traverse and may result in exchanges and users going elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since January 2021, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the FCA, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Financial Conduct Authority, more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/crypto-firms-face-being-booted-from-uk-as-fca-register-deadline-nears.html">been rejected</a>. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The creation of the Crypto Cell sends a clear message to crypto exchanges and users alike that the days of lax controls are over. The implementation and maintenance of robust KYC controls and technologies are imperative for the long-term viability of any crypto business.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Crypto exchanges without these measures in place can expect to encounter increases in both fraud and fines in 2023. Fines that are only getting bigger, with no sign of slowing down. For example, in October 2022 <a href="https://decrypt.co/111676/treasury-fines-bittrex-53-million-sanctions-violations">Bitrex was fined $53 million</a> by the SEC (the more trigger-happy cousin of the FCA) over violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering laws.&nbsp;</p>



 With great crypto opportunity comes great crypto responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The year of 2022 wasn’t all doom and gloom for the UK and European market, however, with American crypto exchange giant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase announcing plans</a> to appoint new executives to its “top team” to boost European expansion efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment, upcoming crypto regulations, and dedicated crypto crime divisions are all strong signs that there is a consensus to create a strong and stable environment where crypto exchanges can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>), it decided to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation. It is also expected to do the same when the two major pieces of European crypto regulation, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>, come into play in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, the UK Parliament passed the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3339">Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill</a>, which “will make it easier quicker for law enforcement agencies such as the National Crime Agency to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets – the digital currency increasingly used by organized criminals to launder profits from fraud, drugs and cybercrime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Crime Agency <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/606-national-crime-agency-annual-report-2021-2022/file">seized almost £27 million</a> worth of crypto assets in 2021-2022 from zero in previous years. What it will seize in 2023, especially with its new crypto-dedicated crime division, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is clearly a balance to be struck between offering a comparatively lighter crypto-friendly environment to attract crypto companies and users away from the US and the EU, and a robust-enough regulatory regime that offers sufficient consumer protection to placate the FCA and the newly empowered NCA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What part the Crypto Cell will play, alongside the notoriously cautious FCA, in the balancing act will become clear very soon. &nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving crypto regulatory landscape. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;For more information on why using crypto platforms without KYC processes is a risk, check out our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">‘Buying crypto without a KYC check?

<p>Products like the Metaproof Platform (formerly known as the POI Platform) and Living Avatar NFTs – utilizing the innovative technology of Soulbound NFTs governed by LOCK DAO – now make up the vital cogs of a decentralized, user-powered identity verification ecosystem that includes the SelfKey identity wallet. Users who actively contribute to secure the network can earn the work token, LOCK.</p>
<p>SelfKey believes that this ecosystem can be widely used and adapted by Web3 platforms to securely verify the identity of users on these platforms – and to effectively distinguish real users from bots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decentralized identity ecosystem envisioned by SelfKey and LOCK DAO can help the crypto industry in its transition toward regulatory compliance. Several events during the course of last year have led to increased discussions surrounding regulations and a greater understanding of the need for effective compliance with the crypto industry and its products.</p>
<p>SelfKey believes that policymakers should consider a decentralized and user-centric approach when creating regulatory frameworks: implementing the same centralized policies used in the legacy financial industries might very well be counter-productive for crypto and its products.</p>
<p>SelfKey views the discussions surrounding regulatory policies as a positive and necessary change that will help users take more responsibility and control over their digital assets. This evolution bodes well for bringing the crypto community closer to a decentralized future.</p>
 ETH 2.0 &amp; Merge 
<p>The much-awaited ETH merge – which marked the transition of Ethereum from a Proof-Of-Work (POW) to a Proof-Of-Stake (POS) network – also happened last year.</p>
<p>The merge and the subsequent transition – dubbed ETH 2.0 – was a major event that the crypto industry and enthusiasts watched closely. This was probably the biggest update to date for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that $KEY, the native token of the SelfKey ecosystem, is an ERC-20 token, SelfKey was also excited to see the impact the upgrade could bring to the Ethereum network.</p>
 Celsius, BlockFi &amp; FTX 
<p>Along with all the great things that have happened during the course of 2022, some unfortunate events also made it to the headlines. The biggest of these was when Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX froze withdrawals for their users and filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Although on first impressions this may have felt like a squarely negative series of events for the crypto industry, the most important takeaway is that all these failed platforms were centralized.</p>
<p>Crypto and the underlying blockchain technology were developed to help rectify the flaws of the centralized financial industry. Yet, a majority of the crypto industry still relies heavily on centralization – and that’s where we are still continuing to see major failures.</p>
<p>Even though the industry still has a way to evolve toward being decentralization positive, it is evident that the industry is on the right path – the purge of incompetent centralized platforms and products is evidence of this trajectory. In parallel, more products are being developed with a focus on decentralization.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>2022 has been an eventful year for SelfKey and the crypto industry. We have witnessed clear signs that the community is evolving toward a decentralized future.</p>
<p>We saw the failure of centralized platforms that gambled with user funds, which has led to serious discussions and recommendations for regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. Proper regulations that will offer clarity and security for users and platforms alike are a necessity.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a cycle and an ever-evolving process, and the community will have to continuously work toward achieving more decentralization as we move through 2023. Similarly, regulations need to focus on the pain points of users and aim to be more user-centric. Combined, these goals can further ensure more user participation in the space, making the industry more decentralized.</p>
<p>SelfKey and LOCK DAO aspires to help the community during this crucial period of evolution. SelfKey hopes that 2023 will be yet another year filled with new challenges and new opportunities that will help the crypto community thrive.</p>
 Happy New Year!

<p>Everyone who loves passwords and multi-factor authentication, raise your hand. </p>

<p></p>

<p>“I’m MEEEE!” I want to yell at a website that’s asked me for the 4th time to go to my email and phone and get a 6-digit code, or go to my email and click another link, or… some stupid thing.</p>

<p>Here’s another thing that drives me nuts: I have a password for my Mac and another for my Google Account. I’m in security, after all, so they are different. </p>

<p>The point is, I know both by muscle memory. Do you know how many times I type the wrong password into the wrong prompt? Any guesses? Nope. More. A lot. </p>

<p>I’m ME!!! Why can’t I get into my accounts by just being ME? I can use my fingerprint for my pixel phone and FaceID for my iPhone. Why can’t I do that everywhere?</p>

<p>Wait? Is there something new out there? Can I finally give passwords the finger and move on? Please tell me about it!</p>

<p>Let’s start with Multi-Factor Authentication, specifically the One Time Password (OTP) type.</p>

<p>If you wanted to play the blame game (and I do), you could blame passwords for the existence of SMS OTP and its variants (and I do that, too). Passwords are weak and can easily be stolen or guessed. So to prove (digitally) that I am who I say I am, websites prompt me to enter a second password -- information that shows I have something or am someone, and if someone stole my password they hopefully do not have access to my SMS messages. Thanks, passwords, for introducing more complexity into my life.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">,WebAuthN</a> (which my co-founder Alex wrote about <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/passkey-user-experience-two-steps-forward-one-step-back">,here</a>) is changing that. WebAuthN is a not-so-sexy technical term for Web Authentication. Passkey is a sexier marketing term for the latest extension of WebAuthN. Instead of inventing a complex password you’d never remember or reuse everywhere, or a simple one that a hacker would figure out (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/most-common-passwords-of-2022-make-sure-yours-isnt-on-the-list.html">,qwerty</a> anyone?), WebAuthN lets people securely log into websites or applications using a phone or a security key. Because your security key must be physically accessible, and your phone needs to be biometrically (or PIN, if your finger is dirty) unlocked and in proximity. you get a much stronger second factor without needing to wait for that annoying SMS to copy-paste What? I’m drinking whatever Kool-aid you are making! How does it work?</p>

<p>I’ll give you the user experience, then rip the cover off and tell you geekier folks how it works: </p> 
   Enter your user name in the website login form and click to authenticate. 
   Pickup phone, unlock via FaceID or Fingerprint 
 <p>And that’s it. No password. Simple. And way more secure.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened behind the scenes: When you registered your user ID on the website, you stored a passkey instead of a password. During that process, WebAuthN created a magic key that was stored on your phone. When you logged onto the website from your laptop, WebAuthN used Bluetooth from your phone to communicate with your computer. It validated the physical proximity of the phone and verified who you were with the biometric unlocking of your phone. And you authenticated! The result is passwordless multi-factor authentication that is easy to use and phishing-resistant. </p>

<p>The technology is backed by the FiDO alliance, with the support of players like Apple, Google, Microsoft, (YeshID!) and others, which means your devices are likely already compatible and ready to use WebAuthN today, where they are supported, and enjoy a secure, passwordless experience built into your device - no new software required! </p>

<p>In security, we always talk about how there’s no “silver bullet.” But a great “bronze bullet” is focusing on the protection of identities &amp; credentials.</p>

<p>If you are a small or mid-sized company using Google Workspace and want to protect yourselves against identity-based attacks (which are involved in <a href="https://spycloud.com/key-takeaways-from-the-verizon-2022-data-breach-investigations-report/">,85% of breaches</a>) with a secure solution that is dead simple to use, you’ll want to sign up for the YeshID Alpha, coming in April.

<p>Online, always-on finance and banking have led to significant security challenges for institutions trying to thwart international terrorism, identity theft, and fraud.</p>
<p>What are KYC regulations? KYC requires sufficient identity assurance and verification standards during customer onboarding to mitigate fraud and money laundering in finance and banking.</p>
 What Are Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations? 
<p>Know Your Customer, or KYC, are regulations around identity assurance and verification in the financial sector implemented to protect against money laundering, fraud, and identity theft.</p>
<p>These regulations require that financial institutions have specific controls in place to assure user identity, with increasingly complex requirements based on the type of institution in question, the economic profile of the user, and other factors.</p>
<p>KYC requirements typically extend beyond traditional authentication standards. KYC can include identity assurance in line with government standards, including providing multiple forms of official government ID (driver’s license, passport, etc.) and even in-person identification with company personnel.</p>
<p>KYC laws exist to stop a few critical crimes:</p>
 
 Money Laundering: Money laundering, or using financial institutions or businesses to sanitize illegal funds by mixing them with legitimate pools of money, has been a significant issue for banks since banking started. KYC attempts to stop money laundering by linking customers with verified identities and credentials. 
 Identity Theft: With robust KYC in place, banks and other institutions can mitigate identity theft by requiring identity assurance–that is, official documents or even in-person assurance using company personnel or certified security professionals. 
 Fraud and Funding: KYC can also provide security against the fraudulent use of funds for organized crime or terrorists by creating a strict and rigorous chain of identity for all customers. 
 
<p>Many countries have some form of KYC laws. In the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970 established requirements for anti-money laundering practices that included identity assurance requirements. However, the onset of widespread digital banking and international terrorism (funded through money laundering and fraud) led to the Patriot Act and updated AML laws.</p>
 What is KYC Compliance? 
<p>Financial institutions must perform regular due diligence on their customers to comply with KYC laws, including identity assurance and expanded authentication.</p>
<p>Some of these requirements for due diligence include:</p>
 
 Customer Identification Program (CIP): The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/kyc-cip/">CIP</a> is a baseline requirement for financial institutions. It stipulates that these institutions collect several official documents or identification from customers to ensure their identity. 
 
<p>There may be more or fewer requirements depending on the risk of fraud (including factors like the volume of money involved and the user’s financial history).</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): CDD involves collecting some basic forms of identification to confirm the customer’s identity. These documents will be used to check associated risk and background databases to identify any issues. 
 
<p>Online databases and services are known as “eKYC” and serve as a highly secure and regulated operation executed by international expert firms.</p>
 
 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Advanced document collection or identity assurance may be required for customers with more significant risks for fraud or terrorism. 
 
<p>Required documents and practices will differ based on context. On the higher end of the risk scale, customers may need to provide several forms of official, marked government ID along with physical identity assurance.</p>
 Know Your Customer From Around the World 
<p>While we’ve covered laws in the US, money laundering and fraud are international challenges. As such, many major governments have enacted some form of KYC.</p>
<p>These international laws include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/documentation/legal-basis/laws-and-ordinances/anti-money-laundering-act-(amla)/">Anti-Money Laundering Act (France):</a> AMLA includes several constituent laws that define an umbrella of KYC requirements, including the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (details of professional KYC practices), and the FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (governing KYC and financial intermediaries). 
 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/pdfs/uksi_20170692_en.pdf">The Money Laundering Act (UK):</a> This law governs KYC laws for financial institutions in the United Kingdom, including basic requirements for due diligence and practices to address financial blackmail and fraud against public figures. 
 <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng">Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada):</a> This law lays out standard KYC requirements in tandem with UK laws, addressing the range of regulated industries in Canada. These industries include accounting, gambling and casinos, precious stones dealers, finance, life insurance, real estate, and others. 
 <a href="https://www.electronicid.eu/en/blog/post/aml5-new-anti-money-laundering-directive/en">The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU):</a> The latest in a series of conferences held by experts and officials in the European Union modernized KYC in EU territories while adding new laws and requirements for financial organizations dealing in cryptocurrency.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Every company has different needs. These will depend on company size, location, products they offer, not to mention the current infrastructure in place. Unfortunately, there is not a solution that “fits them all”, and the high maturity of the IT market leads to&nbsp;numerous vendors offering their services. In this context, the main issue is not to cover the needs of an organization, but to choose the best solutions and to understand their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
 Process phases 
<p>Evaluating and selecting vendors and solutions is not an easy task. It is a process and having a solid methodology in place will certainly mitigate the risks in this choice and allow you to evaluate the value of the wide range of options available more quickly. It is challenging to make decisions considering the job to be done, tasks to be completed and customers’ demands. Generally speaking, this process can be divided into five phases:</p>
<p>1. Definition</p>
<p>It is vital to define the goals of your organization and understand why you need to achieve them. In this sense, it is feasible to identify the priorities, learn about the context, know the vendors and evaluate their performance. At this stage, it is also necessary to establish a time frame. Moreover, businesses will have a clearer description to avoid issues or misunderstanding along the practices.</p>
<p>2. Framework creation</p>
<p>In order to find the best solution, it is necessary to understand the entire business model and the IT strategies of your organization. Creating a framework also allows you to spot vulnerabilities in your current strategy and tend to them. Thus, this stage should be considered as an opportunity to redesign and improve the practices, moving from good to great. In any case, and regardless the findings on the go, it is essential to keep the existing issues in mind.</p>
<p>3. Request for information</p>
<p>Once the problems are defined, it is time to contact different vendors. There should be a minimum criterion to shortlist the suppliers, such as payment, contracting, disbursement, maintenance, and monitoring. Moreover, it is essential to analyse the services from the technical perspective and understand whether it matches the technical structure of the business that seeks for solutions. It is worth mentioning that having strong knowledge on the market is key to speed this stage up.</p>
<p>4. Request for Proposal</p>
<p>At this point, your company already has an idea of the vendors that offer the – apparently - best solutions for your business, and thus final details are to be discussed. You and your stakeholders ask vendors for clarification and for the possibility to amend things in the contract in case they decide to move on. The answers of the vendors must be evaluated to decide for the most suitable supplier.</p>
<p>5. Implementation</p>
<p>Choosing a solution does not mean that the implementation will be a one-time task. There should first be a pre-implementation process, where the solution is tested, and professionals identify gaps. It is likely to change procedures, timing, number of employees, among other factors that might affect the final results. Once the changes are made, the operation runs again with these modifications and the process is tested again. Moreover, monitoring is part of the cycle and a vital procedure during the implementation phase.</p>
<p>6. Proof of Concept</p>
<p>Every tool and process have weaknesses and advantages. It is vital to compare the reality with what was expected. Identifying that the solutions focuses on the problem to be solved is a priority to ensure a well-functioning of the processes. A fair evaluation is needed in order to make changes on time or improve the solution.</p>
 Can companies do it on their own? 
<p>There is nothing to indicate that companies cannot attempt to accomplish this process on their own. However, deep knowledge of the market and of its many vendors is undeniably necessary. There are also several risks associated with this process. One of the most common issues companies have is assuming that they do understand their needs, leading them to implement a solution which does not fully satisfy them – when at all. Additionally, implementing the wrong solution could be twice as expensive as implementing a solution which turns out to be inadequate and undoing the damage caused comes at a cost.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organizations must consider their staff capabilities. Solutions are very complex and unique requiring training new or existing staff, which could be costly. It is important to keep in mind that every company will promise “the best”, but they do not consider every organization’s particular needs and competencies. In a similar vein, considering the compatibility between the solution offered and the organization’s architecture is crucial. Trying to implement a solution that does not fit properly would be both a waste of time and assets.</p>
<p>In that sense, a company like KuppingerCole Analysts can help organizations like yours not only to find the best possible solution in the market, but it will also save you time, money, and resources. Structuring and carrying out an IT implementation process is a critical factor of success. Assuring the correct planning will minimize risks, maximize the outcome of endeavours, and consider affordability within the priorities too.</p>
<p>To support organizations in their search for the solution matching their needs, KuppingerCole Analysts launched KC Open Select, an interactive tool that allows users to map their organization's individual Cybersecurity &amp; Digital ID requirements to KuppingerCole’s Intelligence. This user-friendly, fully automated process provides the user with a shortlist of solutions best-suited to the particular needs of their organization from a wide range of services and solutions available. The tool also provides a rating for the vendors, which allows the user to know what other customers think about the services, and whether the vendor will be the best fit for the organization and to face the challenges. KC Open Select will enable organizations to save time, money and resources when researching industry leading vendors and solutions. <a href="https://go.kuppingercole.com/open-select">Try KC Open Select for free</a>.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>While no solution can guarantee a 100% efficiency, it is possible to find the best fit possible. Naturally, automation processes to acquire a shortlist of vendors and solutions is a huge help, nevertheless human expertise is also needed. At KuppingerCole our advisors have extensive experience negotiating with vendors, a clear understanding of the market, and proper knowledge about what leaders are doing. The combination of KC Open Select and advice from expert would undeniably support organizations to find what they need. KuppingerCole can offer this, and in the process to find and implement solutions, we will state hypotheses, validate them, and find the most efficient techniques for your organization.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are there cases where focusing on governance instead of identity helps achieve our same digital trust goals, while enhancing privacy preservation?</p></blockquote>
<p>In user-controlled digital identity, we often classify entities under the categories of Issuers, Holders and Verifiers. The issuers issue signed credentials to holders (verifiable credentials), while holders present proofs of these signed credentials to any verifier.</p>
<p>A lot of the excitement around this model is because it moves us away from centralized or federated identity management models. This means that identity assertions can now be made directly by the Holder/Prover, without having to ask a third party identity provider (IdP) if an assertion can be trusted. This model makes the Prover their own IdP, creating direct and controlled interactions for them, which should lead to increased privacy-preservation for everyone involved.</p>
<p>This new model that involves the exchange of verifiable credentials is resulting in the emergence of new trust frameworks that can specify things like:</p>
 
 Which issuers are authorized to issue what types of verifiable credentials. 
 Which verifiers are authorized to request what types of verifiable presentations. 
 
<p>If a Verifier no longer relies on the assertions of a trusted IdP, they must gain confidence that the assertions being made by the Prover are in line with the trust frameworks (or governance) they rely on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In federated identity systems, governance is more critical than identity to establish trust. Federated identity systems rely on trust relationships between identity providers, identity brokers, and relying parties. These trust relationships are established through governance mechanisms that ensure that the identity provider and intermediaries have robust processes in place for accurately authenticating user identities and issuing trusted assertions. Without strong governance, relying parties may not have confidence in the system and may be hesitant to accept identity assertions made through it. So can we think that perhaps the same will be true when Provers are their own IdP?</p>
<p></p>
<p>^ [A <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast episode</a> on Governance and Trust that Scott Perry and I did recently which you may find interesting.]</p>
<p>Inside the user-controlled model, the adherence to trust frameworks can be verified cryptographically. This means that a Verifier can gain confidence that an assertion being made by a Prover meets their policies, since it relies on credential data issued by what they would categorize as an authorized Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as Verifiers know that credential data originated from an authorized Issuer, is Identity information then even required to be shared with them? In order to validate that my financial report was issued to my company by a certified audit body, must a verifier know the issuing firm’s identity, or can they gain enough assurance just by knowing that my company’s financial report comes from an audit firm within a trusted list that they use?</p>
<p>If there is a legal/policy requirement for the Verifier to know the Issuer, then of course their identity information can be exchanged. But should exchanging identity information be a baseline requirement? In a lot of cases, enough trust can be established simply by knowing that the assertion guarantees compliance to a set of governing rules that are important to you.</p>
<p>Being able to cryptographically prove adherence to trust frameworks is more valuable than proving an identity itself. I would have to prove adherence to a trust framework anyways, even if I divulge the identity information, whereas the opposite isn’t always true.</p>
<p>If there is no policy reason for a Verifier to know the identity information of the Issuer, can’t we achieve the same trust by (1) cryptographically proving credential data hasn’t been altered since issuance, and (2) cryptographically proving that the issuing entities who signed my credentials are within your accepted trust framework for the assertion that I’m making?</p>
<p>Doesn’t this model set a far better baseline for privacy preservation?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts..</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Yuga Labs, the production company of Bored Ape Yacht Club, announced the completion of a $450 million seed round of funding at a $4 billion valuation, once again igniting the NFT industry and market. And tThe origin of this legendary story is only one sentence&nbsp;↓↓</p>*Image source: Yuga&nbsp;Labs<p>So, how to make NFT? Do you draw it first and then upload it? NO NO NO~! Let usNext, we will start with the two roles of painter and architect to help you get started quickly and join the metaverse world!</p> If you are a&nbsp;painter <p>If you are a painter, then congratulations on the relatively easy way to make an NFT. ~ You can choose to make a PFP type of NFT, easy to make, and more popular and approachable.</p> Step 1:&nbsp;Drawing <p>Most of the current PFP projects utilize have the concept of attributes, and the difference between different NFTs is determined by different attributes. Typical attributes are background color, eye shape, facial accessories, and so on. Random permutations of these attributes can create different NFTs.</p><p>*Image source:&nbsp;Internet</p><p>So, if you want to create a series of 1000 NFTs with 3 attributes of eyes, face ornaments and clothes, what you need to do is not to draw 1000 pictures, but 31 PNGs, i.e. 1 picture of the main character, 10 pictures of eyes, 10 pictures of face ornaments and 10 pictures of clothes, and then complete the combination of NFT pictures in batch (1*10³) by a random generation program.</p> Step 2: Upload to Marketplace <p>Once you have done so, you can publish your NFT work through the various NFT marketplaces.</p><p>Take Opensea as an example, after logging in with your own data client, click [Create] and fill in the information about the NFT to publish your NFT. When you want to sell it, you need to pay a certain amount of Gas fee to be able to auction it on the&nbsp;market.</p> Step 3: Display in the metaverse <p>Of course, NFTs areis not only showcased onin the NFT market, but metaverse projects such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels also provide athe stage for&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>*Image source: Decentraland</p><p>If a visitor is interested in your work, and your work happens to be for sale on Opensea, there is the possibility of a direct transaction., Ffor example, Decentraland can jump directly to Opensea, and of course the metaverse is not limited to the work that can be shown in PFP (although PFP is still the most popular hottest at the moment). With the growing interest in the virtual land sector, NFTs and the metaverse are opening their doors to architects as&nbsp;well.</p> If you are an architect <p>For architects, the current phase of the virtual land and property boom is the perfect time to get in on the action, such as the creation of scenes in Decentraland.</p><p>Let’s take here the example of The Builder, a tool for creating 3D scenes in Decentraland that does not require writing&nbsp;code.</p> Step 1: Create a&nbsp;scene <p>After entering the official website and logging in, click on [BUILDER], you can start creating scenes on this page. The size of the scene can be adjusted by rows and columns (the current area cannot exceed 32). FAnd for the time being, only rectangular scenes are supported, irregularly shaped scenes can only be achieved through the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>Also, the ground in the scene can be selected from the ‘Asset’ column with various ground textures. In addition to this, Decentraland itself offers a wide range of content for the creator to choose from. It is up to the user to decide how the contents of the scene are combined, displayed, etc. The user can simply click on the item and drag it to any location in the scene. If you want to add a 3D model built outside Decentraland, you can do the following:</p>  Create 3D models using SketchUp, Blender, Maya,&nbsp;etc.;  Use The Builder tool to import, the model format must be gltf or&nbsp;glb;  Click New Asset Pack in the scene&nbsp;editor;  Drag in the model&nbsp;file;  Select Import&nbsp;Assets;  After naming the asset pack, press 【Create Asset&nbsp;Pack】.  <p>After importing, there is no difference between using the new asset package and using the asset package that comes with the&nbsp;project.</p> Step 2: Release scenarios <p>When you have finished creating it and pressed [Publish], it means the publishing is successful. There are two options for the launch: one for the scene pool and one for your own&nbsp;land.</p><p>Note that if you have your own land, you can choose to use the created scene on your own land. Of course, you can also choose to publish it in the scene pool for display, and for others to use to earn&nbsp;money.</p> Conclusion <p>Whether you are a painter or an architect, there is a tremendous opportunity to take a shot at and cash in on the metaverse in the future. Such spontaneous opportunities are rare in the centralized Web2 and will be more readily available in a metaverse with fewer rules and strictures. In addition to the above areas, unprecedented directions like Digital Fashion are giving traditional apparel designers new options. But before this can begin, designers still need to create a decentralized account, and furthermore a DID, through decentralized Web3 portal clients like ONTO, MetaMask, etc., to help them accumulate personal value and data and achieve more economization of their behavior and&nbsp;data.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/lets-make-an-nft-a98391db97bd">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | Let’s make an NFT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Here we are again, the start of a new year. It does feel like 2023 arrived more softly than previous years. Maybe due to 2022 being a year that globally progressed very differently than we all expected.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure we’ve been pushing forward on many initiatives for the last 12 months, and now is a good time to surface and reflect on what has been achieved.</p>
 Continued Growth 
<p>Ubisecure is a private company and so we do not publish detailed financials, but we are pleased to announce that we are definitely the right side of the ‘<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/saas-and-the-rule-of-40-keys-to-the-critical-value-creation-metric">rule of 40</a>’. I think given the global economic climate and the continuing macro situation this is a great result and will serve us well into 2023.</p>
 The return of face-to-face events 
<p>One of the really positive aspects of 2022 has been the return of in-person events. In 2022 we were fortunate to meet identity ecosystem stakeholders and present at the Gartner IAM event in London (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/european-reusable-strong-identity/" title="read our event summary">read our event summary</a>), as well as cybersecurity events in New York, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. We also attended our first face-to-face KYC in Banking event where we presented alongside the GLEIF on the value of organisation identity in client onboarding., The immediate feedback and connection you get from face-to-face presentations results in a far more fluid, engaged and valuable session. I do expect 2023 to continue and grow in that regard and we already have a number of speaking engagements booked.</p>
 And the rise of the vLEI 
<p>We were very proud to be working closely with the GLEIF back in May and June for the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title="Verifiable-LEI pilot">Verifiable-LEI pilot</a> that took place. Ubisecure acted as the Qualified vLEI Issuer for the pilot and the credentials issued were used to sign the GLEIF 2021 report. This is a great step forward for the wider LEI eco-system and directly supports our previous predictions of the convergence of classical identity and Verifiable Credentials. During 2023 we will be working with the GLEIF to become a full QVI that can deliver commercially consumable and scalable credentials, so watch this space for more details.</p>
 New Logo Wins 
<p>Taking great care of our existing customers is always a #1 priority for us but growing that customer base is a close #2. We’ve welcomed some great new customers in 2022 – ranging from global media giants to several of the world’s largest banks. UK innovation and Nordic excellence are a winning combination and serving us very well as we expand beyond our Nordic footprint.</p>
 Organisation Identity growth 
<p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/">LEI registration</a> through our RapidLEI brand is going from strength to strength. We remain the #1 issuer of validated LEIs per month, every month. We are the leading provider of GLEIF Validation Agent services through our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> proposition, which is now being used by several of the top ten largest banks.</p>
<p>The LEI eco-system itself is growing well through a number of initiatives, the <a href="https://iccwbo.uk/blogs/press-releases/icc-centre-for-digital-trade-innovation-launches-preparations-for-uk-trade-to-go-digital">UK paperless trade bill</a> and the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/cbp-customs-border-protection-lei/">US Customs &amp; Border Protection global business identifier program</a> clearly mark the LEI as the essential identifier of 2022.</p>
 Spreading the word 
<p>Being at the center of a number of digital identity initiatives we have a wide array of connections into the broader identity industry who we think have plenty of interesting things to say, and it seems many of you agree with us. Over the last year our ‘Lets talk about Digital Identity’ podcast series has doubled its listenership, thanks to the many fantastic guests and introduction of the innovative “Identity Stories Series”. If you have not heard it yet, please have a look and listen to our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/lets-talk-about-digital-identity-podcast/" title="#LTADI podcast episodes">#LTADI podcast episodes</a> and see why so many people are subscribing. </p>

 Driving the vision 
<p>Our belief in the power of digital identity to precisely express who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have when representing them through a combination of highly assured Organisation Identity and strong authenticated Individual Identity defines the core of our focus as we navigate 2023.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Driving growth through global initiatives 
<p>There are a number of global initiatives in play that intersect with our vision, from the cross-border EU ID to GAIN to vLEI. These global efforts all leverage the LEI as the underlying Organisation Identifier and go some way to enabling an expression of representation. The derived, most often through delegation, expression of rights connected to that representation is where Ubisecure delivers a step change in value to these propositions.</p>
 Driving pace 
<p>We have a lot to do but we have a growing team of experts who are working hard on pushing us forward, both technically and commercially. It’s the Ubisecure people that really make the difference to what we do. If you would like to be part of the journey, please speak to us, we are always looking for great, like-minded people to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/careers/" title="join the team">join the team</a>.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year, wherever you are, and look forward to what 2023 brings to the world of identity management.</p>

<p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>내년 상반기 예정된 DEX(탈중앙화 거래소) 런칭에 앞서, 여러분의 이해를 도울 수 있는 아티클을 준비했습니다. DEX란 무엇이고 왜 DEX가 필요한지 메타디움 앰배서더의 아티클을 통해&nbsp;소개합니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p> DEX란 무엇이고, 왜&nbsp;필요한가 <p>안녕하세요 여러분! 메타디움 앰배서더 Cyber G입니다. 오늘은 메타디움에 처음 생기는 DEX와 관련하여 여러분께 설명드리고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>암호화폐를 거래해보신 분들이라면 업비트, 빗썸과 같은 암호화폐 거래소에 익숙하실거라 생각합니다. 이메일을 통해 가입을 진행하고, 강력한 비밀번호를 지정하고, 계정을 인증하고, 암호화폐를 거래하는 방식의 거래소 말입니다. 이러한 중앙화 거래소의 경우, 자산을 거래하기 위해서는 플랫폼 내부로 먼저 입금 과정이 이루어져야 합니다. 그런데, 최근, 세계에서 두번째로 큰 FTX 거래소의 경우, 사용차 예치금의 일대일 준비금을 보유하지 않은 것으로 보여집니다. FTX 거래소 측은 사용자 자산을 FTX 경영진에게 개인 용도로 빌려주거나 자회사인 알라메다 리서치에게 빌려주는 등 다양한 방법으로 자산을 유용하였으며, 결국 사용자들은 인출이 불가능하게 되고 FTX 거래소가 파산하는 등 국내에서도 많은 피해자가 생기는 등 글로벌적으로 큰 이슈가&nbsp;되었습니다.</p>그림 1. 암호화폐 거래소 FTX의 급속한&nbsp;붕괴<p>이러한 사건 이후, DEX에 대한 관심이 급격히 늘어나고 있습니다. 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 거래량은 2022년 11월에 이미 910억 달러에 이르렀으며, 이는 10월 전체에 비해 79% 증가한 것입니다. DEX는 중앙화 거래소를 제치고 현재 현물 거래량이 2022년 9월의 10.8%에서 16.7%로&nbsp;증가했습니다.</p>그림 2. 유니스왑의 일일 DEX 거래량 볼륨&nbsp;차트<p>이더리움 체인 위에서 이더리움과 ERC-20 토큰 간의 자동 교환 거래를 용이하게 하도록 설계된 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 대표주자, 유니스왑의 거래량 차트를 보면 이를 확인할 수 있습니다. Uniswap은 거래량과 사용자 수를 기준으로 최고의 DEX입니다. 설립자 Hayden Adams는 최근 Twitter에 Uniswap이 이더/미국 달러 거래 쌍의 일일 거래량에서 Coinbase를 능가했다고 게시하기도 했는데요. 초기 탈중앙화 거래소는 과도한 가스비 초래, 확장의 한계성, 부족한 유동성 등의 문제가 있어 큰 관심을 받지 못했습니다. 유니스왑은 이러한 한계성을 보완하여 출시하였는데요. 특히 AMM(유동화된 마켓 메이커) 알고리즘 기반으로 유동성 풀(pool, 스마트 컨트랙트 내에 동결되어 있는 자금)을 제공하여 낮은 유동성이라는 한계점을 보완하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성을 공급하는 자들에게 별도의 보상을 지급하는 방식으로 유동성 공급 문제를 해결하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성 마이닝이라는 시스템으로 성립되어 있어 토큰을 특정 풀에 맡기면 전용 거버넌스 토큰인 UNI를 보상으로 받을 수 있습니다. UNI는 일종의 거버넌스 토큰(Governance Token)으로서 가격이 결정되어 있으며 디지털자산 거래소에서 간편하게 교환할 수 있습니다. 또한, 유니스왑은 중앙관리자가 없어 디지털자산의 상장 이라는 개념이 존재하지 않습니다. 이에 누구나 유니스왑에 ERC-20 토큰의 유동성을 공급하여 해당 토큰의 교환을 용이하게 만들 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p>그림 3. 중앙화 거래소와 탈중앙화 거래소의 차이점&nbsp;제시<p>이처럼 DEX에서는 개인 자산을 중앙화 기관인 제3자에게 맡기지 않고 본인의 암호화폐 지갑에 보관하고, DEX 사용시에만 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 자산을 거래하게 됩니다. 그렇기에 귀찮은 가입 과정을 요구하지 않습니다. 대부분의 경우, 암호화폐를 입금 또는 출금할 필요도 없습니다. 거래는 두 사용자의 지갑 사이에서 직접 진행되며, 제3자의 개입 또한 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 제한되게 됩니다. 따라서, 자신의 자금에 대한 통제권을 넘겨주지 않아도&nbsp;됩니다.</p> 그렇다면, Metadium에 DEX가 생긴다는 건 어떠한 의미를&nbsp;가질까요? <p>첫번째로, 메타디움 2.0에서 많은 Dapp을 생태계로 온보딩시키기 위해 각 Dapp들의 생태계를 이어주는 징검다리 역할을 DEX가 하게 됩니다. A라는 프로젝트가 있다고 가정해볼께요. DEX에서는 해당 프로젝트의 토큰을 구매하거나, 혹은 유동성 풀에 유동성을 제공하여 프로젝트에서 제공하는 A 토큰을 에어드랍받는 등 각 프로젝트에 참여할 수 있는 기회가 DEX를 통해 생기게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>두번째로, 다양한 체인의 자산들이 Metadium 생태계로 들어오게 됩니다. 체인별로 암호화폐 자산을 전송하는 브릿지를 통해 메타디움 메인넷 안의 DEX에서 각 자산들이 활용되게 되면서, 생태계 내 유동성 볼륨은 더 성장하게 되고, 이는 메타디움 메인넷에 크게 기여하게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>마지막으로, DEX 사용을 통해 투명하고 안전한 거래를 할 수 있습니다. 모든 거래는 메타디움 블록체인 상에 기록되며, 누구나 그 정보를 열람할 수 있습니다. 또한, 자산의 거래는 P2P 방식으로 진행되며, 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해서만 구동되게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>이처럼 탈중앙화 생태계의 확장에 기여하게 될 DEX. 그리고 DEX를 통해 온보딩되어 성장하게 될 다양한 프로젝트들. 여기의 주인공은 메타디움을 사랑해주시고 이용해주시는 여러분입니다. 국내 최정상급의 블록체인 기술 기업 Ozys와 함께, 메타디움 재단은 생태계 확장에 도움이 될 DEX 런칭에 최선을 다하고 있습니다. 이전 메타디움의 로드맵 중 하나였던 Defi 서비스 “MSPACE” 관련 기획 경험과 암호화폐 시장 현황을 토대로 분석하여, 최적의 시기에 최고의 DEX서비스를 런칭할 것입니다. 메타디움 2.0의 빛나는 미래. 지금 함께&nbsp;시작합니다!</p> 참고문헌 <p>1. “DEXs Gain Market Share As Faith In Centralized Crypto Players Erodes”, Forbes, last modified Nov 23. 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40">https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40</a></p><p>2. “Uniswap의 대응 가능한 시장 확대”, messari report, last modified Nov 21. 2022, <a href="https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market">https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market</a></p><p>메타디움 공식 채널 팔로우하고 메타디움의 최신 소식을&nbsp;확인하세요!</p><p><a href="http://metadium.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/2dhC5Zfay7">Discord</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metadium">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://t.me/MetadiumNotice">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadium">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/%EB%A9%94%ED%83%80%EB%94%94%EC%9B%80-%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%ED%81%B4-dex-%ED%83%88%EC%A4%91%EC%95%99%ED%99%94-%EA%B1%B0%EB%9E%98%EC%86%8C-ff7d58ee9694">메타디움 아티클: DEX(탈중앙화 거래소)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>블록체인 생태계는 끊임없이 변화하고&nbsp;있다</p><p>웹 3.0 시대, 블록체인의 탈중앙화 특징을 활용하여 사용자는 개인이 가질 수 있는 최대의 자율성과 권한을 부여한 다양한 어플리케이션을 경험할 수 있다. 다만 자율성을 보장받게 되면서 의도되지 않은 위험에 노출되는 등 안전 문제가 발생하고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>이런 경우 개인 자산의 소유를 증명하기 위해서는 사용의 자산이 자산이 운용되고 있는 서비스가 AML*, KYC* 등 규제를 준수하고 있어야 법적인 보호를 받을 수 있다. 규정 준수로 디지털 자산에 대한 신뢰를 구축할 뿐만 아니라, 자율 규제를 스스로 정립하고 지켜가는 서비스를 통해 사용자들은 법적 규제에 대한 걱정 없이 스스로를 인증하고 안전하게 탈중앙화 생태계에서 활동할 수 있을&nbsp;것이다.</p><p>*AML(Anti Money Laundering)&nbsp;: 불법자금 세탁을 적발하고 예방하기위한&nbsp;관리체계</p><p>*KYC(Know Your Customer)&nbsp;: 고객에 대해 알기, 금융기관이 고객의 신원을 확인하고 식별하는&nbsp;과정</p>(자료=삼정KPMG경제연구원): 글로벌 블록체인 시장 규모가 2018~2024년에 연평균 67.3% 성장해서 235억달러(약 30조6910억원)를 넘어설 것으로&nbsp;전망했다.<p>블록체인 생태계 성장에는 이처럼 다양한 것들이 요구되고 있다. 생태계는 계속해서 변화되고 고도화되고 있고, 더욱 규제 정립과 규정 준수 대한 필요성이 주목받고 있다. 특히, 가상자산은 정부가 논의중인 디지털자산기본법 도입 등 입법을 통한 정비 등 국내에서 뿐만 아니라 글로벌적으로 관련 시장에 대한 가이드라인 수립을 위한 다양한 노력이 이어지고 있다. 아직 논의가 이어지고 있지만 불공정거래 처벌, 투자자 보호를 위한 각종 방안 등 가상자산 규제에 대한 글로벌 방향에 맞춰 도입될 것이라 예상되고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>이번 포스트에서는 블록체인 시장의 변화에 따라 직면하게 되는 문제점과 이를 해결할 수 있는 해결 방안에 대해 살펴보고자&nbsp;한다.</p> 블록체인의 문제점을 해결하기 위한&nbsp;규제들 <p>블록체인 기술 기반의 다양한 어플리케이션 서비스의 등장으로, 사용자가 직면하게 되는 다양한 문제들이 발생하고 있다. 특히 탈중앙화, 익명성을 특징으로 지닌 블록체인은 중앙 집권적 서비스들 보다 규제가 약하거나 아예 울타리 밖에서 운용되는 경우가&nbsp;많다.</p><p>이 때문에 사용자는 위험에 노출되어 있는게 현실이다. 최근에는 NFT, 개인지갑 등과 관련하여 개인정보 노출에 대한 위험이 발생하게 되면서 안전한 보호책에 대한 필요도가 증가되고 있다. 토큰 경제가 계속 확장됨에 따라 규제 준수 요구 사항이 더욱 강화되고 자금세탁방지(AML) 및 테러자금조달방지(CFT) 활동에 대한 정책이 속속 등장하고 있는 것이 그&nbsp;이유이다.</p>블록체인 생태계와 컴플라이언스&nbsp;이슈<p>이러한 이유로 NFT, 메타버스, DeFi 등의 환경에서 사용자 보호를 위해서는 KYC와 AML을 통해 각국 정부와 기관의 규제가 새롭게 나타나는 움직임이 보여지고 있다. 수취인이 명확하지 않은 지갑에 대해 입출금을 막거나, 인증되지 않은 지갑에 대해 송금을 막는 등 사용자가 탈중앙화 금융 생태계에서 안전하고 신뢰할 수 있는 활동을 하기 위해서는 이러한 규제의 필요가 요구되고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>최근 블록체인, 가상자산, AI 분야 등 뿐만 아니라 디지털 플랫폼 시장에서 자율 규제에 대한 논의가 계속되고 있다. 자율 규제란 정부가 주도하여 법적으로 무조건 제한하기 보다는 기업, 서비스 주체가 스스로 규율을 정립하고 그를 지켜나가도록 하는 것으로, 다양한 형태로 정부 규제를 대신하고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>이를 통해 정부가 주도적으로 하기 보다는 이들을 지원하는 형태로 시장의 자연스러운 성장을 이끌어내는 것이 목표다. 이와 같은 자율 규제를 활성화하는 것이 투자자 보호 뿐만 아니라 생태계 발전에 큰 디딤돌이 될 것으로 기대되고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>지금까지 살펴본 바와 같이 블록체인 생태계는 복잡하고 계속해서 변화를 겪고 있다. 기업 및 서비스 제공자는 기술, 시장, 규제 변화에 잘 대응하며 사용자들이 신뢰할 수 있는 플랫폼, 솔루션을 제공하는 것이&nbsp;필요하다.</p><p>메타디움은 이러한 시장의 변화에 따른 요구사항에 대비하고 있다. 메타디움 DID 기술을 활용한 KYC 프레임워크, 고위험 발생 방지를 위한 고급 규정 준수를 제공하여 엄격한 규정을 효율적으로 처리하고 문제 발생을 사전에 방지하고자&nbsp;한다.</p><p>또한, 기관/기업이 필요로 하는 KYC, AML 조건을 충족하고 그들이 메타디움 기술을 신뢰하고 그들의 서비스 및 솔루션에 적용하여 더 나은 서비스를 제공할 수 있도록 협업 모델을&nbsp;모색중이다.</p><p>메타디움과 비즈니스 협업 모델에 대한 문의는&nbsp;<a href="https://metadium.com/KR/Contact/Form/Biz">여기</a>로…</p><p>To be continued…</p><p>Writer: Jen&nbsp;Chun</p><p><a href="http://metadium.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Medium</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/wAG6mcxCMJ">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metadium">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://t.me/MetadiumNotice">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadium">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9D%EC%B2%B4%EC%9D%B8-%EC%83%9D%ED%83%9C%EA%B3%84%EC%99%80-%EA%B7%9C%EC%A0%9C-9d405c27adfa">블록체인 생태계와 규제</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I promised an update on the status of all the moving pieces of the Holochain development experience. I wanted to do it once it was ready for hApp devs to port their existing codebases over to the new beta release candidate, and while it took longer than we expected, it’s finally here. And not only that, but the new scaffolding tool is ready for new devs ready to build their first hApp!</p><p>Here’s a full list of things that are ready for existing and new devs:</p>  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2  HDI 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 and HDK 0.1.0-beta-rc.1  The <code>hc</code> command-line tool, including <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code>  Tryorama, the hApp testing framework  The JavaScript client  Integration of all the above into Holonix, the Holochain development environment  <p>Here are the things that are still being updated:</p>  Holochain Launcher for end-users  The DevHub hApp for distributing hApps  The Rust client   Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0: Signed zome calls, API and gossip changes <p>Release date: 15 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: admin API, app API, network protocol</p><p>The developers have packed a fair number of changes into this release in order to present a first release candidate that resembles our vision for the beta release as closely as possible. Read on to learn what you need for refactoring your hApp and tests.</p><p>Breaking (app API): The change with the biggest impact is that all zome calls must have a valid capability and be signed. The end-user Launcher hosts UIs in a WebView and signs calls with the author key using the built-in Lair keystore, which lets it use the author capability for all calls. That means you don’t need to worry about hApps deployed for use in this context. The Holo-hosted context has also had support for built-in signing and now applies it to zome calls. Finally, the web browser context lets you authorise a browser-generated public key for signing calls. There are some other changes to the RPC message envelope format, but the JS client lib already supports those. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1510">#1510</a>)</p><p>Breaking (admin API, app API): The two conductor APIs have had name changes and removals of some deprecated endpoints. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1704"> #1704</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1707"> #1707</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1719"> #1719</a>) In the admin API:</p>  The deprecated <code>InstallApp</code> has been deleted, and <code>InstallAppBundle</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.InstallApp">InstallApp</a></code>. (Note: this endpoint can receive app bundle manifest blobs or filesystem paths.)  The deprecated <code>ActivateApp</code>, <code>DeactivateApp</code>, <code>ListActiveApps</code>, and <code>ListEnabledApps</code> have been removed.  <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> and moved to the app API.  <code>DeleteArchivedCloneCells</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DeleteCloneCell">DeleteCloneCell</a></code>, which only allows the deletion of one cell at a time.  <p>In the app API:</p>  <code>ZomeCall</code> has been renamed to <code>CallZome</code>.  <code>ArchiveCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.DisableCloneCell">DisableCloneCell</a></code>.  <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> (formerly <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code>) has been moved here from the admin API.  <code>GossipInfo</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.NetworkInfo">NetworkInfo</a></code>, which now returns only the number of ops a node expects to receive and their combined size. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)  <p>Breaking (admin API, app API): All data structure names (struct names and fields, enum names and variants) are serialised to snake case over the WebSocket ports. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1694">#1694</a>)</p><p>Breaking (network protocol): Gossip rounds no longer transfer ops; they only share information on what ops should be transferred, for later transfer via a processing queue. This is intended to break up network bottlenecks as part of our ongoing real-world performance improvement work for beta. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)</p><blockquote>We’ll keep testing the impact of this change in the coming weeks, but preliminary automated and human testing with simulated and real networks is looking very good. The DHT feels more ‘live’, which is exactly what we want to see as we get Holochain ready for production-ready hApps serving real users.</blockquote><p>New: The <code>hc</code> command has gotten the ability to run subcommands — any commands in your system’s <code>PATH</code> that start with <code>hc-</code>. This includes the new <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code> commands: <code>hc launch</code> uses the Launcher in CLI mode to start a hApp and open up a WebView window, and <code>hc scaffold</code> is a powerful new tool that lets you build out boilerplate code really quickly. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1680">#1680</a>)</p> Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.1: Bug fix in app installation <p>Release date: 16 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>Bugfix (admin and app APIs): This is exactly why we have release candidates, folks — to find and fix bugs. As part of the work getting the Launcher updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, we discovered some bugs in a couple API functions. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1725">#1725</a>)</p>  The admin API’s <code>InstallApp</code> was returning an empty set of cells; now it returns the cells that were installed.  The app API’s <code>CallZome</code> would let you call functions in disabled clone cells; now it returns an error.   Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 23 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1<br>Breaking changes: HDI, HDK, admin API</p><p>Breaking (HDI, HDK, admin API): The <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/holochain_types/prelude/enum.GrantedFunctions.html"><code>GrantedFunctions</code></a> type in a capability grant has changed to an enum, with which you can specify either a list of functions (as before) or a wildcard. This was prompted by the need to make Tryorama tests easier to write after signed zome calls became mandatory, but it can also be useful for UIs. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1732">#1732</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20221223034701">Read the full release notes</a> for the last three releases.</p> Known issues   The ‘latest’ version of the documentation for the release candidates, including <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.2.0-beta-rc.1/hdi/">hdi</a></code>, <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/hdk/">hdk</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/">holochain_conductor_api</a></code>, are pointing to the pre-beta-RC version; use the version selector at the top of the page to choose the latest version.  The standalone <code>holochain</code> binary sometimes crashes on macOS after startup.  Holochain occasionally errors out on startup when there’s no network connection — if you can reproduce this, please let us know. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1580">#1580</a>)  If a countersigning session fails, the results returned by <code>must_get_*</code> in the middle of the session (either in the zome call or during validation) are inconsistent with the actual DHT state.  macOS builds of the Lair keystore are currently having troubles. We intend to officially support macOS (and Windows via WSL2) for developers by the beta in January.  Passing <code>InstallApp</code> a large hApp bundle as a blob over Websocket can fail; we believe this is because of a WebSocket transfer limit.   Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.10.0 to 0.10.4: Holochain/Holo API unification <p>I’m going to collapse the 0.10.x release series into one changelog, because (a) none of these releases support Holochain 0.1.x (the only supported version is 0.0.175), and (b) the work all pertains to the unification of the Holochain JavaScript client with the Holo Web SDK. Once this work is done, you’ll be able to code to one API and swap out the connection backend based on the environment the app is running.</p>  0.10.0, released 7 December 2022, updates the client to work with Holochain 0.0.175, which included some<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-approaching/#holochain-00175-renaming-things"> changes in the HDK and conductor APIs</a> that ripple out to the client. It also introduces <code>AppAgentClient</code>, a common interface for accessing hApps via a local connection or the Holo hosting network. (Currently the only implementation is <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code>, which uses a local connection.) As the changelog says, “hApp devs will now be able to write the majority of their client code using the <code>AppAgentClient</code> interface, completely agnostic as to whether they're in a pure holochain or holo context.” Support has also been added for the admin API’s <code>GossipInfo</code> endpoint, which lets a UI display DHT health info. (Note: this endpoint will change in Holochain 0.1.0-beta.rc0, which means it’s incompatible with this client release.)  0.10.1, released 8 December 2022, changes the event emitter library from <code>events</code> to <code>emittery</code>, to make bundling easier.  0.10.2, released on 12 December 2022, makes the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> object available to consumers (note that this is hidden again in 0.11.7).  0.10.3, released on 12 December 2022 as well, replace a dependency on lodash with lodash-es to give better compatibility with modern ECMAScript implementations.  0.10.4, released on 14 December, changes the <code>getLauncherEnvironment</code> function to synchronous. This function is exposed by the backend object representing the Launcher environment with its embedded WebViews in place of spawned browser windows.   JavaScript client 0.11.0: Holochain Beta-RC support, signed zome calls <p>Release date: 18 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>In addition to the breaking conductor API changes that came with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 (see above), this client also supports the new requirement that every zome call have a valid capability. In general, this is handled automatically or nearly automatically for all three client contexts that this library supports:</p>  In the Launcher and Holo-hosted contexts, the environment will handle signing using the author capability (that is, all calls are signed using the private key of the source chain owner).  In the web browser context, there’s a new async function <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair()</code> that generates a key in-browser and asks the conductor to authorise it using the admin API. This is not secured right now; the conductor will always approve the request. In the future, conductor managers (such as the Launcher) will likely show some sort of popup asking for authorisation, and the in-browser keypair will be secured with a password on page close. Note that this function has a name change in 0.11.4.   JavaScript client 0.11.1 to 0.11.9: Maintenance, bugfixes, and breaking changes <p>Once we released the updated JavaScript client we discovered some issues that necessitated a series of bugfixes. There are also some refactors of previously introduced functionality. Versions 0.11.1 to 0.11.8 all support Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, while 0.11.9 supports 0.1.0-beta-rc.2.</p>  0.11.1, released on 18 December 2022, introduces a breaking change: the provenance field has been removed from <code>AppAgentCallZomeRequest</code>, because the provenance is provided by the backend in all three contexts (Launcher, web browser, and Holo-hosted).  0.11.2, released on 20 December 2022, fixes a bug in bundling the client module, where the WebSocket serialisation module (written in WASM) wasn’t getting bundled. It also introduces a breaking change, in which all deprecated conductor API functions (see release notes for Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 above) have been removed. Finally, it adds a TypeScript type definition for the new <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> function.  0.11.3, released on 21 December 2022, fixes a bug in serialisation.  0.11.4, released on the same day, refactors the in-browser signing key machinery and introduces one breaking change, renaming <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> to <code>authorizeSigningCredentials</code>.  0.11.5, released on the same day, fixes a bug in the Launcher context implementation.  0.11.6, released on the same day, reverts some of the changes introduced in 0.11.3 that caused a regression in compatibility with the Launcher.  0.11.7, released on the same day, introduces a breaking change, re-hiding the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> implementation introduced in 0.10.2.  0.11.8, released on 21 December 2022, reorganises some code involved in the new signing code and introduces breaking changes as a consequence.  0.11.9, released on 23 December 2022, introduces a breaking change in the introduction of the new wildcard option for capability grants, bringing it up to date with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2’s admin API.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">Read the full changelogs.</a></p> Test framework release notes <p>Note: if you’re writing Rust-based tests with Sweettest, the version included in the <code>holochain</code> crate is always up to date.</p> Tryorama 0.9.1 and 0.9.2: TryCP additions and Holochain 0.0.175 <p>Again, I’m collapsing the 0.9.x series of Tryorama because they target older Holochain versions.</p>  0.9.1, released 26 October 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.165 to 0.0.171, features two additions to TryCP, the distributed test orchestrator. <code>ClientsPlayersOptions</code> can take a partial config parameter, allowing you to specify defaults for all players and fill in specific missing config for each player later. And the shortcut function <code>stopAllTryCpServers</code> lets you shut down multiple servers at once.  0.9.2, released 12 December 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.175, bumps the JavaScript client to 0.10.3 and breaks compatibility with previous Holochain releases. The TryCP orchestrator also now exposes the conductor admin API endpoints <code>get_dna_definition</code> and <code>grant_zome_call_capability</code>.   Tryorama 0.10.0: Holochain Beta-RC support <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>This is the release needed to test your hApp against the updated Holochain — and test Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.* and report any bugs you find! Building on the newest JavaScript client, it reflects all the changes to the conductor APIs that I described above.</p> Tryorama 0.10.1: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p><p>Breaking: After updating Tryorama to the new beta release candidate of Holochain, tests became much more challenging to write because of the requirement to sign all zome calls. Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 introduced wildcard function matches for cap grants for this very reason. This version adds support for wildcards, allowing you to generate a single wildcard grant at the beginning of your test script.</p><p>To update your tests for the Tryorama 0.10 series, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/152/files">check the diffs</a> to see all the name changes, removals, and additions, and read the excellent<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.10.0/docs/tryorama.md"> documentation</a>.</p> The new scaffolding tool: like Rails, but for dApps! <p>Guillem Cordoba, creator of the previous scaffolding GUI tool, has applied his skill once again to this tool after receiving feedback from other devs in the community.</p><blockquote>Now it’s a lot &nbsp;like Ruby on Rails’ celebrated scaffolder, which empowered a generation of developers to create basic, working web apps in just a few minutes. This brings that same power to distributed web apps!</blockquote><p>It’s all driven by the command line, and it lets you create and edit project folders, DNAs, zomes, UIs, entry and link types, and collections. It’ll even update existing code as you add new features to your hApp.</p><p>We think this scaffolding tool will be a game-changer for hApp development. Now, newcomers to Holochain who are comfortable with the command line can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">create and run a demo forum hApp</a> in less than a minute, and create the basic code for their own hApp in less than an hour. Because the design decisions involved in building a hApp are slightly different from what devs are used to, it guides you through sensible default choices. It’ll also likely have contextual help in the future.</p><p>What it makes accessible for new hApp devs, it also makes quick and easy for experienced ones. A lot of boilerplate code can be generated in moments with the various scaffolding commands available.</p><p>I’ll feature the scaffolding tool in the next Dev Pulse, but until then, try <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">generating a sample hApp</a> learn more about its <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/happ-setup/">project structure</a> in the Holochain developer website, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_scaffolding_cli/latest/holochain_scaffolding_cli/">check out the full documentation</a>. I think you’ll like what you see, no matter your level of experience.</p> Go forth and code! <p>If you’re a hApp developer with existing code, now is the time to update your zome, UI, and test code and look for bugs and rough edges in Holochain. Your <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/">feedback</a> will help us get Holochain ready for its beta release.</p><p>If you’re a newcomer with some Rust and JavaScript experience who wants to start building hApps, I invite you to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">install Holochain</a>, read the Core Concepts, and try creating something this weekend!</p><p>If you’re an end-user who’s eager to start using a real hApp, we have a working-but-unreleased version of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Launcher</a> with greatly improved network performance. We're testing it internally and fix any bugs before we release it. Once that happens, you’ll find a sample sticky notes / kanban app in the hApp store, and you can expect to see more apps as devs update them.</p><blockquote>Happy new year to everyone who follows the Gregorian calendar. I wish you great success whatever you’re up to, and I’m excited about all the ways that a rapidly maturing Holochain might be able to support your endeavours.</blockquote><p>And by the way — I love talking with people about this stuff. If you’ve got a plan for a way to use Holochain to support new ways of creating, sharing, connecting and doing business, come to the <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Holochain developers’ Discord</a> and share your ideas. I’ll be there to help you figure out how Holochain can fit into your plan.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@philton88?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Parker Hilton</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/JqDNL8vBsHs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>In case you missed some of our updates the last few months, here is a recap of our latest technology upgrades and partnerships.</p> New Partnership With BurstIQ  <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq">BurstIQ Makes Health Data Verifiable, Secure, and Portable With Dock</a> <p>BurstIQ is a company that provides data solutions powered by blockchain technology for the healthcare industry. The company’s LifeGraph platform enables businesses to manage sensitive data while complying with people’s data rights and giving individuals ownership and control over their personal information.</p><p>BurstIQ uses Dock’s Certs API in order to turn any health data into a Verifiable Credential that is portable, verifiable, and secure within and outside of their system.</p><p>Check out:</p>  Blog: <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/blockchain-and-health-care">BurstIQ Use Cases That Leverage Verifiable Credentials</a>  Podcast: <a href="https://youtu.be/jyjmrS1gQCw">Blockchain in Healthcare with Dr. Wendy Charles, BurstIQ’s Chief Scientific Officer</a>  Webinar: <a href="https://youtu.be/QpnFEzXuQ3I">Demo of how BurstIQ is using Verifiable Credentials to ensure data portability and integrity</a>  Press release: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/burstiqs-lifegraph-toolkit-expands-to-include-verifiable-credentials-solution-by-dock-labs-301641297.html">BurstIQ's LifeGraph Toolkit Expands to Include Verifiable Credentials Solution by Dock Labs</a>   New Feature  Dock Certs’ New Certificate Designer <p>The <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> platform enables users to easily issue, verify, and manage Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). We released the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/certificate-designer/">Certificate Designer</a> that allows users to customize the design of their credentials with their own brand or preferred style.</p> Tech Upgrades <p>1) Anonymous Credentials for the Dock Wallet</p><p>With anonymous credentials, the Dock Wallet can now enable users to prove a claim about themselves without revealing the actual details that support the proof. For example, someone could prove they live in an eligible city to qualify for a program without revealing the actual city. </p><p>2) White Label Wallet Service </p><p>Organizations that don’t want to spend resources building their own wallet can simply use &nbsp;the functionality of the Dock Wallet and offer their own branded wallet to their customers.</p><p>3) New Feature: Communication Between EVM Module and Native Modules</p><p>This release will enable developers to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/enhanced-evm-contract-capabilities/">build richer dApps</a> with the flexibility of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts and use Dock's native features like DIDs. This was not possible before because the smart contracts didn’t have direct access to the data on the Dock blockchain. With our new feature, the EVM smart contracts can now read data like DIDs, revocation statuses, and more in addition to being able to verify signatures from DIDs and credentials.</p><p>4) Circom Language Integration: Anonymous Credentials Protocol Update</p><p>Previously, the expressivity of our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/circom-language-integration/">anonymous credential proving system</a> was limited. The holder could prove things like “I have a credential” or that “certain attributes across my credentials are the same”. But verifiers couldn’t request proofs for more complicated conditions like the sum of certain attributes should be less or more than a certain value.</p><p>Examples of these more complex requests:</p>  Someone wants to prove that his yearly income is $20,000 or less to show that he qualifies for a government benefit  Someone wants to prove that her yearly income is $200,000 or more to show that she is eligible to access an investment fund  <p>Because of these limitations, we updated our anonymous credentials protocol to enable developers to express "predicates" (checks that return true or false) on credential attributes using the Circom language. This language is a developer-friendly programming language that could also be used with our proving system. </p><p>Here are examples of applications that demonstrate the use of Circom along with credentials: </p><p>1. The blood group is not AB-</p><p>2. The grade is either A+, B, or C+ but nothing else</p> Community Highlights <p>Latest numbers in our growing community:</p>  <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/docknetwork">CoinMarketCap</a>: 12,100 followers  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a>: 5,800 members  <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a>: 63,500 followers  <a href="https://www.dock.io/community">Turkish Community</a>: 1,200 members  <p>Dock’s Web3 ID on Product Hunt</p><p>Thanks to our community for helping Dock be the #1 Web3 Product of the Week on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>!

Image by Jakub&nbsp;Novacek<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>It’s an extraordinary mystery. Despite all the incredible technologies developed to smash atoms and build telescopes able to see billions of years into the universe’s past, scientists are unable to see or measure 85 -95% of everything that exists. Yes, 85% of it, which is why it’s called ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’. We know it’s there because of its immense gravitational pull. Everything else in the universe revolves around it. But we cannot see it, touch it, or measure it. Amazing. And extremely challenging for theories about how the universe&nbsp;works.</p><p>Modern economics has its own dark matter and dark energy. Virtually all economic activities revolve around it, pulled by its immense gravitational force. But it remains largely unseen and unmeasured. This economic dark matter/energy is called&nbsp;people.</p><p>Economics textbooks are full of endless discussions of entities such as firms, markets, products and prices. Now and again you might find a reference to ‘consumers’, but these are just an abstract entity used to explain something else called ‘demand’, which is far more convenient because it can be turned into a number and used as part of mathematical equations where people somehow get forgotten.</p><p>In economics, real people do not exist. Their lives are not seen and their activities remain unmeasured. For example, the concept ‘Gross Domestic Product’ ignores all the work done by individuals and households to maintain homes, bring up children, care for loved ones, and so on. These activities are not traded for money in markets and they are not undertaken by ‘firms’ or organisations so, in economics-land, they don’t get&nbsp;counted.</p><p>Likewise, every activity undertaken by organisations is investigated and measured down to the finest detail. How to improve its productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and performance? But meanwhile all the complex things that individuals have to do to manage their lives remain unseen and unmeasured, just like the physicists’ dark matter. We all know it’s there lurking in the background. But somehow it never comes into&nbsp;focus.</p><p>If you read our last three blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">productivity</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">joined up services</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">go-to-market processes</a> you might think we are falling into the same organisation-centric trap. These blogs seem to focus on organisations’ efficiency and productivity — and the way we talk about them there, they do (mostly).</p><p>But they account for less than half the picture, because the immense benefits we are highlighting don’t stop there — and don’t even start there. They are a byproduct, a part of something much bigger: a change taking place in the dark matter of the economy itself, outside of organisations’ sight and control, in the lives of individuals and the unexplored realms of household management.</p> Working the dark matter of the&nbsp;economy <p>For Mydex as a Community Interest Company this isn’t a problem. It’s our bread and butter. Our mission and our purpose is the community we serve: individuals and their households and communities. It starts with and exists inside the economy’s dark matter, empowering people with their own data via personal data stores that help them access, hold and use their own data for their own purposes independently of organisations that may have collected data about them, so that they can manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>For those mesmerised by traditional organisation-centric economic theories this is alien and baffling. If everything that matters and counts is done by organisations and happens inside organisations, why bother with anything that happens elsewhere, in the dark&nbsp;matter?</p><p>We have two answers to&nbsp;this.</p><p>First, the ultimate purpose of all economic activity is people — not profit, or productivity, or growth. That may sound like a sentimental cliche but it’s a simple fact. If an economic activity doesn’t in some way alleviate human suffering or enable and enrich their lives, it’s pointless. Profits, productivity and growth are just a means to this&nbsp;end.</p><p>It’s hardly a new idea. Aristotle (who died in 322 BC, 2300 years ago) stated it perfectly in his Nicomachean Ethics when he said “wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else”. So why not address the end directly, rather than focus only on the&nbsp;means?</p><p>Second, because when the dark matter stirs it triggers earthquakes in the organisational part of the economic universe that we can see and measure. Mydex’s purpose is improving the lives of people, which takes us inside the economy’s dark matter into individuals’ lives, independently of and beyond the reach of the organisations that seem to dominate&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it was in the process of doing this that we discovered something important. Helping individuals and households improve their personal productivity and capabilities can also help service providers do the same thing: by enabling safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing (which is what Mydex’s personal data logistics infrastructure does). Transforming the economics of organisations is a byproduct of transforming the economics of the household, not the other way&nbsp;round.</p>  When we highlight the ways in which data sharing helps service providers <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost)</a> these benefits arise from work done elsewhere to help individuals eliminate their own FERC: all the time, effort and (sometimes) money they have to spend seeking and accessing information about themselves, gathering it, presenting it and proving it to service providers.  When we highlight the way better data logistics <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">helps service providers to deliver better, more joined up services at lower cost</a>, this arises from our efforts to reduce the frustration and effort individuals experience in being forced to provide the same information again and again (often to the same organisation), just to complete one, single&nbsp;task.  When we highlight the way PDS-based data sharing can <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">streamline organisations’ go-to-market costs</a>, it comes from our efforts to help individuals find and access the services they need, when they need&nbsp;them.  <p>Yes. We are talking about an economic revolution that will transform how organisations work. But this revolution doesn’t actually come from inside organisations. It is not one of their ‘innovations’. It starts inside households, with individuals trying to manage their day to day lives better. It comes from inside the economy’s dark matter (which is one of the reasons why traditional organisations struggle so hard to see it and comprehend it).</p> The economy’s unseen, unmeasured gravitational force <p>What we are doing isn’t new by the way. It’s not as if the dark matter of individuals and households has only just popped into existence. Far from it. It’s always been there, exerting its gravitational pull.</p><p>Take food. The money price that people pay for food in shops is just a fraction of what this food costs them: all the time and effort spent planning meals, shopping, cooking, eating, washing up, acquiring and maintaining utensils, and so on. Likewise, the value of this food isn’t limited to its taste or nutrition either. Preparing and eating food is a deeply emotional, social thing. It’s got countless dimensions of non-priced, non-material value including sociability and bonding with other people, demonstrating love, the joy of developing and using a skill, demonstrating status, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The measures, processes and purposes that explain households’ use of food have got very little to do with the measures, processes and purposes that obsess food producers. The latter hardly touch the former, which remain like dark matter: a mysterious gravitational force in the producers’ background.</p><p>Yet it’s this dark matter of the personal, human costs and the personal, human dimensions of value that has shaped the food industry over decades. Ready meals, fast food outlets, posh restaurants, home deliveries: they all different ways of addressing this personal, human cost/value equation. It is this invisible gravitational pull — of what it costs the person in terms of time, energy and emotion and the value it brings to that person (also in terms of time, energy and emotion) — that shapes everything the food industry&nbsp;does.</p><p>This is true for the economy as a whole. The 20th century was defined by the rise of the ‘consumer society’. This novel economic arrangement revolved around households acquiring and using thousands of manufactured gadgets: washing machines, fridges, vacuum cleaners, kettles, motor cars, radios, TVs, microwaves, computers and so on — a far, far cry from earlier times that revolved around land and agriculture.</p><p>Why were consumer products so popular? Because they transformed personal and household productivity, freeing up time and energy that enabled people to enrich their lives in other ways. The washing machine saved (mostly) women seven hours of labour a week. Central heating removed six hours a week shovelling coal and dust. Fridges helped people reduce time spent shopping, improved access to fresh healthy food, and reduced food waste. The motor car gave individuals and households freedoms and opportunities that were unthinkable before it became affordable.</p><p>It was this impact on peoples’ day-to-day lives that made this economic revolution so compelling and exciting, and it happened because of one basic thing. It was achieved by taking the machine out of the factory and making it available as a tool in the hands of individuals and households — empowering people in their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>In the early days of the industrial revolution the machine remained inside the factory. Cotton mills may have transformed clothing production, but what people purchased was the cotton product, not the machine. But with the 20th personal productivity revolution they also bought machines in the form of household gadgets to use for their own purposes.</p><p>The personal data revolution is doing the same with personal data. It is taking data out of the organisation and domesticating and democratising it, turning it into a tool in the hands of individuals and households, empowering people to use their data to eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) and to organise and manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>This is worth doing in its own right, regardless of its impact on organisations. But when it impacts both, the effects are economically transformational, just as the consumer goods revolution was transformational.</p> A critical&nbsp;insight <p>Returning to the potential benefits for service providers, there is one crucial point that stands out. Without grasping this point it’s impossible to see or understand what’s going in. None of the benefits to organisations we’ve been talking about can happen without individuals first being empowered with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The elemental force driving this economic revolution is not more of the same — organisations empowering themselves to do more, better — but something new and unfamiliar: citizen empowerment. Organisations benefit only as a byproduct of citizens being empowered with their own data. Without citizens’ ability to gather, store and use their data for their own purposes, independently of organisations that may be collecting data about them, this revolution simply cannot&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To this degree, the revolution is taking place outside of organisations jurisdiction, sight and control. In the dark matter. For those immersed in organisation-centric views of the world, where everything that matters is generated inside organisations and done by organisations, this can be utterly baffling and disconcerting. Like dark matter. But that doesn’t make it any the less&nbsp;true.</p><p>Yet this is still just scratching the surface. The 20th century consumer goods revolution created entirely new industries, employing millions of people. The personal data revolution will do the same.

				  Indicio’s public benefit mission is to advance decentralized identity. How did we do in 2022?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio began as a conventional corporation, but its founders made the decision, a little over a year ago, to reincorporate as a Public Benefit Corporation: Our founding mission — advancing decentralized identity — would be our public benefit mission.</p>
<p>The rationale for this was simple: decentralized identity technology has the capacity to protect individual privacy, enhance digital security, enable consent in data sharing, and provide a pathway to formal identity for hundreds of millions of people currently without any legal means of proving who they are. In short, it can deliver significant material benefits to society besides serving as the missing verification layer to the internet.</p>
<p>Reincorporating as a Public Benefit Corporation means that these material benefits must shape how we do business—that shareholders and stakeholders must align when it comes to business decisions so that we stay on mission.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? How did we advance decentralized identity as a public benefit? The answers are laid out in our first Public Benefit Report — along with our assessment of what we want to achieve in our public benefit mission in 2023.</p>
