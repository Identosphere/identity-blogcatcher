			 2021: Digital Assets Become Officially Accepted by Financial Institutions 
<p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2021’s first edition of Tokeny Insights. This time last year I wrote the <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-insights-january-2020-the-rise-of-defi/">newsletter</a> stating that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) would make big advancements. Since then, the DeFi industry has grown over 2500% in terms of value locked up in smart contracts. So, what for 2021?</p>
<p>2021 will be the year institutions officially and publicly embrace digital assets. Large corporations have already been doing so with crypto-assets. FinTechs such as Paypal and Square have adopted Bitcoin for their millions of users, institutions such as Microstrategy and Ruffer have announced over nearly $2bn in combined Bitcoin purchases. OTC trading firms have reported more institutions continuing to buy Bitcoin. There have been a string of optimistic predictions from the likes of JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, perhaps giving insight into their crypto positions.</p>
<p>These major capital market players are being encouraged by progressive regulation. Following Visa’s announcement that they were backing a major stablecoin, the US regulator announced that banks and saving associations can use public blockchains and stablecoins for settlement, a major milestone for the North American and global market. Luxembourg, which holds the most amount of funds in terms of value outside of the US, will also make a progressive announcement shortly. The market will continue to be educated this year and compounded by a large portion of FOMO from financial players, there will be further public blockchain adoption this year.</p>
<p>What does this mean for security tokens? Our industry will benefit from the increased adoption and reputation gain of digital assets. As crypto-assets get closer to becoming mainstream and accepted financial products, financial players will move their assets to the blockchain. Institutional grade custody solutions are therefore required. So far, the only custody solutions available have been made for crypto-assets, and in 2021 we expect to see some secure custody solutions for blockchain-based securities. Developments will be seen across the lifecycle and particularly the secondary market: they will realise the improved transferability of private securities.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Reality has just caught up with us. The new COVID-19 variants (there seems to be a new one every week since the beginning of the year) is spreading around the world at a worrisome pace. Most western countries are back to strict restrictions with potential new confinements looming before Spring. The vaccination campaign is extremely slow. The Biden Administration just revealed on day two that it inherited a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan and that it must now start from scratch. Concretely, what it means is that employees will continue to work from home and there is no end in sight for the near future. Also, the FBI recently reported that the number of complaints about cyberattacks to their Cyber Division is up to as many as 4,000 a day. That represents a 400% increase from what they were seeing pre-coronavirus. The targets: corporations of all sizes, governments, and critical infrastructures.</p>

 Safiya Noble, author of Algorithms of Oppression, on Big Tech and Government misuse of data and how it affects&nbsp;users <p>In the tenth episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble, Author of Algorithms of Oppression and Associate Professor at the <a href="https://is.gseis.ucla.edu/">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the Department of Information Studies</a>. During this discussion, she spoke about how search engines like Google reinforce discrimination, the role of government regulations in protecting data, and why big corporates are now talking about data protection rights. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>“Here we are, in 2021, and the concerns that I wrote about and I’ve documented in the book are still just as timely as they were, seven to eight years ago. It is an interesting experience to write something that remains timely because the problems have become more acute each year, ” says Noble as she talks about her book Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism published in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>Noble says that Web 1.0, the early web knowledge, was mostly managed by subject matter experts, librarians, and deeply knowledgeable people. If anyone remembers the days of being on the internet before a search engine, it was clunkier. It required time and energy to look through and discern what was legitimate and what wasn’t. “I think with the legacy of that early history of knowledge organization on the web — search engines inherited the trust from those early experts who were doing that kind of work. The assumption for a lot of people is that somebody is curating the expert knowledge here. They will that experts have decided what should be ranked first and what should be ranked at a millionth place,” says Noble. However, this is not the&nbsp;case.</p> How Search Engines manipulate Users <p>Noble mentions that plenty of research shows that exposure to racial stereotypes will affect how people see marginalized groups. So if you live in a society where there is a lot of blatant, racist stereotyping, people will become desensitized to the groups that are being stereotyped. And those groups will be subject to not only dehumanizing images and ideas, but they will also be subject to more harm because the public is desensitized to their humanity.</p><p>“Google is an advertising platform; people think that it’s a fact-checker. People turn to Google to fact-check things that they find in social media that might be off. And then use Google as an authoritative yes or no. Google is also rife with racist disinformation and propaganda, sexist propaganda. That is incredibly unhelpful and I think increasingly has consequences in the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>The public’s awareness of stereotypes is a reason why, particularly in film and television, we have seen a widespread reduction of racist and sexist tropes in media. This has been coupled with the positive representation of women, minorities, and LGBTQ&nbsp;people.</p> How Big Tech responds to Criticism <p>Noble feels that authors and journalists who write about large internet companies are opening a ticket. In a way, you get a signal that someone needs to attend to this problem and solve it and close the&nbsp;ticket.</p><p>“I think of my book like a giant book of tickets that Google was able to take. I certainly noticed that they attended to many of the concerns that I both document in that book — but also that many of my colleagues, journalists, and scholars have put out there. One thing we know is that even though the leadership and founders of Google will say that they don’t do anything to affect the search results, we know that they absolutely do. And the deeper the public relations fiasco or, the hotter the temperature is for them, the more likely they are to change the results. One of the things that I encourage people to do is to look at what the criticisms have been over the last ten years and whether those problems remain. That will tell you a lot about the dynamic way in which the company is constantly shifting search results, based on a political environment or based on criticism — or based on who’s paying the&nbsp;most.”</p> Government Regulation to Protect Data: the ultimate solution? <p>Noble notes that many of the US companies have been funded and heavily supported by the US government. This includes companies that are household names such as Google and Facebook. Then there are other lesser understood companies by the public, like Palantir or other surveillance technology companies.</p><p>“When you talk about a regulatory environment, one of the challenges is that legislative governments, especially the United States, have a unique relationship to many companies in the tech sector as they can access hundreds of millions of Americans’ data and information. They have an open backdoor and can come in with law enforcement and other kinds of agencies and find out all kinds of information about&nbsp;people.”</p><p>There’s a tremendous amount of effort by governments to think about regulating the use of AI. Regulation is complicated because those governments are also deeply invested in using AI. Noble feels that civil and human rights framings and laws are very important. One of the places we will have an incredible amount of power in various publics is through civil and human rights and sovereign rights, laws, and legal protections. In some cases, the damages that have to be paid by companies to the public and to individuals, repair, and restoration that must be made for. For example, the tech sector’s role in collapsing many important social institutions, public institutions, just by virtue of not paying taxes or offshoring profits.</p><p>“You can have an infinite number of data profiles that might exist about us in any given system at any given moment with 1000s of companies. This becomes a really difficult thing to regulate. How do you call back all that data? Is it even possible? I feel like it’s a bit of smoke and mirrors here to satisfy public outrage about the way these systems are tracking and profiling us and over-determining our futures in many cases? They’re creating predictions about us, whether we should go to jail, stay in jail; whether we should get health care or not; whether we should get into college or university; whether we should get a job. This is where predictive analytics are being used on information about&nbsp;us.”</p> The Future of Decentralization <p>According to Safiya, the majority of the world is not in a position to have the luxury of thinking about a technical redesign. But these technologies will continue to get beta tested and practiced out on&nbsp;us.</p><p>“I think what we are seeing is more technology, more data than ever in human history. And we have more global inequality, economic and social inequality to go with it. The question is, to what degree are these [decentralized] technologies going to be used in undoing inequality? To what degree will these technologies be able to redistribute wealth and the largest of the kind of collective productivity of humankind?”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>0:58 — 7:15: Safiya Noble’s journey from the world of advertising tech to now research on Search Engines, Big Tech and Algorithms</p><p>7:15 — 13:11: How do algorithms become Algorithms of Oppression</p><p>12:26 — 18:20: How do Search Engines manipulate our&nbsp;minds</p><p>18:20 — 25:39: How are Google and Big Tech responding to all the criticism for their Algorithms?</p><p>25: 40 — 34:00: Is Government regulation the solution to protect data&nbsp;rights?</p><p>34:00 — 40:00: Is decentralization of data the solution to fight algorithms of oppression?</p><p>41:00 — 49:39: What is corporate America’s answer to the social dilemma and using consumer data to increase&nbsp;profits?</p><p>50:00 to end: How millennials can bring a change in the&nbsp;future</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<blockquote>On January 11, 2021, the public beta version of <a href="https://web.abtwallet.io/">ABT web Wallet</a> developed by <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/">ArcBlock</a>, a leading DApps and blockchain platform for one month is unveiled.</blockquote><p>When the new wallet is released for developers and users to test, ArcBlock senior engineer Wang Shijun answered the following questions —</p> What is the original intention of the development of ABT Web&nbsp;Wallet? <p>To improve user experience. At present, the native version of ABT Wallet requires frequent QR code scanning and the web version of ABT Wallet will make the user experience better without reducing security or reducing functions. The ABT Wallet follows exactly the same protocol as the native version of ABT Wallet and will eventually have the same functionality.</p> Who are the major users of ABT Web Wallet, developers or digital currency&nbsp;users? <p>ABT Web Wallet serves developers at this stage. We hope developers can debug Blocklet without leaving their computers or even their browsers. But finally, ABT Web Wallet will serve all users in the entire ArcBlock ecosystem, including ABT Node operators, Blocklet operators, resource miners, developers, and end-users to help them manage tokens, NFT, digital identities, and verifiable certificates just like the native ABT&nbsp;Wallet.</p> What are the differences between ABT Wallet and MetaMask&nbsp;Wallet? <p>ArcBlock’s ABT Wallet and Ethereum’s MetaMask wallet are two different entrances of ecosystems, both of which are completely offline wallets. In our Rollup solution, ABT Wallet may have Ethereum support similar to MetaMask.</p> How to use ABT Web Wallet and mobile wallet together? <p>The ABT Web Wallet is fully compatible with the native wallet, which means users and developers can import and export data back and forth between the two&nbsp;wallets.</p> What are the major features of the ABT Web Wallet public beta version released&nbsp;today? <p>This public beta version implements the same features as the native wallet listed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Profile management  Basic wallet management  Basic apps management  Combination with ABT Node, Wallet Playground, and other&nbsp;products  Compatibility with native ABT&nbsp;Wallet   What issues do we hope users to help the R&amp;D team to detect from their experiencing the public beta version of ABT Web&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Welcome our users visit <a href="https://web.abtwallet.io/">https://web.abtwallet.io</a> to get started and to raise any compatible, interaction issues and improvement suggestions to <a href="https://github.com/blocklet/abt-wallet-issues">https://github.com/blocklet/abt-wallet-issues</a></p> What are the development milestones and ultimate goals of the ABT Web Wallet released&nbsp;today? <p>We will iterate ABT Web Wallet at the pace of one version per week and our priority will be given to support on-chain transfer, NFT management, on-chain data sync optimization, etc.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/arcblock/abt-web-wallet-public-beta-is-released-c7d91c976acd">ABT Web Wallet Public Beta is Released</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/arcblock">ArcBlock</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>If you use Puppet to automate configuration management across dynamic server fleets, there’s a question about identity &amp; access management – how do you get accounts and credentials on the machines?</p>

<p>A common practice is to push SSH Keys for every admin user to every server. This has major security implications, however. What happens when an administrator leaves the company? It is usually up to someone to clear out those keys on each machine, oftentimes a manual process.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to front your servers with an LDAP interface, configuring a local PAM module on each machine to sync local server accounts with an upstream Identity Provider. This leaves a significant operational burden, however. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? I doubt you do.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Puppet Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create your Puppet project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>puppet_token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure the sample puppet code 

<p>Clone our sample code <code>git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-puppet-example.git</code></p>

<p>Optionally, review the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> contents</p>

<p>This code first installs the Okta ASA server agent binaires. It supports multiple Linux distros using the server distro family to identify the ideal installation tasks:</p>

   <code>#Class for installing ASA
class asa_setup {
    if $facts['os']['family'] == 'Debian' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_deb
    }
    elsif $facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_rpm
    }
    elsif $facts['os']['family'] == 'Suse' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_rpm
    }
    else {
        notice("This sample doesn't work yet on: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
    }
}
</code>   

<p>After installing the agent binaries, the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> code:</p>

 
   Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name), 
   Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
   Starts the ASA server agent 
 

<p>Edit the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> file and update line 2, with the asa enrollment token.</p>

   <code># ASA Enrollment token
$asa_enrollment_token = "ENROLLMENT_TOKEN_HERE"
</code>   

<p>Validate the example syntax: <code>puppet parser validate okta-asa-sample.pp</code></p>

<p>Validate the example in the primary server (without executing the change): <code>puppet apply okta-asa-sample.pp --noop</code></p>

 Test the sample code of your Puppet Project 

<p>It’s time to test the code. To do this, apply the sample on your Puppet primary server to enroll this server in Okta ASA.</p>

<p>Tip: For this tutorial, I’m using a test environment. For use in production, we recommend tests isolated in a new puppet client before running on production clients and primary servers.</p>

<p>To test the sample code Puppet primary server in ASA, enter <code>puppet apply okta-asa-sample.pp</code></p>

<p>To confirm the primary server is enrolled, check the list of servers in ASA:</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the primary server enrolled, let’s move to the clients.</p>

<p>Copy the sample manifest to the environment folder. For example: <code>cp okta-asa-sample.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production</code></p>

<p>Access your puppet clients and execute the command <code>puppet agent -tv</code> (or wait until the clients fetch the new configuration from the primary server).</p>

<p>The Puppet client will fetch the manifest, install and configure ASA, and return the following:</p>

   <code>root@cicd-puppet-3-ubuntu:~# puppet agent -tv
Info: Using configured environment 'production'
Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
Info: Retrieving plugin
Info: Loading facts
Info: Caching catalog for cicd-puppet-3-ubuntu.acme.com

Notice: /Stage[main]/Enroll_server/Service[sftd]: Triggered 'refresh' from 1 event
</code>   

<p>In ASA, you will see the servers enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code></p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS
asa-puppet-1-main           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.101
asa-puppet-2-centos         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.102
asa-puppet-3-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.103
asa-puppet-4-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.104
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-puppet-3-ubuntu
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

<p>Note: Wait… What Okta ASA does for the login?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). - The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolith LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the sample on some clients, you may expand to the rest of your infrastructure and tweak the sample to take full advantage of your Puppet environment – i.e. Bolt, Hiera, secret management tools, and best practices.</p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your catalogs and allow consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

<p>M: It’s going well, thank you. We were fortunate to secure initial funding for the identification of market opportunities by Business Finland’s Digital Trust programme. The programme helps Finnish companies build global business on digital trust and security.</p>
<p>In June, shortly after the press release you mentioned, we launched Vorna ID in the Finnish market with multiple partners at our own Digital Live event. &nbsp;Chris Hudson from RapidLEI also gave a great presentation introducing the LEI to the many digital identity professionals.</p>
<p>And since then we’ve been working on national-level B2G (business-to-government) and B2B (business-to-business) customer opportunities in several sectors, such as manufacturing and financial services. So all round, an exciting year despite the obvious challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: How exciting is the vLEI programme? 
<p>M: It’s very exciting for us especially given all the activity now in B2C Self Sovereign Identity and what it could mean for future B2B use cases. For example, the vLEI could provide reliable information about the organisation’s decision makers, which could be used in defining the organisation’s main users for a given digital resource.</p>
<p>Vorna ID already has experience in trust services requirements and with remote identification, made possible by the new eIDAS regulation, this opens up opportunities for further advances in the automation of onboarding processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What do you see as the opportunities from the vLEI? 
<p>M: We all know that B2B relationships can be fairly complex when it comes to sharing and using confidential data. There’s an obvious market opportunity in leveraging verifiable credentials, such as the vLEI, in identity management to streamline online transactions. This kind of digital identity information could be used online, for example, over an OpenID Connect claim or in off-line transactions in decentralised identity networks, for example in blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What about Vorna ID specifically – how are you responding to this news? 
<p>M: We’re working alongside RapidLEI, as our LOU (Local Operating Unit), in a strategic partnership to enable new digital identity use cases. Our target for this year is to execute pilot projects for governmental and financial services use cases. For us, the vLEI could also enable automated business partner onboarding and identity governance, which were also looking into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What else does 2021 hold for Vorna ID? 
<p>M: Naturally, a big part will be working with current customer cases with our reseller and consulting partners here in Finland. In addition, we’re planning to participate in development projects within a Finnish manufacturing co-creation ecosystem, DIMECC.</p>

 <p>This article is also <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/choix-machine-learning-decentralise-pour-repondre-a-la-crise-sanitaire/">available in French</a>.</p>
<p>The current health crisis has shown how essential it is to have data in order to make political decisions. But also how sensitive some data is, and should only be handled with care. This is evidenced by the current debates in France around the relevance of the 6 p.m. curfew, the tracing of Covid contact cases and the creation of a medical database. In all three cases, for the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/tousanticovid">TousAntiCovid application</a> as for the Health Data Hub, the choice of solutions that centralize data raises questions and concerns. This centralizing model, where all data are brought together in a single database, is fortunately not the only one possible. There are alternatives that make it possible to analyze the data and extract indicators to guide research and public policies, while guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of the data. Solutions that ensure that citizens retain control over their personal information, that it cannot be used without their consent.</p>
<p>We present here one of these solutions that allows training an AI with the data of many individuals without ever disclosing it to third parties, thanks to a decentralized protocol.</p>
 Against COVID: how long to keep sport halls and other public places closed? 
<p>Today, at a time when the whole of France is adopting new restrictive measures (general curfew at 6 p.m.), is it still legitimate to ask this question? The answer is yes and it will also arise as the government will lift these restrictions:</p>
 
 Will we have to open restaurants, bars, sport halls, swimming pools, theaters and other cultural places? In which order ? In what conditions ? 
 Will our children still have to wear a mask from 6 years old? 
 Should we let the most fragile personnel be confined? 
 Will we have to close the school canteens? nurseries? to reopen universities? 
 
<p>One thing is certain: an epidemic covers very large scales, and behaves differently according to many criteria, in particular temporal and spatial, which complicates the isolation of relevant variables.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a>, we bring an innovative approach and will try to answer this first question as an application case: does closing the sport halls contribute to hinder the virus?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, answering such a question as with other questions put forward previously requires centralizing the data of an entire population.<br>
Indeed, this would amount to studying correlations between a large number of personal and shared data of a population:</p>
 
 frequency of attendance of the room 
 medical background 
 age 
 other sports activities practiced 
 etc 
 
<p>To analyze this data, the state of the art - that is, current knowledge - has traditionally focused on methods requiring calculations to be made on a server that centralizes all the necessary and relevant data from a population.</p>
<p>Two major obstacles emerge:</p>
 
 how to recover all this scattered and diverse data? 
 
<p>The data of a population is scattered and the current centralized approaches cannot merge all the silos of existing services, which would require us to launch partnerships with <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps">Google Maps</a> , <a href="https://www.withings.com/fr/fr/">Withings</a>, the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP) and all the other regional hospitals, the Health Data Hub (HDH). As many French and American players would make the legal framework nebulous given the different laws.</p>
 
 how can we not allow misuse of this data? 
 
<p>Today, anonymizing such diverse data is mathematically impossible without degrading the useful value of the data.</p>
 Decentralized approach to personal cloud 
<p>This complexity in the pooling of data to respond to such a study had been anticipated at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> even before the health context that we are currently experiencing. One step ahead, in 2018 we launched Cozy, a French personal cloud and open source - a personal data platform in which the individual brings together all their data to have both more control and more uses. An astonishing paradigm then emerged where the individual can thus benefit from services mobilizing all their data, all their digital privacy, without any data leaving their home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is this ambition to allow decentralization at the individual level by providing them with a personal cloud which constitutes a different and innovative approach that can answer the question asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who is legitimate to collect and control all your personal data? What conditions must be met for digital technology to be structurally at the service of democracy?”</p>
</blockquote>
 Personal Cloud: an innovative and different approach from the centralized approach of GAFA which involves the user 
<p>The idea of Cozy Cloud is to empower individuals with a personal cloud, a digital home that brings together all their personal data because the individual is the only legitimate person to access all of his/her data.</p>
<p>Applied to the example of the closure of sport halls, with his/her personal Cozy cloud, the individual can:</p>
 
 automatically retrieve geolocation data from his smartphone in his personal cloud which indicates the precise attendance of his gym, his history and health constants from his Digital Health Space, his blood pressure monitor connected to Withings, its diabetes telesurveillance service offered by the APHP, etc. 
 contribute to a decentralized learning program ensuring that his data does not leave his personal cloud. 
 
<p>Cozy is thus paving the way for decentralized artificial intelligence where AI can learn everyone's data without anyone sharing their data.</p>
<p></p>
 DISPERS: Decentralized protocol can be activated 
<p>DISPERS: a decentralized protocol</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the privacy-friendly personal cloud provides its users with a dedicated digital space under their sole control. However, this platform remains single-user and, without an adequate framework, does not allow the creation of multi-user applications offering the same guarantees. The objective of the DISPERS protocol published with INRIA, was therefore to define this framework to allow, more specifically, the execution of distributed requests respecting privacy on a set of personal clouds. In our context, we consider that each individual of the studied population has his own personal cloud.</p>
<p></p>Protocole DISPERS<p></p>
<p>This protocol is the result of a CIFRE thesis between Cozy Cloud and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/petrus/">the PETRUS team at INRIA Saclay</a>. More than an anonymization method, this protocol provides strong guarantees that a calculation relating to personal data will not reveal any useful information throughout its execution, even in the presence of malicious actors. This work has given rise to articles published in major international academic conferences:</p>
 
 Julien Loudet, Luc Bouganim, Iulian Sandu Popa <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01949583">Privacy-Preserving Queries on Highly Distributed Personal Data Management Systems</a> 
 Julien Loudet, Iulian Sandu Popa, Luc Bouganim SEP2P: <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01949641">Secure and Efficient P2P Personal Data Processing</a> 
 
<p>The DISPERS protocol is also integrated into <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-16-CE39-0014">the ANR PerSoCloud project</a>, a cooperation between Cozy Cloud, Orange, INRIA Saclay and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, which aims to facilitate the connection of each person's personal digital home.</p>
<p>DISPERS thus offers a way to distribute tasks and information between several Cozy personal clouds. The protocol incorporates processes to hide the holders of the information or make the data incomprehensible to the actor who will be responsible for a sub-task. Thus, no single actor is able to compromise the entire calculation, nor to access useful information!</p>
<p>A technological enabler developed with INRIA</p>
<p>As the data is already present in users 'personal clouds, the DISPERS protocol can be done without having to convince Withings, APHP and Google Maps to share their users' data or find the legal framework in which to contract such a device. Legal constraints are, moreover, an unknown factor that deserves special attention in the context of a decentralized protocol: the legal constraints of each actor participating in the protocol should be listed.</p>
<p>Our protocol allows an epidemiological study to mobilize the data, gathered without difficulty by the individual - in our case user of the Cozy personal cloud, which would constitute a nightmare for a laboratory to recover all the personal information and consents. This thus makes it possible to establish a correlation calculation and assess the prevalence of the virus within the population according to its behavior, while guaranteeing the user that it is technically impossible that the data used does not go out of its way. personal cloud. Data shared in this way is impossible to bring together today to grow a common good.</p>
<p>A new thesis on the basics of DISPERS with a focus on AI</p>
<p>In addition to the previous thesis carried by Julien Loudet, we are opening a new path with a new <a href="http://www.theses.fr/s252717">thesis with INRIA carried by Julien Mirval and Cozy Cloud which aims to be able to do distributed learning in an AI context</a>.</p>
 Use case: relevance of closing sport halls during the COVID-19 epidemic? 
 Conditions of application 
<p>Assuming that the population of our sample has a personal cloud in which each individual has connected their Withings account and retrieved their GPS data (including those of their gym attendance ) thus his health data recovered by his Shared Medical File (DMP) (tested positive or not for COVID).</p>
 Course of the study 
<p>From these data, and by applying the DISPERS protocol,</p>
 
 we can then look at the percentage of contamination of these individuals before and after the closing of the sports halls 
 we can compare it with the percentage of contamination of so-called equivalent people who do not go to the gym (equivalent on certain relevant variables such as location, age, etc.) 
 
 Results of the study 
<p>If we see a drop in the percentage of contamination before and after closure in individuals who went there AND that the percentage of contamination of individuals who did not go there does not follow the same trend, then we can assume that there is an impact.</p>
<p>Note that the experiment does not prove causality, but makes it possible to establish indices, which, added with other studies and / or protocols, would make it possible to better define the behavior of the epidemic.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Decentralized machine learning as a new way to pool data paves the way for democratic AI. Such AI needs to learn from a large, cross-cutting dataset from multiple sources, while respecting user privacy, something that current centralized approaches that operate in silos cannot allow. In a democratic society, individuals themselves control their data.</p>
<p>By adopting a personal cloud to reclaim your personal data, your Personal AI allows access to your “complete digital privacy” without ever disclosing it. A necessary paradigm shift, as the risks of privacy breaches have never seemed greater than in these uncertain times.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Privacy-sensitive users are drawn to solutions with certain features: end-to-end encryption, granular consent, data ownership, and secure storage. But what is it that privacy can really do for users, and is there a non-exploitative business model in it for companies?</p>
<p>KuppingerCole envisioned Life Management Platforms back in 2012 as the pathway to individual data sovereignty. Data sovereignty is incrementally being introduced as a right of individuals, with principles being introduced in the European GDPR, the Canadian PIPEDA, the CCPA, and others. While these regulations manage the commercial data interactions between the individual and the business, there is still a huge gap between the data protections offered and meaningful data sovereignty for the individual; the user does not yet have a cohesive means to manage their personal data and share it with third parties and still maintain ownership and control. In other words, privacy seekers are still waiting for a Life Management Platform.</p>
 Life Management Platforms for User-Centric Control 
<p>Imagine a secure digital data store for your identity documents, financial records, credit score, health records, ownership deeds, and credentials. Imagine that you could share that data securely in a digital format, without sending a scan or filling out a registration form. But beyond simply sharing, you have the control over which entities can view or store that data. You can restrict the length of time they have your data, and you have an auditable list of which third parties you have shared information with. Your data remains centered around you, not the entities you have created an account with.</p>
<p>Imagine submitting a mortgage application to multiple banks, scouting out the best opportunity. You can put permissions on your data so that it only resides with the bank that you sign the contract with; otherwise it is returned to your personal data storage. This way you can shop around without leaving a stream of personal data behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Imagine visiting the doctor with an aging relative, where medical results should be shared with not only the patient, but a designated guardian as well. The aging relative can delegate you to receive information on their behalf and grant data access privileges to you; to share medical information but not financial, for example. In the case of a child these permissions can be granted until they gain full data ownership at 18 or the appropriate legal age.</p>
<p>Imagine posting a photograph on social media with your copyright. Your intellectual property resides in your data storage, but you’ve displayed it on your channel for the world to see. Someone else wants to use that photo, and you grant conditional access, for a fee. One download, with no further reproductions.</p>
 Elements of a Life Management Platform 
<p>We have to recognize that we are describing a product that does not yet exist...not fully anyway. You can find elements of a Life Management Platform here and there, tucked in decentralized identity projects, enterprise digital rights management, or privacy solutions for consent management. A Life Management Platform should contain a user-centric data storage, the means to share data with strong rights management, and standard protocols to establish the veracity and digital provenance of shared data.</p>
<p>Data storage: There is a huge need for a secure data storage for individuals to hold personal data, critical documents, health records, proof of ownership, education credentials, etc. This is missing entirely from most privacy solutions, and only a few niche organizations are developing such a digital safe. The most promising technology solutions seem to be based on decentralized architectures like blockchain. These give the benefit of verifying data against authoritative sources – like a government-issued ID document against the public records – and storing the digital proof in the blockchain while the data itself resides in the user’s own device. Decentralized identity wallets and exchange of data are facilitated through the Verifiable Credentials emerging standard.</p>
<p>Permissioned Exchange: Verifiable Credentials lay the groundwork for data exchange, and some solutions are rolling out revocation rights, but granular permissions and rights management for shared data is still to come. This should include delegated access, guardian access for incapacitated individuals or minors, protection for IP, and protection for data posted in public, like social media channel. Data that is meant to be private must have permissions control to address the individuals it is shared with and the actions they can take.</p>
<p>Verified data, verified identity: Underpinning the ability to store and share one’s own private data securely are standards: Verifiable Credentials as mentioned earlier, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs establish a universal protocol for describing unique identifiers in decentralized systems and Verifiable Credentials make it possible to attach an interoperable cryptographic proof of provenance to data that is shared. Widespread adoption of such standards make it possible to establish that data is verified with transparent publication of which entities have issued it and which have validated it. Similarly, identities that are interacting online can be verified and correlated to a real-world identity. This identity can still be masked during low value transactions to preserve the user's desire to be anonymous, but some transactions, like in banking scenarios, the user can interact and share their private data that is correlated to their real-world identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an71606/the-blockchain-and-life-management-platforms/" title="Life Management Platforms">Life Management Platforms</a> are a futuristic concept, but one that becomes more relevant every day. Trends towards digital, user-centricity, privacy, and reusability all influence the need to hold, control, and share information privately. It will have a huge impact on how we interact as customers, employees, and business partners, be marked with automation and self-service, and attain even higher granularity on permission. Much of the details depend on the structure of the Life Management Platforms that will emerge in the next few years. This is new territory, and we will continue to struggle to balance the pressing need for privacy and the business cases that will inevitably rise out of innovation.</p>

<p>Companies spend a combined $19 billion annually acquiring and analyzing consumer data. This data allows companies to make more informed decisions, increasing customer engagement, unlocking additional revenues. </p><p>However, the long-held belief was that this information was proprietary and therefore should be a closely guarded secret. Companies have treated their collected data as a trade secret, afraid that if competitors discovered insights about their products, strategies, and operations, that maybe they could easily copy them–an argument that is increasingly being proven wrong in many industries.</p><p>According to retail marketing platform, Perch, the more “granular and intimate” the data, the more specific it is to a particular retailer environment and therefore it is even less useful in replication for competitors.</p><p>But just how can sharing data across businesses and companies within the same vertical actually drive more engagement and revenue? In 2014, Apple launched its Healthkit API which allows app developers the ability to share customer health data with other applications through Apple. Healthkit is part of Apple’s broader ‘Health’ product, which serves as a single source of truth for health-related information such as body measurements, nutrition, heart rate, running distance, reproductive health, sleep time and other health related information. To date, thousands of apps integrate with Healthkit, allowing synergies between apps that would otherwise only have access to their own user collected data. A brisk morning jog tracked on one app, can show up as daily health stats in a cycling app, providing a more complete picture to the end user. Google launched a similar app called Google Fit in the same year, with support and integration for nearly all of the most popular fitness apps from Nike to Strava and displays over 50 million downloads on the Google Play store page. Clearly, seamless data sharing and app integration has been a huge win in the health sector.</p> Simplified Access and Synergy <p>Data sharing has implications outside of health apps. Take for instance the popularity of super apps in Asia. WeChat is a prime example allowing users the ability to perform a wide variety of lifestyle tasks in a single ecosystem such as ordering a taxi, applying for a bank loan, paying for goods or items, and even transacting with government service providers, all without leaving the app ecosystem. This synergy allows simplified access and convenience to its users and translates to incredible user engagement –WeChat accounts for around 90% of all messaging app users in China. Compare that with Facebook Messenger, the largest messaging app in the U.S. which accounts for less than 30% of the total U.S. market for chat. Grab, another popular super app, services 144 million users in 8 Southeast Asian countries, enabling users access to ride-hailing, grocery, package and restaurant delivery, rewards and digital payments all in one single platform. Clearly app users are signaling their appreciation for the convenience and power of the synergies generated from information sharing</p> The Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>In a nearly identical manner, Verifiable Credential Issuers stand to make significant strides in user adoption by offering newfound convenience in a traditionally painfully inconvenient industry. Companies that support a Verifiable Credential Issuance standard can provide audited and truthful information to any third party on behalf of and with specific permission from their customers. For example, a bank could provide proof-of-funds in the form of a digitally verified credential document, that can then be used as a source of truth to instantly initiate a mortgage application, or a real estate purchase offer. </p><p>The use of Verified Credentials is far-reaching. Credentials issuers can market their services to customers, who might select them over a competitor due to the added convenience of being able to access other affiliate applications and marketplaces. For example, a financial services provider that offers Verifiable Credentials can allow its customer rapid and simplified access to investment services, credit cards, auto loans, or peer-to-peer payment platforms, negating the need for a redundant, costly and time-consuming verification process with each separate service provider. In the same manner, companies and platforms that accept Verifiable Credentials in their onboarding process might attract users who are already in a shared Verifiable Credential ecosystem, driving additional synergies and growth. Meanwhile, companies that do not support any shared information initiative do not stand to benefit from these synergies and would be relegated to a quickly aging and time-consuming manual credential verification process.</p> Bloom <p>Bloom believes in modernizing access to credit by leveraging an ecosystem of secure identity and financial data sharing. We seek to accomplish this through the use of a Verifiable Credential Issuance standard based on blockchain technology. Our platform provides a single source of truth recorded on an immutable and distributed ledger ultimately decentralizing the way that financial information is shared between parties. Through this, Bloom offers decentralized and centralized applications alike, the ability to integrate within a shared, synergistic ecosystem that provides efficiency and convenience for a customer, while increasing engagement and revenue opportunities for businesses. All data sharing events are specifically permissioned by each consumer, giving them added control and comfort of their private information</p><p>For more information on our technology and mission, please visit bloom.co/about</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-142-your-whatsapp-data-belongs-to-fb-now-ba007f1ecd5c">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-01-jp-thieriot-on-why-uphold-isnt-delisting-xrp-723a33470916">Episode 02 of our podcast with special guest JP Thieriot, CEO of&nbsp;Uphold</a>.</p>  The fallout from deplatforming Trump and&nbsp;Parler  The Signal/Telegram party  What this means for the future of the&nbsp;internet  Everything you need to know about Bitcoin and Blockchain  Stuff happens   1. The big news recently has been the deplatforming of Donald Trump and Parler — and what all of that means for the future of the internet. <p>These tensions have been bubbling for some time now. But with horrendous violence at the Capitol finally sparking firm action, what happens next will define where we go&nbsp;next.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, for instance, Twitter’s need to shutdown Donald Trump’s account was in itself a platform&nbsp;failure:</p><p>Indeed, those divisions will only grow and calcify as factions draw battle lines and take legal action. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-a2ac731f-a04b-4fac-8e86-d2dae0e851b8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The Capitol riot and tech firms’ sweeping attempt in its wake to dislodge the online far right are kicking up efforts to have the courts settle knotty questions about online speech and power, Axios’ Margaret Harding McGill and Ashley Gold&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Legal battles could force the people angry at Big Tech to bring more rigor to arguments that have often devolved into messy sideshows.</blockquote><blockquote>Parler vs. Amazon: Parler sued Amazon after its AWS unit kicked the right-wing-friendly social network off its hosting due to violent threats made on the platform before the Capitol siege. Parler contends Amazon breached its contract and is breaking antitrust laws, hurting Parler to benefit Twitter, another AWS&nbsp;client.</blockquote><blockquote>Rumble vs. Google: Toronto-based Rumble, an increasingly popular streaming-video platform on the right, sued Google, accusing it of steering users of its search engine to YouTube over competing video services.</blockquote><blockquote>ADL v. Gab: No civil suits have been filed or threatened, but the ADL is calling on right-wing-friendly social network Gab to potentially be held criminally liable for Capitol riot mobilization on its platform. Section 230, which shields online platforms from civil liability over user-posted content, doesn’t apply to federal&nbsp;crimes.</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai says online platforms should be forced to explain their practices in the much the same way he required of broadband providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T, Margaret&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Pai paired those transparency requirements with his 2017 repeal of net neutrality rules. Open-internet proponents feared the repeal would lead to ISPs blocking websites or deliberately slowing traffic, but bipartisan concern has largely shifted to the power of platforms like Google and Facebook to shape what people see&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the NYTimes wonders — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/technology/twitter-facebook-parler-rules.html">who should make the online&nbsp;rules</a>?</p><p>Other countries are naturally worried about this latest power flex by Big Tech. If they can so easily silence their own president, what’s to stop them silencing anyone&nbsp;else’s?</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany and France Oppose Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;Exile</a>  <p>Because this was certainly a power&nbsp;move.</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>—<a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/p/how-silicon-valley-in-a-show-of-monopolistic">How Silicon Valley, in a Show of Monopolistic Force, Destroyed Parler</a>  <p>This is quite the dichotomy, no?</p><blockquote>In China, President Xi Jinping has silenced Alibaba founder Jack Ma and launched an antitrust investigation into his company after the e-commerce tycoon publicly criticized state regulators. In the U.S., Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has suspended President Donald Trump’s accounts after the president used the platform to incite violence.</blockquote> 2. It’s that question of Big Tech’s power that’s also driving tens or hundreds of millions of users away from WhatsApp to Telegram and&nbsp;Signal. Telegram Founder Pavel Durov, Photo: TechCrunch  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html">Millions Flock to Telegram and Signal as Fears Grow Over Big&nbsp;Tech</a>  <p>Check out this&nbsp;chart:</p><p>Also, the meme of the week, via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a>:</p> 3. In a sense, that’s a good thing. People have choice through innovation. But in a lot of ways, people fleeing WhatsApp for Telegram is really a parallel narrative to people leaving Twitter and Facebook for&nbsp;Parler. <p>The Information worries about the ramifications of trying to shutdown the&nbsp;latter:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-blocking-trump-puts-the-future-of-the-internet-at-risk">How Blocking Trump Puts the Future of the Internet at&nbsp;Risk</a>  <blockquote>In this respect, it doesn’t matter if the social networks were justified in their response to Trump, which I believe they very much were. It just comes down to the fact that broad swaths of the internet have finally taken a clearly political step that is impossible to apply consistently or fairly across the&nbsp;globe.</blockquote><blockquote>A month ago, any political party would have been reviled for calling to extinguish the voice of a rival on the internet. But in the blink of an eye, exactly that has become a legitimate debate, one that internet companies will lose, no matter what they&nbsp;do.</blockquote><blockquote>Until recently, the global internet seemed a given. Today, it seems possible that Trump’s final act as a president will be to set off the dominoes that lead to the end of digital globalism and the erection of closed digital borders, as well as to regionalization and censorship.</blockquote><p>The rest of the article is worth a&nbsp;read!</p><p>Here’s Ben Thompson’s take:</p>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech)&nbsp;History</a>  <p>Ben had personally called for Trump to be de-platformed:</p><blockquote>After years of defending Facebook and Twitter’s decisions to keep Trump on their services, I called for him to be kicked off last Thursday, and I explained yesterday why tech’s collective action in response to last Wednesday’s events was a uniquely American solution to a genuine&nbsp;crisis</blockquote><p>Notably, there was international backlash to the move. From&nbsp;Europe:</p><blockquote>Germany and France attacked Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. after U.S. President Donald Trump was shut off from the social media platforms, in an extension of Europe’s battle with big tech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel objected to the decisions, saying on Monday that lawmakers should set the rules governing free speech and not private technology companies.</blockquote><p>From India:</p><blockquote>BJP leaders expressed concern on Saturday over the permanent suspension of US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account by the social media giant, saying it sets a dangerous precedent and is a wake-up call for democracies about the threat from unregulated big tech companies…”If they can do this to the President of the US, they can do this to anyone. Sooner India reviews intermediaries’ regulations, better for our democracy,” BJP’s youth wing president Tejaswi Surya said in a&nbsp;tweet.</blockquote><p>Ben’s take:</p><blockquote>Tech companies would surely argue that the context of Trump’s removal was exceptional, but when it comes to sovereignty it is not clear why U.S. domestic political considerations are India’s concern, or any other country’s. The fact that the capability exists for their own leaders to be silenced by an unreachable and unaccountable executive in San Francisco is all that matters, and it is completely understandable to think that countries will find this status quo unacceptable.</blockquote><p>For Ben, all this means is that the current status quo doesn’t represent the end-state of the internet’s evolution, and in fact, so little is settled that we’re in the midst of a complete rejiggering. I’ll let you read up on all of his philosophical context on your&nbsp;own.</p><p>But here’s a preview of where he believes we’re&nbsp;going:</p><blockquote>Here technology itself will return to the forefront: if the priority for an increasing number of citizens, companies, and countries is to escape centralization, then the answer will not be competing centralized entities, but rather a return to open protocols. This is the only way to match and perhaps surpass the R&amp;D advantages enjoyed by centralized tech companies; open technologies can be worked on collectively, and forked individually, gaining both the benefits of scale and inevitability of sovereignty and self-determination.</blockquote><blockquote>This process will take years; I would expect governments in Europe in particular to initially try and build their own centralized alternatives. Those efforts, though, will founder for a lack of R&amp;D capabilities, and be outstripped by open alternatives that are perhaps not as full-featured and easy-to-use as big tech offerings, at least in the short to medium-term, but possess the killer feature of not having a San Francisco kill-switch.</blockquote><p>Sound familiar?</p> 4.

<p>Highlights</p><p>As we look back on another busy week for Ontology, we can identify the exciting developments quite easily! The much anticipated “Welcome Home” application powered by Ontology has officially passed through the initial stages of review with Daimler Mobility. As a truly pioneering MVP product, Welcome Home combines the premium experience of Daimler’s mobility units with Ontology’s technical superiority, in decentralized identity and data protection.</p><p>Latest Developments</p><p>Development Progress</p>  Completed 15% of the Ontology EVM-integrated design, which will be fully compatible with Ethereum contract ecology after completion.  <p>Product Development</p>  Released ONTO v3.7.0. This version supports Huobi ECO Chain (Heco), HRC-721 digital assets and dApps, integrates OKExChain，and adds an English news feed from Cointelegraph in the “News”tab. Other added elements include the optimization of the blind box ad feature, which enables the default currency display to be canceled, and also optimizes UI on the data&nbsp;page.  ONTO supported Circleswap airdrop activities and organized a joint knowledge-testing activity with Sphinex. This initiative gave users the opportunity to answer questions correctly and to receive airdrop&nbsp;rewards.  <p>dApps</p>  112 dApps launched in total on&nbsp;MainNet  6,325,338 dApp transactions completed in total on&nbsp;MainNet  <p>Community Growth</p><p>We are delighted to see that the Ontology community keeps on growing! This week we onboarded 201 new members across Ontology’s global communities.</p><p>Global Events</p><p>Circlesw<a href="https://twitter.com/circleswap">ap</a>, which is built on the Huobi ECO Chain has been integrated into ONTO Wallet. This allows ONTO users to join in on Heco’s airdrop festivities.</p><p>ONTO co-hosted an AMA with Sphinex, and offered participants the opportunity to win&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Industry News</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/mitsubishi-and-tokyo-tech-create-blockchain-system-for-p2p-energy-trading">Mitsubishi and Tokyo Tech create blockchain system for P2P energy&nbsp;trading</a></p><p>Peer-to-peer energy trading set-ups allow consumers and prosumers to engage in direct trading as buyers and sellers. In order to make their new system less reliant on hardware-intensive, high-volume computations, Mitsubishi Electric and Tokyo Tech have customized their blockchain system in order to optimize matches and make clearing buy and sell orders more efficient. Ontology has been working hard to support real economies through blockchain solutions such as digital identities. Last week, Ontology and Daimler Mobility announced the development of the first stage of completion on the Welcome Home app. This will make it possible for users to enjoy full transparency and take control of their own data and privacy. We are looking forward to seeing more blockchain-based use cases solve real-life problems in the&nbsp;future..</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/multiple-defi-mainstays-crack-top-20-in-long-awaited-great-repricing">Multiple DeFi mainstays crack top 20 in long-awaited ‘Great Repricing’</a></p><p>Hardcore decentralized finance (DeFi) adherents woke up today to a long-awaited sight on Coingecko’s top 100 rankings by marketcap. Native tokens for popular DeFi platforms Synthetix and Aave have cracked into the top 20, an event DeFi observers have heralded as “The Great Repricing.” Last week, ONTO integrated the derivatives liquidity protocol Synthetix. ONTO users can utilize multiple features of the Synthetix platform and participate in SNX staking.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On July 16th, 2020 the European Court of Justice issued its decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Data Protection Shield for the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in an EU Member State to another economic operator established in a third country.&nbsp; The use of cloud services is now commonplace and has been increased due to the need for working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp; In addition, unstructured files like documents, spreadsheets and slide decks that are stored in these services often contain personal data. Most of these services are owned and run by service providers located in a Third Country.</p>
<p>What does this judgement mean in detail for organizations using these services and how does Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 help?</p>
 Risk 
<p>There are three points at which the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal data can be compromised by public authorities in Third Countries:</p>
 
 During its transfer across networks, it may be accessed by third parties including governments. This access may be passive where the contents of the communication are simply copied. However, public authorities may also interpose themselves into the communication process and not only read the content, but also manipulate or suppress parts of it. 
 During its storage, by either accessing the processing facilities themselves, or by requiring the recipient of the data to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over. 
 During processing, the data could be accessed while it is being used or analyzed. For example, when a service is being provided remotely. 
 
 EDPB Recommendations 
<p>In November 2020, the EDPB (European Data Protection Board) <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="European Data Protection Board">recommendations 01/2020</a> on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data were approved.&nbsp; These recommendations provide exporters with a series of steps to follow, potential sources of information, and some examples of supplementary measures that could be put in place.&nbsp; These recommendations cover contractual tools such as:</p>
 
 standard data protection clauses (SCCs). 
 binding corporate rules (BCRs). 
 codes of conduct. 
 certification mechanisms. 
 ad hoc contractual clauses. 
 
<p>Note that - while the contractual tools are important – this blog does not provide legal advice will focus on the technical supplementary measures recommended.</p>
 Supplementary Technical Steps 
<p>The recommendations go further and indicate that contractual tools may not be sufficient and that organizations need to take supplementary technical steps to ensure the adequacy of the protection of personal data transferred. In summary the recommendations identify three major technical approaches for which example use cases are provided.&nbsp; These technical steps include:</p>
 
 Encryption – strong state of the art encryption provides adequate protection providing the keys are managed correctly. 
 Pseudonymization – as opposed to anonymization - is explicitly allowed by GDPR providing the addition data needed to reconstitute the personal data is adequately protected. 
 Multi party computing – protocols that split the data into parts that can be processed independently without any of the processors being able to reconstitute any personal data. 
 
 Encryption 
<p>Strong encryption can provide adequate protection for data being transferred against its interception and manipulation by a third-party including government actors.&nbsp; It also provides protection for stored data in the event that the recipient of the data is forced to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over to the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the EDPB encryption offers adequate protection providing:</p>
 
 The encryption algorithm and its, key length, and operation conform to the state-of-the-art. 
 The strength of the encryption considers the length of time the data must remain confidential. 
 The encryption algorithm is flawlessly implemented, and algorithm has been verified, e.g., by certification. 
 The keys are reliably managed and are retained solely under the control of the data exporter. 
 
<p>Public key encryption techniques can also limit access as well as detect where data has been changed. However, public key encryption depends upon the trustworthiness of the certificate authority as well as control over private keys.</p>
<p>However, in general, encrypted data needs to be decrypted for it to be processed and so further measures are needed to protect personal data during processing.&nbsp; Homomorphic encryption is often proposed as a technique that also provides protection during processing.&nbsp; However, there are still concerns about the processing overhead that limits the practicality of this approach.</p>
 Microsoft Double Key Encryption 
<p>Most cloud service providers encrypt data that is held in their service – however, by default they usually control the encryption keys.&nbsp; While this protects against certain threats such as media loss it clearly does not meet the above requirements.&nbsp; Some services provide a way for the customer to securely control the encryption keys – for example, the keys are held in an HSM (Hardware Security Module) which has been certified to be tamper proof <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final">FIPS 140-2</a>.&nbsp; In addition, they may support a secure key management protocol <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/kmip/kmip-spec/v2.0/os/kmip-spec-v2.0-os.html">KMIP</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;These are fine for certain use cases but for unstructured data more is needed.</p>
<p>In July 2020 Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/announcing-public-preview-of-double-key-encryption-for-microsoft/ba-p/1534451">announced</a> their Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 to help organizations to protect their mission-critical data.&nbsp; This is in addition to the data protection capabilities based on content offered by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/">Microsoft Information Protection’s</a>&nbsp;classification and labeling.</p>
<p>Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 uses two keys to protect data; one key in the customer’s control and a second key stored securely in Microsoft Azure. Viewing data protected with Double Key Encryption requires access to both keys. Since Microsoft can access only one of these keys, protected data remains inaccessible to Microsoft, ensuring that the customer has full control over their data privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The protected data can only be viewed and processed by the desktop apps.&nbsp; That is to say that it cannot be viewed using the Microsoft 365 Web apps since this would mean that the data would have to be decrypted within the Microsoft server i.e., it would potentially beat risk during processing.&nbsp; The data can be shared but only if those users:</p>
 
 Have the required permission to access the customer’s key in your Double Key Encryption service. 
 Have the required permission to access the customer’s key in Microsoft Azure. 
 
<p>However, it is not possible to access that data in a non-Microsoft air gapped environment because the service requires access to Microsoft Azure.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The risk of personal data being held in unstructured office productivity tools is often forgotten.&nbsp; While it is easy for end users to inadvertently include personal data there are existing tools that can protect against it being exported (DLP for example).&nbsp; However, there may be a legitimate need to use office productivity tools with this kind of data and to use cloud services to store and share this data.&nbsp; Microsoft Double Key Encryption adds an extra layer of protection on top of what is already offered through the Microsoft Information Protection tools.&nbsp; If properly managed this would appear to satisfy the EDPB criteria for supplementary technical controls needed for compliance. As always security comes at a price.&nbsp; Even with standard Microsoft Azure Information Protection, some capabilities such as joint editing of documents are not available.&nbsp; In addition, when implementing DKE, the cost and complexity of managing the keys should not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>In January of 2020, New Year’s resolutions could not have taken into account the rollercoaster of events that year would bring. As the world enters 2021, leaders need to evaluate how the year ahead will be different from others, and how to incorporate a restorative approach to leadership in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders should not try to tackle all 10 of these resolutions, but rather focus on two to three</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“There is a lot of rejuvenation and rebuilding to be done. All of that impacts the way you do the work of technology-related business leadership and how you personally show up,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/82759/Daniel-Sanchez-Reina">Daniel Sanchez-Reina</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Gartner has created a list of 10 resolutions for CIOs in 2021. Leaders should not try to tackle all 10 of these resolutions, but rather focus on two to three for the year. Nine of the resolutions fall under three themes of being more:</p>
 
 Effective 
 Progressive&nbsp; 
 Self-aware&nbsp; 
 
<p>All of the resolutions for 2021, including a perennial 10th resolution, are focused on soft skills to reflect the challenges of the previous year and specific skills for the next year.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 1: No-regrets doer 
<p>2020 will be remembered by all the things we didn’t do. For 2021, business leaders should think about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-ask-3-questions-before-updating-strategy-post-pandemic/">post-COVID </a>hopes and dreams. It’s okay to include both dream items and concrete plans, just acknowledge that the world will be different moving forward. This exercise can also contain things that your team can stop doing or get rid of to make space for things you need or want to do. Once you have the list, pick one item and set a date to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Virtuality virtuoso&nbsp; 
<p>The massive and sudden shift to remote work left many people coping with the change but not embracing it. CIOs need to lead the charge for the best way to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-leader-checklist-to-foster-trust-on-remote-teams/">lead virtually</a>. Make sure you’re always dressed well, that your video background is uncluttered and that you are well-lit.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">How to Lead Better Remote Meetings</a></p>
<p>Most likely, remote work will be around for a while, so invest in things that make you look professional. When it comes to whatever virtual platform you’re using, make sure you’re exploiting all the tools and options that virtual work offers, whether it’s using virtual breakout rooms or polls.</p>
 No. 3: Offensive player 
<p>Despite what’s going on in the world, CIOs need to manage internal politics and be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-cios-need-to-move-from-defense-to-offense/">on the offensive</a> — especially when it comes to high-visibility projects. Learn to recognize common political attacks and establish relationships with the C-suite to cultivate better relationships and allies. You might also consider taking some media training courses to learn the most effective techniques for deflection and bridging.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Impressionist thinker 
<p>It’s easy to throw away ideas for being too crazy. But instead of dismissing these ideas completely, try to frame them in a sentence and carefully articulate potential benefits to colleagues. When you’re done, ask listeners to wait on reacting. Have them sleep on the idea and come back with an argument that destroys the idea, an alternative idea that makes it more doable, or a high-level plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When these options are presented, ask the destroyer to find an alternative option to reap the same rewards. Ask the alternative plan offerer for a high-level plan that can be&nbsp; carried out. And for those who propose a high-level plan, ask them to start planning and resourcing. If there is no feasible alternative option and the original idea won’t work, withdraw the plan, but use the idea as a springboard for innovative thinking.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 5: Neurodiversity builder&nbsp; 
<p>Though many CIOs&nbsp; are aware of the importance of diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, ability and other areas, neurodiversity is often overlooked. However, this type of diversity could be key to accelerating digital business. CIOs should champion neurodiverse teams and dedicate time to learning about neurodiversity, creating a policy to encourage neurodiversity and focusing on making changes in the IT team.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Sustainability shifter&nbsp; 
<p>The Gartner 2021 CIO Agenda found 62% of CIOs had some involvement in their organization’s environmental sustainability agenda. Look at how the IT team can support these initiatives — from changing how you assess digital transformation and asking sustainability-first questions to&nbsp; getting up to speed on the data and arguments related to environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 7: Conscious leader&nbsp; 
<p>2020 was a hard year for all, and as CIOs enter into 2021, it’s important to reexamine why organizations operate in certain ways. Consider, for example, why organizational charts aren’t that different from what they looked like 200 years ago or why it took a pandemic to move to hybrid and remote workforces.</p>
<p>Begin by questioning and being more authentic about your own struggles and stories. This will establish a culture of trust and safety. This is also a good time to consider other ways of doing things instead of having a “my way is the right way” thought process.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 8: Resilient griever 
<p>There are many kinds of grief, from the loss of a loved one to the loss of a job. Each of those is a primary loss, which is the term for the main reason you’re grieving (e.g., the job). But each primary loss has secondary losses associated with it. For example, the loss of a job might have secondary losses of professional identity, a work routine or time with colleagues. CIOs should learn how to recognize secondary losses in their own lives and in their teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 9: Self-kindness practitioner&nbsp; 
<p>It’s possible the unknowns and ups and downs of 2020 have sapped your emotional and mental abilities. It’s also possible you’re still holding on to mistakes made in the past year. Now is the time for some self-kindness and acknowledgement. Don’t let 2020 mistakes block successes in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try listing out your mistakes alongside the successes you had within the same period of time. Think about each of your mistakes and how you would act differently if faced with the same situation today. This will highlight what you have learned from your mistakes. Consider writing a sincere letter of apology if your mistakes are related to how you acted toward someone.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 10: Make time to directly experience new technologies 
<p>This is a perennial on the CIO top resolution list because it is easy for CIOs to get lost in the business of being a CIO. Despite their focus on meetings, governance, compliance and other important responsibilities, CIOs also need to be able to speak to futuristic business ideas and emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/">Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021</a></p>
<p>This means setting aside time specifically to see demos or try out new technologies, keeping a small budget to purchase new technologies for the office and giving your team “play time” to interact with the new technology. Finally, use these experiences to create business cases for worthy technology.&nbsp;</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with René Seifert, Co-Founder &amp; Co-Head at TrueProfile.io. 
<p>In episode 37, René Seifert talks about the current status of identity in the UK; the government’s recent call for evidence and DIU (digital identity unit); the resultant six guiding principles – including privacy and inclusivity; the potential of self-sovereign identity to solve some of these issues; TrueProfile.io and the importance of verified credentials in an HR context; plus the ethical, political and technical challenges of ‘immunity passports’.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’s interesting if we overlay this utopia of a self-sovereign identity that sounds maybe like science fiction today, and where these UK digital initiatives are geared, and my best guess is we can and will land somewhere in the middle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>René Seifert is a serial entrepreneur and co-head of <a href="https://www.trueprofile.io/">TrueProfile.io</a>, a credential verification solution provider. Powered by the DataFlow Group, TrueProfile.io provides these services in a modern environment via the adoption of Ethereum blockchain. Prior to this, René was the co-founder and co-CEO of Venturate AG, a crowdfunding platform allowing regular people to invest side-by- side with experienced business angels.</p>
<p>In addition, he has been involved in founding several internet, tech and media companies, among the Holtzbrinck eLab. René, half German and half Croatian, began his career hosting radio shows and running an advertising agency parallel to his studies. He was head of marketing and presenter at the radio station Bayern 3. During the “new economy” he headed the entertainment department at Lycos Europe.</p>

<p>Java has been at the forefront of microservice architectures since they came to prominence a few years ago. It’s a popular language with well-known, high-quality frameworks, like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data, and Spring Security.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot 2.0 introduced a new web framework called Spring WebFlux. Previous versions of Spring Boot only shipped with Spring MVC as an option. WebFlux offers a way for developers to do reactive programming. This means you can write your code with familiar syntax and, as a result, your app will use fewer resources and scale better.</p>

 Why Reactive Java? 
 
 
<p>Reactive programming isn’t for every app. The general rule of thumb is it won’t help you if you have &lt; 500 requests/second. Chances are Spring MVC will perform as well as Spring WebFlux up to that point. When your traffic takes off, or if you need to process things faster than 500 requests/second, you should take a look at Spring WebFlux.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring WebFlux’s API has a similar syntax to Spring MVC. For example, here’s the Spring MVC code for creating a new <code>Points</code> entity.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public ResponseEntity&lt;Points&gt; createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    Points result = pointsRepository.save(points);
    pointsSearchRepository.save(result);
    return ResponseEntity
        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
        .body(result);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The same functionality when implemented with Spring WebFlux returns a <code>Mono</code> and uses a more functional, streaming style to avoid blocking.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;Points&gt;&gt; createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    return pointsRepository
        .save(points)
        .flatMap(pointsSearchRepository::save)
        .map(
            result -&gt; {
                try {
                    return ResponseEntity
                        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
                        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
                        .body(result);
                } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
        );
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In this guide, I’ll show you how to create a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Config, Spring WebFlux, Java, and JHipster.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You can find the completed source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Reactive Java Microservices Architecture 
 
 
<p><a href="https://jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an open-source project that started as an application generator, based on <a href="https://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>. It’s also the <a href="https://yeoman.io/generators/">most popular Yeoman generator</a>. JHipster initially allowed you to generate AngularJS and Spring apps. In the last five years, it’s become a platform with extensibility, grown a thriving community, and has saved developers many hours of pain and frustration.</p>
 
 
<p>You see, JHipster integrates everything for you. Do you want to use Angular with Spring Boot? It’s got that. React? Yep. Microservices with Spring Cloud? Check!</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster 7 beta 1 was recently released, and it packs a punch! A couple of slick features that I like are Vue support and reactive microservices with Spring WebFlux. To be fair, WebFlux and Spring Cloud Gateway have been an option since JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/2020/03/08/jhipster-release-6.8.0.html">6.8.0 in March 2020</a>, but now we have R2DBC support too!</p>
 
 
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to generate a microservice architecture that uses OAuth 2.0, an API gateway, and two microservices (a blog and a store). The gateway will use PostgreSQL with R2DBC, the blog will use Neo4j, and the store will use MongoDB. All persistence options are powered by Spring Data.</p>
 
 
<p>Start by installing JHipster using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@beta</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After installing JHipster, you can run the following command to answer a whole slew of questions and create an app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>However, there’s an easier way. JHipster has its own domain language!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Define Your Reactive Java Architecture with JDL 
 
 
<p>JHipster Domain Language (<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/">JDL</a>) offers a way to define apps, so you don’t have to worry about fat-fingering your answer to the <code>jhipster</code> command’s questions.</p>
 
 






You can also generate your JHipster apps using <a href="https://start.jhipster.tech">JHipster Online</a>. However, it’s a bit tedious when creating a microservice architecture.



 
 
<p>Create a new directory on your machine and navigate into it in your terminal.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take reactive-stack # mkdir reactive-stack &amp;&amp; cd reactive-stack
git init # initialize git, so apps aren't created with their own .git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the JDL below and put it into a <code>reactive-ms.jdl</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName gateway (1)
    reactive true (2)
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway
    applicationType gateway
    authenticationType oauth2 (3)
    buildTool gradle (4)
    clientFramework vue (5)
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities Blog, Post, Tag, Product
}

application {
  config {
    baseName blog
    reactive true
    packageName com.okta.developer.blog
    applicationType microservice (6)
    authenticationType oauth2
    buildTool gradle
    databaseType neo4j
    devDatabaseType neo4j
    prodDatabaseType neo4j
    enableHibernateCache false
    serverPort 8081
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Blog, Post, Tag
}

application {
  config {
    baseName store
    reactive true
    packageName com.okta.developer.store
    applicationType microservice
    authenticationType oauth2
    buildTool gradle
    databaseType mongodb
    devDatabaseType mongodb
    prodDatabaseType mongodb
    enableHibernateCache false
    serverPort 8082
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Product
}

entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3)
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

entity Product {
  title String required
  price BigDecimal required min(0)
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog

deployment { (7)
  deploymentType docker-compose
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
} 
 
 
 


1
The first app is an API gateway.


2
Because the gateway is reactive, it’ll use Spring Cloud Gateway.


3
The gateway and microservice apps must use the same authentication type.


4
Use Gradle, because a lot of y’all love it.


5
Vue support is new in JHipster 7, let’s use it!


6
Make sure and specify <code>microservice</code> as the application type for the blog and store apps.


7
JDL allows you to create Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployments too!


 
 
 
 






See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options">application configuration options</a> to see the possible values for the above configuration options.



 
 
<p>Import this architecture definition and generate <code>gateway</code>, <code>blog</code>, and <code>store</code> apps.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>As part of this process, several Docker Compose files are generated for you. These allow you to run databases, the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> (for service discovery), <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a> (for identity), all with Docker.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>After JHipster finishes generating your apps, you can run them with Gradle. Assuming you’re in the same top-level directories you ran <code>jhipster jdl</code> from, you can run the following commands to start all the backend services for each microservice.</p>
 
 






JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/">Oh My ZSH! plugin</a> that I highly recommend. It provides aliases for starting Docker containers and is a real time-saver. I’ve included these commands as comments below.



 
 
 
 <code>cd gateway
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d #jhkeycloakup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d #jhpostgresqlup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 






You can run <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml logs --follow</code> to watch the logs of the JHipster Registry (or <code>jhregistrylogs</code> if you’re using Oh My Zsh and have the JHipster plugin installed).



 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> is a Netflix Eureka server that handles service discovery. When the gateway and microservices start up, they register with Eureka. This allows communication between services using logical names, rather than IP address or host names. JHipster Registry also contains a Spring Cloud Config server that can distribute configuration between apps. You can learn more about Spring Cloud Config in <a>Spring Cloud Config for Shared Microservice Configuration</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window, start the blog app’s Neo4j database, and then the app itself.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../blog
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/neo4j.yml up -d #jhneo4jup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, open another terminal window, start the store app’s MongoDB database, and the microservice.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../store
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d #jhmongoup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Mac/Linux, <code>c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> on Windows).</p>
 
 
 
 127.0.0.1	keycloak 
 
 
 
<p>This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or <code>127.0.0.1</code>), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named <code>keycloak</code>.</p>
 



 
 
 
 
 Test Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>Open <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code> in your favorite browser. You should be able to login with <code>admin/admin</code> as credentials.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Make sure you can add a new blog, edit existing posts, and add new products.</p>
 
 
<p>To prove everything works in an automated fashion, you can run <code>npm run e2e</code> in the gateway project’s directory. This will run a number of end-to-end tests with <a href="https://www.protractortest.org/">Protractor</a>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






JHipster has support for <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>, but it <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/12686">doesn’t work with Okta</a> yet.



 
 
 
 
 Prepare Your Reactive Java Stack for Production 
 
 
<p>Keycloak is a superb open source identity provider. It has excellent support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) and easily runs in a Docker container. I greatly appreciate Keycloak’s ease-of-use. I also appreciate Spring Security’s OAuth and OIDC support.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Security makes it so you only need to override three properties to switch from Keycloak to Okta!</p>
 
 
<p>In production, you might not want to manage your own identity provider instance. That’s where Okta comes in. We’re a developer-friendly SaaS company that provides OAuth and OIDC support as a service. You can create a developer account and use it for free. Our <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes it super easy.</p>
 
 
<p>Install the Okta CLI using the aforementioned website and come back here when you’re done. If you don’t have an Okta developer account, run <code>okta register</code>.</p>
 
 






You can also use your browser and Okta’s developer console to register an app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">JHipster’s security documentation</a> for those instructions.



 
 
<p>Then, from the gateway project’s directory, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Accept the default redirect URIs.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>This process does several things:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Registers an OIDC app in Okta with JHipster’s configured redirect URIs.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups and adds your user to both.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates a <code>groups</code> claim and adds it to ID tokens.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file with the values you’ll need to talk to Okta.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Update the JHipster Registry to Distribute OIDC Configuration 
 
<p>I mentioned earlier that Spring Cloud Config allows you to distribute Spring’s configuration between apps. In this section, you’ll configure JHipster’s Spring Security settings to use Okta across all your services.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the following YAML to <code>gateway/src/main/docker/central-server-config/localhost-config/application.yml</code>. You can find the values for each property in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Save your changes. These values will be distributed to the JHipster Registry, gateway, blog, and store apps. Restart the JHipster Registry by running the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml down #jhregistrydown
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Use Ctrl+C to kill all your <code>./gradlew</code> processes and start them again.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, open a new incognito browser window, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, and sign in. Rejoice that using Okta for authentication works!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, you can set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests (from the <code>gateway</code> directory).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export E2E_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;
export E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;your-password&gt;
npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 






Your JHipster Registry is now configured to use Okta for authentication. You’ll need to add redirect URIs in your Okta app for <code><a href="http://localhost:8761">http://localhost:8761</a></code>. After making these changes, you should be able to sign in to it.



 
 
 
 
 
 Create Docker Images for Your Microservice Apps 
 
 
<p>The JDL you used to create this reactive stack contains Docker configuration, so you can run everything with Docker Compose.</p>
 
 
<p>Stop all your apps with Ctrl+C. Stop all your Docker instances too.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)</code> 
 
 
 






Bump up the memory and CPU that Docker uses in Docker &gt; Preferences &gt; Resources. I have my Docker preferences set to 6 CPUs and 12GB of RAM.



 
 
<p>To run your reactive stack with Docker Compose, you need to create Docker images for each app. In your three different app directories, run the following Gradle command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Microservices Stack with Docker Compose 
 
 
<p>Once your Docker containers are finished building, you’ll want to add your Okta settings to Spring Cloud Config in JHipster Registry.</p>
 
 
 Switch Identity Providers with Spring Cloud Config 
 
<p>Open <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> in your favorite IDE (I like <a>IntelliJ IDEA</a>) and remove the Keycloak image at the bottom. You can leave it if you like, but it won’t be used in this example.</p>
 
 
<p>Update <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> to contain your OIDC settings that you want to share with all your microservices.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Prove Your Reactive Java Stack Works 
 
<p>In the <code>docker-compose</code> directory, run the following command to start all your containers.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose up</code> 
 
 
 






You can add a <code>-d</code> to the above command to run it as a daemon. I like watching all the log messages dance with each other.



 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to open <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, sign in, and access all of your microservices. Pretty slick, eh?! 🤓</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 What About Kotlin Microservices? 
 
 
<p>JHipster supports Kotlin-based microservices thanks to its <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">Kotlin blueprint</a>, supported by <a href="https://github.com/sendilkumarn">Sendil Kumar N</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You can install it using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, use <code>khipster jdl reactive-ms</code> to create the same stack you did above with Kotlin.</p>
 
 






At the time of this writing, JHipster’s Kotlin blueprint doesn’t support JHipster 7. Watch the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/releases">project’s releases page</a> for updates.



 
 
 
 
 How Do I Deploy to the Cloud? 
 
 
<p>JHipster creates a cloud-native microservices architecture that can be deployed to many cloud providers. There’s specific support for AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
 
 
<p>However, if you’re doing microservices, you’ll probably want to leverage Docker as you did in this tutorial. When your apps are containerized, they can be orchestrated with Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> sub-generator that you can use to deploy it to the cloud. I’ll cover this in a future tutorial.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, you can watch a presentation that <a href="https://twitter.com/saturnism">Ray Tsang</a> and I did recently that shows how to deploy JHipster microservices with Kubernetes. If you start watching from <a href="https://youtu.be/AG4z18qePEw?t=2778">46:18</a>, you’ll see Ray show how to deploy to Google Cloud using Kubernetes.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Should You Go Reactive? 
 
 
<p>As with most software architecture decisions, it depends. Are you building CRUD apps? Then no, Spring MVC is good enough.</p>
 
 
<p>Are you dealing with massive amounts of steaming data and millions of customers? Then yes, reactive frameworks like Spring WebFlux might just save you $$$ on your monthly cloud bill.</p>
 
 
<p>What about <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main">Project Loom</a>? Will it allow you to write regular non-reactive code that performs as good as reactive frameworks? I’m not sure. I’m betting on reactive for now. I think it’s a good skill to have for Java developers.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to learn more about Project Loom, I recommend listening to <a href="https://inside.java/2020/11/24/podcast-008/">Episode 8 "Project Loom" with Ron Pressler</a> from the <a href="https://inside.java/podcast/">Inside Java Podcast</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Reactive Java and Microservices 
 
 
<p>This tutorial isn’t an in-depth guide to programming reactive Java microservices. That’s because it doesn’t have to be! With JHipster, you can generate high-quality reactive Java code (~70% test coverage) that’s based on fantastic frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Security.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster also implements most of the patterns in my <a>Security Patterns for Microservice Architectures</a>. You can add dependency scanning with Snyk (based on <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/jhipster-security-scanning/">Brian Vermeer’s blog post</a>), use HTTPS locally, adopt OAuth, add CI/CD, and generate secure Docker containers, just to name a few.</p>
 
 
<p>The Spring Cloud Gateway implementation in JHipster is largely based on what I learned when researching and writing <a>Secure Reactive Microservices with Spring Cloud Gateway</a>. Spring Cloud Gateway makes it trivial to relay an access token between a gateway and microservices. It’s just five lines of YAML:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can find the completed source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Dock Association has welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-laverty-15a0222/">Andy Laverty</a>, an expert in finance and corporate governance, as its new member.</p><p>At Dock, we believe that maximum participation and widespread adoption are more likely when the network itself is not owned or controlled by any single member, as a network that serves to benefit everyone is far more appealing than one that benefits just the network owner. And as the benefits become decentralized, governance of that network - managing the differing and often competing agendas of its participants while ensuring that the network continues to evolve and improve - becomes increasingly important. This is why we have <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-decentralize-network-governance-with-the-creation-of-a-new-non-profit/">created in July 2020 the Dock Association</a>, a Swiss non-profit dedicated to overseeing the network’s roadmap, establishing and providing ongoing governance, and promoting adoption of the network.</p><p>We believe that Andy’s experience and expertise will be a significant asset to the Association. In addition to working as a highly sought-after consultant in the technology industry, Andy is currently a Non-Executive Director at <a href="https://maidsafe.net/">MaidSafe</a>, which is building an autonomous and decentralised data network that will provide its users with freedom of expression, control over personal data, and a high level of security. Andy has also served as a finance executive at various technology companies, including <a href="https://www.fnz.com/">FNZ</a>, a global fintech company, and Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle).</p><p>As part of his role in the Dock Association, Andy will participate in the network governance decisions through the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/governance-features-added-to-dock-mainnet/">new democratic features</a> that we’ve recently introduced to our mainnet. Serving as a member of the Council, he will review and vote on the proposals from the Dock community, as well as advise on managing the Dock treasury and provide strategic commercial and business guidance to the Association. We’re excited to have Andy on board, and look forward to working with him on growing and evolving the Dock ecosystem.</p>

With fraud, deep fakes, and data breaches abounding, my belief has only expanded; so much so that I, together with cofounders, started <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a> to make SSI easy to use. When we began 18 months ago, the tools SSI-interested businesses had at their disposal were dreadfully far from usable. After we launched the first production-grade verifiable credential platform, we’ve become the first choice for over 1,000 developers and businesses around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Since technology stopped being a blocker for SSI adoption (seriously, you can issue credentials in production in less than five minutes using <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>), hundreds of teams began building solutions. But now all of these teams have a new challenge (this shouldn’t surprise you): SSI is most valuable when it’s widely adopted. Like other standards, SSI benefits greatly from a network effect which forms as adoption grows. The immediate business value of SSI at a given point in time is an exponential function of the state of adoption.</p>The value of SSI increases with adoption. This graph assumes an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_life_cycle">S-curve</a>” rate of adoption and an exponential relationship between adoption and&nbsp;value.<p>The crux of the matter therefore is: Many implementers won’t realize the potential of SSI until it’s deployed at scale, but in order to get to scale, we need implementers to realize value. It’s the classic chicken &amp; egg&nbsp;problem.</p><p>For Trinsic and our customers, partners, and the broader SSI space to achieve the <a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">tremendous economic opportunity</a> SSI represents, this adoption problem needs to be solved. We want to do our part to help the SSI space solve this problem, so I decided to interview close to 50 business leaders who are seeking to deploy SSI in production to glean their learnings. The interviewees included our “competitors” (at this stage we’re more collaborative than competitive), a few of Trinsic’s customers, and industry leaders. I have summarized and consolidated their insights and my own thoughts into 4 keys for SSI adoption.</p> Understanding timing of verifiable credential adoption <p>The first key to cracking the SSI adoption challenge in your solution is to understand our current place in verifiable credentials’ adoption curve; at different phases of adoption, different growth strategies should be employed. A natural metric to gauge the state of SSI adoption is the number of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> deployed in production. (My definition of “production” for the purpose of this piece is that a credential is 1. issued, 2. accepted by someone/something, 3. to solve a real problem that results in 4. the creation of real business&nbsp;value¹.)</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, I estimated there were only a few hundred verifiable credentials in production. As of October 2020, based on my interviews with all major vendors and many business leaders, I estimate there were the following number of credentials in production:</p><blockquote>56,115 verifiable credentials in production</blockquote><p>Given the billions of credentials I believe will eventually exist, one could easily argue that 56,115² is little more than a drop in the ocean. On the other hand, while the websites created pre-1995 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995">easily fit on a Wikipedia page</a>, they represented the important start of an enormous flywheel. The growth of the SSI market from ~a few hundred to ~56,115 production verifiable credentials in only 10 months is a strong signal of a market that is growing&nbsp;fast.</p><p>During my interviews, I also asked everyone their opinion on when verifiable credentials will really “take off”. New technologies always have a long, slow ramp-up, growing linearly until they hit an inflection point where their growth becomes exponential. It’s impossible to predict when this inflection point will occur, but according to my interviews, experts believe it will be as soon as three years away, but not longer than five years&nbsp;away.</p>While it’s impossible to know the current state of SSI adoption precisely, my research leads me to believe we’re somewhere in the highlighted area. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still a long way to&nbsp;go.<p>It’s important to understand where we’re at in the adoption lifecycle so that you can spend your time focused on the right things. It may be too early for point-of-sale systems integrations, but the perfect time for an SSI-powered loyalty program. Given that most experts believe we’re still a few years away from mainstream adoption of SSI, should you want to build a verifiable credential-powered business? Maybe. Would you rather have started an internet company in 1996 or 2001? The earlier you build, the more upside potential exists. But I believe, like the internet, there will be business opportunities in this space for decades to&nbsp;come.</p> Selling the value of&nbsp;SSI <p>The next key to adoption is to sell the value. Verifiable credentials unlock different kinds of value for different players in an ecosystem. Sometimes it’s the issuer who benefits from issuing the credential, while other times it’s the verifier that consumes the value. The business case for verifiable credentials is different for each use case, but here are some tips that apply regardless of the business&nbsp;model.</p>  Don’t sell the tech; sell the solution to a problem<br>People spend money on solutions to problems, not on technology. (I don’t buy pharmaceuticals — I buy relief from my heartburn.) When you’re selling your solution, don’t lead with the technology. The technology discussion is best-suited as a “nail in the coffin” after the business value is clear. <br>A commonality across all production use cases is that they start small. Pick an initial, clear, quantifiable benefit to the customer and build for that. For example, although verifiable credentials offer the ideal platform upon which to build an internationally-portable eKYC system for banks, perhaps it’s better to start initially with authenticating users to ATM machines. Amazon began with the vision to be the “everything store” but started out selling books. It’s ok to grow into your ultimate&nbsp;vision.  Don’t talk past your buyer<br>With a new technology like verifiable credentials, there are lots of potential reasons a buyer could be interested. Before diving in to your sales pitch, make sure you understand the problem your buyer is trying to solve and speak to that. If you’re selling instant verifiability of data and they’re wanting to buy improved, trusted communication, you’ll have a tough time.<br>Some enterprises are still trying to figure out their OIDC or SSO strategies, for example. If the business value you’re selling is secure authentication, the buyer might feel like they’re too premature. But if you’re selling the ability to future-proof the company’s identity-related investment, you might have better&nbsp;luck.   Overcoming obstacles for going to production <p>The third key to adoption is to overcome the obstacles that will inevitably come. All new technologies need to overcome obstacles to go to production. Most of these obstacles are common regardless of the technology, but a few are unique to verifiable credentials. During my interviews with other experts, 10 distinct obstacles kept coming up that consistently block teams from going into production. Medium won’t let me embed a table, so you can see the full breakdown of the obstacles on <a href="https://trinsic.id/4-keys-to-ssi-adoption/">Trinsic’s blog,&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Which came first, the issuer or the verifier? Overcoming the chicken/egg problem. <p>The last key to SSI adoption is overcoming the chicken/egg problem. It’s easy to envision a future where verifiable credentials are ubiquitous and useful; everyone has a digital wallet with useful credentials issued by trusted entities which are accepted by verifiers everywhere. But until there are companies issuing verifiable credentials, why would one begin to verify them? And until there are verifiers, why would a company sign up to be an issuer of them? And until there are places to get credentials and other places to use credentials, who will download a digital&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>This is a classic question of causality: How does one cause a market to emerge? When I asked this question to the experts I interviewed, I was surprised at their&nbsp;answer.</p>  50% of respondents believed an ecosystem-driven approach was the best&nbsp;one  50% of respondents believed a single-sided approach was the best&nbsp;one  <p>Personally, I think both are justified, depending on the use&nbsp;case.</p> Ecosystem approach <p>An ecosystem-driven approach is a method to overcome the chicken-egg problem where an entity brings together all sides of the market at the same time. If we take COVID-19 test results as an example, an ecosystem approach would bring together doctor’s clinics &amp; labs (issuers), employers (verifiers), and patients (holders) all at the same time. By curating an entire ecosystem of participants, each can receive the full measure of the value they could expect when verifiable credentials are widely adopted. The challenge with this approach is bringing together all sides of the market simultaneously; it may take longer and cost more than expected. Even in this approach, the use case will need to be constrained in some way (scope, geography, etc.).</p> Single-sided approach <p>What I’ll call a “single-sided” approach, as opposed to a two-sided or three-sided marketplace, is where a single participant gets value from verifiable credentials. Using the same example, in a single-sided approach, the vendor might sell verifiable credentials only to the lab as a way to improve deliverability of test results. This adds immediate value to the lab through standard digital transformation value-adds; process automation, cost reduction, etc. It allows the vendor to focus the value proposition on a single entity instead of curating multiple.</p><p>Once an entity is already issuing credentials, it may be easier to sell a solution to the verifiers of those credentials.</p> Conclusion <p>The chart on the left illustrates the adoption of the fax machine over time. It had to overcome the chicken and egg problem at first, too. It took a long time, but ultimately it only needed two things: specific, individual “killer use cases”, and recognition as a global standard. SSI is well on its way to&nbsp;both.</p><p>Every trusted market in the world will be impacted by verifiable credentials. Billions of dollars of economic value will be created by this new medium for exchanging trusted data, and the early implementors building products with this technology will be rewarded handsomely. I hope these four keys help teams do just&nbsp;that.</p><p>Trinsic is focused on building the best tools to enable developers and other innovators to easily build with verifiable credentials. Over 1,000 developers and companies choose to build on Trinsic — see why at <a href="http://trinsic.id/">http://trinsic.id/</a>. If you’re building a solution and want more support, or would like to give feedback on this work, reach out to us&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">here</a>.</p><p>Footnotes</p>  All four elements are important. Some interesting SSI cases don’t fit my definition but are cool nonetheless. <a href="https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/en/home">BCGov’s OrgBook</a> satisfies all of these except #2 (because OrgBook credentials are issued to a public registry, not a person or entity, so they don’t count in my arbitrary definition of “production”). Likewise, if you book a meeting on my calendar, you’ll get a verifiable credential confirmation in your inbox (powered by our <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-and-zapier-partner/">integration partner Zapier</a>). This satisfies all but #4; its primary purpose is demonstrative and doesn’t actually solve a real business&nbsp;problem.  The other thing I’ll add is that the number of verifiable credentials in production is far from a perfect metric. For example, some groups I spoke with had issued credentials to thousands of people, while others were using credentials in a business-to-business context where the volume of credentials was low but the value per credential was high. Thus the total value created by SSI is only loosely correlated with the sheer number of verifiable credentials in production. I’m always open to adopting better metrics to measure the value of&nbsp;SSI.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/4-keys-to-self-sovereign-identity-adoption-ad269b208569">4 Keys to Self-sovereign Identity Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>I’ve been convinced the world needs&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>&nbsp;(SSI) since my first encounter with it during an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a>&nbsp;for the first job opening at&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>. With fraud, deep fakes, and data breaches abounding, my belief has only expanded; so much so that I, together with cofounders, started&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>&nbsp;to make SSI easy to use. When we began 18 months ago, the tools SSI-interested businesses had at their disposal were dreadfully far from usable. After we launched the first production-grade verifiable credential platform, we’ve become the first choice for over 1,000 developers and businesses around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since technology stopped being a blocker for SSI adoption (seriously, you can issue credentials in production in&nbsp;less than five minutes&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>), hundreds of teams began building solutions. But now all of these teams have a new challenge (this shouldn’t surprise you): SSI is most valuable when it’s widely adopted. Like other standards, SSI benefits greatly from a network effect which forms as adoption grows. The immediate business value of SSI at a given point in time is an exponential function of the state of adoption.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					This graph shows a more realistic picture; it assumes an "S-curve" rate of adoption.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The crux of the matter therefore is: Many implementers won’t realize the potential of SSI until it’s deployed at scale, but in order to get to scale, we need implementers to realize value. It’s the classic chicken &amp; egg problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Trinsic and our customers, partners, and the broader SSI space to achieve the&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">tremendous economic opportunity</a>&nbsp;SSI represents, this adoption problem needs to be solved. We want to do our part to help the SSI space solve this problem, so I decided to interview close to 50 business leaders who are seeking to deploy SSI in production to glean their learnings. The interviewees included our “competitors” (at this stage we’re more collaborative than competitive), a few of Trinsic’s customers, and industry leaders. I have summarized and consolidated their insights and my own thoughts into 4 keys for SSI adoption.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Understanding timing of verifiable credential adoption 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first key to cracking the SSI adoption challenge in your solution is to understand our current place in the verifiable credentials adoption curve; at different phases of adoption, different growth strategies should be employed. A natural metric to gauge the state of SSI adoption is the number of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;deployed in&nbsp;production. (My definition of “production” for the purpose of this piece is that a credential is 1. issued, 2. accepted by someone/something, 3. to solve a real problem that results in 4. the creation of real business value¹.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, I estimated there were only a few hundred verifiable credentials in production. As of October 2020, based on my interviews with all major vendors and many business leaders, I estimate there were the following number of credentials in production:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				56,115 verifiable credentials in production			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Given the billions of credentials I believe will eventually exist, one could easily argue that 56,115² is little more than a drop in the ocean. On the other hand, while the websites created pre-1995&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995">easily fit on a Wikipedia page</a>, they represented the important start of an enormous flywheel. The growth of the SSI market from ~a few hundred to ~56,115 production verifiable credentials in only 10 months is a strong signal of a market that is growing fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During my interviews, I also asked everyone their opinion on when verifiable credentials will really “take off”. New technologies always have a long, slow ramp-up, growing linearly until they hit an inflection point where their growth becomes exponential. It’s impossible to predict when this inflection point will occur, but according to my interviews, experts believe it will be as soon as three years away, but not longer than five years away.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					While it's impossible to know the current state of SSI adoption precisely, my research leads me to believe we're somewhere in the highlighted area. We've come a long way, but there's still a long way to go.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>It’s important to understand where we’re at in the adoption lifecycle so that you can spend your time focused on the right things. It may be too early for point-of-sale systems integrations, but the perfect time for an SSI-powered loyalty program. Given that most experts believe we’re still a few years away from mainstream adoption of SSI, should you want to build a verifiable credential-powered business? Maybe. Would you rather have started an internet company in 1996 or 2001? The earlier you build, the more upside potential exists. But I believe, like the internet, there will be business opportunities in this space for decades to come.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Selling the value of SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The next key to adoption is to sell the value. Verifiable credentials unlock different kinds of value for different players in an ecosystem. Sometimes it’s the issuer who benefits from issuing the credential, while other times it’s the verifier that consumes the value. The business case for verifiable credentials is different for each use case, but here are some tips that apply regardless of the business model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Don’t sell the tech; sell the solution to a problem<br><br>People spend money on solutions to problems, not on technology. (I don’t buy pharmaceuticals—I buy relief from my heartburn.) When you’re selling your solution, don’t lead with the technology. The technology discussion is best-suited as a “nail in the coffin” after the business value is clear.<br><br>A commonality across all production use cases is that they start small. Pick an initial, clear, quantifiable benefit to the customer and build for that. For example, although verifiable credentials offer the ideal platform upon which to build an internationally-portable eKYC system for banks, perhaps it’s better to start initially with authenticating users to ATM machines. Amazon began with the vision to be the “everything store” but started out selling books. It’s ok to grow into your ultimate vision.<br><br>  Don’t talk past your buyer<br><br>With a new technology like verifiable credentials, there are lots of potential reasons a buyer could be interested. Before diving in to your sales pitch, make sure you understand the problem your buyer is trying to solve and speak to that. If you’re selling instant verifiability of data and they’re wanting to buy improved, trusted communication, you’ll have a tough time.<br><br>Some enterprises are still trying to figure out their OIDC or SSO strategies, for example. If the business value you’re selling is secure authentication, the buyer might feel like they’re too premature. But if you’re selling the ability to future-proof the company’s identity-related investment, you might have better luck.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Overcoming obstacles for going to production 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The third key to adoption is to overcome the obstacles that will inevitably come. All new technologies need to overcome obstacles to go to production. Most of these obstacles are common regardless of the technology, but a few are unique to verifiable credentials. My interviews consistently identified 10 distinct obstacles blocking teams from going into production. Here, I’ll share a short thought on how to mitigate them.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 
		 
			
				   Obstacle      Description      Mitigant   
				   Perceived complexity      Friction to get started or complexity to integrate with existing systems      Explain things simply. Stay out of the weeds of the technological underpinnings.      Lack of business case      Both enterprises and startups need to clarify what business value verifiable credentials deliver in their particular use case      Balance technical R&amp;D with business model R&amp;D. This is a place where you can innovate and get ahead. Be systematic in terms of product development and quantify the value that you deliver whenever possible.      Lack of “safety”      Nobody wants to be the first one to arrive at a party or the first to adopt a new technology      Find examples of companies who’ve gone to production and hold them up as examples. Find your own lighthouse customers who are willing to vouch for you.      Buy-in from stakeholders      Getting approvals up the chain can take time      Quantify business value. Support teams not just in tech but also marketing, governance, legal, and operations.      User experience      The UX of SSI can be less than ideal      Find customers who will accept your technology “warts and all”. Use a platform like Trinsic that you can customize to the ideal UX for your specific use case.      Slow-moving issuers      The ideal issuers of credentials are slow-moving or highly-regulated entities      Start small and expand from there. Don’t try to boil the ocean. Quantify results and proactively offer additional solutions.      Execution      Teams deploying verifiable credentials need to execute better      Leverage books, podcasts, and other resources to hone your skills. Be focused in your execution and systematic with your product development.      Governance      Governance defines the rules of play for a given situation      Some people have viewed governance as needed to go to production while others have felt an over-emphasis on governance was slowing our industry down. In the end, it depends on your use case. If you can wait on governance, then wait. If you need formal governance, leverage the templates being created at the Trust over IP Foundation.      Standards paralysis      Waiting for clarity on which implementations will become the de facto standards      If you’re building from scratch, be clear on which standards you’re leveraging and why. Participate in the NGOs (DIF/Hyperledger/ToIP/etc.), and work with the community to make this a non-issue. If you’re leveraging Trinsic, we’ve got you covered.      Advanced tech      Some buyers think verifiable credentials are too forward-thinking and advanced      If you hear this, you’re probably not talking to your ideal customer. Find customers that are willing to accept newer technologies, at least until you get a few lighthouse customers.   
			
		 

		 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Which came first, the issuer or the verifier? Overcoming the chicken/egg problem. 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The last key to SSI adoption is overcoming the chicken/egg problem. It’s easy to envision a future where verifiable credentials are ubiquitous and useful; everyone has a digital wallet with useful credentials issued by trusted entities which are accepted by verifiers everywhere. But until there are companies issuing verifiable credentials, why would one begin to verify them? And until there are verifiers, why would a company sign up to be an issuer of them? And until there are places to get credentials and other places to use credentials, who will download a digital wallet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a classic question of causality: How does one cause a market to emerge? When I asked this question to the experts I interviewed, I was surprised at their answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  50% of respondents believed an ecosystem-driven approach was the best one  50% of respondents believed a single-sided approach was the best one  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I think both are justified, depending on the use case.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Ecosystem approach 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>An ecosystem-driven approach is a method to overcome the chicken-egg problem where an entity brings together all sides of the market at the same time. If we take COVID-19 test results as an example, an ecosystem approach would bring together doctor’s clinics &amp; labs (issuers), employers (verifiers), and patients (holders) all at the same time. By curating an entire ecosystem of participants, each can receive the full measure of the value they could expect when verifiable credentials are widely adopted. The challenge with this approach is bringing together all sides of the market simultaneously; it may take longer and cost more than expected. Even in this approach, the use case will need to be constrained in some way (scope, geography, etc.).</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Single-sided approach 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>What I’ll call a “single-sided” approach, as opposed to a two-sided or three-sided marketplace, is where a single participant gets value from verifiable credentials. Using the same example, in a single-sided approach, the vendor might sell verifiable credentials only to the lab as a way to improve deliverability of test results. This adds immediate value to the lab through standard digital transformation value-adds; process automation, cost reduction, etc. It allows the vendor to focus the value proposition on a single entity instead of curating multiple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once an entity is already issuing credentials, it may be easier to sell a solution to the verifiers of those credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Conclusion 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The chart on the right illustrates the adoption of the fax machine over time. It had to overcome the chicken and egg problem at first, too. It took a long time, but ultimately it only needed two things: specific, individual “killer use cases”, and recognition as a global standard. SSI is well on its way to both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every trusted market in the world will be impacted by verifiable credentials. Billions of dollars of economic value will be created by this new medium for exchanging trusted data, and the early implementors building products with this technology will be rewarded handsomely. I hope these four keys help teams do just that.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is focused on building the best tools to enable developers and other innovators to easily build with verifiable credentials. Over 1,000 developers and companies choose to build on Trinsic.<br><br></p><p>If you’re building a solution and want more support, or would like to give feedback on this work, reach out to us <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">here</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			
						
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Notes 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					  
 	 All four elements are important. Some interesting SSI cases don’t fit my definition but are cool nonetheless.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/en/home">BCGov’s OrgBook</a>&nbsp;satisfies all of these except #2 (because OrgBook credentials are issued to a public registry, not a person or entity, so they don’t count in my arbitrary definition of “production”). Likewise, if you book a meeting on my calendar, you’ll get a verifiable credential confirmation in your inbox (powered by our&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-and-zapier-partner/">integration partner Zapier</a>). This satisfies all but #4; its primary purpose is demonstrative and doesn’t actually solve a real business problem. 
 	 The other thing I’ll add is that the number of verifiable credentials in production is far from a perfect metric. For example, some groups I spoke with had issued credentials to thousands of people, while others were using credentials in a business-to-business context where the volume of credentials was low but the value per credential was high. Thus the total value created by SSI is only loosely correlated with the sheer number of verifiable credentials in production. I’m always open to adopting better metrics to measure the value of SSI.

<p>First-of-a-kind report reveals password-related attacks on enterprises continue to rise but organizations are fighting back.</p>
      
<p>NEW YORK,&nbsp;Jan. 19, 2021 —&nbsp;Enterprises worldwide are accelerating the adoption of passwordless authentication technologies in response to the increase in cyber security threats in 2020, according to a new report released by HYPR, The Passwordless Company® and Cybersecurity Insiders.</p>
      
<p>The report <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2021-state-of-passwordless-security-report">“The 2021 State of Passwordless Security”</a> includes insights from over 425 information technology professionals, representing a cross-section of organizations of varying sizes across multiple industry verticals, globally. It uncovered the key drivers and barriers to passwordless adoption and organizations’ technology preferences, based on data from Cybersecurity’s 500,000-member community.</p>
      
<p>90% of survey respondents experienced phishing attacks against their organizations in 2020, 29% of those experienced credential stuffing – revealing the impact of remote working and the overall increase in attacks on legacy and password-based multi-factor authentication (MFA). 91% say preventing credentials-based attacks is the primary reason for MFA, 64% cite improving user experience, 21% believe it’s essential to their digital transformation journey, and 14% attribute MFA to increased cost savings. In terms of defense, close to all of the respondents reported a need to establish a passwordless security strategy.</p>
      
<p>“Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, passwords and shared secrets were the number one cause of breaches despite billions of dollars invested in cyber security. This report highlights that many organizations are now re-allocating funds and investing passwordless technologies,” said&nbsp;George Avetisov, HYPR Co-Founder and CEO, “Not only have&nbsp;a&nbsp;meaningful number of organizations already deployed passwordless technology, they demonstrate a clear understanding of its impact and use cases. The key takeaway is that adoption of passwordless security is further along than we think, and it’s happening faster than anyone predicted.”</p>
      
<p>Other key findings include:</p>
      
<p>Remote workers dominate when it comes to Passwordless</p>
      
<p>The pandemic forced organizations to adapt to new ways of working, with the majority moving to a remote model. Today, 78% of global CEOs agree that remote collaboration is here to stay, according to a survey by PWC.1&nbsp;This shift saw a positive impact on passwordless adoption with remote work identified as the number one use case (86%). Close to three quarters of onsite employees rounded out the top, followed by external contractors (43%), and lastly 24% represented customers and consumers.</p>
      
<p>Organizations understand the need to evolve beyond passwords</p>
      
<p>Adoption of passwordless MFA remains steady with 36% using smartphones as FIDO tokens, 17% are using hardware security keys such as Yubico Yubikey or Google Titan, etc, and 17% are leveraging built in authenticators such as Windows Hello. However, 48% of respondents say their organization still lacks a passwordless solution.</p>
      
<p>Despite the uptick, many organizations are still using two step multi-factor authentication to verify users. 61% reveal that their passwordless solution still requires a shared secret as an underlying password, a one-time password (OTP), or SMS code. Additionally:</p>
      
  Over 90% consider it essential or somewhat important to eliminate shared secrets for authentication  22% are “unsure,” suggesting more education is required to define the benefits of passwordless MFA  Organizations must prioritize ease of use and speed to ensure a superior “passwordless user experience,” yet 67% of respondents say their organization lacks the right skills and teams to ensure seamless adoption  
      
<p>Organizations must consider the variables before undergoing passwordless transformation</p>
      
<p>When choosing a method, a mobile-first passwordless MFA solution is preferred over traditional options, with close to three quarters of respondents saying smartphones are the most convenient and provide the most user-friendly experience. This usability also contributes to the high number of remote users (86%) adopting passwordless technology.</p>
      
<p>Integration, standards and interoperability are essential when it comes to choosing a passwordless solution. 76% require ease of use and ease of integration, followed by cost, while interoperability with multiple identity providers was important for two-thirds of those surveyed. Additionally, close to all respondents’ state that leveraging a standards-based approach such as Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is paramount to ensure a future-proof environment.</p>
      
<p>Upcoming Fireside Chat&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>HYPR is hosting a virtual Fireside Chat to discuss the report findings in context of the current cybersecurity landscape. You are invited to attend, to share your thoughts and pose questions to a panel of industry experts.</p>

 To enhance security without sacrificing convenience or jeopardizing privacy, European companies must adopt intuitive solutions powered by biometric technology. <p>With <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93501-enterprise-security-teams-struggle-with-the-growing-pace-volume-and-sophistication-of-cyberattacks">cyber threats targeting the enterprise reaching new heights last year</a>, and the deadline for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/europe/merchant-services/insights/strong-customer-authentication-whats-next">just around the corner,</a> companies operating within Europe will be wondering how to protect their users and workforce from threats, without adding further disruptions to workflow or complexity to the login experience.</p><p>Without disregarding the deadline for SCA, it’s important that businesses avoid rushing to adopt solutions that are inherently complex and insecure, such as those that are partly dependent on passwords or legacy 2FA authentication, as these methods can still leave private systems <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/opinion/2fa-cyberattacks-security.html">susceptible to&nbsp;threats</a>.</p><p>Security and IT leaders must instead prepare to adopt intuitive authentication solutions that make strong, secure authentication as easy as possible for the user. To free us from our dependency on outdated authentication technology, we must start considering how user-friendly authentication technology, like biometrics, can be leveraged to enhance security.</p> Users are ready for biometrics, is&nbsp;Europe? <p>There’s really only one option when it comes to strong authentication: the simplicity and accuracy of biometrics can enhance security and the login experience all at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Since biometrics are unique to each user and require little conscious effort, they can help solve many of the user-experience and security pain points associated with more cumbersome authentication methods, like usernames and passwords, or email and SMS two-factor authentication. Their inherent simplicity is the exact reason <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/security/how-fingerprint-authentication-works.html">users have become becoming increasingly comfortable using biometrics</a> to access their personal devices and accounts.</p><p>However, despite the clear benefits, the adoption of biometric solutions at the enterprise level has been slow in Europe <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/biometric-adoption/">compared to Asia, Africa, and Latin American markets</a>. One obvious reason for this trend is that companies operating in the European Union are under more regulatory pressure to protect sensitive biometric data under the General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>Thus, processing sensitive biometric data, which cannot be readily changed in the event of a privacy breach, comes with an unprecedented level of responsibility — a burden that many businesses simply don’t want to&nbsp;carry.</p><p>The good news is that solutions leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies directly address the issue of privacy in relation to the use of biometrics.</p> Closing the trust&nbsp;gap <p>Privacy-enhancing technologies is an umbrella term for a range of advanced cryptographic techniques for processing, storing, and managing private data in a way that does not expose the data to any party involved in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Privacy-enhancing technologies can essentially be leveraged to securely store private authentication data on the cloud using distributed systems. While this might not mean anything to the average user, the ability to securely store biometrics on a distributed cloud network is nothing short of revolutionary in cybersecurity.</p><p>Current biometric solutions — <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/local-authentication-vs-keyless-pt-1-faceid-and-yubikey-cb1b594d399c">take Face ID for example</a> — lock biometric data to a user’s device, essentially marrying a user to it and as a result creating a chain reaction of user-experience issues if the user loses access to that&nbsp;device.</p><p>Distributed cloud storage gives users more control, as they can essentially use one set of biometrics across multiple-devices. In terms of user experience, this allows for features such as biometric-enabled account backup and recovery and multi-device registration.</p><p>In terms of enabling strong security, this means that companies can have greater assurance that a user is who they say they are (as each user only has one set of biometrics for all their devices).</p><p>For companies using legacy authentication solutions (usernames and passwords) that rely on centralized databases to store private credentials, the transition to private-by-design distributed cloud systems can reduce the impact of security breaches, helping to restore trust and improve relationships with employees, users, and external stakeholders.</p> The opportunity <p>The future of security depends on our ability to make authentication fast, easy, and as minimally disruptive to the user-journey as possible.</p><p>Solutions that replace cumbersome authentication methods, with user-friendly, privacy-first solutions will dramatically improve their security and compliance posture, without impeding productivity or user-experience.</p><p>It’s up to companies whether or not they’re ready to embrace this step change. Those that do will become significantly more resilient to threats, and attractive to customers.</p> Request a Free Demo of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io/">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io/">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io/">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/embracing-user-friendly-authentication-is-key-to-strong-security-in-europe-2b8178870f14">Embracing user-friendly authentication is key to strong security in Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Pioneering the KERI stack 



<p>Over the course of 2020, Jolocom added support for an <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">off-chain element based on KERI</a>. This is in addition to the Jolocom DID method (did:jolo and did:keri), which supports the Jolocom-Lib, our own SDK and the Jolocom SmartWallet.</p>



<p>Jolocom focused on the Rust KERI implementation, which we donated to DIF last fall and can be found <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox/">here</a>.</p>



<p>An example of the KERI DID registrar/resolver integrated in our library can be found <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/jolocom-lib/tree/next/ts/didMethods/local">here</a>. This is also included in the Jolocom SmartWallet via the <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/jolocom-sdk">SDK</a> integration.</p>



<p>With that, interested parties can already start building high-level verifiable credential-based services and workflows on KERI. More details are available <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">here</a>. KERI is currently being worked on in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Decentralized Identity Foundation’s Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, which is co-chaired by Dr. Sam Smith who originated KERI and contributed ideas and feedback to this article. Currently, there are three community-driven implementations in progress, in <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/kerijs">JavaScript</a>. Anyone who wishes to get involved in these is actively encouraged to do so.</p>



 Driving standards and interoperability 



<p>There is a substantial need for interoperability within and beyond the SSI community. As such, numerous efforts to achieve this are taking shape among the broader SSI community. In that context, DIDComm was donated to DIF by the Aries community’s Daniel Hardman (thank you!). Under DIF, a dedicated working group is working on the DIDComm v2 specification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Jolocom strongly believe that DIDComm is a crucial infrastructure element for the broader and future-proof SSI stack, and current work on DIDComm v2 includes Jolocom’s implementation of the specification with authcrypt (authenticated encrypted) and most of the low level of the protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rotation messaging is supported with the library, only the logic of actually handling it will be on the caller’s side. The initial implementation was developed <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/didcomm-rs">here</a> and will now be donated to DIF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ConsenSys Mesh are working on a staged approach, where they focus first on DIDComm v2 payload and Aries issue credentials/present proof. We will then add the JWE (JWM) encryption layer.</p>



<p>During the DIF F2F, a small demo will be held to show the message lifecycle in various setups&nbsp; – direct, mediated, raw, encrypted or signed – using didcomm-rs library. DIDComm is currently being worked on in <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIF’s DID Communication Working Group</a>, co-chaired by Sam Curren, Oliver Terbu and Tobias Looker. Once again, interested parties are actively encouraged to participate.</p>

 Ocean Shipyard — The First&nbsp;Wave  Learn about the inaugural batch of projects in Ocean’s early-stage program <p>We are excited to announce that after countless hours of reviews, interviews, due diligence, and brainstorming — the first wave of Ocean Shipyard has officially kicked off. We received a whopping 60 applications from teams excited to BUIDL on Ocean Protocol, for which we are grateful. Out of 60 applications, we have shortlisted six teams to be included in the first wave of Ocean Shipyard.</p><p>The total funding for this round is about $157,000 in OCEAN tokens. Upon successful completion of pre-determined milestones and deliverables, Ocean Protocol Foundation will release funds to participants. This ensures that teams are motivated to build and deliver on time, assuring proper usage of funds to foster the ecosystem.</p><p>Apart from funding the teams, Ocean also provides them with mentorship from our team and advisors to advance their product and&nbsp;company.</p><p>Other perks include (and not limited&nbsp;to):</p>  joint marketing opportunities  introduction to top crypto VC funds for seed&nbsp;round  possible admission into leading incubators and accelerators  possible next round of&nbsp;funding  <p>Ocean’s Head of Ecosystem Sheridan Johns says, “Ocean is extremely pleased and proud to welcome such a diverse and accomplished group of outstanding projects to the inaugural batch of the Ocean Shipyard program. Each of these carefully selected projects is ideally positioned to help drive the sustainability and growth of Ocean Protocol in various ways. We look forward to working closely together with them over the coming months to help them scale and flourish.”</p><p>Without further ado, we’re pleased to present the newly inducted members of Ocean Shipyard.</p> DataUnion.app <p>DataUnion.app is a crowdsourced data annotation platform. By using a reward system based on Ocean’s datatokens, anyone can contribute and become a stakeholder. Their first data vault is for images. Images are uploaded and annotated by contributors, after which they are verified. Contributors receive datatokens as a reward and become stakeholders in the dataset. This combination of mechanics creates an intrinsic motivation to contribute positively. Their primary goal is to empower people to use their data for a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>DataUnion.app’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>This project brings a lot of value to the Ocean ecosystem by incentivizing our community to participate in data annotation services and bringing meaningful data and services to Ocean Protocol. In the longterm, they want to migrate to a DAO, similar to OceanDAO, to facilitate self-sustaining growth.</p> <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule</a> <p>Molecule is a virtual accelerator platform that helps scientists translate their discoveries into novel therapeutics for patients. Molecule is building a Web3 marketplace to decentralize ownership dynamics in drug development. Drug development consists of two core value drivers: data production and intellectual property rights. Opening and tokenizing IP rights is challenging because most ownership and funding models may be considered securities. At its core, Molecule aims to create new fluid structures to fund early-stage pre-clinical data creation by scientists that enable an open data economy around new therapeutics. Combining this with composable tokenized frameworks on an open speculative market, they hope to overcome reproducibility issues around harmful data — one of the most significant problems in research&nbsp;today.</p><p>Molecule’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>Molecule intends to pioneer a novel data production fundraising mechanism (SAFDs) to empower new early-stage therapeutics, a +$100B market. To accomplish this, they want to leverage Ocean to develop new co-operative ownership and funding structures for biopharma research data, starting in longevity (geroscience). They will launch one of the first tokenized data co-operatives on Ocean tied to a real-world therapeutic research project: GeroDao. GeroDao will bring a new stream of datasets onto Ocean and enable a new fundraising mechanism for generating such novel datasets, thereby opening up a new tool for crowdfunding to produce exceptional data.</p> Oort <p>Oort Digital, a DeFi aggregator for NFTs, is a super account that allows people to do anything with their NFTs — no need for a bank. Compared to DeFi, the NFT ecosystem is still in its infancy in both applications and market cap. But the maturity of the NFT space is upon the horizon. NFTs have a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/could-nfts-become-2021s-biggest-crypto-trend/">great potential to supercharge DeFi</a>, and the growth experienced in recent years is promising — DeFi has exploded from below $482 million to over $21 billion in the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>Oort’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>Oort intends to create an NFT lending platform that allows anyone to lend their NFTs and receive compensation in return. Using Ocean data, Oort wants to make price oracles for NFT valuations. This idea opens up a slew of opportunities for Ocean to be used as price oracles along with data feeds monetization platform — not only for NFT and collectibles but even in DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> PostHuman <p>Models like GPT-3 are extremely powerful generalists, which will likely only improve in the next few years. The benefits of such models ought to be equitably shared by humanity at large. Unfortunately, training and inference from models are presently strictly controlled by large centralized institutions like Microsoft. However, if models are trained in a zero-knowledge environment, countless miners, who all know their work will be rewarded, can conduct the training. PostHuman leverages GPUs’ availability worldwide to train useful transformer models and invites miners to bet their compute on models they feel will be used the most. PostHuman proposes a marketplace utilizing ZK-FT, where anybody can build upon any existing model by further fine-tuning it (on the same or different data) and be rewarded if the model proves&nbsp;useful.</p><p>PostHuman’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>PostHuman will leverage Ocean Protocol to create the backbone of zero-knowledge model publication on their marketplace. Additionally, all inference requests will be on the Ocean network due to the model’s decentralized and zero-knowledge nature. It will not be possible for an individual to run inference on a published model outside the ocean ecosystem. Therefore, every inference request will utilize Ocean tokens for payment, dramatically increasing demand/value as more useful models are published in the marketplace.</p> <a href="https://swashapp.io/">Swash</a> <p>Swash unlocks and democratizes new streams of the data economy for web users while disrupting the legacy models for data brokering and online advertising. Swash is creating a transparent data crowdsourcing and crowd-selling solution in the Web3 model. Users can profit directly from their data and attention while data buyers and advertisers reach wider audiences, improve efficiency, and obtain users’&nbsp;consent.</p><p>Since its Beta launch, Swash has attracted over 7,300 organic users. In May 2020, Swash was selected by Outlier Ventures from over 270 startups to join their coveted accelerator program. Recently, Swash has been presented in industry events and praised by thought leaders on several occasions, including Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Coindesk, and Hackernoon.</p><p>Swash’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>The type, volume, and quality of Swash data are unique and attractive to many data consumers. Swash is already well-versed in the ecosystem and shares similar vision and values with Ocean Protocol. The growing number of Swash users will benefit Ocean as well. This is the first use case at the application layer where two leading decentralized data platforms, <a href="https://streamr.network/">Streamr</a> and Ocean, are utilized, sending a strong signal to the market. The data crowdsourced from Swash users can be sold in a marketplace on Ocean and accessed by third-party data analysis projects to run their algorithms to extract insights. The resulting revenue can be distributed among contributors: users, analysts, Swash, and&nbsp;Ocean.</p> <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca/">Transport Genie</a> <p>Animal welfare is a long-standing issue in the agrifood industry, as companies attempt to balance the need for large-scale livestock production environments with animal welfare legislation. Presently, animal welfare concerns are costing the global food industry billions of dollars in fines, lost revenue, and brand dilution. Transport Genie is solving this problem by creating bespoke IoT sensors with a precision monitoring solution. Transport Genie believes in Ocean’s ability to enable a decentralized and secure data marketplace where their customers can be compensated while also allowing their customers to have non-custodial data&nbsp;control.</p><p>Transport Genie’s Value for&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>This collaboration will enable Ocean to source new data feeds directly from Transport Genie’s IoT devices, thereby improving the diversity of datasets within the Ocean Market. More importantly, this collaboration will also attract and demonstrate to IoT industry veterans how they can incentivize their customers to securely monetize their private data without giving away control of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Applications for the next wave of Shipyard contenders will begin this February.

 Hypotheekacceptatie op basis van brondata nieuwe standaard in hypotheekketen 



<p>Steeds meer partijen binnen de hypotheekketen maken gebruik van brondata. Dit is door de consument aangeleverde persoonsinformatie, die via de Ockto-app direct wordt ontsloten vanuit overheidsbronnen en banken. Dankzij de Brondata Service kan de door de consument aangeleverde dataset die gebruikt wordt voor hypotheekadvies, ook gebruikt worden voor de hypotheekacceptatie door hypotheekverstrekkers. Uiteraard na toestemming van de adviseur én consument en volgens alle geldende regelgeving. Komende maanden zullen Aegon, Argenta, ING, Lot Hypotheken en Ockto deze nieuwe standaard actief bij adviseurs onder de aandacht brengen.</p>



<p>Bijna twee jaar geleden begon een aantal partijen uit de hypotheekketen met de Brondata Service voor het onderling uitwisselen van data via het HDN-netwerk. Inmiddels is dit uitgegroeid tot een breed ondersteunde ketenoplossing en zijn al 10 hypotheekverstrekkers, 9 hypotheekketens, 4 adviespakketten, 3 hypotheekservicers en 2 CRM pakketten aangesloten op deze nieuwe standaard.</p>



<p>De bekendheid van de Brondata Service bij het intermediair kan echter beter. Er wordt nog maar beperkt geprofiteerd van de voordelen. Daarom slaan Aegon, Argenta, ING, Lot Hypotheken en Ockto de handen in één om adviseurs hierover te informeren. Om te benadrukken dat het hier om een breed ondersteunde systematiek gaat die door vele partijen in de keten gebruikt wordt is onder andere onderstaande video ontwikkeld. Komende maanden zullen adviseurs vanuit verschillende kanten hiermee benaderd worden.</p>



 
 



 
 
 



 
 



<p>Voordelen Brondata Service</p>



<p>De voordelen van het gebruiken van de Ockto dataset werken door in het gehele hypotheekproces. De digitale informatie uit brondata zorgt dat er door de consument minder losse documenten aangeleverd hoeven te worden. Daardoor verloopt het proces voor zowel consument, adviseur als hypotheekverstrekker sneller. Gegevens zijn immers sneller binnen, in één keer goed en direct in te lezen in de te gebruiken systemen.</p>



<p>Steeds meer partijen sluiten zich aan</p>



<p>Gert Vasse, Account Director Ockto: “Steeds meer aanvragen worden gedaan op basis van brondata, daar zien we duidelijk een stijgende lijn in. Dit kunnen adviseurs doen door klanten uit te nodigen om persoonsgegevens aan te leveren met behulp van Ockto. Toch zijn adviseurs soms nog wat terughoudend in het gebruik van deze techniek. Veelgehoorde argumenten zijn dat nog niet genoeg geldverstrekkers zijn aangesloten op de Brondata Service en dat nog een te beperkt aantal stukken komt te vervallen. Maar als je doorpraat blijken er toch veel meer partijen aangesloten dan waar adviseurs zich in eerste instantie bewust van zijn. En dit aantal blijft groeien, net als de verschillende stukken die hiermee zullen komen te vervallen.”</p>



<p>Hele keten werkt mee aan verbetering</p>



<p>Dat er ook nog wat puntjes op de i moeten worden gezet wordt niet ontkend. Vasse: “Een oplossing die zo veel partijen en softwarepakketten in de keten raakt is altijd uitdagend. Maar ook dit wordt door de keten opgepakt voor het grotere belang. HDN heeft bijvoorbeeld de belangrijke rol op zich genomen om voor deze nieuwe standaard te zorgen dat werken met de Brondata Service door de hele keten soepel verloopt, en blijft verlopen, ongeacht welke leveranciers gebruikt worden. En met hypotheekservicers zoals Quion hebben we bijvoorbeeld ook diverse initiatieven lopen om te zorgen voor een goede adoptie.”</p>



<p>Robert Harreman, Algemeen Directeur Ockto, voegt hieraan toe: “Werken met brondata gaat hoe dan ook de norm worden binnen de hypotheeksector. De hypotheekketen blijft stevig verder digitaliseren. De voordelen voor de consument zijn groot, want hij weet veel sneller met zekerheid waar hij aan toe is, zonder daarvoor allerlei documenten aan te hoeven leveren. Voor de hypotheekverstrekkers betekent het werken met de Brondata Service een grote digitaliseringsslag. Die gaat niet overwaaien. Wij raden adviseurs dan ook aan om snel ervaring met deze nieuwe manier van werken op te doen. Onderzoek hoe je deze technologie optimaal in je werkwijze kan inpassen. Door dit goed in te zetten zorgen je voor een hoge klanttevredenheid, een flinke kostenbesparing en duurzame relevantie.”</p>

  <p>Although virtual assistants have been around for a while, and most <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-ways-to-stay-customer-centric-in-uncertain-times/">consumers</a> are used to dealing with them, the application is limited and the experience can be poor. However, there is a whole new level of virtual assistance on the way called advanced virtual assistants, which are capable of functioning as virtual billing agents, virtual AI/VR agents or even virtual driver/car agents.</p>
<p>The impact will be substantial in industries, organizations and consumer interactions. But advanced virtual assistants are just one of 23 of the most impactful technologies featured on the Gartner Emerging Technologies and Trends Impact Radar for 2021.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37986"]</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the technologies that I find especially interesting. I’ll examine a few that are right around the corner (e.g., advanced virtual assistants) and one that is further out (AR cloud). These technologies align to three themes:</p>
 
 Interfaces and experiences: Technologies that are fundamentally changing the way we interact with the world. 
 Business enablers: Technologies that impact enterprises by changing practices, processes, methods, models or functions. 
 Productivity revolution: The confluence of multiple technologies and trends that help organizations quickly, accurately and in greater volume, classify, predict and solve problems that humans cannot. 
 
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-emerging-technologies-explained-by-gartner-experts/">5 Emerging Technologies Explained by Gartner Experts</a></p>
<p>You can see these technologies here on our 2021 Emerging Technologies Impact Radar. The rings represent the range, which estimates the number of years it will take until the technology or trend crosses from early adopter to early majority adopter. The size and color of the emerging technology — or trend radar blip — represent the technology’s mass; in other words, how substantial will the impact of the technology or trend be on existing products and markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1hZmI2MTQzNTU3NzYxMWViODc2MmE3MGQ5NDczOWQzMA=="></a></p>
 Advanced virtual assistants (AVAs) 
<p>Advanced virtual assistants, sometimes referred to as<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-habits-of-organizations-with-successful-ai/"> AI</a> conversational agents, process human inputs to deliver predictions and decisions. They are powered by a combination of conversational user interface, natural language processing (NLP), and semantic and deep learning techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs), prediction models, decision support and personalization.</p>
 Time to market: 1-3 years 
<p>The estimated time to market is driven by the expansion of current, limited function virtual assistants (which have been around for years now) to advanced virtual assistants that target a multitude of jobs and functions — propelling the expansion of AI conversational agents into every sphere of consumer lives, business interactions and operations.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/">Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021</a><br>
</p>
<p>The impact potential of advanced virtual assistants is high because the technology can be utilized in virtually every vertical segment and almost all disciplines. It has the potential to transform the nature of how an application is used for the workforce and how consumers interact with devices and the IoT (Internet of Things) while enhancing customer experience and engagement.</p>
 Transformer-based language models 
<p>Transformer-based language models are DNNs that process words as sequences in a sentence. This approach preserves the context or meaning of surrounding terms. It also substantially improves translation, transcription and natural language generation. These models are trained on enormous datasets of billions of phrases.</p>
 Time to market: 1-3 years 
<p>The time to market is driven by the effectiveness of the training tools, runtime efficiency and ease of deployment. Transformer-based language models, such as GPT-3, have the capability to generate paragraphs of text that are indistinguishable from those written by a well-educated human.</p>
<p>The impact potential of transformer-based language models is very high because they are displacing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) systems at a surprising rate. And new tools deliver substantial improvements in advanced text analytics and all related applications, such as conversational user interfaces, intelligent virtual assistants and automated text generation.</p>
 Packaged business capabilities 
<p>The composable business enables organizations to create custom application experiences composed from application components that they buy or build. To support the composable business, technology providers should deliver packaged business capabilities, which represent a well-defined set of business features that are recognizable as such by a business user.</p>
 Time to market: 3-6 years 
<p>The time to market is driven by the high number of vendors that have modularized their offerings. That being said, despite this progress, smaller providers and providers transitioning from older technologies still find themselves in the earliest stages of API adoption.</p>
<p>The impact potential of packaged business capabilities is medium because the technology typically represents a repackaging of existing capabilities, but the widespread implementation of the composable business will transform the way that traditional providers market, sell and deliver their solutions.</p>
 AR cloud 
<p>AR cloud enables the unification of physical and digital worlds by delivering persistent, collaborative and contextual digital content overlaid on people, objects and locations to provide people with information and services directly tied to every aspect of their physical surroundings.</p>
<p>For example, any individual can receive fare, route, schedule and routing information about public transit based on their context (personal status, geolocation, calendar appointment, travel preferences, etc.), by simply “looking at” a bus or bus station with your phone, tablet or <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/head-mounted-displays-hmd">head-mounted display (HMD)</a>. Further information can be crowdsourced, such as users noting how often the bus has been late in recent weeks.</p>
 Time to market: 6-8 years 
<p>The time to market comes from a need for numerous, underlying elements such as edge networking, high bandwidth and low-latency communications, standardized tools and content types for publishing into the AR cloud, management and delivery of content, and interoperability to ensure seamless and ubiquitous experiences.</p>
<p>The impact potential of AR cloud is very high because it will transform how people will interact with the world around them. AR cloud will provide a digital abstraction layer for people, places and things and will space across business and consumer applications and impact every industry regardless of geography. This will enable new experiences and, in turn, new business models and ways to interact and monetize the physical world.</p>

The closest we could probably get to what you're asking, Adrian, is to align the Zero Trust Architecture principles to how DIDs and VCs can help -- primarily around: identity verification (VCs), login authentication (DIDs), least-privilege access (ZCAPs, Confidential Storage), and HTTP API access authorization (ZCAPs).</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2021Jan/0004.html">More from Adrian</a></p><blockquote><p>The most important message from the SolarWinds hack and much of the ransomware havoc is that our systems are not set up for individual accountability or independent audit.</p><p>The VC and ZCAPs perspective is inadequate. As an SSI community we need to address the separation of concerns between authentication, authorization, and audit as equally important and needing a harmonized best-practice perspective.

<p>We held our first community meeting about interest in building out the distributed database capabilities of the Web Native File System (WNFS).</p><p>Here is the video from the January 7th, 2021 meeting:</p><p>James posted <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/kicking-things-off/1372">notes from the kickoff</a>:</p>  As we had predicted, the group was a mix of people who are interested in using WNDB as app developers (who have feature and API design interests) and those interested in the protocol / “plumbing” of WNDB  There were not a lot of strong feelings about the nature of the API - rather, WNDB needs features and documentation on how to implement them  There is a lot of interest / consensus around our initial event source-based design ideas. Brooklyn highlighted <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/unofficial-guide-to-datomic-internals/">datomic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">datascript</a>.  A lot of good (early) discussion around schema management: developers should be able to define them (but also share and re-use), they should be applied as “views”, and lots of interest in <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html">project cambria</a>  <p>We've got a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/developers/webnative-db/53">new Webnative DB category in the forum</a> that you can subscribe to and follow along, as well as <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">join the Fission Discord chat</a>.</p>

			 Nida joined the team at the beginning of Tokeny’s establishment as an UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer 

		 
	 
              
	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>I’m Nida Orhan. I am a remote UI/UX designer and Frontend Developer. I was born in and I am still living in Turkey. I have studied Business at Bogazici University. I have done a couple of internships in sales, marketing and finance departments in various companies in my first years of college. In my third year, I started to learn graphic/web design to create visuals and interfaces for our startup project. Our business idea didn’t work out in the end but from this grew a strong interest in web design and development and I decided to pursue a career in the field. I took courses and did an internship as a graphic designer. After finishing college I worked as a frontend developer in Turkey for some time, then I did freelance design and development for almost 1 year. After that I joined Tokeny in its early days and have been working here since then.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was looking for a permanent remote position and I got an offer from Tokeny. The company was only a few months old at the time with a few employees. The team was still trying to finish the first MVP. After interviewing with our CEO, I was impressed by Tokeny’s vision in blockchain technology and it was obvious for me that the company will succeed in this area. So I wanted to be a part of the team that will realize that vision.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Tokeny has been a remote friendly company since the beginning. It is a flexible and well connected organization. We have regular weekly online meetings to keep each other in sync about our work and monthly meetings to learn about the company’s overall performance and strategy. I love the collaborative team culture and friendly atmosphere at Tokeny. I have been working remotely for almost 3 years now and I have never had the chance to visit our offices in Europe but I have always felt accepted and valued and seen as a part of the team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m most passionate about product design. I love creating applications from scratch that are beautiful and easy-to-use for people and doing this by combining design and development. It has been always very satisfying for me to design an interface and bring it to life with code.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I have many, but the ultimate one is to live a fun and happy life with my family. I became the mother of an adorable little son two years ago and he has been the center of my life since then. I want to see him grow and cherish him throughout his life.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would like to give everyone the opportunity of having a high quality education so that everyone can achieve their dreams.</p>

<p>Midnight (GMT) on the 11th of January marked the end of the 5-week <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-2-incentives/">incentive bonus</a> period for the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-1/">Dock token migration</a>. During this time, 222,268,512 tokens were submitted to the Vault (migration address) within the incentivization window and will share in the 20M swap bonus. That means for every 12 tokens swapped, token holders received approximately 1 bonus token. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the swap bonus, Dock also made a vesting bonus pool available. Token holders collectively opted in to lock up 71,213,970 tokens and will share in the 5M DOCK pool. This means that for every 15 tokens opted for vesting, token holders will receive 1 bonus token. After conducting a community vote during the migration, the original vesting pool incentive (which had been set to 30 million Dock tokens) was reduced to 5 million tokens, with 25 million tokens being set aside for future community incentives. </p><p>The coins locked for vesting and the bonus tokens were distributed on the 12th of January and sent to the main net account addresses used during the migration. These tokens are shown as reserved in the Polkadot-js wallet and they will be unlocked and available approximately 5 weeks from when the migration transaction was processed.<br><br>The migration to the new mainnet token will continue until midnight (GMT) on the 7th of March and holders can continue to <a href="https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial">migrate directly</a> with Dock. Binance has also <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/758e3d56c5f747fdbf5eeebfd509dc54">announced</a> their plan to help holders migrate, although they have yet to confirm when this service will be available.<br><br>Exchange support for the new token has been extremely encouraging with Huobi, Kucoin and gate.io all supporting the trading of Dock’s new mainnet token. Additional exchanges are either in the process of integrating Dock’s new wallet, or are making preparations to do so. </p><p>As <a href="https://blog.dock.io/governance-features-added-to-dock-mainnet/">announced</a> earlier this week, the utility of Dock’s new token is already in evidence as Dock has introduced on-chain democratic governance features to Dock’s mainnet. Any holders of the new Dock mainnet token, as well as the members of the Dock Association Council, can now propose changes to the network. The Council will regularly review and vote on the proposals, and quickly act upon the ones they approve.</p>

These can run on existing PC workstations and remote devices including smartphones and tablets. As part of digital transformation these solutions should improve productivity, increase employee satisfaction, and create value in distributed cloud infrastructures. As the world shifts to greatly increased mobile and remote working during and after the global pandemic, Workplace Delivery Platforms will enable a richer working experience from wherever end users are situated. As ever, security of these platforms should be a primary consideration when buying.</p>

 Ontology and Daimler Accelerate Progress on ‘Welcome Home’&nbsp;App  Enjoy full transparency and take control of your own data and&nbsp;privacy <p>We are happy to announce that the much anticipated “Welcome Home” application powered by Ontology has officially passed through the initial stages of review with Daimler Mobility. As a truly pioneering MVP product, Welcome Home combines the premium experience of Daimler’s mobility units with Ontology’s technical superiority, especially related to decentralized identities and data protection. All of this can be experienced in 6 simple steps, outlined in the videos&nbsp;below!</p><p>This marks an unprecedented step in the right direction, bringing your automotive experience a step closer to Ontology’s decentralized blockchain services.</p><p>Car operators who have access to the Welcome Home in-car system will have control over unique features, including:</p>  Your in-car and mobility service preferences are attached to your profile, not to any one particular vehicle, therefore you could transform any vehicle into your own, anytime, anywhere across the&nbsp;globe.  You can access third-party service providers integrated into the system with one-time verification, yet stay anonymous to all providers after the services are completed.  You will be authorizing your data for service providers to give personalized services, yet you retain full transparency and control of all access and usage of your data, which would allow you to stay anonymous.  <p>According to Harry Behrens, Head of Daimler Mobility Blockchain Factory:</p><blockquote>“Customers using the Welcome Home which integrates with the Daimler Mobility Blockchain Platform would be greeted to their customized user settings and profile by any Mercedes they pair the app with. Fully sovereign in control of their data they can choose to share this experience with their friends and be safe at home with Mercedes — anywhere they&nbsp;go”</blockquote><p>As we’ve written about previously, Welcome Home is designed to be a user-centric application granting us full control over when, where, and whom we share data with through our ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>We firmly believe that the control over which content to share should belong to the user, and is something achievable through our Decentralized Identity (DeID) protocol as well as our Distributed Data Exchange Framework (DDXF) — both powered by cryptographic algorithms on the blockchain.</p><p>At the end of your journey, you can share your trip with people in your social circle with just a couple of clicks. This allows the Welcome Home app to combine your mobility with social networking. By using Ontology’s unique framework for DID and highly secure data access we have combined usability with the highest standards for data sovereignty and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Looking to the future, we look forward to the gradual rollout of not just the Welcome Home app, but also further automotive innovations through Daimler Mobility and their embrace of the blockchain world.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="https://ont.io/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology GitHub</a> / <a href="https://onto.app/?source=post_page---------------------------">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases?source=post_page---------------------------">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Telegram (English)</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc">“Welcome Home” is now Approved!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>ArcBlock 2020 year in review was a transitional year for the Blockchain industry. In this article, ArcBlock CEO Robert Mao takes a look back at some of the challenges, opportunities, and showcases an optimistic view of what’s to come in&nbsp;2021.</blockquote> ArcBlock CEO, Robert Mao — “A Year of Progress” <p>Whether it’s me or the ArcBlock team, 2020 has been a tough year, while also being a year of growth and love. I believe that one day in the future when we look back we will all realize that we accomplished a lot — both personally and professionally.</p><p>Similar to many of our friends and customers, ArcBlock was deeply impacted by the epidemic and saw the overall industry take a downward trajectory as many businesses and individuals began to realize the full extent of the&nbsp;virus.</p><p>So for ArcBlock 2020 was a time to reflect, learn from our mistakes, and return to our beginning by rediscovering ourselves and focusing ourselves on our mission to make decentralization a reality. We are removing past mistakes, focusing on our strengths, and delivering products to our customers that they need, want, and can&nbsp;use.</p><p>2021 is no longer about unrealistic expectations, but rather embracing who we are and what we want to do in order to make ArcBlock a success. If you go back and look at the last year, you can see that despite the impact of the pandemic the ArcBlock team remained strong, resilient, and focused on building, improving, and delivering our products.</p><p>“One day in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.”</p> Product Releases  ABT Node   In July, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/07/30/abt-node-rc1">ArcBlock officially released ABT Node&nbsp;RC1</a>  In September, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/09/01/arcblock-releases-abt-node">ArcBlock officially released ABT Node 1.0 for production DApps and use&nbsp;cases</a>  In October, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/10/30/arcblock-updates-dev-platform">ArcBlock released an improved version of ABT Node that included various feature enhancements</a>  In December, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/12/01/arcblock-releases-dapp-platform-update">ABT Node 1.1 was released with several new innovations and Blocket&nbsp;updates</a>   ABT Wallet   March saw <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/03/29/arcblock-releases-decentralized-identity-wallet-with-integrated-browser">ArcBlock release ABT Wallet 2.5 improving on their industry-leading decentralized wallet and reimagining how users could control their data on the decentralized web.</a>   NFT   <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/06/08/arcblock-releases-devcon-nft-tickets">ArcBlock’s Devcon in June included a wide range of NFTs including tickets, certificates, and&nbsp;more.</a>   Token Swap   In January, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/01/24/token-swap">ArcBlock released its official Token Swap&nbsp;Service.</a>   DevCon   In June, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/05/15/arcblock-announces-devcon-2020">ArcBlock announced it’s first official Developer Conference to be held live over a 48-hour period in&nbsp;June.</a>  <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/06/20/devcon-day-one-recap">ArcBlock Devcon 2020 Day 1&nbsp;Recap</a>  <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/06/21/devcon-day-two-recap">ArcBlock Devcon 2020 Day 2&nbsp;Recap</a>  On June 28, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/06/28/hackathon-demo">ArcBlock held a week-long Hackathon that included unique NFTs, leading developer teams, and&nbsp;more</a>   Experiences   In February, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/02/28/arcblock-decentralized-identity-cash-app">ArcBlock released a live demo experience “Try Identity Now” that enabled anyone to experience decentralized identity, blockchain and DApps in a few simple&nbsp;steps.</a>   Partnerships   In Aprile, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/04/14/arcblock-supports-covid19-initiative">ArcBlock joins the Covid 19 Initiative</a>  In June, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/06/19/arcblock-partners-with-wtia">ArcBlock officially announced a new partnership with the&nbsp;WTIA</a>  In November, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/11/02/arcblock-partners-with-poulsat-to-bring-blockchain-services-to-africa">Poulsat and ArcBlock officially announced a new strategic partnership to bring Decentralized Identity, Blockchain, and tokenization to&nbsp;Africa.</a>  In December，<a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/en/post/2020/12/04/arcblock-joins-mydata-global">ArcBlock joined the internationally recognized decentralized identity organization MyData&nbsp;Global.</a>   Milestones   In October, <a href="https://www.arcblock.io/blog/zh/post/2020/10/31/arcblock-third-anniversary">ArcBlock celebrated its three-year anniversary</a>   2021 and&nbsp;Beyond <p>As ArcBlock continues to grow as a company and become more public with it’s product releases, ArcBlock will no longer be announcing it’s internal product roadmap.

In doing so, we will be able to improve the ArcBlock platform and experience for our developers and customers by removing much of our technical debt;  We will introduce a new ABT asset chain based on the Ethereum Optimistic Rollup mechanism, and sunset our previous Forge-based native asset chain approach. In doing so, we will enable our users to gain the benefits of both Ethereum and the high-performance native&nbsp;chain;  Lastly, we will host our next DevCon 2 Developers Conference in June, when we’ll partner with more developer partners to show the future of decentralization, DApps, and&nbsp;more.  <p>While 2020 has been challenging, it has also created many new opportunities for ArcBlock. While “the pessimist is often right, the optimist is often successful”. In the unprecedented dilemmas and challenges of 2020, we have chosen to be optimistic and are excited to share everything we’ve been working&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/arcblock/arcblock-year-in-review-2020-c36b366b01f8">ArcBlock Year in Review 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/arcblock">ArcBlock</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 2020 in review 
<p>I think we can all agree that 2020 was not the year we were expecting! The pandemic has affected all of us in different ways and to different extents. Yet the silver lining for me was to see all the teams we have within Ubisecure adapt and continue regardless of last year’s challenges, continuing to communicate effectively, deliver first-rate services, and grow the company. This is a testament to each and every member of the Ubisecure team, dealing with remote working, home schooling, yet still growing Ubisecure as a leading identity specialist.</p>
<p>Our 2020 milestones include:</p>
 
 Great growth from both our Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) software, Identity Platform, and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) service, RapidLEI. On top of our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/corporate/2019-roundup/">100% revenue growth in 2019</a>, we saw a 50%+ revenue growth in 2020 (CAGR of 70% over the last two years) despite the impact of the pandemic. 
 RapidLEI went from being the fastest growing LEI provider to becoming the world’s <a href="https://rapidlei.com/stats">#1 issuer of validated LEIs</a>. 
 RapidLEI also topping the charts for best data quality results amongst the GLEIF-accredited Local Operating Units (LOUs). 
 We announced support for the new Global LEI Foundation Validation Agent (VA) model to support on-demand LEI issuance for Banks, Fintech, CAs and Business Registries. 
 We launched many new CIAM and LEI partnerships, including technology alliances with <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/partner-directory/hitachi/">Hitachi</a> (finger vein biometrics), <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/partner-directory/omada/">Omada</a> (Identity and Governance Administration), and Verimi (pan-European consumer digital identity platform). 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2021 – Looking forward 
<p>As I write this in the first week of January 2021, our teams across the organisation have already hit the ground running. We see an active, rapidly growing market, further driven by the current pandemic and ever-increasing cyber-attacks. This increase in malicious activity is leading organisations to ramp up cybersecurity efforts, including reviewing legacy Identity &amp; Access Management solutions. More remote working serves to further <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customer-iam/digital-identity-remote-working-employee-customer-iam/">blur the lines</a> between ’employee’ and ‘customer’ identities, increasing the number of external identities an organisation manages. This has generated high demand for CIAM (Customer IAM) solutions, specifically built to streamline management of external identities, such as our Identity Platform.</p>
 Building on our role as an Organisation Identity Expert 
<p>Ubisecure’s plans for 2021 include further developments on our unique position as an Organisation Identity expert. We have strong recognition in this area both from analysts and from fellow identity management firms. &nbsp;We will continue to build on this capability, joining our LEI and CIAM business arms to launch our innovative representation governance solution, “<a href="https://rapidlei.com/representation-governance/">Sign in with RapidLEI</a>” service to enable individuals to assert a right to represent their organisation in financial transactions, legal signatures and more.</p>
 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) 
<p>The concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is in its infancy and, in the general case, as yet independent of classical identity systems. As organisations seek services that can intertwine these systems, we will provide interoperation and also enable the issuance of organisation credentials as the result of LEI issuance (as now used in our “Sign in with RapidLEI” service).</p>
 Identity Trust Anchors 
<p>I also plan to continue educating on the importance of Trust Anchors through various media – how they enable online interaction, and how we have been implementing them for more than 10 years. I spoke on the subject at the virtual Digital Identity and Digital On-boarding for Banking conference at the end of 2020 – watch the video and others on the Ubisecure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKl96I87v_TwRcCq5bWsv6Q">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
 Expanding use of national, local, and federated digital identities 
<p>The Ubisecure CIAM platform has long supported the industry’s widest range of digital identity schemes, both at a national and enterprise level. In 2021, we will offer expanded support for identity verification from both existing identity platforms, like Germany-based Verimi, and real-time identity proofing, thanks to partnerships with organisations like Onfido.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 In Conclusion 
<p>Overall, while the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our personal lives in 2021 may continue, 2020 has shown us that Ubisecure is well-prepared to deliver business as usual whilst keeping our staff safely working from home. I look forward to talking more about our 2021 innovations and Ubisecure’s continued growth as the year pans out.</p>

 What is User Provisioning?  <p>User provisioning, also known as user account provisioning, is an automated process for creating user accounts and managing access to IT resources. It goes beyond simply identifying whether an individual is who they say they are and extends into that person’s rights and permissions to specific enterprise applications and other resources. To use a simple banking analogy, identity management identifies the thieves from the customers and employees, allowing the latter groups to enter the bank, while user provisioning keeps the customers from dipping into other customers’ bank accounts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Furthermore, user provisioning allocates user privileges and permissions automatically, based on criteria such as user role. This differs from identity governance and administration, which handles user identity lifecycle administration and does more than simple user provisioning. With user provisioning, you’re not relying on access requests. There’s no certification, no attestation, no audit trail—just the exact user information needed for access management.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>User provisioning becomes increasingly critical the larger an enterprise grows. The more employees and positions within an organization, the more difficult it can be to determine access rights. User provisioning can help boost productivity by relieving the burden from IT having to manually create user accounts and arrange access for each new employee and application. For instance, as titles and departments change, IT can perform group updates. They can also easily provision new applications and deprovision old ones, further reducing the risk of unauthorized information falling into the wrong hands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  The Ping Provisioning Catalog  <p>Ping solutions include numerous out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to automatically provision, update and deprovision users to a wide range of applications. Provisioning from cloud and on-premises HR application sources helps you maintain accurate, up-to-date user profile information, with full CRUD (create, read, update and delete) capabilities for user or group provisioning, so you can eliminate manual processes and profile synchronization challenges.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In keeping with Ping’s standards-based approach to IAM, our user provisioning is based on the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard. SCIM was developed nearly a decade ago using protocols like REST and JSON in order to reduce complexity and provide a more straightforward approach to user management, and it enables easier, more powerful and standardized communication between identity data stores.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ping’s provisioning capabilities fall into two main categories: inbound HR provisioning and outbound application provisioning.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

   Security and risk management leaders are experiencing widespread disruption in identity and access management (IAM) solutions for many reasons, most notably because of the increased drive to customer-facing interactions on digital channels and the sudden and rapid expansion of the remote workforce because of the pandemic.

  <p>Security and risk management leaders are experiencing widespread disruption in identity and access management (IAM) solutions for many reasons, most notably because of the increased drive to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-ways-to-stay-customer-centric-in-uncertain-times/">customer-facing</a> interactions on digital channels and the sudden and rapid expansion of the remote workforce because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“IAM challenges have become increasingly complex,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/89288/Akif-Khan"> Akif Khan</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, “and many organizations lack the skills and resources to manage effectively. Leaders must improve their approaches to identity proofing, develop stronger vendor management skills and mitigate the risks of an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">increasingly remote workforce</a>.”</p>
<p>The five strategic planning assumptions that follow focus on current trends in decentralized identity, access management, IAM professional services and identity proofing.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36784"]</p>
 Cybersecurity mesh will support more than 50% of IAM requests 
<p>The old security model of “inside means trusted” and “outside means untrusted” has been broken for a long time. Most digital assets and devices are outside the enterprise, as are most identities.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-security-projects-for-2020-2021/">Gartner Top 10 Security Projects for 2020-2021</a></p>
<p>By 2025, cybersecurity mesh will support more than half of all IAM requests, enabling a more explicit, mobile and adaptive unified access management model. The mesh model of cybersecurity provides a more integrated, scalable, flexible and reliable approach to digital asset access control than traditional security perimeter controls.</p>
 Delivery of IAM services will increase via managed security service providers (MSSPs) 
<p>Organizations lack the qualified resources and skills to plan, develop, acquire and implement comprehensive IAM solutions. As a result, they’re contracting professional services firms to provide the necessary support, particularly where multiple functions need to be addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p>More and more, organizations will rely on MSSP firms for advice, guidance and integration recommendations. By 2023, 40% of IAM application convergence will primarily be driven by MSSPs that focus on delivery of best-of-breed solutions in an integrated approach, shifting influence from product vendors to service partners.</p>
 Identity proofing tools will be implemented within the workforce identity life cycle 
<p>Historically, vendor-provided enrollment and recovery workflows for multifactor authentication have incorporated weak affirmation signals, such as email addresses and phone numbers. As a result, implementing higher-trust corroboration has been left as an exercise for the enterprise.</p>
<p>Because of the massive increase in remote interactions with employees, more robust enrollment and recovery procedures are an urgent requirement, as it is harder to differentiate between attackers and legitimate users. By 2024, 30% of large enterprises will newly implement identity-proofing tools to address common weaknesses in workforce identity life cycle processes.</p>
 A global, portable, decentralized identity standard will begin to emerge 
<p>Centralized approaches to managing identity data — common in today’s market — struggle to provide benefits in the three key areas: Privacy, assurance and pseudonymity. A decentralized approach uses blockchain technology to help ensure privacy, enabling individuals to validate information requests by providing the requestor with only the absolute minimum required amount of information.</p>
<p>By 2024, a true global, portable, decentralized identity standard will emerge in the market to address business, personal, social and societal, and identity-invisible use cases.</p>
 Demographic bias within identity proofing will be widely minimized 
<p>Bias with respect to race, age, gender and other characteristics gained attention significantly in 2020, coinciding with the increased interest in document-centric identity proofing in online use cases. This “ID plus selfie” process uses face recognition algorithms to compare selfies of customers with the photo in their identity document.</p>
<p>There has always been awareness of possible bias in face recognition processes, with implications concerning customer experience, brand damage and possible legal liability. As a result, by 2022, 95% of organizations will require that identity-proofing vendors prove that they are minimizing demographic bias, a significant increase from less than 15% today.</p>

<p>Now that the United States is a few weeks into deploying the COVID-19 vaccine, many frontline workers have received at least their first round of shots, along with a digital medical record documenting this, or vaccination record card provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The digital records and vaccine cards include medical information, including the manufacturer and date of administration.</p>



<p>As plans are unveiled for further vaccine distribution, a light at the end of the lockdown tunnel has begun to emerge, and planning for a “new normal” is underway. Businesses and governments are in the process of rethinking how they will manage social interactions throughout daily life. With part of the population vaccinated, occupancy limits will change and travel restrictions will be revamped, creating new opportunities to slow the spread of the virus and simultaneously expand in-person contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.civic.com/healthkey/">COVID Health Key by Civic</a> offers the most secure, most private and most compliant way to maintain safe spaces by <a href="https://youtu.be/k4C6lP62XFc">securely verifying proof of vaccination status</a>. We’ve designed our technology to allow for a more inclusive approach to rebuilding. With Health Key, individuals keep control over their personal information by using digital identity from the industry’s leading innovator. No personal data is stored or entered into any requestor’s database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Civic is expanding its ability to help more organizations by providing small businesses and ad-hoc networks with the ability to create safe environments around the world — all without maintaining personally identifiable information or compromising the privacy of their patrons.</p>



<p>Consumers and small businesses may begin using COVID Health Key by Civic in Spring 2021 as a stand-alone, self-serve solution. Restaurants, gyms, daycares and more have struggled to resume business with mandates for low occupancy rates. Health Key helps enable the loosening of constraints in a safe and easy-to-use way. For customers, using Health Key means simply linking their digital medical records or uploading their vaccine card and self-attesting the document’s accuracy in the app.</p>



<p>For larger organizations, we’re offering a previously announced version of COVID Health Key by Civic that streamlines the management of entry points. This product helps organizations confirm that an individual has received a test result or vaccine, and that local entry point regulations have been followed. Civic links the medical record on the back end, for seamless review by the individual and receipt by requestors.</p>



<p>Civic is also building government solutions, available worldwide with the exception of a few sanctioned countries. Customized solutions can be linked to national healthcare systems, identity cards, passports and customs requirements. Health Key by Civic is a real-life application of our patented digital identity system. It’s also compliant with international GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team at Dock has kicked off 2021 by introducing on-chain democratic governance features to the Dock PoA mainnet.</p><p>Any holders of the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-4-the-migration-begins/">new Dock mainnet token</a>, as well as the members of the Dock Association Council, can now propose changes to the network. The Council will regularly review and vote on the proposals, and quickly act upon the ones they approve. The new democracy greatly reduces the role of the multi-signature Master account, which is controlled by the Dock Association and has superuser access to the network.</p><p>The New Democratic Process</p><p>The new process involves two entities in the network: the Council and the Technical Committee. The Council is the governing body of the network, responsible for reviewing and voting on any proposals from the community. The Technical Committee helps maintain the network and can fast-track the implementation of any urgent proposals. For the remaining duration of the PoA phase, any changes to the Council and Technical Committee membership (adding or removing members) will require votes from the existing Council members.</p><p>Holders of the Dock token, as well as the Council members, are now able to <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/gov-poa/poa-2/proposals">propose changes</a> to the network. To prevent spam, any non-Council members making a proposal are required to lock 1,000 tokens, which will be returned after the proposal has been reviewed and voted on. The newly created proposal will join the proposal queue, from which the Council will consider one proposal every 20 days. The Council will have 15 days to vote on the proposal, and if approved by the Council, it will take effect in 2 days unless fast-tracked by the Technical Committee.</p><p>For more details on the new governance process, please see our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/gov-poa/poa-2">docs</a>. Any proposals awaiting consideration can be viewed <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">here</a>. </p><p>Coming up in 2021</p><p>The team is working towards transitioning the Dock network to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus during the next quarter. This change will be accompanied by implementation of further democracy in the network: the Master account will be disabled, and token holders will be able to cast their votes for proposals, validator selection, and the election of new Council members.</p>

   Introduction to C# 9 (and a bit of C# 8, too) 

<p>Let’s start with a background on how C# 9 got here (implementation examples start in the next section).</p>

<p>The last few years in computer science, we’ve observed the rising popularity of the #FreeLunchOver concept. The idea is that CPU technology, based on electrical signals and Von Neumann architecture, has reached its intrinsic limits. As long as integrated circuits were slower than light, we knew we had work to do in improving the technology. But the time has come where, to go faster, we would need a faster medium and/or a different architecture. Scientists are all convinced that nothing can go faster than light. So, for the time being, engineers have explored the architecture path toward increasing speed. And they did exactly what the Industrial Revolution did to increase productivity - break the work into subunits, execute the subunits in parallel pipelines, and finally, assemble the resulting components. We began to see dual-core, quad-core processors… and we’ll probably soon see the day where exponential notation has to be used to express the number of cores in a CPU!</p>

<p>In the software industry this trend has produced significant effects. Programming paradigms that weren’t particularly relevant in sequential computing became more important, such as immutability, threading and asynchronous pipelines. Functional Programming (FP), previously relegated to academic and niche domains, gained more popularity in the commercial software arena. FP has characteristics that better adapt to parallel computing workflows than the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that dominated programming language design for 20 years.</p>

<p>The first mainstream OOP language was C++, born as an OOP extension to the former procedural C. C++ has become an incredibly rich language without losing its fundamental trait, that is being an unmanaged language, which means it is close to the machine. With time, managed languages began to appear, where some aspects of the machine management, like memory allocation and especially deallocation and collection, have been promoted from “developer concern” to “machine concern.” As these features are not easy to implement in hardware, language creators invented the Virtual Machine (VM) concept. The VM is actually a piece of software itself that effectively makes available to the developer a different machine than the bare hardware. With time, VMs have become integral components of modern Operating Systems (OSs).</p>

<p>The most prominent example is probably Java, which conquered a vast share of the market with its free-to-use policy. There was a time where the big actors tried to ride the Java horse to their own advantage. But eventually Microsoft decided to create its own managed software framework, and .NET and C# were born.</p>

<p>When functional programming began to emerge, it became essential for these big actors to offer functional languages to the public for their own VM engines. They were constrained, though, as the languages needed to be compatible with their already grown OOP babies. So, after spending some time considering the already existing FP languages (Haskell and OCaml, to mention two of the most successful), they created new languages - Scala (Java VM) and F# (.NET VM). I am personally very passionate about functional programming,, and an active F# advocate.</p>

<p>But progress never stops! Quantum computing seems to be the next hardware architecture frontier, which will  of course invite new challenges for software engineers. These days, I am plunging into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit">Microsoft Quantum Development Kit</a> (QDK) and its associated language Q# - that’s another story for an upcoming post.</p>

<p>Back on earth, the OOP vs. FP gossip is very juicy. . In the Microsoft realm, it seems to me that there’s more effort to make C# more functional, rather than F# more object oriented. There seems to be some strong resistance in the industry against FP, maybe because FP developed a reputation as more difficult and abstract. Which is not completely undeserved, though I’d say the reward makes the effort spent in learning it absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>Starting with version 7 and on with version 8 and 9, C# has seen several much welcome improvements, both in syntax and features. This post aims to collect some of those advancements, including real code examples. As a matter of fact, the title “Cheat Sheet” is a little… well, cheating. But I hope you’ll enjoy it anyhow.</p>

<p>To follow the examples in this article, you need <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5 SDK</a>. I’ll be using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019 CE version 16.8.3</a>. The code examples are in a solution in <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-csharp9-cheatsheet-examples">this GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>Please create a new Solution with a .NET Core console Project. By default, the project uses .NET Core 3.1 as target framework, with C# 8 as the language version.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, all you need to enable C#9 in your project, is to select .NET 5 as target framework for your project, since .NET 5 used C#9 by default.</p>

   <code>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code>   

<p>With this, we are now ready to explore the new features C#8 and C#9 have to offer.</p>

 Immutability 

<p>Immutability is a property that symbols in a program can have. We are so used to the “variable” terminology, that there seems to be no distinction from a symbol we declare to identify some value, and the concept of variable. This is because OOP is centered around the concept of imperative assignment, where any symbols representing data can be mutated as we wish, hence perfectly matching the “variable” nomenclature.</p>

<p>FP, on the other hand, is centered on the opposite concept, that of immutability. The universally known “=” syntax has a different meaning: not assignment, but binding. So whatever is on the left is not variable anymore, but “invariable” if you like. (What a bad term!) That’s why I prefer to use the term “symbol,” in place of “variable”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes we find opinions in the community that depict mutability as evil, advocating an almost religious superiority of FP over OOP. I don’t personally agree with this point of view. In my experience, having more tools makes things better, not worse. If nothing else, I can always decide not to use a tool I have, while I cannot use a tool I don’t have.</p>

  <p>Also in my experience, OOP and FP are two powerful weapons in my arsenal after the necessary familiarization period. Now it’s natural to use both in designing new software, and I find they can get along pretty well (and this is one of the reasons why I like F#).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One myth I would like to dispel is that C# cannot define immutable types. It can, only it’s not quite made for this, so it requires some additional effort. The feature described in this section helps to avoid most of the boilerplate that was needed in previous versions.</p>

 Init-Only Properties (a.k.a. Immutable Reference Types) 

<p>The new keyword init can be used when declaring properties. Properties can be set only once at initialization.</p>

   <code>using Xunit;

namespace Cs9CheatSheet.Immutability.InitOnlyProperties
{
    class OktaOptionsClass_Mutable
    {
        public string OktaDomain { get; set; }
        public int Retrials { get; set; }
    }

    class OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Wrong
    {
        public string OktaDomain { get; }
        public int Retrials { get; }
    }

    class OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Constructor
    {
        public string OktaDomain { get; }
        public int Retrials { get; }

        public OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Constructor(string oktaDomain, int retrials)
        {
            OktaDomain = oktaDomain;
            Retrials = retrials;
        }
    }

    class OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Ok_Init
    {
        public string OktaDomain { get; init; }
        public int Retrials { get; init; }
    }

    public class Tests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Test()
        {
            var options_mutable =
                new OktaOptionsClass_Mutable {
                    OktaDomain =
                    @"https://dev-509249.okta.com", Retrials = 3 };

            options_mutable.Retrials = 9458257; //properties can be set at any time

            //Compiler error, cannot set properties (at all)
            //var options_immutable_wrong =
            //    new OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Wrong {
            //        OktaDomain = @"https://dev-509249.okta.com",
            //        Retrials = 3 };

            //Ok, use constructor
            var options_immutable_ok = new OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Constructor(@"https://dev-509249.okta.com", 3);
            //options_immutable_ok.Retrials = 9458257; //design time error: properties are readonly

            //Ok, new init-only  properties
            var options_immutable_ok_init =
                new OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Ok_Init {
                    OktaDomain = @"https://dev-509249.okta.com",
                    Retrials = 3 };
            //options_immutable_ok_init.Retrials = 9458257; //design time error: properties are readonly

        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>There are 4 different versions of a class with different degrees of immutability:</p>

 
   OktaOptionsClass_Mutable; mutable, properties can be changed at any time 
   OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Wrong; immutable, but also useless as there is no way to set the properties 
   OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Constructor; old way immutable, requiring to write a “dumb” constructor 
   OktaOptionsClass_Immutable_Ok_Init; new way immutable, less boilerplate (you don’t need to write the “dumb” constructor) 
 

 Records 

<p>A new type of declaration named record makes it easier to work with complex types. For example:</p>

 
   Record variables are object references like class types 
   Equality is by value, like struct types 
   Immutability features (copy constructor/cloning, deconstructor,  deep equality logic) are created for us by the compiler 
 

   <code>using Xunit;

<p>In this code sample, I am declaring three different data types with the same content, but different language implementation. Please refer to the comments for more detailed information.</p>

<p>Notice however that in this paragraph I am using record with enforced mutability (where properties have set accessors), in order to compare them to the traditional mutable constructs offered by the language. Records, though, are designed to make it particularly easy to work with immutable data.</p>

 Positional Records 

<p>Records offer a particularly lean notation to create immutable objects</p>

   <code>using System;

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: OktaOptionsPositionalRecord behaves as OktaOptionsClass. In other words, C# now offers syntactic sugar to add immutability boilerplate to class based types automatically. You simply have to declare your type as record instead of class. A Deconstruct method can be defined in a class type. This is also a new feature created to implement records, but can be used in non-record types.</p>
</blockquote>

 Static Local Functions 

<p>One of the principles of functional programming, along with immutability, is “No side effects.” This means a function should produce results only as a return value, and data needs to be passed in as a parameter in order to to produce it. This is what static local functions are all about.</p>

<p>We can ensure that local functions, lambdas, and anonymous methods are side-effect free. The compiler will refuse to compile them if they access data outside their context.</p>

 Default Interface Methods 

<p>Default interface methods are a new feature, and are not strictly related to the FP enrichment, but they’re a very nice to have, especially for Library authors.</p>

 Non Breaking Interface Augmentation

 Pattern Matching 

<p>Pattern matching is a typical FP concept. As is often the case, explaining with words is more difficult than showing how it works. Though we could say that pattern matching belongs in that category of those improvements that allow us to write code that performs traditional things in a more succinct and expressive syntax.</p>

 Switch Expression 

<p>The new switch expression and the added relational and logical operators give us a more powerful and expressive way to carry out decision-making workflows.</p>

   <code>using System.Linq;
using Xunit;

                    ret = "Unclassified";
                    break;
                case 1:
                case 2:
                case 3:
                    ret = "Bad";
                    break;

<p>The new pattern-matching coding in SwitchExpression is evidently more terse and expressive, stripping out a great deal of boilerplate needed in the traditional SwitchStatement implementation.</p>

<p>In the above, observe how:</p>

 
   Readability improves significantly from the “traditional” way, compared to the new expressive pattern matching flavors 
   We need to write much less when using pattern matching, which both saves time and reduces errors. (After all, there is no code more correct that the one we don’t write!) 
 

<p>The last example CascadeSwitchExpression is not equivalent to the example before that, as it also raises validation exceptions. Rather, it’s an example showing how to nest switch expressions.</p>

 Property Pattern

<p>Working with the end of an array has become as easy as working with the front.</p>

 Null Coalescing 

<p>Two new operators make it easier checking on nulls:</p>

 
   ??: Null coalescing operator. In place of the old a != null ? a : b or a == null ? b : a, you can now simply write a ?? b 
   ??=   Null coalescing assignment operator. It allows write a ??= b to assign b to a only if a is null, like in the old a = a != null ? a : b

<p>Null coalescing operators are really helpful with the “null billion dollar mistake”. Usually in C#, checking for nulls populates a great deal of our source files. The new operators do not get rid of null, but they make it much less annoying to deal with it.</p>

 Target Type Inference 

<p>Target type inference moves us further towards writing less boilerplate. The compiler’s type inference power has been increased so that we don’t need to specify the type in a new statement if the new instance is meant to be referenced by a typed variable. Un the following example you can observe three different cases</p>

   <code>using Xunit;

namespace Cs9CheatSheet.FitAndFinish.TargetTypeInference
{
    record MyType(int Value = 0);

    public class Tests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Create_new_instance()
        {
            var a = new MyType(12); //old way
            MyType b = new(12); //new way
            Assert.Equal(b, a);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Function_call()
        {
            int Double(MyType myVar) =&gt; myVar.Value * 2;

            var a = Double(new MyType(7)); //old way
            var b = Double(new (7)); //new way

            Assert.Equal(b, a);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Property_init()
        {
            var a = new MyType() { Value = 61 }; //old way
            MyType b = new() { Value = 61 }; // new way
            Assert.Equal(b, a);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 
   Type indication replaces the var declaration, so the right side of the assignment operator doesn’t need to repeat the type 
   The type of the newly instantiated object is already clear by the called function (Double) declaration 
   Similar to 1, but with property initialization 
 

<p>In other words, when the compile finds a new statement without a type name, it looks around if the object to be instantiated has a target symbol (a variable or a function parameter) where the type is specified. Hence the name “target type inference.”</p>

 Type Extensibility 

<p>These additions belong to the group of features that empower the use of third-party libraries. (We already saw above, the default interface methods.) In that case, the feature allows library users to supply new versions of their product by adding members to existing interfaces without forcing the user to refactor the application code. The amenities discussed in this section all facilitate users of third-party libraries to extend the library with more powerful constructs.</p>

 Covariant Returns 

<p>The very native extension pattern in OOP is inheritance. Type members can be declared virtual when defining a type, allowing the user to override them in derived types. Traditionally, though, method overrides need to maintain the same signature of the base. Covariant returns means that we can now define overridden methods with different return types than the base ones, provided that the override return type is derived from the base return type. Returning derived types from overrides was possible even before, but it required the call site to perform a cast or a type checking. Well, not anymore.</p>

</code>   

<p>In the above example, the namespace OldWay shows how to return derived types from overrides before this feature was added, whilst NewWay shows how with the new feature we can avoid casts, and also declaratively assert clearly that we are returning a derived type.</p>

 Enumerability By Extension 

<p>Another concept borrowed from FP is “laziness.” Laziness allows us to write more modular code, that is to say, implement a better separation of concerns. We can write code that produces a result, without executing it immediately, but deferring the execution to a later time when the result is effectively accessed. A textbook scenario is a database query. Often our programs contain iterative or event-based workflows - where we check some conditions and based on the check we run one of multiple different queries. Without laziness, we would need to put the query code inline with the condition-check, or alternatively pre-calculate all the possible results in the cached collection to be used in the iteration. With laziness, we get both. We can write the query code in one place and declare it as lazy. Somewhere else, in our codebase, we can then write the iteration accessing the data as if it were cached - when in reality the compile has hooked a call to our lazy code.</p>

<p>Laziness in constructing collections is not new in C# — the IEnumerable and IEnumerable<code>&lt;T&gt;</code> generic interfaces were available well before version 8 of the language.</p>

<p>What is new, though, is the possibility to add this feature to existing types via type extensions. Previously, Enumerable types needed to implement IEnumerable or IEnumerable<code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. Today, this is not strictly necessary. What is required is to provide a public GetEnumerator method returning an instance of a type that defines two public members: a current property and a bool MoveNext parameterless method.</p>

<p>And this method can be an extension method, so we can add enumerability to a library type (where previously the only way was to add an IEnumerable implementation which required access to the source code and recompilation of the library).</p>

</code>   

<p>In the previous code example, EnumerableTour implements IEnumerable but NonEnumerableTour doesn’t. However, in the test, we can see that both types allow you to enumerate their cities through foreach. What makes this possible is the Extension class code, where GetEnumerator is defined as an extension method for NonEnumerableTour. If NonEnumerableTour was in a NuGet library, this extensibility wouldn’t have been possible previously. If you wanted it, you had to change the source code and transform NonEnumerableTour into EnumerableTour, and recompile the NuGet package (or create a derived type implementing IEnumerable).</p>

 Asynchronous Streams 

<p>Asynchronous streams are a powerful feature aimed to improve resource usage, especially in scenarios characterized by a particular type of data source, known under the name of streams. With the ever-increasing pervasiveness of networking and distribution, the new generation of applications will need to deal with increasingly sparse data.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, computers got data through perforated cards and spit out results as line-printed-paper trails. Then we passed to magnetic supports and phosphorus screens… Step by step, we came to these days where almost everything external to the unit we are programming is identified by an internet URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). It doesn’t ever matter what there is behind that funny string. What matters is that we can write something like Web.GetSomethingFrom(“some-kind-of-protocol://someone-out-there/what-we-want?color=blue&amp;flavor=vanilla&amp;whatnot..”) in place of the “archaic” Console.Read() or File.GetLine() or DB.Query(“SELECT…”).</p>

<p>Every one of these data exchanges could traverse a large number of routing points, bounce through satellites, and be converted several times to different means (electricity, light, radio waves, little messages tied to a carrier pigeon’s ankle, etc).</p>

<p>Dealing with sparse and remote data sources has important implications, though. The most relevant is, indeed, asynchronism. A data exchange is more like a mail exchange than a phone call. We send a request to the URI and then… wait for an answer.</p>

<p>Modern program flows are not like in the old days:</p>

 
   Read inputs from a connected device 
   Elaborate 
   Write outputs to a connected device 
 

<p>They are more like:</p>

 
   Register your interest in some subject 
   Do something else 
   When some event occurs, react to it (elaborate) and write the relative piece of output 
 

<p>We cannot any longer assume that the data we need is immediately available when we need it.  Instead we need to deal with the fact that someone else decides when to send it to us. Not only that, but we must also deal with the fact that the waiting times can be several orders of magnitude longer than those required by our CPU to elaborate. In other words, we cannot afford to simply wait, we must organize our programs to use the CPU in between successive packets of data. We need to make asynchronous programs.</p>

<p>Asynchronous programming is nothing new, by the way. Starting from the lowest level, the CPU, most activity is based on interrupts. Hardware components, like network cards, used to interrupt the CPU when they have something to tell it. While traditionally asynchronism was under the control of hardware or the operating system in the machine, today control is lost in the internet sea - so that its management must involve the application itself, rather than the system that runs the application.</p>

<p>The .NET API has gone through a profound transformation over the years, making asynchronous programming progressively easier and more natural. Events were available even before .NET, and they were part of the very first C# version. In many cases, though, asynchronous programming was left to the developer code, for example running a worker thread that, in turn, cyclically polls a service checking for new data to be available.</p>

<p>Later we saw the callback paradigm, where asynchronous operations were based on three functions:</p>

 
   Begin to start the asynchronous operation and register a completion callback 
   Callback passed to the system in the Begin Call. The system calls it when a relevant event occurs 
   End to be called by our code (usually at the end of the callback) to inform the system that the transaction is complete 
 

<p>The Task Parallel Library (TPL) was also created to ease multitasking, relieving the developer from the burden of thread management, as threads are expensive and therefore a limited resource.</p>

<p>The latest improvement is the async/await pattern. We are now able to write asynchronous workflows almost as a regular code block, while the compiler takes charge of transforming that into separate blocks with interruption and continuations, then put them into automatically created tasks, and schedule them in a coordinated way using a managed thread pool.</p>

<p>Asynchronous streams add a new important feature to the async/await pattern. Syntactically, the feature is quite easy to use. You simply need to:</p>

 
   Supply a method returning the new interface type IAsyncEnumerable&lt;&gt; and containing the composite keyword yield return await in its code 
   In the call site, use the new await foreach asynchronous iteration construct 
 

<p>The new pattern is particularly suited for scenarios where the data emitter has the characteristics of a stream. A relevant example is an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Imagine a pool of meteorology sensors distributed across a territory, which send updates to a cloud service, either in a timely fashion, and/or when some specific condition is detected (for example, the temperature changes by at least 1 degree). This is a typical scenario for the observer/observable pattern, however, asynchronous streams help represent it in code with similar expressivity, and probably less ceremony.</p>

<p>Here an example, followed by some explanation and a few notes.</p>

</code>   

<p>I used the WorldBank REST API for this example. It maintains a database of geographical and geopolitical information, available for free on the internet.</p>

<p>There is an interface called IDataSource, which abstracts our model of data emitter. On the application side, the data emitter is something that offers the following services:</p>

 
   DownloadIso2CodesAsync() - Download a collection of Iso2 country codes 
   DownloadCountries(string[] iso2Codes) - Download a collection of country records, with code specified in the iso2Codes input parameter 
   DownloadCountriesStream(string[] iso2Codes) - Same as the previous method, but using the new Asynchronous Streams feature 
 

<p>Note that the two last methods, besides having different names, have exactly the same input type but different return type:</p>

 
   DownloadCountries returns IEnumerable<code>&lt;Task&lt;&gt;&gt;</code> 
   DownloadCountriesStream returns IAsyncEnumerable&lt;&gt; 
 

<p>Both functions return lazy values, which means that the foreach loops they implement won’t be executed when the functions return. And they will be executed only when the last lines of TestBlock() and TestStream() are reached in the Tests class. These two test methods have:</p>

 
   
    <p>A first common part, where they download a set of ISO codes (100 in the example) and select ten of them randomly</p>
   
   
    <p>A second part where they retrieve detailed information about the selected countries, but in different ways</p>

    <p>Let’s now concentrate on the last two lines, where the key differences are manifested:</p>
   
   
    <p>TestBlock calls DownloadCountries and receives a collection of Tasks. It then executes them in parallel using the Task.WhenAll TPL API. When all the tasks complete, the collection of results is returned as an array, referenced by the countries symbol. Finally, the last line runs an iteration synchronously on the hydrated array and does application-specific work.</p>
   
   
    <p>TestStream calls DownloadCountriesStream and receives an IAsyncEnumerable, referenced by the countries symbol. This is the first difference. The symbol countries does not hold a hydrated array of countries like with TestBlock, but a promise. When the last line is reached, nothing has been materialized from the data sources yet, while with TestBlock the materialization is already complete. Finally, TestStream executes an asynchronous iteration calling the new await foreach. This is the point where the internet is finally hit and the remote data are retrieved</p>
   
 

<p>At this point, it’s worthwhile to highlight a qualifying point. In the TestBlock case, we have the opportunity to leverage the TPL, while in the TestStream case we don’t. This has two potential consequences:</p>

 
   Performance: If the backend has already available all the countries in our selection at the time the requests come, TestBlock will get all the cities in roughly the same time required to retrieve only one of them. TestStream, on the other hand, is constrained to a sequential workflow, so the time will necessarily be the sum of the times for each of the cities in the selection 
   Memory: The block version will allocate memory for all the cities, while the stream version only needs to allocate memory for one. 
 

<p>Therefore, if the backend has all the data, choosing between block and stream is a tradeoff between memory resources and performance. Usually, in situations like this, the best solution is the parallel one with pagination.</p>

<p>However, if the backend does not have all the data, like the meteorology sensors I mentioned above, the performance advantage of parallel execution is nil, since even if the tasks are running in parallel, only one of them will complete just after the launch.  The remaining tasks will need to wait until new data is available. In this case, the stream solution is definitely superior, as it will give the results in the same time, but with less memory use and with only one pending task during the data retrieval period.</p>

<p>In the previous example, this is demonstrated by creating two implementations of IDataSource: CountriesDb and CountriesIoT. CountriesDb behaves like a database. That is, it simulates a data source that responds immediately upon request. CountriesIoT, instead, simulates an IoT device, with data items available one by one at one-second time distance. (The trigger is the task started in StartFeed where a pool of semaphores is released over time, while the overridden DownloadCountryAsync awaits one of the semaphores before doing active work.) Running the tests produces the following results:</p>

<p></p>

<p>With a db-like data source, the block workflow executes in half of the time taken by the stream workflow. With the IoT-like data source, on the other hand, times are comparable.</p>

					 <p>A developer and product manager from Trinsic’s first Fortune 500 customer scheduled a call with our CEO Riley Hughes shortly after Trinsic’s beta platform launched in 2019. “Thank you for building your API,” the developer explained. “We spent weeks trying to get something working with one of your competitors. All-in, we estimated that using their solution would take us four months to build our product. In just the last three weeks with Trinsic, we’ve built our solution, demoed it to stakeholders, and secured our first pilot.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of conversation still happens almost every day at Trinsic; 80% of developers who’ve used our platform recommend it. Since launching the world’s first production-ready verifiable credential platform less than a year ago, over 1,000 developers from more than 75 countries have used Trinsic for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials. We have no “sales” or “business development” staff because the best sales tool is a good product, and the best business development is hundreds of happy customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See for yourself how easy it is to issue credentials in the <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a>. It will take you less than five minutes.</p>

					 <p>Supporting teams in 75+ countries has taught us important lessons about the diversity of use cases and their requirements. And with customers in production in more than 10 of those countries, there are some requirements that were needed immediately:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Compliance with global data protection regulation  Choice of public utilities/blockchains  Accessibility first  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the number and diversity of Trinsic’s customer base continue to grow, we know these features will be needed by all. That’s why we’re announcing our commitment to make Trinsic more accessible and functional for our customers all over the globe in the following ways.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Global compliance through data residency 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our customers must comply with local regulations which often mandate that PII (personally identifiable information) remain within the borders of their jurisdiction. Starting now, Trinsic’s customers will have the ability to choose where their data is hosted in both the Trinsic platform and the mobile app (mediator service). This helps with compliance requirements associated with data protection laws in Canada, EU, South Africa, and other geographies. This feature is available on all <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">paid plans</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic now supports data centers in the following locations:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  United States  Canada  Netherlands  South Africa  Singapore  Australia  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each Organization (cloud agent) is hosted on its own dedicated tenant. When using <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, you can select the region by selecting from the drop-down menu that is titled “Select Region” when creating an Organization.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>If you are interacting directly with <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s API</a>, the default region is USA. A user can put the region into the API using the alpha-2 country code for that region. For example, a user who wants to create an Organization in Canada would add:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p><code>{<br><br>"name": "Canadian Organization",<br><br>"network": "sovrin-live"<br><br>"region": "CA"<br><br>}</code></p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Global utility networks 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Experience with diverse, global use cases has shown us why choice of networks is important. Trinsic’s vision is to be ledger and protocol agnostic, so we’ll add any production-ready networks as they become available. We support the following networks out of the box:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>: Launched in 2017, Sovrin was the first production-ready distributed ledger purpose-built for self-sovereign identity and includes Sovrin MainNet, StagingNet (most common for demos and pilots), and BuilderNet. Sovrin has stellar uptime and a <a href="https://sovrin.org/ssi-metrics-dashboards/">metrics dashboard</a> that monitors its performance.  <a href="http://prod.bcovrin.vonx.io/">BCovrin</a>: This is a clone of Sovrin for testing in the British Columbia region of Canada.  <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio</a>: Indicio is a concierge-class decentralized identity network that provides developers with a stable and reliable environment to build, test, and demo their SSI solutions, beginning with a test network.  In the near future, we will support geo-specific networks in Africa, Canada, Finland, Germany, and Southeast Asia.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>When creating an Organization in Trinsic Studio, there is a drop-down menu titled “Select Network” which allows you to easily designate which network your Organization is provisioned on.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic mobile app</a> supports these networks and also allows developers to add their own networks to connect with.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>Add a new network to the mobile app by clicking the “+” button to the upper-right of the network selection page in the mobile app.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>Switch between networks by navigating to the network selector page in the settings menu.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We look forward to continuing to add support for new networks as they develop and mature around the world. The following requirements must be met in order for Trinsic to add a production network to its platform:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  The network needs to be sufficiently decentralized with a governance framework outlining how it intends to avoid centralization of power.  The network needs to allow Trinsic to sign transactions on behalf of our customers; this is sometimes called an ‘endorser’ or ‘trust anchor’ model.  The network needs to have some form of paid staff support so that we can quickly resolve issues if our customers face them.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If your network meets these requirements and you would like your network to be accessible to the global Trinsic developer community, please <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Global accessibility 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As a part of expanding into other geographies, we have begun work to translate the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> application into various languages. If you would like to volunteer your time to translate the Trinsic Wallet into your language, <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">let us know</a>, and we can get you connected to the translation process.</p>

					 <p>Compared to the potential scale of SSI, 1,000+ customers means we’re still in our infancy. However, it also represents impressive initial growth of the SSI space. Developers are recognizing the value of SSI for themselves and their customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the addition of the data residency feature, our ongoing support of new networks, and our push to translate the Trinsic Wallet application into other languages, we hope to expand the reach of the Trinsic platform to developers and organizations around the world looking to build SSI solutions. Our goal has always been to make SSI as accessible as possible, and we look forward to continuing to work at that goal as we grow.</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-140-applepay-finally-gets-the-antitrust-attention-it-deserves-355d7da9774a">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got this&nbsp;week:</p>  Big Tech pulls plug on&nbsp;Parler  Your WhatsApp data belongs to&nbsp;FB  New Senate majority bad for Big&nbsp;Tech  Paypal + Square v. Regulators  Vaccine rollout needs better messaging + identity platforms  Losing trust in the Federal&nbsp;Reserve  Stuff happens   1. Big Tech pulls the plug on&nbsp;Parler <p>Most of you likely already know this story. Violence in DC last week sparked a swift reaction from Tech’s heavy hitters with Apple, Google and Amazon all pulling to plug on Parler, an alternative social media platform preferred by conservatives.</p><p>Two big takeaways:</p>  Moderation is a must in today’s digital reality. Really, it’s a part of growing up and the internet is so intertwined with our daily lives, we can no longer have the expectation of some Wild West. Plus, we have an obligation to keep our communities safe — whether in the real world or online. Clearly, the two worlds have collided and have spilled into each&nbsp;other.  Big Tech is very powerful — so powerful that they can swiftly shutdown an incredibly popular platform literally overnight, one that boasted over ten million users. Which only raises further questions.  <p>Both are weighty challenges to&nbsp;tackle.</p>  Via Todd — <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Apple Has Threatened To Ban Parler From The App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-twitter-muzzle-trump-capitol-8751fa88-db34-4737-8bbe-a7a9903db07c.html">Social media platforms muzzle Trump after Capitol&nbsp;melee</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-suspends-parler-from-app-store-76e67a4d-98f6-4bcf-858d-5e43ab182fde.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Amazon and Apple pull the plug on&nbsp;Parler</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol">Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/trump-and-twitter/">Trump and&nbsp;Twitter</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/new-defaults/">New&nbsp;Defaults</a>   2. Your WhatsApp data now belongs to Facebook. <p>Well, it’s not like we didn’t see it coming. After all, how else will Facebook make money on all those&nbsp;users?</p><p>It’s a reality that we’ve come to expect in this era of our tech evolution — the chapter where “we’re the product.” That’s why it’s&nbsp;“free.”</p><p>But evolution is a continuous process and there are alternatives now (such as GlobaliD).</p><p>There’s also Signal, which got the thumbs up from the new richest man on the planet on&nbsp;Twitter:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153">@elonmusk</a></p></blockquote><p>This part of how change happens — from the bottom up, from innovation, from users deciding that they want something better.</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/01/03/whatsapp-beaten-by-apples-new-imessage-update-for-iphone-users/">WhatsApp Soundly Beaten By Apple’s Stunning New iMessage&nbsp;Update</a>  <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp-privacy-policy-data-sharing-facebook/">Mandatory WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update Allows User Data to be Shared With&nbsp;Facebook</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-is-now-the-richest-person-in-the-world-passing-jeff-bezos-.html">Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world, passing Jeff&nbsp;Bezos</a>   3. The other way change happens is from the top down. You can bet that the new Democratic Senate majority is going after Big&nbsp;Tech. <p>Here’s The Information:</p><blockquote>Democrats have discussed sweeping changes to antitrust laws to make it easier for prosecutors to win antitrust convictions against companies with dominant market power, but Republicans have stood in the way of such legislation. Federal anti-monopoly lawyers recently filed legal claims against both Google and Facebook under existing antitrust law. Incoming Democratic president Joe Biden also is expected to try to reverse corporate tax cuts and reform a law known as Section 230 that shields internet companies like Google and Facebook from lawsuits over content posted by their users. Legislation to update online privacy-related rules also would be more likely to pass. To be sure, the Senate currently has a cloture rule requiring 60 members to end debate on most topics to move them to a chamber-wide vote.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/dc6afd">Briefing: Democrats Nearing Senate Majority, Spelling More Trouble For Big&nbsp;Tech</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/house-amazon-facebook-apple-google-have-monopoly-power-should-be-split/">House: Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google have “monopoly power,” should be&nbsp;split</a>   4. But the top-down method is always reliable or effective. Sometimes, it misses the mark or has unintended consequences. <p>One example was the CFPB’s (well-intentioned) prepaid card regulations — which the regulatory body wanted to expand into Paypal’s territory. That, of course, never really made sense and would have strapped Paypal’s innovative potential without actually protecting consumers.</p><p>As Greg noted on&nbsp;Twitter:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1347063982163587074">@gregkidd</a></p></blockquote>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/banking-paypal-cfpb/paypal-wins-bid-to-strike-down-cfpb-prepaid-card-regulations-idUSL1N2JB1AO">Paypal wins bid to strike down CFPB prepaid card regulations</a>  Photo: JD&nbsp;Lasica<p>Another example could be FINCEN’s midnight crypto wallet regulations. Square’s response was on&nbsp;point:</p><blockquote>With this rulemaking, FinCEN seeks to expand reporting and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) type obligations to parties who are not our customers. Instead of leveraging blockchain tracing with wallet addresses (which to date has proven effective in tracking the unlawful activity cited in the Proposal leading to indictments and convictions), FinCEN proposes a static requirement that would have us collect names and physical addresses from non-customers. To put it plainly — were the Proposal to be implemented as written, Square would be required to collect unreliable data about people who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.</blockquote><blockquote>This creates unnecessary friction and perverse incentives for cryptocurrency customers to avoid regulated entities for cryptocurrency transactions, driving them to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S. to transfer their assets more easily (non-custodial, or “unhosted” wallets are a type of software that lets individuals store and use cryptocurrency, instead of relying on a third party). By adding hurdles that push more transactions away from regulated entities like Square into non-custodial wallets and foreign jurisdictions, FinCEN will actually have less visibility into the universe of cryptocurrency transactions than it has&nbsp;today.</blockquote><blockquote>The impact of the Proposal would not only hamstring law enforcement capabilities, but also limit American innovation by hindering our ability to create a competitive service that allows customers to seamlessly transfer and transact in cryptocurrency the way the technology was designed. The burdensome information collection and reporting requirements deprive U.S. companies like Square of the chance to compete on a level playing field to enable cryptocurrency as a tool of economic empowerment.</blockquote>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter">Square, Inc.’s Federal Comment Letter Regarding FinCEN’s Proposed Rulemaking on Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital&nbsp;Assets</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/90005/square-fincen-wallet-proposal-crypto">Square says new FinCEN wallet proposal will inhibit crypto adoption and hinder law enforcement efforts</a>   5. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been clunky at best. And at its core, it’s because we need better identity and messaging systems. <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>The big picture: Historically, the federal government has established systems to help local governments deploy emergency information, like tornado and hurricane warnings that are broadcast on local television, as well as localized text&nbsp;alerts.</blockquote><blockquote>But the government hasn’t set up emergency communication systems to convey localized information about the vaccine, forcing citizens to turn to less reliable sources of information online.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re going to have to think through systems that will reach people when they need information that’s highly specific — and in this case, time sensitive,” says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “We’ll need to institutionalize that structure and keep track of&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><blockquote>“The fact that we don’t already have it is a real indictment,” she told Axios. “We should’ve thought this through&nbsp;before.”</blockquote><blockquote>What to watch: A lack of coordinated messaging around the vaccine rollout has left millions of people to search for answers online and via social media, opening space for confusion and misinformation.</blockquote><blockquote>Experts worry that big tech platforms, already reeling from election misinformation problems, are not equipped to help vet and verify vaccine rollout information.</blockquote><blockquote>Of note: Almost all of the experts Axios spoke to said that the best way to tackle this problem would be through a massive, federal government-backed awareness campaign educating consumers about the importance of getting a vaccine and directing them to some sort of a federal directory with links to verified local resources.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the U.S. has no centralized database with citizens’ addresses and health records, that’s likely the fastest thing the federal government can do to support local governments with the rollout at this&nbsp;point.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/vaccine-distribution-information-vacuum-fbb15860-5a9c-4751-bcd9-4e7122652aa0.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">As localities improvise to distribute COVID vaccines, an information vacuum&nbsp;emerges</a>  <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/singapore-coronavirus-app-criminal-investigations/?utm_content=150650672&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-775781157539614721">Singapore says COVID tracing app data is fair game for criminal investigations — CyberScoop</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/los-angeles-vaccine-recipients-can-put-the-proof-in-apple-wallet">Los Angeles Vaccine Recipients Can Put the Proof in Apple&nbsp;Wallet</a>   6. This week in society’s trust deficit: The Federal&nbsp;Reserve. <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>Big names in the world of finance are beginning to call out the Fed and other central banks for their role in ramping up economic inequality and manipulating financial markets — a departure from the praise they received for most of last&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Wall Street was the only pillar of solid support.

<p>AuthenTrend, a fingerprint security key solution provider, today announced a new partnership with Gluu, a leader in open source identity and access management ecosystem.  The goal of the partnership is to collaborate on passwordless infrastructures for enterprise employees, consumers, and citizens.  Gluu’s has tested AuthenTrend’s FIDO authentication devices, ATKey.Pro and ATKey.Card which are compliant with the FIDO2, FIDO U2F, andW3C WebAuthn standards, which enable people to move away from passwords in lieu of secure cryptographic credentials based on public and private key technology.</p>
<p>AuthenTrend’s applied fingerprint-authentication technology is trusted by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association, and can also be used for Windows Sign-on. Unlike traditional fingerprint devices, AuthenTrend’s patented standalone enrollment technology allows users to enroll fingerprints directly on the ATKey.Card or ATKey.Pro, no app download required. The ATKey.Pro device is available as both USB-A and USB-C. The ATKey.Card device supports USB-A, NFC and Bluetooth. </p>
<p>FIDO leverages the previously enrolled biometric template to unlock access to a private key. While older FIDO technologies required an end-user to simply press a button, biometric FIDO credentials ensure that only the owner of the key can use the credential.  The private key never leaves the device–meaning a breach of the server does not enable impersonation. FIDO technology also prevents phishing, as hackers cannot trick the user to provide a one time code or intercept it with malware.  </p>
<p>Gluu includes extensive support for FIDO devices in it’s platform, including both FIDO U2F and FIDO 2 authentication and registration endpoints.  This design enables applications to use federated digital identity protocols like SAML or OpenID Connect to achieve single sign-on across multiple domains, and to request FIDO as the mechanism to authenticate the end user. The Gluu platform also includes a self-service web portal called Casa that enables end users to see their registered devices, and to remove a device, for example if it’s lost. Like all Gluu components, the login experience and Casa can be customized to meet the exact localization, user experience and security requirements of enterprises and governments. For more information about Gluu, you can visit their website at https://gluu.org </p>
<p>AuthenTrend aspires to replace all passwords with biometrics to help people take back ownership of their credentials. Learn More AuthenTrend products: https://www.authentrend.com</p>

<p>CON PROXYSIGN, INFOCERT CONTRIBUISCE A VELOCIZZARE LA SOMMINISTRAZIONE DEI VACCINI ANTI COVID-19.</p>



<p>Il 27&nbsp;dicembre 2020 sarà ricordato in Italia e in tutta Europa come il Vaccine day, ovvero il giorno in cui ha preso il via la campagna di vaccinazione anti Covid-19. Da questa stessa data InfoCert ha affiancato con le sue soluzioni una delle prime aziende sanitarie a partire con le vaccinazioni in Italia.</p>



<p>La ProxySign Interactive Trust Platform di InfoCert ha permesso di digitalizzare l’intera procedura di raccolta del consenso informato dei vaccinandi, che è obbligatoria e richiede la sottoscrizione con firma autografa.</p>



<p>La soluzione messa in campo da InfoCert rende la procedura più semplice e pienamente conforme alle normative:</p>



  effettuato il riconoscimento del vaccinando attraverso la tessera sanitaria, il personale dell’ASL procede ad effettuarne l’anamnesi e ad inserire tutti i dati al terminale;  il vaccinando appone sul tablet dell’operatore due firme grafometriche (Firme Elettroniche Avanzate – FEA);  le firme vengono immediatamente recepite e verificate dal sistema senza alcun passaggio cartaceo.  



<p>La raccolta dei consensi tramite firma grafometrica aumenta la sicurezza del processo, la sua efficienza e permette di ridurre i tempi di permanenza degli utenti all’interno del centro vaccinale, azzera i rischi di errore procedurale e riduce significativamente i costi di gestione a carico delle ASL.</p>

<p>The recent article by <a href="https://t.co/I64yn6toMO?amp=1">Vitalik on social recovery</a> summarised his views on the different options for key management where he pushed for stronger adoption of social recovery&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We resonate with much of what was mentioned. Especially the magnitude of key management issues, and the strong need for solutions better than mnemonics. Given that we’ve been working on the same problem for a while now, we want to present our thoughts on Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) that the social recovery Vitalik describes depends on, why we’ve gone a different direction with our suite of solutions (tKey, the Torus Network) and the tradeoffs that come with&nbsp;both.</p> Social Recovery is awesome, but SCW/multi-sigs on L2s are a tough&nbsp;problem <p>Social recovery as prefered by Vitalik manages a user’s account via a smart contract’s signing key. In the case of loss, Guardians which are added prior, allow changing of the signing key via social flows. While definitely a great ideal to work towards, Vitalik outlined SCWs that two main shortcomings to overcome in the near&nbsp;future:</p>  Gas costs. At ETH Gas Station’s standard gwei (250) and ETH’s price today this amounts to ~$35 per user to set up their&nbsp;SCW.  Account abstraction and the reliance on relayers.  <p>To address these issues, a migration to L2 and perhaps the inclusion of multi-sigs/SCWs on the protocol level was proposed. By no means is this a small task, there are definitely challenges to solve. With the different L2’s being dished out and the different SCWs/Multi-sigs in the space, each with their own technical architectures and business/project interests to align, one might expect implementations to vary quite a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>Because state is separate between all of the different L1s and L2s we face state issues. When we migrate, do we leave L1 state behind? Will we be able to have the same SCW on L1 as well as L2? Would we have to deploy our SCW on different L2s, deploying and syncing permissions on each? Combine this with ETH2 sharding complexity with managing state only increases.</p><p>On a technical level, these challenges are already complex, when we introduce building it for an onboardable UX for a mainstream user the restrictions are even&nbsp;tighter.</p> Using Threshold Cryptography (Off-chain Multi-sigs) <p>Because private keys are a relatively rigid crypto primitive, initiatives like SCWs/multi-sigs choose to wrap abstractions around accounts to provide more flexibility via an additional smart contract state that is managed on-chain. However, we can also secure accounts in the other direction, by using threshold cryptography to make private keys more flexible.</p><p>Initiatives, like <a href="https://darkcrystal.pw/">Dark Crystal</a>, <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> by Hashicorp, <a href="https://wiki.trezor.io/Shamir_Backup">Shamir39</a> by Trezor as well as our <a href="https://github.com/tkey/tkey">tKey</a> opt to go down this direction. The solutions often use a variation of Shamir Secret Sharing to split a user’s key into a number of shares. With a threshold number of these shares, a user is able to access/reconstruct their key (i.e. 2 out of 3). In specific, <a href="https://hackmd.io/@torus/rkjxXsBBw">tKey</a> has a focus on personal key management and user-centric flows and interested readers can try it out for themselves <a href="https://app.tor.us/">here</a>.</p><p>It is very similar to a multi-sig but with one small (but impactful) difference — it results in a public-private key&nbsp;pair.</p> Tradeoffs between Threshold Key Management and SCWs/multi-sigs <p>As threshold key management results in a key pair, it’s directly and natively compatible with a multitude of other cryptographic constructs out there. When compared to SCW/multi-sigs, you&nbsp;have:</p><p>One account to manage — Instead of having to manage state across different L2s and L1 you only have one set of permissions/access control to worry about per&nbsp;account.</p><p>A key’s widespread compatibility — Cryptographic keys are the foundation of blockchains, and beyond being compatible with different chain states you can use your key to interact with whichever protocol out there be it zero-knowledge proofs on Aztec or staking on ETH2. Private keys are plug-and-play.</p><p>Supports use cases beyond blockchains — An application may want to simply sign a token to represent a login, encrypt data for a particular user. These constructions are by no means impossible for SCWs/multi-sigs but it introduces additional requirements and complexity to a&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Universally accepted — Key management is a universal problem across cryptography. Using key management structures that are more universally integrated allows blockchains to be more compatible, and potentially integrable with traditional software&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>Lack of generic computation — A strong benefit of SCWs is being able to read Ethereum state. You can set daily spending limits, add recoverability via timeouts, or even add DAOs as guardians. While wallets that support computation are definitely very powerful, arguably some of these features can be done client-side (e.g. daily thresholds) even if there aren’t consensus guarantees. Additionally, many useful security checks that applications use today (e.g. IP whitelisting) may be impossible to replicate on-chain.</p> Social Recovery flows via&nbsp;tKey <p>To an extent, social recovery flows can be replicated with tKey. To&nbsp;achieve:</p><blockquote>There is a single “signing key” that can be used to approve transactions</blockquote><blockquote>There is a set of at least 3 (or a much higher number) of “guardians”, of which a majority can cooperate to change the signing key of the&nbsp;account.</blockquote><p>We can create two separate sharings, one for the user to manage across their user devices (like a multi-sig) for personal use and another shared across people they know (like guardians). Hierarchies can be created for different groups through sub-sharings. Unfortunately, it is harder to replicate the timeouts or the “vault” architecture Vitalik through native crypto primitives since threshold key management doesn’t rely on Ethereum&nbsp;state.</p> Threshold Key Management or SCWs?&nbsp;Both? <p>As an ecosystem, on-chain wallets, with the power of generic computation have a lot to offer, but its compatibility and interoperability restrictions are definitely hurdles to overcome. As ETH2 progresses and more L2s evolve out with varying requirements, as well as other interesting low-level cryptographic tools that are being built, you can be sure that they will still always use native key pairs and we are always going to need good ways to secure&nbsp;them.</p><p>For us at Torus, we found the compatibility benefits from threshold key management very compelling. As an SDK it’s easier to integrate into different clients across platforms and blockchains, has no gas costs, and covers 80% of the access management flows required today. Because tKey is native it’s also naturally compatible with SCWs and we’re keeping an eye out for what could the right mix of solutions here. We’d love to work with any of the current SCW operators to see how that might look&nbsp;like.</p><p>For readers who want to try out what a Threshold Key Management flow could look like, you can check out tKey <a href="https://app.tor.us/">here</a>.

  <p>As we continue to endure the prolonged effects of the pandemic, it should come as no surprise that millions of people are online more than ever. In fact, our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-study-shows-45-consumers-plan-increase-online-services-use-post">New Normal</a> report surveyed 5,000 global consumers and showed that this is likely to be a long-term shift - 45% of people stated that they plan on continuing to use more online services post-pandemic than they did before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Government services are one area that has seen online demand skyrocket. From departments who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/13/self-employment-grant-application-website-crashes-hours-launch-12698889/">were challenged</a> to manage an influx of benefit claimants, to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-website-what-tier-down-crash-b1762243.html">websites buckling</a> under the weight of people attempting to learn what the COVID-19 restrictions were in their area - government departments and agencies have been at the forefront of the battle to ramp up their digital transformation efforts to meet demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now with COVID-19 vaccines on the horizon, the beginning of the end of the pandemic crisis just might be in sight. So what long-term lessons can be learned about how to service a customer base which looks ready to access services increasingly online-first, while remaining agile enough to respond to any future societal shifts?</p>

 Identity First 

<p>To start, your approach should put digital identity at the heart of your operations. Many companies still consider identity a layer in their software stack rather than a core component. It’s only those that subscribe to the latter, more modern mode of thinking, who will stand to benefit from the true business value of identity. From managing and safeguarding a remote workforce to ensuring all citizens have easy access to your online services, digital identity will allow your organisation to face the challenges of today and provide secure, connected digital services at scale, simply by ensuring that systems, services and apps know who (or what) they are interacting with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those of you in customer-facing operations, this matters because it allows you to deliver a personalized, and therefore better, online service that directs people to precisely what they need based on their identity. This creates an effortless user journey that also requires less resource investment. For your workforce, ForgeRock’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity and access management </a>functionality means you can now control who has access to what, and allow <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/crisis-and-resilience/covid-19/digital-identity-supports-a-secure-remote-digital-workforce-duri.html">rapid scaling</a> as demand grows or shrinks.&nbsp;</p>

 Focusing Your Time on What Matters 

<p>Next, your organization needs to be able to react to unforeseen events and changing situations, like COVID-19, quickly and without tying up scarce resources which are in acute demand elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/g-cloud-buyers-guide">Government-Cloud's framework</a> will allow you to search, compare, and procure from pre-approved suppliers and vendors without lengthy bureaucratic processes.</p>

<p>This speeds up an otherwise protracted approval process, making the task of finding the right digital identity solution for your department quick and seamless. It also means you can focus your efforts on the mission-critical areas that need your attention - like managing the increased user demand from the thousands of people newly accessing government services online now and into the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Pick a Cloud, Any Cloud 

<p>And the good news? As an approved Government-Cloud vendor, ForgeRock is on the list of providers you can choose from. What’s more, ForgeRock is the only vendor recognized as a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">leader across the top three analyst firms</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which takes us to the third lesson: every department’s digital transformation journey won’t be identical. That’s why we’ve developed our<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud"> Identity Cloud</a> solution, a single identity and access management (IAM) platform that can manage and protect all of the identities, devices and services within your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a range of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment options</a> available, meaning that organizations can embed our solution into an existing public cloud, on-premises or hybrid environments. It is not an all-or-nothing proposition: your department doesn’t need to ‘rip-and-replace’ their entire legacy identity systems to benefit from our identity cloud capabilities. We adapt to the unique needs and capabilities of each organization.</p>

<p>That means by moving to a hybrid cloud model that can co-exist and augment your existing identity infrastructure, your department can scale with ease, on your own timeline and according to your unique departmental demands and capabilities.</p>

 Keeping Your Data Safe 

<p>Final lesson: security is more important than ever. From HMRC <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/features/coronavirus-has-been-boon-cybercriminals">reporting</a> an increase in phishing scams at the start of the pandemic to <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/hackney-council-hit-%E2%80%98serious-cyberattack%E2%80%99">local councils</a> suffering from serious cyber-attacks, public sector data breaches are <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/data-breaches/357407/uk-gov-data-breaches-2019-2020#:~:text=Government%20departments%20reported%20scores%20of,ICO%20between%202019%20and%202020&amp;text=UK%20government%20departments%20experienced%20%22thousands,security%20implemented%20by%20the%20institutions.">on the rise</a> following the online migration of so many users during the pandemic. With more people signing up for government services, departments must ensure that user data is protected from cyber-attacks and malicious hackers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, a modern hybrid cloud solution can defend against compromised accounts and data breaches, via ongoing contextual authentication and authorization - ensuring only the right people are accessing the right things.&nbsp;</p>

 It’s a Hybrid World&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>The pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives. Some of those shifts will be temporary; others permanent. But for public sector bodies concerned with equipping themselves for the long-term, the lessons are clear: a digital identity solution, available quickly, which adapts to your specific needs and protects your users’ data will put you in good standing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And ForgeRock’s Identity Cloud Solution, available to procure via the Government-Cloud portal, will do just that.</p>

<p>Bloom is happy to announce that we'll be offering funds for research and development grants to the crypto community to collaborate on some exciting new initiatives to benefit the crypto ecosystem. With these grants we hope to help shed light on some poorly understood fundamentals of the crypto space, as well as to build some exciting new solutions for unsolved problems.</p><p>Research Grant: Tokenomics</p><p>Bloom will be accepting proposals for a grant of 5 ETH, with an opportunity for ongoing funding upon completion, for research on the economic behavior of ERC20 and other native blockchain tokens. The research should examine the economic interactions involved with different types of tokens, and how their supply, demand and price influence the behavior of smart contracts and off-chain mechanisms for different crypto projects, protocols and applications, and how various distribution models, such as token sales and airdrops, impact them. Examples of projects that may be relevant to this research include MakerDAO, Chainlink, Uniswap, Yearn, and the Graph. Grantees will be expected to produce a scientific research paper detailing their findings, as well as a summary to be published on the Bloom blog.</p><p>Build Grant: Unsecured Lending Vaults</p><p>Bloom will be accepting proposals for a grant of 10 ETH, with an opportunity for ongoing funding upon completion, for building a solution based on Bloom's specification for unsecured data lending vaults. The solution must involve using either Chainlink protocol's query methods, or direct on-chain transactions, to facilitate loading data on-chain to describe KYC status and interest rate for a borrower. This exciting project opens up the door to unsecured/undercollateralized lending to take place on-chain with participation from traditional banking institutions and other entities in the crypto space, allowing competition among different models of calculating risk for lending to emerge in the crypto space, and for the grantee to explore different models for decentralized governance of unsecured lending. Grantees will be expected to produce a working proof of concept, and if the grant is extended beyond the initial terms, grantees will have the opportunity to develop their solution into a full commercial application.</p><p>Unsecured lending vaults are Yearn-style vaults but instead of implementing yield farming strategies, they implement unsecured lending strategies based on the vault creator's proprietary risk pricing models. The community can provide liquidity to a lending vault to gain exposure to the lender's borrowers.</p><p>Token governance may be introduced to nominate &amp; select lending strategies for the community to adopt. Stakers would receive rewards based on the returns from the adopted strategies. In addition, some strategies may wish to delegate lending terms like interest rates to liquidity providers, enabling the community to optimize the returns for a given cohort of borrowers.</p><p>Build Grant: Utility Experiments</p><p>Bloom will be accepting proposals for a grant of 5 ETH, with an opportunity for ongoing funding upon completion, for building a proof-of-concept solution for automatically providing BLT tokens to application users in exchange for providing Verifiable Credentials of their personal information via the Bloom App. Examples may include providing data to assist in building credit models, direct payment to users for personalized advertisement, providing data to assist in market research, surveys, or other similar use cases - in every case, through a mechanism similar to scanning a QR code and responding with Bloom verifiable credential data as well as an ETH address at which to receive payments. Grantees will be expected to produce a working proof of concept, and if the grant is extended beyond the initial terms, will have the opportunity to develop their solution into a full commercial application.</p><p>How to apply</p><p>Applications due by Friday, January 29, 2021</p><p>If you are interested in applying for any of the above grants, send us an application at <a href="mailto:grants@bloom.co">grants@bloom.co</a>. Please include information about other projects you have completed in the space, why you are a good candidate for the grant, and how you would approach the chosen topic, including a time estimate for completing the first submission. Once accepted, we will invite you to our Discord where we can kick off the project!</p><p>Joining the new community discord</p><p>Soon after the onboarding of our grant recipients to the Discord, we'll invite more community members in to discuss the projects as well as future research, and grant opportunities.</p><p>We look forward to receiving the community's proposals and announcing our grantees!</p>

					 <p>In verifiable credential exchange, a decentralized network (also referred to as a ledger or a blockchain) primarily acts as a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) for identifying who issued a particular credential. For example, if an issuer is provisioned on the Indicio Network, the authenticity of credentials created by that issuer can be verified by looking up the issuer’s DID on the Indicio Network. For more information on issuer DIDs, see our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/issue-credentials#issuer-did">documentation</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the Indicio Network, the Trinsic platform currently supports organizations being provisioned on the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Network</a>, Sovrin’s <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">test networks</a>, and the BCovrin Test Network. We plan on adding support for additional networks in the near future and will continue to do so as more decentralized identity networks emerge.</p>

					 Because decentralized identity can make life better: Why we converted to a public benefit corporation 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  In December, Indicio.tech reincorporated as a public benefit corporation, joining a worldwide movement committed to align profit with a positive material impact on society.  
			   
				
				
				 For Indicio, it has always been clear that <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a> benefits the public—that is what brought us, the founders, <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-letter-from-our-ceo/">together</a>. It solves a massive structural flaw in the architecture of life online: The lack of an effective way to encode uniqueness and thereby verify individual identity; and it does so in a way that removes the need for third parties to control and store personally identifying information.<p></p>
<p>Decentralized identity allows people to give meaningful consent to sharing their data in a maximally private and secure way. It answers the deep disquiet over the misappropriation of personal data that has been given a voice in data privacy regulation—and it makes compliance with such laws easy.</p>
<p>All of these are public “goods.” Now, add in decentralized identity’s capacity to help those who have no formal, legal identity, those who are stateless, those who are refugees—a number <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/12/11-billion-invisible-people-without-id-are-priority-for-new-high-level-advisory-council-on-identification-for-development">estimated</a> at over a billion people—to prove that they exist, secure access to health and financial services, and establish rights over property.</p>
<p>To dream this big we have to formulate achievable, incremental steps to get there. We have to create the technology and infrastructure that can realize these public goods; we have to make the tech interoperable and, wherever possible, open source. We have to make it as easy as possible to understand, use, and adopt. We have to build use cases and help others build use cases to reveal its value.</p>
<p>As Indicio grew, and as we saw decentralized identity as an ecosystem that needed to be <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/three-things-that-will-launch-decentralized-identity-into-commercial-reality/">seeded and cultivated</a>, the public benefit corporate model became more and more compelling as a way of ensuring that our beliefs and values were baked into this mission. But we also saw the benefit corporation as a way of encoding a positive and inclusive culture inside our company. If each team member is genuinely valued for the work they do, they will give their best to our clients, they will become the most effective advocates for our mission.</p>
<p>A brief overview of the benefit corporation movement<br>
The idea of a benefit corporation begins with long-simmering dissatisfaction in the argument that the only responsibility or duty a company had was to increase its profits, a claim that had been forcefully made by University of Chicago economist<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html"> Milton Friedman in the New York Times magazine</a> in 1970. Arguing that only an individual had responsibilities, and a corporation couldn’t be a person, Friedman defined a new era of shareholder supremacy in business.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the easiest way to see whether a business was acting responsibly was to see if its share value was increasing, a simple metric that had profound consequences for the way a business or corporation was run. The CEO’s job became defined by what he or she did to increase their company’s share price. Shareholders didn’t need to buy into the reasons why the business was founded, or the vision of its founders, or even the value the company provided its customers and society: share price higher, company good. There was no obligation to think, strategically, outside the short-term, or to consider the welfare of community, the environment, or the company’s employees.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the inflexibility of this model from the business side and growing public interest in economic and environmental sustainability and social responsibility helped to open up a legal middle way between for-profit and nonprofit corporations. The “benefit” corporation was the result and the first benefit corporation legislation was <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2010rs/chapters_noln/Ch_97_sb0690T.pdf">introduced in Maryland in 2010</a>. Simply put, profit and public benefit can be combined in a way that allows company directors to balance shareholder and stakeholder interests in the pursuit of that public benefit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">Many states</a> now offer similar legislation. In Delaware, where Indicio is incorporated, such corporations are called <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc15/">public benefit corporations</a>.</p>
<p>The case for benefit corporations has been most forcefully put by one of the best-known B-Corps, <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/benefit-corporation-update-patagonia-passes-b-impact-assessment-improves-score-to-116/story-17871.html">Patagonia</a>. In registering as the first California benefit corporation in 2017, founder Yves Chouinard <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/b-lab.html">said</a>, “Benefit corporation legislation creates the legal framework to enable mission-driven companies like Patagonia to stay mission-driven through succession, capital raises, and even changes in ownership, by institutionalizing the values, culture, processes, and high standards put in place by founding entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>The social impact of technology<br>
It’s not surprising that environmental impact has been central to defining the B-Corp movement and the companies that have embraced it. 1 But decentralized identity offers a similar opportunity for tech companies to think about the social impact of technology.</p>
<p>We need to set standards for what the public should expect from technology companies and from decentralized identity. We need independent third parties, like <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B-Lab</a>, which was instrumental in creating the B-Corp model, to help codify and provide independent certification that we—and other tech companies—are walking the walk on digital identity, data privacy, and security when we build and govern decentralized identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>At a time when “Big Tech” is looking more 19th&nbsp;century than 21st&nbsp;century in the way it acts—“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34a352a6-85d1-480f-9132-71c6416f101b">Big Tech face its Standard Oil moment</a>” was an end-of-2020 headline in the Financial Times—a transformational technology like decentralized identity gives us an organic opportunity for a reset.</p>
<p>We have the means to give people control of their identities, the right to share their data, and to give the identity-less legal agency in the world. We believe this will trigger a new wave of innovation that will benefit business and organizations too. But we believe, most of all, that it’s the right thing to do. A public benefit corporation is not just the way to do this, it’s the way to create a meaningful conversation in business about the role of technology in people’s lives—and to hold us accountable for all this talk.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p> 1The use of a distributed ledger in decentralized identity does not involve “proof of work” or mining, both of which entail substantial energy costs. Instead, with the optimal network size being 25 or fewer nodes, writing credentials to the ledger is energy comparable to logging into a website or sending a form. Much of the activity in a decentralized identity ecosystem takes place off ledger. This all makes decentralized identity a low-energy consumption practice.</p>

<p>There’s not much that hasn’t already been said about 2020. Last year provided the world a historic level of uncertainty due to the pandemic. Companies worldwide had to suddenly adjust to employees working from home out of necessity while also responding to consumers and customers that were similarly homebound. Despite this uncertainty, the Digital Identity (DI) space saw a tremendous amount of forward momentum, as enterprises were forced to utilize DI technologies on a grander scale, simply to conduct business. This transition came with some downsides as well, most notably the lack of innovation. Still, the issues that arose from this response led to some exciting shifts in the DI space, including more investment and awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that we’ve officially put 2020 behind us, it’s time to look forward. With the new administration in the US, the rollout of vaccines and the ongoing maturation of DI, there’s plenty more opportunity and enthusiasm ahead. </p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely there will be some unexpected hiccups and macroeconomic issues that we can’t predict in 2021 – let’s just hope not on the scale of another global pandemic – but we do see some intriguing trends in digital identity that we believe will shape the space this year.&nbsp;While plenty of other potential possibilities exist, as others have highlighted, these five trends standout to us due to the momentum we’ve seen build over the past number of years. And if you have some thoughts or predictions of your own, drop us an <a href="mailto:research@oneworldidentity.com">email</a> to let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 OWI’s 2021 Predictions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Incumbent fraud prevention platforms go on a buying spree&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming off of a record year for the eCommerce and eCommerce fraud space, most companies across the fraud prevention and risk management market saw revenues and profits rise in 2020. Based on the advantages of large-scale networks to deliver superior fraud detection signals, top platforms separated themselves from the field, opening up opportunities for industry consolidation of lagging players. Those companies that did well outperformed their targets by levels of 30% to 50%, while those left behind only saw 10% to 20% of growth beyond targets. Those that outperformed gained an edge due to basic advantages, like network data size, to provide more accurate models and offerings. Since these advantages will continue to widen, the companies that only had a good year will need to raise significant capital or be acquired in order to keep up with those that had a great year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>This will push the industry towards more comprehensive, integrated digital identity platform solutions, including everything from identity resolution, customer onboarding, to ongoing account management.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity confirmation becomes common at checkout and when watching mature content online 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect large platforms, such as Youtube and Netflix, to comply with regulations that seek to protect children and consumers, which is the goal for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/audiovisual-media-services-directive-avmsd">Audiovisual Media Services Directive</a> out of the EU, as an example. This will force these companies to know more about their users in order to mitigate this risk, leaning towards convenience and frictionless identification, whenever possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital identity wallet adoption grows worldwide as contact tracing becomes mandatory for everyday activities 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies with digital identity wallet capabilities and offerings have waited for a major catalyzing event to take a good idea and make it applicable for a massive population. COVID-19 contact tracing applications will normalize proving your identity through your device, confirming any close contacts, and potentially providing your vaccination status. It’s similar to the impact that Apple’s release of Face ID had on normalizing facial recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy concerns remain the major barrier to adoption for these tools. Since the COVID response will play out on a worldwide scale, it offers a catalyzing event, which will improve initial adoption rates this year and increase digital identity confirmation uses moving forward. If the wallets can ease privacy concerns with the technology, particularly since consumers will often be utilizing the tool for the first time, then that worldwide adoption can lead to ongoing use far beyond tracking COVID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital identity initiatives get the Biden Bump 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, the Obama administration unveiled the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf">Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights</a> as part of a “comprehensive blueprint” to improve consumers’ privacy protections and ensure that the Internet remains an engine for innovation and economic growth. Better ID Coalition, led by former Obama administration executives, recently unveiled their <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/five-key-initiatives">blueprint</a> and helped introduce the bipartisan <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/press-releases/2020/9/11/better-identity-coalition-hails-introduction-of-the-improving-digital-identity-act-of-2020">Improving Digital Identity Act of 2020</a> in Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>With the Biden administration tapping many of the same people that guided Obama, expect these issues to have a place at the table. This effort becomes even more operable, since the Biden administration will be working with a supportive Congress.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The passwordless revolution finally arrives 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year saw behavioral biometrics company BioCatch and multi-factor authentication company Trusona raise $168 million and $19.4 million, respectively. The funds came from serious investors, like Amex Ventures, Bain Capital, Citi Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins. This marks the moment of institutional buy-in to kill the password, once and for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect to start seeing that shift this year with more investments and an increase in awareness about tactics in DI that go beyond the password to reach enterprises and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In late December, software company SolarWinds became aware of a supply chain attack on one of its software systems. The attackers added malware to signed versions of the supplier’s software, which was then used to infiltrate 18,000 private government and private organizations. The malware became active once deployed in the target environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/25610/Peter-Firstbrook">Peter Firstbrook</a>, Gartner VP Analyst, and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/44900">Jeremy D'Hoinne</a>, Gartner VP Analyst, say that although these types of attacks are a reality, organizations are often unprepared to respond to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-a-defensible-cybersecurity-program-in-3-steps/">cybersecurity </a>attacks. We spoke with the analysts to discuss the nature of supply chain attacks and how security and risk teams can prepare for them.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 What is a supply chain attack? 
<p>A supply chain attack is when goods, services or technology supplied by a vendor to a customer have been breached and compromised, which introduces a risk to the customer base. The risk to an organization will vary.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-ways-to-defend-against-a-ransomware-attack/">6 Ways to Defend Against a Ransomware Attack</a></p>
<p>There are various examples of supply chain attacks, such as using a compromised email account from a supplier for social engineering or to increase the probability of a malware infection by sending it from a supplier’s email address. More elaborate attacks can compromise a supplier’s network and use its privileged access to infiltrate the target network. The most sophisticated attacks, including the SolarWinds attack, involve modifying trusted software tools.&nbsp;</p>
 How do you detect this type of attack and the extent of the damage?&nbsp; 
<p>It’s a short question with a very long answer. The biggest challenge is that supply chain attacks are utilized by advanced adversaries, often using new techniques and tools that are difficult to detect. In addition, anomaly detection is an imprecise art and can trigger too many alerts for security teams to address. Scaling the security operation team to respond to alerts and thus reduce detection time remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Supply chain attacks expand the scope further. In addition to what’s under the direct control of the organizations, security teams must:</p>
 
 Inventory and monitor the third-party tools the organization uses, and learn about vulnerabilities and disclosed breaches 
 Monitor remote access granted to suppliers, restrict it and strengthen it with additional layers such as multifactor authentication.&nbsp; 
 Monitor third-party providers that have access to corporate resources.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Supply chain attacks might leverage multiple attack techniques. Specialized anomaly detection technologies, including endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR) and user behavior analytics (UBA) can complement the broader scope covered by security analytics on centralized log management/SIEM tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-security-projects-for-2020-2021/">Gartner Top 10 Security Projects for 2020-2021</a></p>
<p>The primary target of advanced adversaries is authenticated access, which enables them to blend into normal activities. This means identity infrastructure hygiene, multifactor authentication and continuous monitoring are key defenses. Additionally, network segmentation can limit the damage of undetected attacks by making it harder to get to higher-value corporate resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 How should organizations respond to a supply chain attack? 
<p>Incident response playbooks for supply chain attacks are similar to any incident response, but with different time horizons to consider. The first step is the incident response workflow. This includes tracking down the extent of the compromise with a forensic analysis and restoring normal operations. For this, access to the relevant information is critical.</p>
<p>In the absence of internal investigation resources, or when anticipating a critical breach, organizations should engage incident response services.</p>
<p>Longer term, acknowledging that anyone can be breached and that there is no inside vs outside of the network (i.e., zero trust), security teams should adapt their security and risk management roadmaps to better reflect supply chain attack exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerging breach and attack simulation tools can be used to continuously explore inside the network attack scenarios</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations that have determined that they are not impacted by a high-profile supply chain attack should take the opportunity to test “what if” scenarios by assuming they were impacted, what mitigations or security defenses would have provided effective containment and what would not. This type of analysis may change thinking about security priorities and procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this particular attack was discovered by an alert security operator wondering why an employee wanted a second phone registered for multifactor authentication. This would imply that the attacker was aiming to leverage identity, and specifically MFA as an attack vector. As such successful security organizations must scrutinize identity onboarding procedures, which includes the registration of new devices for MFA usage security procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emerging breach and attack simulation tools can be used to continuously explore inside the network attack scenarios and implications, as well as test security defenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What specific concerns have security professionals been raising since the attack?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>We received a broad set of inquiries mixing traditional post-breach questions, typically aimed at understanding the scope and direct consequences of a specific attack along with an additional set of questions related to the impact of using the compromised supplier’s product, and how to adapt to this situation.&nbsp;</p>
 This seems like a good time for organizations to review security and risk plans. Where should they focus?&nbsp; 
<p>It is important to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">avoid ad hoc responses</a> that might be too specific and not the most preferable move to improve security overall. A broad review helps put recent events in a broader, more balanced context. The review should not be limited to preventative controls, but should also include anomaly detection and incident response. Frameworks such as Breach and Attack (BAS) can help formalize the initial review and tools, and also aid in the automation of the assessment.&nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>MicroProfile is an open-source community project with the goal to encourage the development of Java microservice solutions. It was created in 2016 in response to the changing needs of modern web development. In particular, it seeks to foster the development of smaller, less monolithic services (microservices) that can run on faster release cycles than the typical, old-school Enterprise Java application. Shortly after its creation, it joined the Eclipse foundation.</p>

<p>MicroProfile, in essence, is a set of specifications and standards agreed upon by a community of developers that allows for “write once, run anywhere” in the Java microservice ecosystem. There are currently around nine compliant runtimes for MicroProfile, including Apache TomEE, Quarkus, and Open Liberty. A program written for one can be seamlessly run on another. The community also serves as an incubator for new ideas within Enterprise Java and microservice architectures.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, the runtime you are going to use is Open Liberty. Open Liberty is an implementation of the MicroProfile specification. Open Liberty bills itself as “a lightweight open framework for building fast and efficient cloud-native Java microservices.” It’s easily customizable, fast to start, and has a low footprint.</p>

 Why Use GraphQL Instead of REST? 

<p>The application you’re going to write is a surf report generator. Why? Because people seem to like weather apps for their example apps, and I thought a surf report generator was more fun. The surf reports, unfortunately, will just be randomly generated. However, you’ll use GraphQL to query and return data instead of a traditional REST API.</p>

<p>With a REST API, a typical transaction cycle might include numerous API requests. The client app may have to, at a minimum, make a different call for each type of resource required, and often, lots of data is returned that is not used by the client. This results in a lot of inefficient communication. Facebook created GraphQL to address this.</p>

<p>GraphQL allows a client to ask the server for exactly the data it needs in a single request. The client can group multiple request types in a single request and specify exactly which properties on the requested data structures it wants to be included in the response. This results in much more efficient communications between client and server, allowing, for example, mobile apps to work well even on slow connections.</p>

<p>The app will be secured using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect using Okta as the provider. MicroProfile provides a JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and authorization specification that Open Liberty implements. You’ll use this to add role-based authorization to your surf report.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to have a few things installed.</p>

 
   Java 11: This tutorial uses Java 11. <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is an excellent option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   Maven: The MicroProfile starter uses Maven, a dependency management utility. It can be installed according to <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">the instructions on their website</a>. You could also use  <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> or <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. 
   Okta Developer Account: You’ll be using Okta as an OAuth/OIDC provider to add JWT authentication and authorization to the application. You can go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">our developer site</a> and sign up for a free developer account. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test your MicroProfile app. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
 

 Create a Java Project Using the MicroProfile Starter 

<p>You can bootstrap a project using the MicroProfile starter. This will quickly configure your MicroProfile project using OpenLiberty as the MicroProfile implementation.</p>

<p>Open the starter website, <a href="https://start.microprofile.io/">https://start.microprofile.io/</a>, and make the following selections.</p>

 
   MicroProfile Version: <code>3.3</code> 
   Java SE Version: <code>Java 11</code> 
   MicroProfile Runtime: <code>OpenLiberty</code> 
 

<p>Leave the groupId as <code>com.example</code> and the artifactId as <code>demo</code>. Don’t check any of the Examples for specifications. These are great for exploring and understanding the various features of MicroProfile, but they’ll just complicate things for this tutorial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click DOWNLOAD.</p>

<p>Copy the <code>demo.zip</code> file somewhere appropriate as a project root directory and extract the files.</p>

<p>You have a fully functioning application. Open a shell and navigate to the project root directory. Run the starter application using the following command.</p>

   <code>mvn liberty:run
</code>   

<p>You’ll see a lot of output that ends with the following.</p>

<p>Test the basic server using HTTPie to run a GET request on the auto-generated endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :9080/data/hello


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Hello World

</code>   

 Configure MicroProfile for GraphQL 

<p>Now you’re going to create a simple GraphQL “hello world.” To do this, you need to add some dependencies to the <code>pom.xml</code> file and add the GraphQL feature to the <code>server.xml</code> file. The <code>pom.xml</code> file is Maven’s dependency management file. The <code>server.xml</code> file (<code>src/main/liberty/config/server.xml</code>) is the MicroProfile configuration file.</p>

<p>Add two dependencies to the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;microprofile-graphql-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;

  &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.18.16&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>The first dependency is the MicroProfile GraphQL dependency. The second adds Lombok to the project. Lombok is a collection of helper annotations that will save you (or me, really, since you’d just be copy and pasting them) from the tedious task of writing a bunch of getters, setters, and constructors.</p>

<p>You also need to make two additions to the <code>src/main/liberty/config/server.xml</code> file.</p>

<p>First, add the GraphQL feature to the <code>&lt;featureManager&gt;</code> section.</p>

   <code>&lt;featureManager&gt;
    ...
    &lt;feature&gt;mpGraphQL-1.0&lt;/feature&gt;  &lt;!-- ADD ME --&gt;
&lt;/featureManager&gt;
</code>   

<p>Second, add the following line under the top-level <code>&lt;server&gt;</code> element (this just allows us to log from the app and have it shown on the console).</p>

   <code>&lt;server&gt;
    ...
    &lt;logging consoleLogLevel="INFO" /&gt;
&lt;/server&gt;
</code>   

 Implement GraphQL Hello World 

<p>Create a new Java file, <code>HelloGraphQl.java</code>. This is a simple GraphQL resource controller.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloGraphQl.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.GraphQLApi;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.Query;

@GraphQLApi
public class HelloGraphQl {

    @Query("hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello world!";
    }

}
</code>   

<p>MicroProfile and OpenLiberty have a feature that detects changes and code and attempts to reload the application quickly. However, this feature did not always work for me and often resulted in errors on subsequent GraphQL queries. I found it better just to stop and restart after changes.</p>

<p>Stop your server if you haven’t, using <code>Control-c</code>. Start it again.</p>

   <code>mvn liberty:run
</code>   

<p>Wait for it to finish loading. Test your new GraphQL endpoint.</p>

   <code>http POST :9080/graphql query='{ hello }'


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en-US
Content-Length: 33
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:57:01 GMT
X-Powered-By: Servlet/4.0

{
    "data": {
        "hello": "Hello world!"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Notice that the REST endpoint was at <code>/data/hello</code>, and this endpoint is at <code>/graphql</code>. Notice also that you’re using the GraphQL query language, not making a REST request. You’re also making a POST request instead of a GET.</p>

<p>Explaining GraphQL query language is beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you’d like to learn more about it, take a look at <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">the documentation on the project website</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this request is trivial. To do something more interesting, you’re going to create a GraphQL endpoint that returns surf forecasts. The forecasts are randomly generated, but the controller will accept a parameter and allow you to use the GraphQL query language to choose the data you’d like returned.</p>

 Generate Surf Forecasts Using GraphQL 

<p>First, create the <code>SurfController</code> class that will expose the <code>surfReport</code> query.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SurfController.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.GraphQLApi;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.Name;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql.Query;


@GraphQLApi
public class SurfController {

    @Query("surfReport")
    public SurfConditions getSurfReport(@Name("location") String location) {
        return SurfConditions.getRandom(location);
    }
    
}
</code>   

<p>Second, create the <code>SurfConditions</code> data model.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SurfConditions.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import lombok.Data;
import lombok.ToString;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@Data @ToString
public class SurfConditions {

    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger("SurfConditions");

    private final String location;
    private final int chanceOfRainPercent;
    private final double windKnots;
    private final String windDirection;
    private final int swellHeight;
    private final int swellPeriodSeconds;

    static SurfConditions getRandom(String location) {

        List&lt;String&gt; windDirections = Arrays.asList("S", "SW", "W", "NW", "N", "NE", "E", "SE");
        Random rand = new Random();
        String windDirection = windDirections.get(rand.nextInt(windDirections.size()));
        int chanceOfRain = (int)(Math.random() * 100);
        double windKnots = (Math.random() * (40 - 5)) + 5;
        int swellHeight = (int)((Math.random() * (25 - 2)) + 2);
        int swellPeriodSeconds = (int)((Math.random() * (15 - 8)) + 8);

        SurfConditions report = new SurfConditions(
                location,  // just the input location
                chanceOfRain,  // random int between 0-100
                windKnots,  // random double between 5-40
                windDirection,  // random direction
                swellHeight,  // random int between 2-14
                swellPeriodSeconds // random int between 8-15
        );

        LOG.info(report.toString());

        return report;
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Much of this class’s complexity is in the <code>getRandom()</code> method that returns a random surf forecast, which is just a convenience method for this tutorial. In a real situation, you’d likely be querying a database instead of generating random forecasts.</p>

<p>If you strip that out (see below), you’ll see that your model class is really just a Java class with some properties defined. Two Lombok annotations (<code>@Data @ToString</code>) are used to generate all of the necessary getters, setters, constructors, and the <code>toString()</code> method.</p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import lombok.Data;
import lombok.ToString;

@Data @ToString
public class SurfConditions {

    private final String location;
    private final int chanceOfRainPercent;
    private final double windKnots;
    private final String windDirection;
    private final int swellHeight;
    private final int swellPeriodSeconds;

}
</code>   

<p>Stop the server with <code>Control-c</code> and re-run.</p>

   <code>mvn liberty:run
</code>   

<p>Try a couple of queries. Play around. Notice that you can specify a different location parameter in the search query. You can also specify which return values you need. In more complex situations, this is a great way to reduce network traffic.</p>

   <code>http POST :9080/graphql query='{ surfReport(location:"Texas") {location,chanceOfRainPercent,windKnots,windDirection,swellHeight,swellPeriodSeconds} }'


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

{
    "data": {
        "surfReport": {
            "chanceOfRainPercent": 9,
            "location": "Texas",
            "swellHeight": 22,
            "swellPeriodSeconds": 8,
            "windDirection": "E",
            "windKnots": 14.561441929794396
        }
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>http POST :9080/graphql query='{ surfReport(location:"Oregon") {windKnots,swellHeight,swellPeriodSeconds} }'


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

{
    "data": {
        "surfReport": {
            "swellHeight": 14,
            "swellPeriodSeconds": 13,
            "windKnots": 32.28906559297788
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>You’ve now got a working MicroProfile GraphQL app. The next step is to use Okta to add JWT authentication to your application.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect Application 

<p>You should have already signed up for a free developer account with Okta. If you haven’t, please do so now by going to their website: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">https://developer.okta.com/signup</a>. You’re going to use Okta to add JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to your app.</p>

<p>TIP: You can also install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to create an account.</p>

<p>Okta implements two standards that allow you to do this. First, Okta is an OAuth 2.0 provider. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization standard, meaning that it enables your application to verify user permissions. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication standard, meaning that it allows your application to verify the identity of the user or client service. Together they provide a full specification for authentication and authorization–everything you need for web security. As you will see, Okta implements this standard in a way that allows you to quickly and easily integrate these technologies into your application.</p>

<p>In this particular example, you’re implementing a web service that uses a JSON Web Token to verify the identity of web clients making requests. Each request is required to contain a valid web token in an authentication header. The web token will be issued by Okta (you’ll do this manually via the OIDC Debugger) and will also be validated by Okta using the MicroProfile JWT feature.</p>

<p>If you’re using the Okta CLI, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Then select 1 for Web, 2 for Other, and enter <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> as the redirect URI. If you prefer to add a new application in your browser, continue following the steps below.</p>

<p>Open the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta developer dashboard</a> and log in.</p>

<p>Once you’ve logged in, you may need to click on the Admin button to get to the developer dashboard.</p>

<p>From the top menu, click on the Applications item, and then click the green Add Application button.</p>

<p>Select Web as the platform and click Next.</p>

<p>Give the app a name. I named mine “MicroProfile”, but you can call yours whatever you like.</p>

<p>Under Login redirect URIs, add a new URI: <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p>You configured Okta as an OAuth 2.0 OIDC provider. Take note of the Client ID because you’ll need it in a moment.</p>

 Add Groups and UPN Claims to Default Authorization Server 

<p>To enable role-based authorization, as well as to meet MicroProfile’s requirements for the JWT, you need to add two claims mappings to your default Okta authorization server: a groups claim and a upn claim. The groups claim mapping is what maps Okta’s groups to the role-based authorization in MicroProfile. MicroProfile requires the upn claim, and you’ll get an invalid token error without it. This is the “user principal name” as defined in <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/september/article2.php">the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>From the Okta developer dashboard’s top menu, go to API and select Authorization Servers.</p>

<p>Click on the default server.</p>

<p>Select the Claims tab.</p>

<p>Click Add Claim.</p>

 
   Name: <code>groups</code> 
   Include in token type: <code>Access Token</code> <code>Always</code> 
   Value type: <code>Groups</code> 
   Filter: <code>Matches regex</code> <code>.*</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Next, add a upn claim.</p>

<p>Click Add Claim.</p>

 
   Name: <code>upn</code> 
   Include in token type: <code>Access Token</code> <code>Always</code> 
   Value type: <code>Expression</code> 
   Value: <code>user.email</code> 
 

<p>Click Create.</p>

 Generate a JSON Web Token 

<p>Every request to the secured API will require a valid JWT. Typically, the JWT is generated when a user signs in via a client application. In this case, there is no client application. Instead, you are going to use the OpenID Connect Debugger to generate a token. This web application allows you to perform a request for a JWT against Okta servers and inspect the results.</p>

<p>Open <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">https://oidcdebugger.com</a>.</p>

<p>Your Authorization URI is based on your developer account URI and will look like<br>
<code>https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. However, you need to replace the <code>dev-123456</code> with your own URI (just look at your dashboard URI).</p>

<p>The Redirect URI stays the same. This is the URI you entered into the Okta OIDC application settings.</p>

<p>Copy and paste the Client ID from the Okta OIDC application into the Client ID field.</p>

<p>The State parameter can be any value but cannot be empty. This is used in production to help protect against cross-site forgery requests.</p>

<p>Response type should be <code>code</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and click Send Request.</p>

<p>You should see a success screen with an authorization code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can use HTTPie to exchange this authorization code for an actual token.  Fill in the values in brackets with your values: the authorization code, your Okta domain, your OIDC app client ID, and your OIDC app client secret.</p>

   <code>http -f https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token \
grant_type=authorization_code \
code={yourAuthCode} \
client_id={clientId} \
client_secret={clientSecret} \
redirect_uri=https://oidcdebugger.com/debug
</code>   

<p>You should get a lengthy response that looks like the following (with sections omitted for brevity and clarity).</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
...

{
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJBX05XeGVXcVdrNG5pUjBFWlJnbWg5X3JJa...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJBX05XeGVXcVdrNG5pUjBFWlJnbWg5X3JJa1Q3...",
    "scope": "openid",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
</code>   

<p>To inspect the JWT, copy the access token value and go to <a href="https://token.dev/">token.dev</a>. Paste the value in the JWT String field.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll see something like the following for the JWT Payload.</p>

   <code>{
  "ver": 1,
  "jti": "AT.H_Mdj-ejg9RZycCk1Dury7Cuh34gQBsIUrsxBqPmfV4",
  "iss": "https://dev-447850.okta.com/oauth2/default",
  "aud": "api://default",
  "iat": 1610043537,
  "exp": 1610047137,
  "cid": "0oa1mpynrqj5XGGgS4x7",
  "uid": "00u133jktIYEgC5ZR4x6",
  "scp": [
    "openid"
  ],
  "sub": "andrew.hughes@email.com",
  "upn": "andrew.hughes@email.com",
  "groups": [
    "Everyone"
  ]
}
</code>   

<p>Two things to notice: first, the <code>upn</code> claim is one of the claims you added. The MicroProfile JWT specification requires this. If it’s not there, go back and add the claim again. It won’t work without it. Second, notice the <code>groups</code> claim. This will contain an entry for every group (or role) of which the user is a member.</p>

<p>Groups and roles are not really the same thing (in short: groups are groups of users, and roles are collections of permissions). I mention this because, in a moment, you’ll use an annotation called <code>@RolesAllowed</code> to specify <code>Everyone</code> as the allowed role. <code>Everyone</code> is Okta’s default group, of which all users are a member. For the purposes of this tutorial, we don’t care if it’s a group or a role, just that it’s a string passed from Okta through the groups claim that specifies an authorization. It needs to be there for the rest of the tutorial to work. If it’s not, go back and check the groups claim in your default Okta auth server.</p>

<p>Save the access token to a shell variable.</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJBX05XeGVXcVdrNG5pUjBFWlJnbWg5X3JJ...
</code>   

<p>Leave this shell open. You’ll use it in a moment to make an authenticated request. First, you need to configure MicroProfile to use JWT authentication.</p>

 Configure MicroProfile for JWT Authentication 

<p>In <code>src/main/liberty/config/server.xml</code>, you need to replace these lines:</p>

   <code>&lt;!-- This is the keystore that will be used by SSL and by JWT. --&gt;
&lt;keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" location="public.jks" type="JKS" password="atbash" /&gt;

&lt;!-- The MP JWT configuration that injects the caller's JWT into a ResourceScoped bean for inspection. --&gt;
&lt;mpJwt id="jwtUserConsumer" keyName="theKeyId" audiences="targetService" issuer="${jwt.issuer}"/&gt;
</code>   

<p>With these lines:</p>

   <code>&lt;!-- Import default Java trust store for root certs --&gt;
&lt;ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" trustStoreRef="defaultTrustStore" /&gt;
&lt;keyStore id="defaultTrustStore" location="${javaKeystoreLocation}" type="JKS" password="changeit" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Configure MicroProfile JWT Auth --&gt;
&lt;mpJwt
    id="myMpJwt"
    jwksUri="https://${oktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/keys"
    issuer="https://${oktaDomain}/oauth2/default"
    audiences="api://default"
/&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add two properties to your <code>pom.xml</code>. You will need to add your own Okta domain for <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code>. For example, <code>dev-6974382.okta.com</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;properties&gt;
  ...
  &lt;liberty.var.javaKeystoreLocation&gt;${env.JAVA_HOME}/lib/security/cacerts&lt;/liberty.var.javaKeystoreLocation&gt;
  &lt;liberty.var.oktaDomain&gt;{yourOktaDomain}&lt;/liberty.var.oktaDomain&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>server.xml</code> file, you did two important things. First, you configured MicroProfile to use the default Java trust store and key store. You have to do this because when the app wants to verify the JWT, it will try and connect to the default Okta auth server via TLS/SSL. For the TLS handshake to work, MicroProfile needs a key store with root certificates. The default Java key store has the root certificates already installed. Another option would be to use your own key store and import Okta’s certificates into the trust store.</p>

<p>The second thing happening in the <code>server.xml</code> changes is that MicroProfile JWT (<code>&lt;mpJwt&gt;&lt;/mpJwt&gt;</code>) is configured to use Okta to verify the JWTs.</p>

<p>Two values are used in <code>server.xml</code>: the okta domain and the location of the Java key store. However, these values are placed in <code>pom.xml</code> and passed to <code>server.xml</code> as system properties.</p>

<p>To add security to your GraphQL controller, add the <code>@RolesAllowed</code> annotation to the <code>getSurfReport()</code> method in the <code>SurfController</code> class.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SurfController.java</code></p>
   <code>import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;

@GraphQLApi
public class SurfController {

    @RolesAllowed("Everyone")  // &lt;-- ADD ME
    @Query("surfReport")
    public SurfConditions getSurfReport(@Name("location") String location) {
        return SurfConditions.getRandom(location);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>With that annotation, only users or clients that are members of the <code>Everyone</code> group will be able to access the query.</p>

<p>Stop the server with <code>Control-c</code> and re-run.</p>

   <code>mvn liberty:run
</code>   

<p>Go back to the shell where you saved your token. First, try a request without using the token.</p>

   <code>http POST :9080/graphql query='{ surfReport(location:"Texas") {windKnots,swellHeight,swellPeriodSeconds} }'

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...
</code>   

<p>Now, use your token.</p>

   <code>http POST :9080/graphql query='{ surfReport(location:"Texas") {location,chanceOfRainPercent,windKnots,windDirection,swellHeight,swellPeriodSeconds} }' \
"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>You should be able to query the GraphQL server successfully.</p>

 All’s Well That Ends Authenticated 

<p>In this tutorial, you created a simple sample web application using MicroProfile and OpenLiberty. You first saw how to easily bootstrap a project using the MicroProfile starter before configuring the project to use GraphQL. Next, you secured the application using JWT authentication.</p>

<p>You can find the source for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-microprofile-graphql-example">oktadeveloper/okta-microprofile-graphql-example</a> repository.</p>

   GraphQL is an incredibly powerful query language for APIs that helps improve performance and extensibility in your APIs. The query language is designed to allow developers to query exactly the data they need. As your API grows in size and scope, current consumers are unaffected by changes since their queries should return the same data. 

 Apollo Client is a state management library for JavaScript

  <p>GraphQL is an incredibly powerful query language for APIs that helps improve performance and extensibility in your APIs. The query language is designed to allow developers to query exactly the data they need. As your API grows in size and scope, current consumers are unaffected by changes since their queries should return the same data.</p>

<p>Apollo Client is a state management library for JavaScript. It fits seamlessly into React applications and can handle fetching, caching, and modifying application data.</p>

<p>In this application, you will create a small React application that uses Apollo Client to query a GraphQL API that contains the data for SpaceX’s launches. You will display an overview of launch histories to the user and allow the user to drill down into a specific launch. To secure the application you will use Okta’s <code>okta-react</code> library to make setting up your authentication easy.</p>

 Create your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you will need a free developer account from Okta. if you don’t have one you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up for one here.</a>. Once you have completed that navigate to your developer’s console and click on Applications and then Add Application. Select Single Page App and click Next.</p>

<p>Give your application a meaningful name. You will also need to change your URIs to localhost:3000 as this is the default in React.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Done. On the application management page, you will be presented with your Client id. Make note of this as you will need it in your application.</p>

 Create Your Apollo and React Application 

<p>Next, you will create your web application. Navigate to the parent directory where your application will be stored and use the command <code>npx create-react-app apollo-demo</code>. After your application is finished scaffolding you will need to install the required dependencies. First, you will be using bootstrap and react-bootstrap because it makes creating web pages simple.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
npm i react-bootstrap@1.4.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to get Okta’s core javascript and react packages. With these packages, setting up your authentication with Okta only takes a few short minutes.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.4.0
npm i @okta/okta-react@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>You will need the <code>graphql</code> and <code>apollo-client</code> packages to connect to the graphQL API that you will use for your data.</p>

   <code>npm i @apollo/client@3.3.4
npm i graphql@15.4.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will use dotenv to store your sensitive data during development.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>With dotenv installed, you can create a new file in the root of your application called .env and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code>   

<p>Now you want to start building your application by editing the <code>App.js</code> file. Open <code>App.js</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}&gt;
        &lt;AppWithRouterAccess /&gt;
      &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Most of this should look fairly familiar. You are importing the bootstrap <code>CSS</code> files at this level. You also need to instantiate your <code>apolloClient</code> and pass it into the <code>ApolloProvider</code> component that wraps <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code>. Per Apollo’s documentation, you should put the <code>ApolloProvider</code> as high up in your application as necessary so that all the children components can access it. The <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> contains the logic for implementing Okta and securing routes.</p>

<p>Create a new file in your <code>src</code> directory called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, SecureRoute, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home'
import Blastoff from './Pages/Blastoff'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
    const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/default'
    const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
    const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

    const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
        issuer: issuer,
        clientId: clientId,
        redirectUri: redirect
      });      

    return (
        &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;
            &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} &gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
            &lt;SecureRoute path='/Blastoff' component={Blastoff} /&gt;
            &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
        &lt;/Security&gt;
    );
};
export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>Here you are creating a new instance of <code>OktaAuth</code> and passing it into your <code>Security</code> component that is provided by Okta. The <code>SecureRoute</code> component is used to check if the user is logged in. If the user is not, they will be redirected to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>Now you can focus on creating your pages and components. First, add two new folders to your <code>src</code> directory; <code>Pages</code> and <code>Components</code>. In <code>Pages</code>, add a new file called <code>Home.jsx</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Link, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';

import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from 'react-bootstrap'


import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

const Home = () =&gt; {

  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  return (authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/Blastoff' }} /&gt; :

    &lt;Container&gt;

      &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

      &lt;Row&gt;

        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;BlastOff! &lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt; A Look at SpaceX Launch History&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;/br&gt;
          &lt;h5&gt;A React Demo Using &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferer" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/"&gt;Apollo Client &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secured With &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferer" href="https://www.okta.com/"&gt;Okta &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
          &lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer"&gt;GraphQL Data Available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;

      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

      &lt;Row &gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;Card style={{ width: '21.5em', margin: '0 auto' }}&gt;
            &lt;Card.Header&gt;
              Already have an Okta Account?
              &lt;/Card.Header&gt;
            &lt;Card.Body&gt;
              &lt;Link to='/Blastoff'&gt;Login Here&lt;/Link&gt;
            &lt;/Card.Body&gt;
          &lt;/Card&gt;

        &lt;/Col&gt;

      &lt;/Row&gt;

      &lt;footer className="text-muted text-center"&gt;
        &lt;div className="container"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A Small demo using &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferer" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/"&gt;Apollo Client &lt;/a&gt; Secured by &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferer" href="https://www.okta.com/"&gt;Okta &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/footer&gt;

    &lt;/Container&gt;
  );
};
export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This page serves two major needs. First, it provides a landing page for your users and gives some further reading about the technologies used on the site. Second, it contains a redirect to the <code>Blastoff</code> page if the user is already logged in. This second part isn’t strictly necessary but you can change the workflow if you feel so inclined.</p>

<p>Next, you can implement the code for the <code>Blastoff</code> page. Add a new file to your <code>Pages</code> directory called <code>Blastoff.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';

import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'

import Histories from '../Components/Histories';
import History from '../Components/History';

class Blastoff extends Component {

    constructor(props, context) {
        super(props, context);

        this.state = {
            loading: false,
            showHistory: false,
            shownHistoryId: -1
        }

        this.onHistorySelected = this.onHistorySelected.bind(this);
        this.onReturnToHistories = this.onReturnToHistories.bind(this);
    }

    onHistorySelected (id) {
        this.setState({
            showHistory: true,
            shownHistoryId: id
        });
    }

    onReturnToHistories () {
        this.setState({
            showHistory: false,
            shownHistoryId: -1
        });
    }

    render () {

        if (this.state.loading) {
            return &lt;Container&gt;
                &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;Loading, please wait.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;/Container&gt;
        }

        if (this.state.showHistory) {
            return (
                &lt;Container&gt;
                    &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
                    &lt;History id={this.state.shownHistoryId} onReturnToHistories={this.onReturnToHistories}&gt;&lt;/History&gt;
                &lt;/Container &gt;
            )
        }

        return (
            &lt;Container&gt;
                &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
                &lt;Histories onHistorySelected={this.onHistorySelected}&gt;&lt;/Histories&gt;
            &lt;/Container &gt;
        );
    }
}

export default Blastoff;
</code>   

<p>This page is the showcase of your application. Users will land on this page and be able to see all the detail your application offers.  It has two modes, one to show all the histories available and one to show the details on a specific history. When the user first lands on this page, you will display the <code>Histories</code> component. If the user clicks on the title of a launch they will be presented with the details of that launch on a different component.</p>

<p>Next, add a new file to your <code>Components</code> directory and add a file called <code>Histories.jsx</code>. The code for that component is as follows.</p>

   <code>import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'

function Histories ({ onHistorySelected }) {

    const HistoriesQuery = gql`{
            histories {
              id
              details
              links {
                article
              }
              flight {
                id
                mission_name
              }
            }
          }`;

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(HistoriesQuery);

    if (loading) {

        return (&lt;Container&gt;
            &lt;img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/3f1d85ab9951d0db65e797c7f40e89cc/tenor.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
        &lt;/Container&gt;);
    }
    else {
        return (
            &lt;Container&gt;
                &lt;table className="table table-striped"&gt;
                    &lt;thead&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;Mission Name&lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;Details&lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;Article&lt;/th&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;/thead&gt;
                    &lt;tbody&gt;
                        {data.histories.map((history, i) =&gt; {
                            return &lt;tr key={i}&gt;
                                &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="#" onClick={() =&gt; onHistorySelected(history.id)}&gt;{history.flight == null ? "Unnamed" : history.flight.mission_name}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
                                &lt;td&gt;{history.details}&lt;/td&gt;

                        })}
                    &lt;/tbody&gt;
                &lt;/table&gt;
            &lt;/Container&gt;
        )
    }
}

export default Histories;
</code>   

<p>This component does the heavy lifting for displaying the histories to the user. Since you are using the <code>useQuery</code> hook, you will need to use it in a React function component. From this hook, you can get the <code>loading</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>data</code> values. These allow you to build the component itself. If the data is still loading, you can present the user with a waiting gif of a classic space race moment. If there is an error you can display a brief error message. And once the data is returned, you can build a table with the data you wish to display to the user. Note here that the first column contains the <code>mission_name</code> and an <code>onClick</code> handler to tell the <code>Blastoff</code> page to load the detail.</p>

<p>For a detailed history, add a new file called <code>History.jsx</code> to the <code>Components</code> folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { Container, Row } from 'react-bootstrap'

function History ({ id, onReturnToHistories }) {

  const HistoryQuery = gql`         
          query history($historyId: ID!) {
                    history(id: $historyId) {
                      details

</code>   

<p>Again, you obtain the <code>loading</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>data</code> values from the <code>useQuery</code> hook, but this time you need a value for the <code>gql</code>. The reason is that you only want to get the data for one history. The <code>gql</code> itself is a little different as it fetches more data than the overview. This is one of the powerful features of graphQL, you only need to request the data you need which reduces the overhead.</p>

<p>Finally, in your components folder, add a file called <code>Header.jsx</code>. This file will provide links for your users as well as the logic for a login/logout button.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = () =&gt; {
    const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

    if (authState.isPending) {
        return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
    }

    const button = authState.isAuthenticated ?
        &lt;Button variant="secondary" onClick={() =&gt; { oktaAuth.signOut("/") }}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt; :
        &lt;Button variant="secondary" onClick={() =&gt; { oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect("/Blastoff") }}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;

    return (

        &lt;Navbar bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;

                &lt;/Form&gt;
            &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
        &lt;/Navbar&gt;

    );
};
export default Header;
</code>   

 Test Your Apollo and React Application 

<p>Your code is now complete. Use the command <code>npm run start</code> to start running your application. First, you will be shown the <code>Home</code> page. Click on either Login or Blastoff!. You will be presented with the Login screen hosted by Okta. Login in with your Okta account and you will be directed to the <code>Blastoff</code> page to review the launches from SpaceX.</p>

 Uncertainty remains under the continuous growth of Stablecoins, Regulatory restrictions and the open letter of&nbsp;Circle <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1999493307">https://bihu.com/article/1999493307</a></p><p>Original publish time: January 6,&nbsp;2021</p><p>Original author: Xiang Yao, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together, please feel free to leave suggestions.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $24.66 billion to $28.25 billion, a monthly average increase of&nbsp;11.5%.  Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, DAI, and BUSD increased by 1.850 billion, 940 million, 110 million, and 293 million, the circulation of the remaining stablecoins decreased slightly.  The circulation of USDT exceeded $20 billion, the circulation of USDC reached $4 billion, the circulation of BUSD approached $1&nbsp;billion.  Members of Congress proposed the STABLE Act, which is intended to regulate stablecoin-related behaviors, which has caused strong controversy.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(December 1, 2020, ~ December 31, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $2.99 billion to $28.25 billion. The average daily market capitalization in December was $26.63 billion, an increase of $2.758 billion from the past month. The figure below shows the monthly average change of the circulation of the stablecoin, that is, the daily average circulation in December minus the daily average in November.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Among them, the main growth comes from Tether. Tether has additionally issued a total of 1.850 billion, specifically 1.0 billion on Ethereum and 850 million on TRON. The circulation of USDC increased by 940 million, reaching $4 billion on December 31, 2020 (from the Circle official website), of which 3.913 billion was on Ethereum, and the rest was on Solana and Algorand. It needs to be emphasized that most media, including Forbes, only count data on Ethereum, which is not accurate. The market capitalization of the remaining stablecoins has not changed&nbsp;much.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Last month, the average daily active addresses of major stablecoins were 227,000, an increase of 0.12% from the past&nbsp;month.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of 2.50%. Among them, the growth rate of DAI is remarkable, from an average of 14,000 daily transactions to 48,300, an increase of&nbsp;45.2%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins increased by $903 million, an increase of&nbsp;18.32%.</p> 2. The boundaries of stablecoins continue to&nbsp;expand <p>The entire stablecoin and the ecology are still booming. The amount of funds has steadily increased, and the monthly supply of major stablecoins has increased to $3 billion, of which USDC has increased by $1 billion in one month, the total supply has reached $4 billion, and the total supply of BUSD has also approached $1 billion. The main body and platform are more abundant, the euro stablecoin EURB is launched on Stellar, and HUSD announced that it would be deployed on&nbsp;Nervos.</p> The supply of major stablecoins increased by $3 billion&nbsp;monthly <p>In December 2020, the supply of major stablecoins increased by $3 billion per month, of which the main contribution came from USDT and USDC ($18.50 and $940 million). The total supply of stablecoins reached $28.2 billion, doubling in 5&nbsp;months.</p> The Euro stablecoin EURB is launched on&nbsp;Stellar <p>On December 9, 2020, the Stellar official website <a href="https://stellar.org/press-releases/bitbond-and-bankhaus-von-der-heydt-issue-euro-stablecoin-eurb-on-the-stellar-network">announced</a> that the euro stablecoin EURB is launched. This is the first stablecoin directly issued by a banking institution on Stellar and the first issuance of this type of stablecoin in the market. The specific issuance method of EURB is that the blockchain technology service provider Bitbond provides operations such as the issuance and redemption of EURB on Stellar, while the euro is hosted by Bank von der Heydt. Philipp Doppelhammer, a member of BVDH, said that EURB would be integrated into DTransfer, a payment service based on Stellar provided by SatoshiPay.</p><p>Bitbond issued a Security Token approved by the BaFin in&nbsp;2019.</p> HUSD will be deployed on&nbsp;Nervos <p>On December 8, 2020, according to the <a href="https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/dollar-pegged-stablecoin-husd-is-coming-to-nervos-11e1b283ff37">official blog</a> of Nervos, the compliant stablecoin HUSD will be deployed on Nervos, becoming the first stablecoin collateralized by legal currency on Nervos, and Nervos will also become the first non-access blockchain deployed by HUSD outside of Ethereum.<br>HUSD Token is a compliant stablecoin issued by the financial technology startup Stable Universal in cooperation with Paxos Trust. It is anchored 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar assets are hosted by Paxos Trust and audited and certified by a top American audit&nbsp;company.</p> 3. The stablecoin bill caused controversy <p>Regulatory issues for stablecoins continue to heat up. On December 4, American Congressmen proposed the ‘STABLE Act’ to <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/media/press-releases/tlaib-garcia-and-lynch-stableact">regulate the issuance of stablecoins</a>, ‘protect consumers from risks brought by emerging digital payment tools’ and prevent the emergence and growth of abusive, opaque, and stablecoin-based shadow banking systems. The bill is pending approval, and there is no doubt that this proposal has caused a strong controversy in the cryptocurrency community.</p> The STABLE Act attempted to restrict stablecoins <p>According to <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/STABLEAct.pdf">documents</a> on the official website of the US Congress and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2020/12/09/cryptocurrency-legislation-is-on-the-rise--what-the-proposed-stable-act-could-mean-for-crypto/?sh=4632bd69633d">reports</a> from Forbes, the ‘STABLE Act’ contains the following content. First, the issuers of stablecoins need to comply with state laws or currency transfer laws; second, they must fully comply with existing banking regulations; besides, the issuers of stablecoins may not issue stablecoins until six months after obtaining approval from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC; finally, the issuers of stablecoins need to obtain FDIC insurance or directly deposit reserves with the Federal Reserve. The approach of the current issuers is to cooperate with FDIC-covered financial institutions.</p><p>The proposal is pending approval, and another report of Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/12/20/stable-coin-regulation-with-a-focus-on-the-stableact/?sh=7845a5cd3e5a">explains</a> it. The article believes that the current stablecoin ecosystem has two major risks. One is KYC/AML. Users holding stablecoins cannot belong to a forbidden set and should be associated with their identities to report to the tax system; the other is an equivalent Exchange relationship between stablecoins and the US dollar, which needs to be achieved through full reserves. This may be the motivation for congressmen to sponsor the&nbsp;bill.</p> Controversy continues in the cryptocurrency community <p>Although the bill has not yet been approved, it has undoubtedly caused controversy in the cryptocurrency community, especially from issuers of stablecoin. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on his <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1334277520695431169">personal Twitter</a> that the bill is a huge step backward in the innovation of digital currency in the United States and restricts the development of the blockchain and financial technology industries. He believes that the cryptocurrency industry is providing solutions that fundamentally improve the speed, availability, cost reduction, and efficiency of the U.S. and global payment and banking services and that Congress should support open innovation rather than forcing non-bank fintech companies to bear the huge regulatory burden from the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The technology and governance standards of stablecoins should be negotiated and new forms of regulatory regulations should be considered. Circle looks forward to constructive cooperation with federal agencies and the private sector will continue to innovate in this area. Besides, Jeremy Allaire also sent an <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/AllaireLetterUSTreasurySecretary.pdf">open letter</a> to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, stating the development status of USDC and offering a response to FinCEN’s proposed non-custodial wallet transaction reporting rules.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-seek-to-make-stablecoins-illegal-without-federal-approval">collation</a> of CoinTelegraph, other opinion leaders also expressed opposition. Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, said that ‘cryptographic currency reduces the cost of providing services to people who have historically been excluded from the banking sector. If the bill is introduced, service costs will increase, compliance will become more difficult, and will, in turn, put the cart before the horse’. Tyler Lindholm, a member of the House of Representatives of Wyoming believes that the bill violates the basic spirit of a decentralized system. The cryptocurrency industry has provided financial services for people without bank accounts, and centralized power is not suitable for a decentralized world.

DIDKit <p><a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/introducing-didkit-an-identity-toolkit-e0dfa292f53d">DIDKit </a>is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  Packaged DIDKit into an npm package so it can run on the backend for a Node.js application.  Started building DIDKit for WebAssembly, for use in web browsers.  Implemented did-tezos resolution layer 1 to support tz1/tz2/tz3 without the DID manager smart contract or off-chain updates  Implemented JSON-LD to RDF serialization to support arbitrary Linked Data verifiable credentials, with compile-time context&nbsp;loading.  Tested our implementation of JSON-LD to RDF serialization and JSON-LD Dataset normalization with W3C test suites, discovering and fixing bugs along the&nbsp;way.  We are increasing cryptographic agility so that the user can choose their own cryptographic function implementations.

Intake <p>Intake is a smarter onboarding tool for businesses via secure document collection and processing.

  <p>In today’s digital world, we no longer have to go to a branch office or ATM machine to do the majority of our banking. For the most part, consumers can manage all bank transactions from the comfort of their home on mobile devices, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, virtual banking has the potential to be so much more than just cashing checks. Many organizations around the world offer financially empowering services such as budgeting and saving plans to meet specific goals for their customers, like buying a house or car. However, there is quite a bit of work that goes on behind the scenes that dictates the success of such ventures, particularly from an identity standpoint.</p>

 Virtual Banking Industry Growth 

<p>The global digital banking platform market is on track to reach $9 billion <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165956-digital-transformation-in-the-banking-sector-is-being-driven-by-need-to-reduce-operational-costs-offer-better-user-experience-report/">by 2026</a>. The concept of the virtual bank is largely credited with beginning in Hong Kong, rapidly expanding to the rest of Asia and then the rest of the world. Every institution, from established global banks like <a href="https://www.us.hsbc.com/">HSBC</a> to start ups like <a href="https://mox.com/">Mox</a>, are getting into the game and rightfully so. Virtual banking is quickly growing globally due to the profitability of the business model. Zero infrastructure is needed to build or maintain branch offices as every service and transaction is conducted via devices like phones and tablets.</p>

<p>This model has indeed been quite profitable for many organizations around the globe, such as <a href="https://www.btpn.com/en/tentang-kami">PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk</a> (BTPN), one of Indonesia’s largest banks. BTPN was tasked with the challenge of reaching a population of over 250 million scattered over 17,000 islands. Virtually, of course. Creating branch offices on various islands was not financially feasible, so the organization virtually launched its <a href="https://www.jenius.com/">Jenius</a> application to serve its disparate consumer base. The bank quickly reached two million subscribers much faster than it had anticipated. As a result, BTPN has become much more profitable. Also, its flexible new system allows BTPN to introduce new services such as its recently released <a href="https://www.btpn.com/en/tentang-kami/segmen-usaha/btpn-wow-">Wow application</a>, which caters to small business owners.</p>

 Identity is Key in Digital Banking Experience&nbsp; 

<p>Some of the challenges during the shift to virtual banking include the need for a technology solution that allows for secure and quick onboarding of new customers and businesses that delivers an exceptional digital experience throughout the customer lifecycle. Due to these factors, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity</a> plays a critical role in the success of virtual banking. Banks need to understand who their users are, which devices they are using and what their preferences are in order to offer consumer-friendly, personalized services. Plus, all of this needs to be accomplished in a secure and frictionless manner, minimizing the number of clicks and logins, while also connecting to downstream apps and services like credit cards and loan offerings.</p>

 The Future of Digital Banking 

<p>Mobile technology has opened the door for innovation in banking and personal finance management. For example, with AI-enabled apps, banks can offer consumer analytics, reminders and personalized advice. It is important to understand though, that none of this would be possible without the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">backend identity management solutions</a> to support these mobile banking apps and services. With new <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> advancements such as biometric authentication, consumers can now access their banking information from anywhere with just the tap of their finger, while multifactor authentication (MFA) also remains a key element for logging into important financial apps and accounts. Looking ahead, brick-and-mortar banks are not going away anytime soon, but it’s clear that banks must adapt to consumer expectations quickly to keep from being outpaced in our rapidly digitizing world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zurich, Switzerland</p><p>Dock is excited to announce that ovrhd (pronounced ‘overhead’), winners of the prestigious <a href="https://solutions.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-the-hague-challenge-driving-adoption-of-living-labs/">Odyssey Momentum Hackathon</a>, has built their solution on top of Dock’s technology. Their winning hackathon entry, "Conscious Cities: Driving Adoption of Living Labs”, addressed the problem of overcrowding within the desirable district of Scheveningen in the City of The Hague in the Netherlands, seeking to rebalance the needs of residents, business owners, and government so that the area can be enjoyed to its fullest by everyone. </p><p><a href="https://ovrhd.nl/">ovrhd</a> used Dock’s open source software to implement and host a permissioned blockchain, as well as leverage Dock’s features such as creation of Decentralized Identities (DID) and the ability to issue verifiable credentials.

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Kaliya Young – consultant, conference organiser, author, activist. 
<p>In episode 36, Kaliya and Oscar discuss the long-running Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) that she co-founded, the effects of moving to virtual identity conferences in 2020, insights from Kaliya’s books – ‘The Domains of Identity’, newly published in 2020, and ‘A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity’ – plus some great tips for all business leaders on how to view the role of identity in their organisation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we may be selling self-sovereign identity all wrong. It should be infinitely scalable, low-cost federation. That’s really powerful!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaliya Young is the author of two books “<a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-pb">The Domains of Identity</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=guide+to+self+sovereign+identity&amp;qid=1601333817&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>”.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, she has been working to catalyse the creation of a layer of identity for people based on open standards. She co-founded the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) in 2005 to bring together technologists who want to see decentralised identity come into being. In the fifteen years their community has been meeting, they have created standards being used all over the internet, like OpenID Connect and OAuth. In 2012 she was recognised as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>The next IIW is in April. Sign up on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxii-32-2021a-tickets-131551119941">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Kaliya is widely recognised for her community leadership. She travels to Africa and Asia at least once a year to ensure the development of person-centric identity is truly global and inclusive. Most recently, she co-founded <a href="https://humanfirst.tech/">HumanFirst.Tech</a> with Shireen Mitchell, a project focused on creating space for diverse voices and building a more inclusive industry.</p>
<p>In 2009, she was named one of Fast Company’s Most Influential Women in Technology.</p>

 Having a dedicated part of a mobile app for authorized users is a must for a modern-day app. Users want to have a personalized experience with the apps they love. They expect to seamlessly use services on different devices and platforms. And, most of all, they want to be sure that their personal data is secure.

<p>Having a dedicated part of a mobile app for authorized users is a must for a modern-day app. Users want to have a personalized experience with the apps they love. They expect to seamlessly use services on different devices and platforms. And, most of all, they want to be sure that their personal data is secure.</p>
 
 
<p>Implementing a secure login process on Android can be challenging to achieve since many different moving parts need to be working in sync. On the Android side, you need to create a friendly login UI, communicate with a back-end service, securely persist the user data on the device, and maintain that data since the user expects to go through the login process only once. On top of that, you need to have a back-end app that supports the login features in the most secure way possible.</p>
 
 
<p>Here is where the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android">Okta OIDC SDK</a> comes to the rescue! It’s a mobile SDK developed by industry-leading security experts, designed to provide a simple way for your users to log in into your app. This is done by using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), which are the security industry’s standards for authorization and authentication. A fun guide to these technologies can be found in <a>An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>This post will show you how easy it is to set up the Okta OIDC SDK on Android and leave you with a working app that allows users to securely login!</p>

 Create an Android Login Application 
 
 
<p>To begin, create a new Android app. It will consist of three screens:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Splash screen where you figure out if the user is already logged in or not.</p>
 
 
<p>Login screen.</p>
 
 
<p>Home screen, which is only accessible to the logged-in users.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to download and install the latest version of <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> (v4.1.1 at the time of this writing).</p>
 
 
<p>Next, launch the app and navigate to File → New…​ → New Project…​. Then, create an "Empty Activity" for "Phone and Tablet." You should now see a screen similar to this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Change your application name and add the right package name, set the minimum SDK to API 23, and click Finish to create the project.</p>
 
 
 Add the Okta Android OIDC SDK 
 
<p>Android apps use <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> as their build tool. To add the Okta OIDC SDK as a dependency to your project, you will need to modify the app module’s <code>build.gradle</code> file:</p>
 
 
<p>You need to add the right auth redirect scheme for your Okta app and add the Okta library as a dependency. Make sure the <code>applicationId</code> matches what you used when creating your app.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'
    id 'kotlin-android'
}

1
The redirect URI for the application you created in your Okta Developer Console.


2
We are using a view binding feature to interact with our views. More information can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding">here</a>.


3
Okta OIDC libraries require Java 1.8 compatibility.


4
Add the dependency required for the Okta OIDC library.


 
 
 
 
<p>Sync the project with Gradle files by clicking the File → Sync Project with Gradle Files, so the Okta dependency gets downloaded.</p>
 
 
 
 Install the Okta CLI 
 
<p>Getting started with Okta is made quite straightforward with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. It’s a tool that makes creating an Okta account and an Okta application a breeze!</p>
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p>
 
 
 MacOS (via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>) 
 
 
 <code>brew install --cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is a package manager for macOS.



 
 
 
 Linux (via Flatpak) 
 
 
 <code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install com.okta.developer.CLI
alias okta="flatpak run com.okta.developer.CLI"</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> is a utility for software deployment and package management for Linux.



 
 
 
 Windows (via Chocolatey) 
 
 
 <code>choco install okta --version=0.7.1</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is a package manager for Windows.



 
 
<p>If you don’t want to use a package manager, you can install the Okta CLI with curl and bash.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Register Your Android Application 
 
<p>To create an Okta developer account, simply run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta register</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You will be prompted with a few questions:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>➜  okta register
First name: Dino
Last name: Bikic
Email address: ******@*****.***

 Create an Okta OIDC App 
 
<p>To create a new Okta OIDC app, run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta apps create</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You will be prompted with a few questions:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>➜  okta apps create
Application name [dbikic]: Android Login (1)
Type of Application
(The Okta CLI only supports a subset of application types and properties):
&gt; 1: Web
&gt; 2: Single Page App
&gt; 3: Native App (mobile)  (2)
&gt; 4: Service (Machine-to-Machine)

Okta application configuration:
okta.oauth2.issuer: https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id: ********************  (5)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Name your Okta app.


2
Native app (mobile) is the option to select for Android applications.


3
Press enter for the default value. You will need this value for the Okta library setup.


4
Press enter for the default value. You will need this value for the Okta library setup.


5
You will need this ID for the initialization of the Okta library in your application.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create an Android Application Class 
 
 
<p>In the root folder of your app’s package (in the provided example, that’s the folder <code>app/src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample</code>) create a Kotlin application class named`OktaLoginApplication`.</p>
 
 






The <code>Application</code> class is the entry point of your app and is used to maintain the global state of the application. The most common use for it is to initialize the third-party libraries in its <code>onCreate()</code> method. More info about it can be found in <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application">Android’s official documentation</a>.



 
 
<p>For now, just create the class and make it extend the <code>Application</code> class from the Android framework.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample (1)

import android.app.Application

class OktaLoginApplication : Application()</code> 
 
 
 


1
Update the package to match the one you set when creating the project.


 
 
 
 
<p>After creating the application class, you need to reference it in your <code>app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;

  &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;    (1)

  &lt;application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:name=".OktaLoginApplication"  (2)
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
    android:supportsRtl="true"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.OktaLoginExample" /&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>Okta OIDC SDK</code> needs internet permission to communicate with the back-end.


2
Reference the application class you created in the previous step.


 
 
 
 






<code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> is an essential file for an app that contains basic info about the app’s name, the package name, permissions, activities, and many other things. More information about it can be found in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro">official documentation</a>.



 
 
 
 
 Manage Authentication with a Manager Class 
 
 
<p>When adding third-party libraries to your codebase, it’s usually a good idea to create a wrapper class that will hide the actual usage. Reasons for this include:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Reusing of the common interaction with the libraries.</p>
 
 
<p>You can define all the library interactions in an interface and provide the actual implementation with dependency injection throughout your app.</p>
 
 
<p>Everything related to that library is in one place. Replacing the library with a different one is easy as you only need to change the wrapper class.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Because the above, create a class called <code>OktaManager</code> in the root package. This class will be used in all the screens you create:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Context
import com.okta.oidc.*
import com.okta.oidc.clients.sessions.SessionClient
import com.okta.oidc.clients.web.WebAuthClient
import com.okta.oidc.net.response.UserInfo
import com.okta.oidc.storage.security.DefaultEncryptionManager
import com.okta.oidc.util.AuthorizationException

class OktaManager(applicationContext: Context) {

    /**
     * Authorization client using chrome custom tab as a user agent.
     */
    private var webAuth: WebAuthClient (1)

    /**
     * The authorized client to interact with Okta's endpoints.
     */
    private var sessionClient: SessionClient (2)

    init {
        val config = OIDCConfig.Builder()
            .clientId("********************") (3)
            .discoveryUri("https://dev-123456.okta.com") (4)
            .redirectUri("com.okta.dev-123456:/callback") (5)
            .endSessionRedirectUri("com.okta.dev-123456:/") (6)
            .scopes("openid", "profile", "offline_access")
            .create()
        webAuth = Okta.WebAuthBuilder()
            .withConfig(config)
            .withContext(applicationContext)
            .withCallbackExecutor(null)
            .withEncryptionManager(DefaultEncryptionManager(applicationContext))
            .setRequireHardwareBackedKeyStore(true)  (7)
            .create()
        sessionClient = webAuth.sessionClient
    }

    fun isAuthenticated(): Boolean {
        return sessionClient.isAuthenticated
    }

    fun registerWebAuthCallback(callback: ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt;, activity: Activity) {
        webAuth.registerCallback(callback, activity)
    }

    fun registerUserProfileCallback(callback: RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt;) {
        sessionClient.getUserProfile(callback)
    }

    fun signIn(activity: Activity, payload: AuthenticationPayload) {
        webAuth.signIn(activity, payload)
    }

    fun signOut(activity: Activity, callback: RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt;) {
        webAuth.signOut(activity, callback)
    }

    fun clearUserData() {
        sessionClient.clear()
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>private lateinit var webAuth: WebAuthClient</code> is a reference to the web client you will invoke to log in.


2
<code>private lateinit var sessionClient: SessionClient</code> refers to the session you can use to conduct multiple operations after logging in, such as getting the user’s profile, revoking the authentication token, refreshing the authentication token, etc.


3
Replace with your client ID.


4
Replace with your discovery URL.


5
Replace with your redirect URL.


6
Replace with your end session redirect URL.


7
<code>setRequireHardwareBackedKeyStore(true)</code> forces the app to require a device with encryption capabilities. This is the default configuration for Okta OIDC, and it’s considered the best practice. If you want to run this code in an emulator, though, you can temporarily set it to <code>false</code>.


 
 
 
 






Make sure to use the values you received when completing the <a>Create an Okta OIDC App</a> step.



 
 
<p>The last step of the setup stage will be to initialize the <code>OktaManager</code>. Remember the empty <code>OktaLoginApplication</code> class? Now you need to modify it to initialize the manager when the app is created.</p>

class OktaLoginApplication : Application() {

    lateinit var oktaManager: OktaManager

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        oktaManager = OktaManager(this)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now, let’s create the screens.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add an Android Splash Screen 
 
 
<p>The purpose of a splash screen is to initialize all the applications' dependencies and prepare the app for usage. You’ll use it to figure out if the user is authenticated and decide which screen to show next: the login screen or the home screen.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a <code>SplashActivity</code> class in the root package.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui.LoginActivity

class SplashActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    (1)
    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        if (oktaManager.isAuthenticated()) {
            navigateToHome()
        } else {
            navigateToLogin()
        }
    }

    private fun navigateToHome() {
        // todo implement
    }

    private fun navigateToLogin() {
        startActivity(Intent(this, LoginActivity::class.java)) (2)
        finish()
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
For simplicity, the instance of the <code>OktaManager</code> class is in the application class so that it can be easily accessed from all the activities. The real-world solution here would be to use dependency injection and inject the instance class.


2
Ignore the unresolved reference error for now because we will add the missing class in the next step.


 
 
 
 
<p>Register the activity in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;

  &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;

  &lt;application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:name=".OktaLoginApplication"
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
    android:supportsRtl="true"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.OktaLoginExample"&gt;

    &lt;activity
      android:name=".SplashActivity"&gt;
      &lt;intent-filter&gt;  (1)
        &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
        &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
      &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/activity&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
This intent filter specifies that the <code>SplashActivity</code> is the first activity that will be shown when the app is launched


 
 
 
 
<p>This class won’t compile just yet. You’ll need to create <code>HomeActivity</code> and <code>LoginActivity</code> classes before it does.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Build an Android Login Screen 
 
 
<p>Now, let’s do the <code>LoginActivity</code>! First, create a simple layout with a button in <code>app/src/main/res/layout/activity_login.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:background="@color/white"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".LoginActivity"&gt;

  &lt;Button
    android:id="@+id/signInButton"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_margin="40dp"
    android:text="Sign in"
    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent" /&gt;

&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create the <code>LoginActivity</code> class in a new <code>ui</code> package:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.okta.oidc.*
import com.okta.oidc.AuthorizationStatus.*
import com.okta.oidc.util.AuthorizationException
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.OktaLoginApplication
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.OktaManager
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.databinding.ActivityLoginBinding

class LoginActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityLoginBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityLoginBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        setupOktaCallback()
        setupViews()
    }

    private fun setupOktaCallback() {
        oktaManager.registerWebAuthCallback(getAuthCallback(), this)  (1)
    }

    private fun setupViews() {
        binding.signInButton.setOnClickListener {
            val payload = AuthenticationPayload.Builder().build()
            oktaManager.signIn(this, payload)  (2)
        }
    }

    private fun getAuthCallback(): ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: AuthorizationStatus) {  (3)
                when (result) {
                    AUTHORIZED -&gt; navigateToHome()
                    SIGNED_OUT -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Signed out")
                    CANCELED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Canceled")
                    ERROR -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Error")
                    EMAIL_VERIFICATION_AUTHENTICATED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Email verification authenticated")
                    EMAIL_VERIFICATION_UNAUTHENTICATED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Email verification unauthenticated")
                }
            }

            override fun onCancel() {
                Log.d("LoginActivity", "Canceled")
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("LoginActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    private fun navigateToHome() {
        // todo implement
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Register the auth callback with the <code>OktaManager</code>.


2
Call the sign-in method when the button is clicked.


3
The result is an <code>AuthorizationStatus</code> object. With a simple <code>when</code> expression we can quickly figure out the status type and access its members if needed.


 
 
 
 
<p>And register it in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;application
    ... &gt;
    ...
    &lt;activity
      android:name=".ui.LoginActivity"
      android:theme="@style/Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar" /&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The purpose of the <code>LoginActivity</code> is to try to authenticate the user with Okta when the login button is pressed. To achieve that, you need to register the web auth callback with the Okta OIDC SDK, and call the <code>signIn()</code> method.</p>
 
 
<p>This is enough for the SDK to open a custom Chrome tab with the login screen of the Okta application. Users input their credentials into the form, and when the process is finished, the appropriate method of your auth callback will be called. This allows you to gracefully handle the possible errors or handle the login success, which is, in this case, navigating to the <code>HomeActivity</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create an Android Home Screen 
 
 
<p><code>HomeActivity</code> is the part of your app which can be accessed only by authorized users. In this example, you can fetch the user details, display the user name on the UI, and sign the user out of the app. First, create the layout file in <code>res/layout/activity_home.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/userLabel"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:textSize="22sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Hello, user!" /&gt;

  &lt;Button
    android:id="@+id/signOutButton"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_margin="40dp"
    android:text="Log out"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create the <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity

    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityHomeBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityHomeBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)

        oktaManager.registerUserProfileCallback(getUserProfileCallback()) (1)
        binding.signOutButton.setOnClickListener {
            oktaManager.signOut(this, getSignOutCallback()) (2)
        }
    }

    private fun getSignOutCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: Int) {
                oktaManager.clearUserData() (3)
                val intent = Intent(this@HomeActivity, LoginActivity::class.java) (4)
                intent.flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP (5)
                startActivity(intent)
                finish()
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    private fun getUserProfileCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: UserInfo) {
                binding.userLabel.text = "Hello, ${result["preferred_username"]}!" (6)
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Register the user profile callback with the <code>OktaManager</code>.


2
Sign out from the app on the sign out button.


3
After the user is successfully logged out from Okta, clear the user’s data.


4
Navigate the user back to the <code>LoginActivity</code> after they sign out.


5
This flag makes sure that all the back stack activities are cleared and that the <code>LoginActivity</code> will be the only activity in the memory.


6
You have fetched the user info successfully! You can check which fields you received <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#response-example-success-5">here</a>.


 
 
 
 
<p>And register it in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;application
    ... &gt;
    ...
    &lt;activity
      android:name=".ui.HomeActivity"
      android:theme="@style/Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar" /&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can now implement the empty method <code>navigateToHome()</code> in both <code>SplashActivity</code> and <code>LoginActivity</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui.HomeActivity

...

private fun navigateToHome() {
    startActivity(Intent(this, HomeActivity::class.java))
    finish()
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Android Application 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to run the application on an emulator or on a physical device, by pressing the play icon in the top right part of Android Studio. Your app and its login process should look similar to the video below:</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>What’s cool about the Okta OIDC SDK is that it also securely stores the user session to the app’s local storage and maintains its state for you. Instead of creating a custom user management system and handling multiple edge-cases that can happen in the real world, you can concentrate on spending your time building app features for your users.</p>
 
 
<p>You also implemented the logout flow, which is triggered by the user clicking the Log Out button:</p>
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Android and OIDC 
 
 
<p>This post showcased how easy it is to set up and use the Okta OIDC SDK for an Android app. The functionalities which the SDK brings to your app, like the OAuth 2.0 authorization and OpenID Connect authentication, are essential for a modern-day app with challenges like security and data privacy.</p>
 
 
<p>Creating a custom solution for security and privacy is challenging and time-consuming since the code on the mobile part is not enough, and you also need to have a back-end app that supports those features. Maintaining two applications can cause a lot of long-term work.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example">oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Although the example you created here does enough to satisfy the needs of most apps, the Okta OIDC SDK doesn’t stop there. The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android">Okta OIDC Android repository</a> contains a variety of ideas and suggestions to improve user experience such as:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Using your own OkHttp client.</p>
 
 
<p>Using a custom UI to log in.</p>
 
 
<p>Add a social login for accounts that include Google, Apple, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
 
 
<p>Biometric login, with Iris authentication, fingerprint authentication, PIN authentication, pattern authentication, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Having fine-grained control over session tokens' expiration and refresh.</p>
 
 
<p>Settings to handle preference of browser client for the authentication process.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This post has provided you with the foundations to set up a successful OIDC client. If you want to deepen your knowledge around modern authentication systems, check these additional resources on Android, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect:</p>

Here’s&nbsp;Greg:</p><blockquote>The ironic thing here is if you read what the mission is of the SEC, it’s to protect investors, to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation. If you go through each of those five things — is this protecting investors? Is this fair? Is this orderly? Is this efficient? Does this promote capital formation?

 Naast informatie uit overheidsbronnen kan nu ook banktransacties aangeleverd worden 



<p>Ockto stelt consumenten in staat om makkelijk en veilig persoonlijke gegevens bij verschillende overheidsbronnen op te halen en te delen met financieel dienstverleners. Inmiddels is de Ockto dataset uit te breiden met informatie uit banktransacties. Hierdoor zijn acceptatieprocessen voor financiële diensten nog verder te digitaliseren. Daarnaast maakt deze uitbreiding het werken met brondata voor nog meer sectoren interessant.</p>



<p>Na de toekenning van de PSD2-vergunning door DNB afgelopen zomer is er bij Ockto veel werk verzet. Klanten van Ockto kunnen consumenten nu ook vragen benodigde informatie uit banktransacties aan te leveren. Deze worden gecategoriseerd naar soort inkomsten en uitgaven. Denk daarbij aan de maandelijkse vaste lasten en inkomsten voor een huishouden zoals betaalde huur, kinderopvang, eventuele alimentatie, etc. Dat maakt het mogelijk voor een consument om niet alle banktransacties te delen, maar alleen de informatie die noodzakelijk is voor het verlenen van de betreffende dienst.</p>



 Werken met brondata nu voor meer sectoren interessant 



<p>Met de toevoeging van informatie uit banktransacties wordt het digitaliseren door te werken met brondata voor nog meer sectoren interessant. Auke Dirkmaat, Sales Manager Ockto: “We zien dat informatie uit banktransacties een belangrijke game changer is voor onder andere aanbieders van consumptief krediet en de private lease sector. Maar denk ook aan overheidsinstanties. Zij kunnen met behulp van Ockto de dienstverlening digitaliseren waardoor burgers veel persoonlijke gegevens niet meer los aan hoeven te leveren. Bijvoorbeeld bij schuldhulpverlening en het toekennen van regelingen en subsidies.”</p>



 Toezichthouders 



<p>Ook toezichthouders bewegen inmiddels mee met de trend om processen te digitaliseren met behulp van brondata. Per 1 april wordt bijvoorbeeld de VFN-leennorm aangepast waarbij het gebruik van brondata wordt toegestaan voor de kredietwaardigheidstoetsing.</p>



 Klanttrajecten 



<p>Inmiddels lopen er verschillende klanttrajecten waarbij informatie uit banktransacties gebruikt worden. Bijvoorbeeld voor bijzonder beheer in de hypotheeksector. Gert Vasse, Account Director Ockto: “Partijen beginnen logischerwijs met deze functionaliteit bij afdelingen waar een consument al banktransactie informatie moet aanleveren. Voor zowel de consument als de casemanager kunnen hiermee veiliger en efficiënter banktransacties opgehaald, gecategoriseerd en geïnterpreteerd worden.”</p>



 Snel, eenvoudig en veilig gegevens aanleveren via een app 



<p>Met Ockto kunnen financiële dienstverleners consumenten verzoeken digitaal gegevens aan te leveren via de Ockto-app. Bijvoorbeeld voor een hypotheek, financieel advies, een huurwoning, of het openen van een spaarrekening. Snel, makkelijk en veilig. Hierdoor wordt het aanleveren van losse documenten verleden tijd. Ockto zorgt dat alleen de gegevens aangeleverd worden die nodig zijn voor het proces waarmee dus volledig wordt voldaan aan de AVG.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>MYKEY, the multi-chain smart wallet, officially supported the DOT token through third-party custody, and the custody service is provided by Hashkey Hub. To ensure the security of users’ assets, KYC authentication is required(PS: users who have enabled BTC feature no longer need&nbsp;it).</p><p>DOT is the token of Polkadot. Polkadot is an open-source sharding multi-chain protocol that can facilitate the cross-chain transmission of any type of data or asset (not only tokens) so that various blockchains can interoperate.</p> The difference between the MYKEY DOT token and the DOT of other&nbsp;wallets <p>1. Implementation method: MYKEY uses a decentralized account to authorize centralized custody, and all operations can only be performed after the user’s signature, ensuring the security of the user’s DOT assets to the greatest&nbsp;extent.</p><p>2. Cost of Transfers: DOT transfers between MYKEY users can be made in a fast way and free fee (the Network&nbsp;Fee).</p><p>3. Asset Retrievable: Based on the recovery mechanism of the KEY ID protocol, even if the MYKEY account/device is lost, users can retrieve the DOT&nbsp;assets.</p><p>4. The compliance Agency: HashKey Hub is a product of HashKey Group, committed to providing users with one-stop digital asset management services in a simple, easy-to-use, safe, and compliant manner. An App realizing the safe storage, gain, and trade of digital assets. Free transfers amongst Hashkey platform users, and steady income based on regular financial products in mainstream tokens.</p> How to add the DOT&nbsp;token <p>Enter MYKEY and update to the newest version 3.4.0. Click [Assets] &gt; [Token] &gt; [+] &gt; [DOT] and add&nbsp;it.</p><p>Note:</p><p>1. The single transfer amount of the user to MYKEY DOT account is at least 1.5 DOT. If a single transfer is less than 1.5 DOT, the tokens will be&nbsp;lost.</p><p>2. Because the custodian needs to be responsible for users as much as possible and ensure the security of BTC assets, KYC authentication is required to create an account. Please upload the ID card and handhold a note with Hashkey and the application date and your ID. Users who have enabled the BTC feature no longer need&nbsp;it.</p><p>FAQ</p><p>1. How long does the KYC audit take? What if the submission fails?</p><p>Generally, it takes 1–2 working days for the audit, if the application fails to be submitted, please contact the MYKEY Customer Service: @mykeytothemoon in Telegram.</p><p>2. How much Network Fee is required for transfer?</p><p>There is no Network Fee for internal transfer, and it will arrive quickly. $0.2 Network Fee per transaction is required for external transfer.</p><p>About Us</p><p>KEY GROUP: <a href="http://keygroup.me/">https://keygroup.me/</a></p><p>MYKEY Web: <a href="http://mykey.org/">https://mykey.org/</a></p><p>BIHU: <a href="http://bihu.com/">https://bihu.com/people/1133973</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="http://t.me/mykey_lab">https://t.me/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href="http://twitter.com/mykey_lab"> https://twitter.com/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Medium: <a href="http://medium.com/mykey-lab">https://medium.com/mykey-lab</a></p><p>Github: <a href="http://github.com/mykeylab">https://github.com/mykeylab</a></p><p>Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpkcMxDMZL-OAVfQPodqgg">MYKEY Laboratory</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-officially-supported-the-dot-token-8553090058bd">MYKEY officially Supported the DOT Token</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Can you “sense” the next year&nbsp;yet? <p>With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it is time to take a look at all the things Ontology has lined up for 2021. While 2020 was dominated primarily by the rise of DeFi, which Ontology took part in through the successful launch of <a href="http://wing.finance">Wing.Finance</a>, we hope that 2021 will take the momentum DeFi has seen and spread it across other industries.</p><p>Our focus for the upcoming year revolves around optimizing deeper product integrations across different blockchains and bringing more users onboard the Ontology experience with secure layers of protection for their Decentralized Identity and Data. Given the various core projects Ontology is building, we thought it’d be best to share a roadmap of how each of these projects will collaborate and&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Just as human beings have five core senses ‒ sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste ‒ which work in tandem to create the human experience, Ontology also has 5 core “senses” that collaborate intimately to create a better Ontology experience in 2021. In no particular order, they are ONT ID (“Identity”), OScore (“Credit”), ONTO (“Wallet”), Wing (“Lending”), and SAGA (“Data”).</p><p>Below is our 2021 roadmap for how we plan on driving further innovation and bring more users to our platforms.</p> ONT ID &amp;&nbsp;UID <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Integrate our decentralized identity features on more public chains in addition to Ethereum, Polkadot, and Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain  Implement additional security and privacy controls for&nbsp;users  <p>At the core of what we do is a laser focus on providing the utmost security and privacy controls for users in regards to their own identity and the data they produce. This is perhaps most commonly seen in our ONT ID, a decentralized form of identification transcribed on the blockchain making it immutable and completely safe from hacking. Through a revamped DDXF which aims to support more decentralized data application scenarios, ONT ID protocols can be exported to an array of different public chains in 2021 in order to become the default market leader for decentralized identities and data protocols across chains. This vision has already been set in motion in 2020, as cross-chain Universal Identity (UID) is now supported on Ethereum, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and more. By locking down industry leaders, we are confident in adding additional chains in 2021 to the DeID movement.</p> OScore <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Integrate OScore into more DeFi platforms  Tackle other use cases for&nbsp;OScore  <p>With the inaugural launch of OScore on Wing’s Inclusive Pool, we have seen market adoption from an extended network of users. Through this data and analysis, we strongly believe that 2021 will see significant growth in other platforms and dApps adopting our credit-scoring system. Many of the immediate possibilities revolve around the DeFi space, such as credit-based lending and borrowing, which is still drastically underdeveloped. Compared to traditional finance, we know that DeFi can only truly take off with the addition of a trustworthy and transparent credit system like OScore. Not only will OScore be used in DeFi, but we envision a world where decentralized credit scoring could evolve into a self-sovereign reputation score controlled by the end-user.</p> ONTO <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Add support for more dApps on&nbsp;ONTO  Build deeper native integrations with DEXs and dApps within&nbsp;ONTO  <p>As cross-chain usability becomes a default requirement in wallets, ONTO is focused on bridging multiple chains together within a single user experience. As seen with its recent additions of Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum 2.0, the team behind ONTO will primarily focus on making sure ONTO is the only wallet you need, especially as we continue to invest in adding more decentralized applications and DEXes. We also view ONTO as a leading candidate to give you accessibility to the DeFi space by making it easier for you to stake in different liquidity pools or swap assets across the same, or different chains. As OScore continues to evolve, ONTO and OScore will become more synergistic, ultimately creating an in-depth snapshot of your crypto transactions and dApp activities under your control. We also envision ONTO will help the unbanked around the world by allowing for micropayments, and ultimately salary to be paid directly to a person’s ONTO wallet&nbsp;address.</p> Wing <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Launch new product pools to support more asset types beyond fungible&nbsp;tokens  Launch the Wing platform on other blockchains including Ethereum  Drive forward total value locked and usage from existing and new communities  <p>2020 was marked by the sudden astronomical rise of DeFi. As a natural extension to Ontology’s decentralized identity capabilities, the Ontology team invested heavy resources in building out Wing’s technical infrastructure, resulting in successful product launches like the Flash Pool and more recently, the Inclusive Pool. Moving into 2021, Ontology will continue working with Wing to develop further product lines that expand the types of assets which can be lent, borrowed, and collateralized. These include but are not limited to NFTs, art, real estate, derivatives, synthetic assets, and securities. Using OScore, Wing will also lean into deeper elements of undercollateralized lending to expand accessibility for more users to participate in the lending ecosystem. This will also allow Wing to explore new areas such as microlending and credit delegation, all while retaining user privacy and data protection. On top of that, 2021 will see Wing being built on other blockchains as well. The primary focus will be to build it on Ethereum so that Wing can support more ERC-20 assets, making it much more convenient to use for the existing Ethereum DeFi community. At the same time, Wing will work to bring in a generation of new users from emerging markets who stand to benefit from the disruptive potential of decentralized finance.</p> SAGA <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Add new ecosystem partners across various industries to the decentralized data&nbsp;platform  Invest into how research can be applied to more real use&nbsp;cases  <p>Moving into 2021, SAGA will invest heavily in research, and how theoretical research applications can be integrated into real use cases that strengthen SAGA’s data interaction protocols. Investments will also be funneled into creating more prototypes that can use the vast amount of data already available on the SAGA platform. Throughout the year, the SAGA team aims to deepen its ties with existing ecosystem partners while improving the product framework and seeking further partners to grow a truly decentralized data marketplace.</p> Conclusion <p>As we grow, our senses continue to adapt and change. Sometimes a scent like vanilla will be enticing, whereas other times it will be bothersome. With this in mind, we treat the five core elements of Ontology the same way, rapidly testing and iterating based on the feedback obtained from external stimuli. We look forward to growing out each vertical and have full confidence in our team to execute on the improvements needed along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Despite the rapid changes being made in these verticals, the core aspect of Ontology, which is our public blockchain, will not undergo much change. Rather, there will be a reinforced focus on improving the security of our decentralized network through onboarding additional enterprises and community run consensus, as well as candidate nodes. Our new governance model lowers the threshold for users to run a node or stake into a node to participate in the governance of our public blockchain. This improves upon its already established high performance while providing security and stability. In addition, more flexible staking mechanisms and support for different types of smart contracts will also be added in 2021. Our core tech team will look to create even more innovative products at the cross-section of DeFi and DeID in 2021 to complement the existing Ontology ecosystem.</p><p>In terms of community, our goal is to continue tackling real-world use cases made possible by using the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID / DDXF, Ontology’s DeFi products such as Wing, and our ONTO Wallet, as well as with the additional support from our innovative community members and all of Ontology’s community-run projects.</p><p>To conclude this roadmap, we want to thank our entire community for your support over the last 3 years, and we look forward to recapping 2021 at the end of next year the same way we recapped 2020 this year — with pride and&nbsp;success!</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-2021-roadmap-f5096d774b11">Ontology 2021 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I had no intention to write any blog posts during the holidays or, God forbid, do any predictions for the next year (look how relevant last year’s predictions turned out to be). However, an <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/30/business/ticketmaster-plea-passwords-computers/index.html">interesting story</a> involving Ticketmaster, a large American ticket sales company, has caught my eye and made me think once again about my career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The whole story goes all the way back to 2013, but the details have only recently been unsealed after the company has entered into a plea agreement and agreed to pay a $10 million fine for illegal access to a competitor’s computer system. Apparently, a former employee of the said (undisclosed) competitor switched to Ticketmaster in 2013, taking with him usernames and passwords for his former employer’s computer systems. On multiple occasions between 2013 and 2015, he and his new Ticketmaster colleagues illegally accessed that company’s computers to assess their competitor’s products and to “steal back” their customers. According to the article, Ticketmaster used this data to gain a competitive advantage while being aware of the illegal tactics and even promoted the employee.</p>
<p>Can't see the forest for the trees</p>
<p>Now, I realize that this is old news, and it will certainly be overshadowed by other, hotter stories like the recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/attack-surface-reduction-and-xdr">SolarWinds scandal</a>. However, it is nevertheless worth looking at with more attention since, in a way, it much better represents the current state of cybersecurity as a whole. Pardon me for using a silly analogy, but cybersecurity experts sometimes remind me of the fans of zombie movies. I’m pretty sure everyone watching such a film imagines themselves as the main protagonist defending against a horde of monsters using a truck-mounted machine gun. However, In the very unlikely event of a real zombie apocalypse, most of us will surely end up as an insignificant part of that very horde…</p>
<p>In a similar way, discussing how we should defend against the latest highly advanced attack of another state-sponsored group has very little relevance for the risks an average company is facing daily, and designing your security architecture around the most current buzzword is not a wise strategy, perhaps even less wise than ignoring security risks completely. I’m not going to guess which of the extremes was the culprit of the Ticketmaster scandal, but you don’t have to be an expert to see that the victim company cannot be rated high on the cybersecurity maturity scale.</p>
<p>Not de-provisioning users that have left the company, using passwords without any multifactor authentication, and apparently not having any monitoring tools in place to detect illegal access – these are not some complicated technologies, but the very basic security hygiene rules. Why bother inventing new ways to fight sophisticated Russian or North Korean hackers if any malicious insider can easily exploit your systems for years without causing any suspicion? Maybe cybersecurity vendors, as well as the industry press and analysts should perhaps leave their ivory towers for a moment and focus their efforts on the lowest common denominator among their customers?</p>
<p>A dangerous precedent</p>
<p>There is another, even more worrying aspect in this case, however. Ticketmaster, a large company and a subsidiary of an even larger Live Nation conglomerate with billions in yearly revenue, was basically slapped on the wrist with a mere $10 million fine. Doesn’t it set a precedent that shows that corporate espionage and theft of intellectual property using the tried and trusted malicious insider approach can be considered a valid business practice, maybe unethical but still undeniably profitable? It took years to create reasonably comprehensive and harsh regulations for protecting personal information (with GDPR and such), but what about other types of sensitive data?</p>
<p>I have written about the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult of cybersecurity</a>” earlier, but what we have here is even worse – that’s cybersecurity’s Stone Age! I really hope that problems like this will be the focus of more discussions in 2021 and not just the trendiest buzzwords like ransomware or supply chain security. Because if they won’t, the worst of cybersecurity predictions for the next year will turn out to be true: nothing will ever change.</p>

  <p>Modern authentication systems use and generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT). There are many different ways that JWTs are used but, in this post, we will concentrate on JWTs that are used as OIDC access tokens. When a user successfully logs in to an application using a service like Okta, an OIDC access token is generated in the form of a JWT. That token can be passed in requests to the backend. The backend can then validate that token and reject all requests with invalid or missing tokens.</p>

<p>A common way to validate OIDC access tokens is to simply make an API request to the issuer with the access token. While this is the simplest method to use, it is far faster to validate tokens “offline”.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to build a simple web application that uses the Okta authentication widget to log users in. An access token will be generated and sent to an API written in Go which will validate the token. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-offline-jwt-validation-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go Application 

<p>First things first, if you haven’t already got Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all of your future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir jwt-go
cd jwt-go
</code>   

<p>Next, we will make our directory a Go module and install the Gin web server package, and the JWT verifier package.</p>

   <code>go mod init jwt-go
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> containing these dependencies will be created by the <code>go get</code> command.</p>

<p>To use Okta authentication, you need to have a free [Okta Developer account] (https://developer.okta.com). Once you’ve done this, sign in to the developer console and select Applications &gt; Add Application. Then select Single-Page App and hit Next. The next page is filled in with default values, most of which are sufficient for this application and don’t need to be changed. Important: Add the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to the allowed redirect URLs. Hit Done.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of information that you need to obtain from the Okta Developer Console. These are your Okta domain name (e.g. <code>dev-12345.okta.com</code>) and your client id (e.g. <code>0ab1c2defg3AB4Chi567</code>).</p>

 How to Build a Web Client in Go with Okta Authentication 

<p>First, we need to create a directory for the static web pages.</p>

   <code>mkdir client
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/index.html</code> which loads the Okta JavaScript, and has a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with an id of <code>widget-container</code> for use by the Okta authentication widget, and a form to send messages to a backend API.</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Offline JWT Validation with Go&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/4.3.2/js/okta-sign-in.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/4.3.2/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
        &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
        &lt;script src="control.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Offline JWT Validation with Go&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="centred"&gt;
            &lt;form id="messageForm"&gt;
                Message: &lt;input id="message" name="message" type="message"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Send" onclick="onmessage()"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="messages" name="messages" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Messages&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/control.js</code> containing the following JavaScript code:</p>

   <code>var accessToken = null;

var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
    baseUrl: 'http://${yourOktaDomain}',
    clientId: '${yourClientId}',
    redirectUri: window.location.origin,
    authParams: {
        issuer: 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
        responseType: ['token', 'id_token']
    }
});

signIn.renderEl({
    el: '#widget-container'
}, function success(res) {
    if (res.status === 'SUCCESS') {
        accessToken = res.tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
        signIn.hide();
    } else {
        alert('fail);')
    }
}, function(error) {
    alert('error ' + error);
});

function onmessage() {
    const url = "/api/messages";
    var headers = {}
    if (accessToken != null) {
        headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken }
    }
    fetch(url, {
        method : "POST",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers,
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("messageForm"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.text();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        var msgs = JSON.parse(data) 
        document.getElementById('messages').value = msgs.messages.join('\n');
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = "Permission denied";
    });
}
</code>   

<p>So, what is this code doing? First, a variable named <code>accessToken</code> is created to store the JWT access token.</p>

<p>Next, we have created an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object named <code>signIn</code>. Note You need to replace both occurrences of <code>${yourOktaDomain}</code> with the Okta domain name from the console. Also, replace <code>${yourClientId}</code> with the client ID from the application we previously created in the console.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl()</code> function displays the authentication UI and performs the authentication. If successful, a JWT access token is returned and saved. The UI is then hidden.</p>

<p>The <code>onmessage()</code> function is called when the “Send” button is clicked to submit the message form. This function makes a POST request to an <code>/api/messages</code> endpoint that we will be creating later on. The <code>onmessage()</code> function also passes in the message text to <code>/api/messages/</code>. The request to the <code>/api/messages</code> endpoint will also include the access token in an HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header. As it is a token the header needs to specify its type as <code>Bearer</code>. When the response comes back, the messages are all displayed in the text area.</p>

 How to Build a Simple Go Web Server 

<p>We are going to implement a web server using the Go Gin library. Create a file called <code>main.go</code> containing the following Go code in the <code>jwt-go</code> directory that you created at the beginning of this post:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var messages []string

func Messages(c *gin.Context) {
    message := c.PostForm("message")
    messages = append(messages, message)
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./client", false)))
    r.POST("/api/messages", Messages)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>So, what does this code do? The messages are stored in a slice of strings called <code>messages</code>. The <code>main()</code> function creates a default instance of a Gin HTTP web framework engine. It serves the static content, which we have already created, from the <code>client</code> directory. It calls the function <code>Messages()</code> on receipt of POST requests to <code>/api/Messages</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Messages()</code> function extracts the message from the POST form data and appends it to the list of messages. It then returns the list of messages back to the requester as a JSON object.</p>

<p>Now, we can test the application by running the server and pointing a web browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   
 Introduction to  Complex Data Structures in Go 

<p>For those new to Go, some of the more complex code which we will see later will make more sense if we understand how Go handles lists and maps (also known as dictionaries or hash tables). Here is a short introduction to lists and maps in Go:</p>

<p>Consider an application which reads a JSON object from a file or a network resource. For example:</p>

   <code>[{ "name":"John", "age":30, "car":null },
 { "name":"Jane", "age":27, "car":"Mini" }]
</code>   

<p>We want to use the Go JSON decoder to turn the JSON string into a list of maps.</p>
 
   Map and list values can be of type nil, int, float, string, list, and map. 
   Go is a compiled language and it is also strongly typed. 
   Map keys are always strings. 
   The values of any map or list can be a mixture of types, so the values of a map or list can’t be given an explicit type in the code. 
 

<p>For example, In the code above, we declared a list of type <code>string</code> with this code:</p>

   <code>var messages []string
</code>   

<p>In order to overcome the typing issues, Go allows maps and lists to have values of any type by declaring the type as an interface, for example:</p>

   <code>var persons []interface{}
var person map[string]interface{}
</code>   

<p>This leads to another issue. When writing the code, it is impossible to know for certain what the actual type of the value is. For example, the JSON structure could change. The type can only be determined at runtime. This makes it important to know what the data structure actually is. If you know the type, you can use a type assertion that tells the compiler what the actual type is. In our example above, <code>persons</code> is a list of maps and <code>person</code> is a map containing a number of attributes.</p>

<p>The type assertions become:</p>

   <code>person, err := persons[0].(map[string]interface{})
name, err := person["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>If the type assertion agrees with the actual type the <code>err</code> will be <code>nil</code>. You can omit the <code>err</code> return value, but if the type assertion fails then an exception will be thrown. Multiple type assertions can be used in the same expression:</p>

   <code>name := persons[0].(map[string]interface[])["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>Finally, if you don’t know the actual type of an interface value, then you can use <code>reflect</code> to find it out:</p>

   <code>print(reflect.TypeOf(persons[0]))
</code>   

 How to Validate a JWT Token in Go 

<p>Now that we have the application working, it is time to validate the access token which is the focus of this article.</p>

<p>First of all, what is a JWT? It is three base64 encoded components separated by a <code>.</code> character.</p>

<p>The first component is the header. This is a map. The most important fields of the map are <code>alg</code> which specifies the cryptographic algorithm used, and the <code>kid</code> or key identifier which identifies which public key to use to verify the JWT.</p>

<p>The second component is the payload, which is a set of claims. A claim is a map. Important claims are <code>aud</code> which is the audience, and <code>iss</code> which is the issuer of the token.</p>

<p>The final component is the signature, which is a digital signature of the header and payload.</p>

<p>In order to validate the token, we first need the public key so that we can validate the signature. Start by modifying the <code>import</code> section of <code>main.go</code> to look like this:</p>

   <code>import (
    "net/http"
    "crypto/rsa"
    "encoding/json"
    "encoding/base64"
    "math/big"
    "os"

     "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
     "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
</code>   

<p>Next, add the following Go code to <code>main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>var rsakeys map[string]*rsa.PublicKey

func GetPublicKeys() {
    rsakeys = make(map[string]*rsa.PublicKey)
    var body map[string]interface{}
    uri := "https://" + os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN") + "/oauth2/default/v1/keys"
    resp, _ := http.Get(uri)
    json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;body)
    for _, bodykey := range body["keys"].([]interface{}) {
        key := bodykey.(map[string]interface{})
        kid := key["kid"].(string)
        rsakey := new(rsa.PublicKey)
        number, _ := base64.RawURLEncoding.DecodeString(key["n"].(string))
        rsakey.N = new(big.Int).SetBytes(number)
        rsakey.E = 65537
        rsakeys[kid] = rsakey
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Then and add a call to the <code>Keys()</code> function to the <code>main()</code> function, like this:</p>

   <code>func main() {
    GetPublicKeys()
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./client", false)))
    r.POST("/api/messages", Messages)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>What do these changes do? First of all, in <code>GetPublicKeys()</code> a GET request is made to the Okta API to get the signing public keys for the Okta domain stored in the $OKTA_DOMAIN environment variable. The response is a JSON object containing a list of keys.</p>

<p>Next, we parse the JSON object to extract one or more of the  RSA public keys that we will use to verify access tokens from Okta. The key has two components, a number (called “N”), and an exponent (called “E”). The number is base64 encoded and the exponent is usually 65537 so we just hard-code it.</p>

<p>Now we need to add some code to do the actual verification. Update your <code>import</code> section so it looks like this:</p>

   <code>import (
    "crypto/rsa"
    "encoding/base64"
    "encoding/json"
    "math/big"
    "os"
    "strings"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"
    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
</code>   

<p>Then, add the following code to <code>main.go</code>.</p>

   <code>func Verify(c *gin.Context) bool {
    isValid := false
    errorMessage := ""
    tokenString := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")
    if strings.HasPrefix(tokenString, "Bearer ") {
        tokenString = strings.TrimPrefix(tokenString, "Bearer ")
        token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenString, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
            return rsakeys[token.Header["kid"].(string)], nil
        })
        if err != nil {
            errorMessage = err.Error()
        } else if !token.Valid {
            errorMessage = "Invalid token"
        } else if token.Header["alg"] == nil {
            errorMessage = "alg must be defined"
        } else if token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)["aud"] != "api://default" {
            errorMessage = "Invalid aud"
        } else if !strings.Contains(token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)["iss"].(string), os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN")) {
            errorMessage = "Invalid iss"
        } else {
            isValid = true
        }
        if !isValid {
            c.String(http.StatusForbidden, errorMessage)
        }
    } else {
        c.String(http.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
    }
    return isValid
}
</code>   

<p>The function extracts an <code>Authorization</code> request header and looks for a <code>Bearer</code> token. If it does not exist, then a 401 <code>Unauthorized</code> response is sent.</p>

<p>The token string is then passed to the <code>jwt.Parse()</code> function, the second parameter being a function that returns the public key.</p>

<p>Now, we can validate the token. It must be rejected if any of the following are true:</p>
 
   The parse function returns an error which means that the token can’t be decoded, or more likely that the public key can’t decrypt the signature. 
   The token is invalid. 
   The cryptographic algorithm must be RSA256. 
   The audience does not match the expected audience. 
   The issuer is not the expected issuer. 
   The token has no key identifier. 
 

<p>Finally, modify the API functions to call <code>Verify()</code>.</p>

   <code>func Messages(c *gin.Context) {
    if Verify(c) {
        message := c.PostForm("message")
        messages = append(messages, message)
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
    }
}
</code>   

 Testing it all out 

<p>We can now test end to end. Start by  running the server:</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Next, point a web browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

<p>Enter a message and hit the submit button. You should get an authorization error.</p>

<p>Now, login and try sending another message. This should send a token that gets validated correctly. Your message should be displayed.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In this post, we have learned how to authenticate with Okta to get a JWT, how to use that JWT in the <code>Authentication</code> header of an HTTP GET request, and how to perform “offline” validation of that JWT in Go.</p>

 Open Sourcing ARNIMA FL — Aries Mobile Agent SDK for Google&nbsp;Flutter Aries Flutter Mobile Agent&nbsp;SDK<blockquote>Exactly a year ago in Jan 2020, we announced ARNIMA — first ever Aries React Native Mobile Agent SDK that we made open source for the Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem. (<a href="https://medium.com/@ayanworks/introducing-arnima-aries-react-native-mobile-agent-907c7af02049">See&nbsp;here</a>)</blockquote><p>Today, while we wish you a very happy and healthy 2021, we thought to add to that happiness beyond just wishing. We are very excited to announce one more small open-source contribution from <a href="http://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> to the Aries community.</p> ARNIMA FL — Flutter based Aries Mobile Agent&nbsp;SDK <p>During the recent IIW #31 (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>) that took place during Oct 2020, we announced about our willingness to bring open-source Flutter based Aries Mobile Agent SDK. Keeping up with the promise and with the commitment we have for contributing to the open-source, we are glad to announce ARNIMA FL — Aries Flutter Mobile Agent SDK, first ever Google Flutter based open-source cross platform Aries Mobile Agent&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>While this is the first version, we have implemented initial set of Aries RFCs into it for the developers community to start&nbsp;using.</p> Features available in V1 of ARNIMA Flutter&nbsp;SDK <p>This being the first version, we have following basic features made available –</p>  Create Wallet  Connection with Mediator&nbsp;Agent  Connection with Aries Cloud Agent using Invitation URL  <p>We believe that these initial features will help SSI developers to get first hand playing around with this version. Soon, we will push remaining features/RFCs in subsequent releases.</p> GitHub Repo <p>Following is the <a href="https://github.com/ayanworks/ARNIMA-flutter-sdk">GitHub repository</a> you can get the SDK source from. We have provided a sample mobile app for your ready reference as part of the&nbsp;repo.</p><p>We intend to move this repository soon as a Hyperledger project under Hyperledger Github Org, so that the bigger Hyperledger Aries community can contribute &amp;&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>https://github.com/ayanworks/ARNIMA-flutter-sdk</p><p>We look forward to your feedback and contribution as always the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Happy collaborating!!</p><p>— <a href="http://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> Team</p><p>#SelfSovereignIdentity #SSI #HyperledgerAries #MobileAgent #Flutter #opensource #HyperledgerIndy #annoucement</p>

 A self-sovereign digital identity (SSID) empowering individuals to engage in heritage and legacy-planning, establishing trusted connections with future generations and their environment. <blockquote>Dark Matter Labs and IOTA Foundation — with significant conceptual contributions from Futures Literacy experts at UNESCO and Finland Futures Research Centre at University of Turku — are launching Persistent Selv; an exploratory demo app empowering individuals to improve their ecological footprints, by prospecting their environmental legacies and establishing trusted connections with future generations.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://persistent-selves.vercel.app/demo/welcome">Click here</a> to test the Persistent Selv demo&nbsp;app.</blockquote><p>INTERDEPENDENCIES WITH THE PAST AND THE&nbsp;FUTURE</p><p>“We live in an era of pathological short-termism. Our politicians can barely see past the next election or latest tweet. Markets spike then crash in speculative bubbles. Nations sit around international conference tables bickering away while the planet burns and species disappear. And we are constantly clicking the Buy Now button. This is the age of the tyranny of the&nbsp;now.</p><p>How can we expand our time horizons beyond our obsession with the present tense so we can deal with the crises of our time? […] This is the moment to consider a new conception of the self that extends far beyond the present and transcends death itself.”¹</p><p>This is the moment to recognise that we are a gift from the past and we will, eventually, gift the future. This is the moment to acknowledge the impact of our legacies on future generations. This is the time to practice true long-term planning, prospecting and legacy-thinking. How we form our heritage will be decisive for expanding our influence beyond our lifetime, to take care of future generations.</p><p>PERSISTENT SELV&nbsp;DEMO</p><p>Based on this we have developed Persistent Selv, an exploratory demo app that leverages the possibilities opened up by self-sovereign digital identities (SSIDs) and data wallets, to help individuals plan their environmental legacy. Persistent Selv attempts to investigate possibilities for fostering individual long-term thinking, to make us aware of our interdependencies with the past and the future, understanding how our actions today might contribute to the legacies we are leaving behind to future generations.</p><p>The demo app engages individuals with a series of exercises that help them think about their environmental inheritance and how they might start constructing it to take care of future generations. The app asks individuals to construct their environmental legacy by registering a series of commitments towards supporting the ecological systems of our planet. In this demo, we have created two fictional institutions that provide the infrastructure to manage two different types of commitments: (1) far-future promises of financial capital transfers, contingent on what the future will need, and (2) present commitments which recognise everyday acts as legacy formation.</p>Far Future Foundation, a fictional institution that supports far-future legacies of financial capital transfers. Screenshot from the Persistent Selv demo&nbsp;app.Far Future Foundation allows individuals to imagine possible and desirable futures, a process that can help us think of the impact of our legacies on future generations. Screenshot from the Persistent Selv demo&nbsp;app.<p>These commitment structures — our promises for being Good Ancestors — are testaments of the legacies we will pass down to the next generation. To form those environmental commitments, the Persistent Selv demo app has two main&nbsp;aims.</p><p>1. Guiding individuals to becoming time-literate</p><p>To overcome pathological short-termism, we need to learn to witness time in a way that transcends the limits of a single human experience. We need to learn to perceive our actions in deeper time and longer timescales that are relevant to the ecological systems of the planet (for example, those of groundwater systems or of forest&nbsp;growth).</p><p>A skill that can enable this is futures literacy² which offers individuals the possibility to expand their approaches towards imagining and using futures. This ability, to imagine multiple futures, can be thought of as adopting a variety of lenses, each one specifically able to show some aspect of our ever-changing world. In this sense, becoming skilled at being aware of the futures one is using and being able to readily switch to different approaches and aims for imagining futures is valuable. It can help identify and select opportunities for action in the present to inform our environmental commitments and legacies.</p><p>At the same time, futures literacy teaches us an important lesson about our legacies. In the present we can only imagine futures, whether those are probable, possible, desirable, surprising or even unexpected. But in reality the future is emergent. The design of our legacies need to embrace emergence by safeguarding the diversification of futures. In this way, we can move away from imperial intentions and decolonise the future, to grant future generations agency and decision-making power over the use of our legacies.</p><p>2. Financing the&nbsp;future</p><p>Through the Persistent Selv app we are also trying to create opportunities to coordinate the future through a more democratized and environmentally beneficial system for financing futures.</p><p>Our current mode of coordinating the future through financing is not fit-for-purpose. Our inheritance instruments bias a form of succession focused on financial capital and close kin, overlooking the importance and intertemporality of other types of capital, such as social or environmental. They are also built on stable social institutions, which are at a mismatch with the dynamic futures we are facing. And this all happens within a centralised financial system, where the gravitational pull of capital leads to accumulation of wealth across generations and inequality — meaning that most are left only with memories of their deceased loved&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Through Persistent Selv, we hope to provide a democratized opportunity for all to create the long-term futures they want. For all to transcend their death, through engaging with a dynamic future using oracles to trigger payments towards what is societally needed at that time. Persistent Selv is the infrastructure to provide individuals the trust to donate, and in the future invest, in long-term deep&nbsp;time.</p><p>PERSISTENT SELV DEVELOPMENT</p><p>Even though just a small probe, we hope the Persistent Selv demo app can provide a first interactive and captivating way to bring elements of Long-termism to life. We will be developing further this initial design towards a new long-term digital inheritance instrument for investing in futures through a variety of capitals.</p><p>Persistent Selv is just one of many experiments aimed at shifting the tenor of our financial flows. It has been developed as part of the <a href="https://medium.com/futures-in-long-termism/an-alliance-for-long-investing-eb7d218ed40a">Long Term Alliance</a>.</p><blockquote>To test the Persistent Selv demo app follow the instructions below.</blockquote><p>To test the demo on iOS, please download the Testflight App from the App store: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/3FCosIcj">https://testflight.apple.com/join/3FCosIcj</a></p>  When prompted to download the mobile app on the Selv desktop experience, use the iOS camera app to scan the desktop QR code with your mobile&nbsp;device.

<p>Financing the Transition — Blog&nbsp;3.</p><p>This is the third of a series of blogs on financing the transformations that our societies need. It is part of our project ‘<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/ReCode-ReCoding-to-capitalise-civic-goods">Re-coding for a civic capital economy</a>’, co-financed by EIT Climate-KIC, and also builds on ideas developed through the EmergenE Room programme with McConnell Foundation, our work with Viable Cities, and the EIT Climate-KIC supported Long Term Alliance. See the first and second blog <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-elements-for-a-way-forward-c208787ab6ae">here</a>.</p> Introduction <p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">first post</a> of the Bridging the Gap series, we outlined our overall Investment Thesis. This entails the urgent need to transition existing public and private capital, as well as to orient the new intergenerational investments towards five new asset classes, structured as a portfolio of novel infrastructure investments. These asset classes present a direct opportunity to address the interrelated health, economic, social, and climate crises in our cities and societies, all of which have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The asset classes we see&nbsp;are:</p>  Natural Assets.  Deep district retrofits (‘Future-fitting’)  Social infrastructures.  Large-scale, sustainable new urban developments.  Agricultural land.  <p>It is insufficient (and in any case seemingly impossible) to simply ‘allocate more capital’ to these five key areas of intervention. Of equal importance are the investment structures behind these assets. Specifically, we believe the following three ‘re-codings’ of capital are required:</p>  Long financing: New investment instruments for the long-term allocation of&nbsp;capital.  New public governance models: Off public balance sheets yet for public interest.  Innovating funding: New mechanisms for contracting multiple value&nbsp;flows.  <p>In combination, holistic value chains that include multiple co-benefits can be strung together via a system of smart contractual rights and obligations that enables macro-aggregation of capital and micro-deployment of solutions.</p><p>We have outlined a roadmap for this Investment Thesis with ten recommendations, each of them a step towards bridging the gap from macro-policy to micro-implementation. The purpose of this third post is to outline the Dark Matter Labs (DML) strategy for the next twelve months, as well as to extend an open invitation for collaboration. Only through open dialogue and testing of our assumptions will we collectively be able to refine our thinking and put ideas into practice.</p> Our Investment Thesis <p>The Investment Thesis we put forward is derived from DML’s mission of the past two years. It is based on three interlinked dimensions that are crucial to transformative markets.</p><p>First dimension: Develop Prototypes that establish the operational viability of the frameworks with our partners, including the EIT Climate-KIC initiatives on <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/transformation-capital/">Transformation Capital</a>, on <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/deep-demonstrations/long-termism/publications/">Long-termism</a> and on <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Healthy-Clean-Cities.pdf">Healthy Clean Cities</a>, our work with <a href="https://twitter.com/ViableCities?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Viable Cities</a> on their Transition Lab, and the <a href="https://medium.com/@JayneEngle/the-emergence-room-82a151ec6737">EmergencE Room</a> collaboration with the McConnell Foundation, among others. By prototyping we can test the viability of proposed solutions and collect evidence that can be factored into the design of each constituent element. This also provides an opportunity to nurture relationships and trust with all stakeholders.</p><p>Second dimension: Development of key elements of the above prototypes that can be used to structure and build rich complex systems of value, as well as instruments, such as Smart Perpetual Bonds and Smart Carbon Treasury, and novel governance vehicles, such as Smart Public Trust and Smart Covenants.</p><p>Third dimension: Development of whole-city value models, which weave together the frameworks to create a comprehensive narrative. One such example is our collaboration with stakeholders in Madrid, Spain, where a carbon sequestration capacity that includes an emphasis on multiple co-benefits capacity is currently being planned via a ring <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20200710/madrid-wants-to-build-biggest-metropolitan-forest-in-europe">of urban forest</a>s around the entire city. It is within this dimension that we showcase the demand and market viability for the societal scale investment models.</p> Pathways of engagement <p>Over the next twelve months, DML will build on the last two years of collaborative work across all three dimensions and future asset classes, such as the emerging ‘Future-Fit’ deep district retrofitting model and <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAsInfrastructure</a>. We will also seek to engage with a wider circle of external partners and participate in a wider transformation capital movement.</p><p>From our experience to date, we have identified two distinct pathways to integrate the elements into prototypes. The first involves deliberate undertakings by the cities to test the entire framework in a dedicated prototype. The second pathway involves the integration of a series of more discreet elements within an existing project or infrastructure. We aim to pursue both opportunities as we believe that they complement and inform one&nbsp;another.</p> Conclusion <p>There remains little doubt regarding the depth of the current health, economic, social, and climate crises. The problems are well understood, the solutions less so, requiring extensive innovation and testing of unproven ideas. We have outlined our ideas and recommendations in the hope of opening a dialogue and testing assumptions. We look forward to hearing from&nbsp;you.</p><p>If you want to find out more about how to engage with this mission, please contact <a href="https://medium.com/u/fc285852de98">Indy Johar</a>, Anastasia Mourogova Millin, Raj Kalia, <a href="https://medium.com/u/6cd2b63287b6">Joost Beunderman</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/u/9805eebdc48f">Chloe Treger</a> at <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a>.</p><p>We have been supported in this mission by our close partners, Dominic Hofstetter and Thomas Osdoba at EIT Climate-KIC, Viable Cities, The Long Alliance, and Emergence Room Alliance in Canada.

<p>Financing the Transition — Blog&nbsp;2.</p><p>This is the second of a series of blogs on financing the transformations that our societies need. It is part of our project ‘<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/ReCode-ReCoding-to-capitalise-civic-goods">Re-coding for a civic capital economy</a>’, co-financed by EIT Climate-KIC, and also builds on ideas developed through the EmergenE Room programme with McConnell Foundation, our work with Viable Cities, and the EIT Climate-KIC supported Long Term Alliance. See the first blog&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">here</a>.</p><p>Linked to the climate crisis is a huge funding gap estimated to be $6 trillion annually. There is both an opportunity and demand to look at the problem through a different lens, especially as current macroeconomic crisis management tools and unconventional monetary policies, such as Quantitative Easing, may not provide any substantial redress in the time required.</p><p>As our previous blog outlined, there is a need to invest in and recognise the value of a new typology of 21st-century infrastructure, a new class of assets, and a new way of managing liabilities — all of which fall outside our existing socio-economic system.</p><p>Our work to date reveals two significant features of this new asset&nbsp;class.</p>  Typologies: The new asset class includes novel investments such as an urban forest (looking beyond its cost and traditional elements as timber yield value to incorporate its systemic environmental and social services) and intangible assets such as bridging social capital (trust, governance, well-being), which enables societies to handle shocks in an age of long emergencies.  Characteristics: The new asset class operates and behaves like infrastructure, where yields are persistent, quasi-monopolistic, and serve as a foundational component of our 21st-century society and&nbsp;economy.  <p>Unlocking this asset class for society-wide benefit requires new capital structuring mechanisms, in order to open up whole new value chains as yet inaccessible or unrealised in the analogue era of the 20th-century and early-21st-century economy. Such an approach is predicated on:</p>  The real-time, data-driven coupling of investment instruments and smart micro funding contracts.  The capacity to pool liabilities and value flows, turning micro into macro, through smart collective insurance or collaborative procurement and outcomes-buying models.  Building what is called ‘sympoietic systems’ of interaction and collaborative value creation. “Sympoietic (collectively-producing) systems do not have self-defined spatial or temporal boundaries. Information and control are distributed among components. The systems are evolutionary and have the potential for surprising change. Since they cannot be identified by boundaries, sympoietic systems must be identified by the self-organising factors involved in their generation.”  The deployment of smart market protocols (such as open, micro-transfer pricing) to avoid rent-seeking and monopolistic behaviours and characteristics.  A series of interoperable smart elements, that are vital in constructing the contracts of value necessary for transition.  <p>Combined, these conditions catalyse a whole new set of value chains. They can optimise, measure, and contract for investment and value synergies — thus generating co-benefits, managing co-liabilities and externalities in a way as yet unaccountable and impossible to create contracts for. Trees, for example, can be understood as a natural resource but also can be contracted as an infrastructure asset for their carbon-capture capabilities, their means to manage ‘heat island’ effects for energy utilities, their impact on health outcomes for communities, and their sustainable urban drainage benefits for water utilities.</p><p>We believe this new way of structuring capital and value has the potential to drive the expansion of what counts as investable infrastructure beyond assets like real estate, transport, and energy to include both civic and nature-based assets: social infrastructure as well as brown (full-street retrofit), green, and blue nature-based solutions, all of which are fundamental to tackling the climate crisis and driving a just transition.</p><p>As we outlined in the first blog, this has all been made possible by developments in the application of smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies. When combined, these create almost frictionless means to transact, pool, and aggregate value, and to couple across the ambient, micro, and known emissions of value and their spillovers.</p><p>The ability to contractually value and interact with the permutations of these value emissions is what opens up the potential for a new class of investible value models. We can then use a combination of these emissions of value to establish, for example, a much deeper understanding of the holistic value flows of a tree — its direct value to a house, its value within a system, as well as its correlated value to a synthetic benchmark or&nbsp;index.</p><p>Once we are able to understand and more accurately describe the value equations of novel infrastructures in this context, we can start to assemble the contractible components and value chains, These value chains are assembled and compounded off the back of a series of universal elemental components which we think are vital to constructing this new civic&nbsp;economy.</p> A PERIODIC TABLE OF TRANSITION ELEMENTS <p>Over the course of the last year we have identified a series of elemental transition finance components through various projects, missions and case studies. We think all of these are vital in ‘re-coding’ capital and constructing the civic value chains we need in order to drive the transition. These elements are the foundations of a radically transparent and machine-readable investment ecosystem which, in turn, creates new governance mechanisms. Our work has shown that these value chains can be constructed through a series of discrete ‘machined’ elements. These create the contractible pathways for the flow of value across multiple partners and stakeholders, opening up new possibilities for funding, including the financing of novel infrastructures.</p><p>Construction of value in this new economy is based on these elements. The fact that they are digitally machined provides a surge in capacity that would not otherwise exist. In fact, advances in technological capability (computational and API contracting, remote-sensing, data collection and analysis), as well as near-zero transaction costs, have made and will make the development of these new elements possible. The resulting value chains are the combinations of these elements that result in contractual arrangements such as smart covenants (to capture spillover value of novel infrastructure benefiting real estate owners) and comfort-based or outcomes-based contracts for at-scale district retrofitting, smart perpetual financing, and smart carbon treasuries. Together, they form whole new compounds of value that enable financing of the transition.</p><p>The graphic above shows an initial periodic table of elements which we have started to define as they emerging from our work. We do not believe this to be either exhaustive or complete, but it is a start. We expect this list to be added to and augmented by ourselves and others over the course of the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>A key feature of these elements is that they can be compounded to build rich complex systems of value, and the contracts provide the capacity for these elements to be structured as value flows. Therefore, bundles of these elements would create new contracts and functions, such as smart covenants and smart comfort or outcomes contracts. Such contracts facilitate the interaction between micro, ambient, and known flows of value and liabilities. Below are some examples of these contracts with examples of how they are used in creating value&nbsp;chains:</p><p>CONTRACTS &amp; FUNCTIONS — Examples</p><p>These contracts can be aggregated to create new functionalities such as a Carbon Treasury.</p><p>A Carbon Treasury would involve management of an accreting (gradually accumulating over time) legal liability of a local authority (e.g. municipalities have a legal responsibility to be carbon neutral by 2050 or before). It could do so through an asset-backed approach as opposed to a traditional revenue based approach (i.e paying ever-higher insurance premiums or carbon offsets). So, rather than buying carbon credits to offset its net emissions (which would effectively be leaking money out of the local economy), the local authority could take the net present value of the future liability and use that to set up and invest in a civic infrastructure asset like a network of urban forests, or renewable energy infrastructures and whole-district retrofits. The authority could then issue index-linked perpetual notes which pay coupons algorithmically based on a carbon price or outcomes index, or on the closing price of CO2 offsets on a recognised exchange on the coupon payment&nbsp;dates.</p><p>This form of compound transaction results in the trading of an accreting liability for a civic asset. The table below illustrates how the local authority effectively buys a collective outcomes contract with locked-in value flows within a circular&nbsp;economy.</p><p>It is important to note that the Carbon Treasury proposed is an example of a compound element as opposed to a value chain, in that it is essentially about managing carbon liabilities through a series of elements. It is of course an integral part of value-chain construction especially when viewed through a carbon sequestration lens as in the case of an urban forest, or the potentially rapid carbon emissions reductions through holistic district energy retrofits.</p><p>Value chains are the results of contracts and functional elements being combined to construct decarbonisation deals that maximise value creation and, therefore, making them eligible for investment. Without the technological advancements in value capture mechanisms, it would not be possible to structure deals such as street or district retrofits and <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAsInfrastructure</a> (a project which aims to demonstrates how urban trees can be used to offset carbon locally in cities), as well as other nature-based solutions like the soil regeneration initiative undertaken by our partners <a href="https://www.mis.quebec/en/">MIS</a> in Montreal.</p><p>Value Chain&nbsp;Models</p><p>The following two examples are used to illustrate the potential of the elements we describe and new value construction they&nbsp;offer.</p><p>The Highline as smart&nbsp;commons</p><p>As we analyzed in a <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">previous publication</a>, there is a fundamental link between investing in an urban greenspace infrastructure like the Highline in New York (or the proposed highline in the London Borough of Camden) and the uplift of land value and revenue yields adjacent to it. Historically, this link has been uncontractible and untransacted, leaving civic assets like a new public green amenity largely uninvestable even though they generate a large quantum of value — from well-bein and local business growth to biodiversity. If these civic assets are invested in by the public/state, the financial value generated is currently largely captured by a minority real estate owner&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We believe that a sustainable value chain can be structured for such civic assets, on the basis of a collateralised Smart Covenant-backed Perpetual Bond. This is an asset-backed security collateralised through a smart covenant contract, which captures the value flows in the deal — i.e. land value uplift and retail revenues, containing an option to receive fixed and variable annuity streams (the coupons).</p><p>The smart bond can also be contingently structured to contain elements of price uplift that are relative and proportional to the aggregate uplift notional value, and also proportional to the location of each micro-asset holder in the overall highline perimeter. The bond could equally be structured with capital call features, allowing bondholders’ capital to be called when needed in line with the various development phases of the Highline project. Bondholders could also be given voting rights over future restructurings, or rights of first refusal in subsequent financing rounds. In this way, a new financing approach emerges for the green infrastructures that our cities need but find hard to fund though traditional budgets.</p><p>FutureFit: whole-street or whole-district retrofitting</p><p>The retrofitting of whole blocks, streets and districts in an integrated manner present us with a system-scale option for meeting climate transition targets. If undertaken in a holistic manner, benefits don’t just include energy efficiency, energy bill savings and job creation, but also human health, social cohesion and industrial innovation, with correlated benefits at the national&nbsp;level.</p><p>However, up until now the complexity of interactions and transactions, ambient and micro spillovers of value, a misaligned ecosystem of incentives and nonlinear benefits, have all served to maintain this holistic at-scale retrofitting as a rarely realised designer’s dream.</p><p>Whole-system ‘FutureFitting’ is a good example of the transposition of output financing (energy units only) to outcomes financing that creates a type of synthetic risk arbitrage between the change in energy utilisation and comfort value. The model is predicated on the collateralisation of the delta (change) between the value of the energy reduction (of future energy demands) and the energy bills paid by the customer that contribute to the retrofit.</p><p>The deal construction can also be viewed as a derivative; a Total Return Swap (TRS) where the receiver leg of the swap (beneficiaries) is comprised of various returns including a comfort contract in return for a series of payments (energy bills) that are capped or linked to, for example, a consumer price index CPI. From the beneficiary’s perspective, it is trading (swapping) energy capacity for comfort value through the contract. In this case, the householder (a beneficiary) receives the direct well as correlated benefits of a whole street retrofit — the comfort value. The comfort contract is linked to energy usage and the energy bill that is linked to the individual. Health savings is an additive component and not linked at the individual (micro) level but at the societal (health service) or systems&nbsp;level.</p><p>The seed capital required to fund the retrofit is the aggregate notional value of the amount of energy reduction (¤/KWh). As the seed capital will only partially fund the retrofit, other parties (e.g. Health, Environment) will also need to contribute to the overall required funding amount for the whole street / whole city retrofit.</p><p>The total seed capital available could be pooled and warehoused to originate syndication deals involving senior-secured bank or private capital, or alternatively through a Smart Perpetual Bond with structured coupons linked, for example, to an applicable spread (e.g. the notional value of the energy unit reduction) and/or to a customised index of environmental and social constituents. These are just some examples of financing alternatives to consider when structuring output-to-outcomes financing. However, the Public Interest Institution performs key functions in the scaling and execution of this value chain&nbsp;model.</p><p>The Public Interest Institution (PII) would&nbsp;oversee:</p>  Aggregation of all deltas of the projected energy requirements.  Pooling of energy savings with savings from other&nbsp;budgets.  Achievement and verification of outcomes objectives.  Participation of other stakeholders and counterparties.  Construction and operation of secondary pooling mechanisms.  <p>The PII would pool the energy savings potential at street level, and use that as a density function to determine excess spread required between energy units saved and the energy bill guaranteed for the consumer. Once this is established, the PII would sequentially invite outcomes buyers such as public health, then utilities and insurance (reduced flooding risk), and perform these additive functions as each contract and outcome buyer (liability holder) is separate.</p><p>Density Function: In probability theory, a probability density function, or density of a continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample in the sample space can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that&nbsp;sample.</p><p>The strategy also requires us to not only break down the contract into granular elements of specific performance, procurement, and comfort but also manage the nesting of the contractual elements between all contracting parties (this is a vital issue and challenge for parametric smart contracts). Further, the sequencing and execution of the various contractual arrangements is essential as the transaction contains execution risk owing to the nested and specific performance in the contractual arrangements between multiple counterparties, including retrofitters and energy suppliers who must commit to providing the seed funding for the transaction.</p><p>Trust, legitimacy, transparency, new forms of market design and novel consumer rights are required to mitigate gamification risks in these arrangements. The governance of the energy bill guarantee, therefore, is key. Contract governance and execution of the retrofit strategy is the keystone to constructing these futures. As such, this needs to be orchestrated via a Public Interest Contract, and a third-party contracting agency that would design, create and adjudicate the public interest contracts between energy providers, retrofitters, and citizens, requiring all parties to commit to full transparency and disclosure.</p> Conclusion <p>We see the examples of green infrastructure and retrofitting as demonstrative illustrations of how value is structured using the emerging ‘periodic table’ of transition finance elements we have outlined. The key feature of these elements is that they can be compounded to build rich complex systems of value. Digitally enabled contracts provide the capacity for these elements to be structured as value flows at the known, micro, and ambient levels. Technological advancements have made it possible to capture value at micro-massive scales, in order to structure the new value&nbsp;chains</p><p>Together, these elements in the new ‘re-coded’ and ‘machined’ finance economy can be used to create whole new forms of civic assets and institutions as we make the transition.</p><p>We recognise that our illustrations and conclusions are interim. We will continue to optimise our approach and the development of these novel infrastructures over the course of the next year together with our partners and collaborators, and welcome your thoughts.</p><p>The next phase of this journey for us and our many partners is to develop on-the-ground experiments and to gather evidence in order to test and validate our investment hypothesis.

 Bridging the Investment Gap: Infrastructuring Tomorrow. <p>Financing the Transition — Blog1.</p><p>This is the first of a series of blogs on financing the transformations that our societies need. It is part of our project ‘<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/ReCode-ReCoding-to-capitalise-civic-goods">Re-coding for a civic capital economy</a>’, co-financed by EIT Climate-KIC, and also builds on ideas developed through the EmergenE Room programme with McConnell Foundation, our work with Viable Cities, and the EIT Climate-KIC supported Long Term Alliance.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Our generation is facing an unprecedented long emergency — from climate crisis to economic hardships to health emergencies to social injustice — all further exposed and deepened by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Governments around the world are increasingly aware that the scale of the present calamity requires radical capital, policy, and infrastructural solutions beyond our existing capabilities. The impact of these investment decisions will be felt for generations to come, with all the resulting implications both now and in the future. These intergenerational investments will need to address the needs of societies as a whole, carrying with them an array of accountabilities. To borrow from the future is both to assume responsibility and to operate with a duty of care for tomorrow.</p><p>In response, we have seen the development of Green New Deals around the world. Linked in part to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and in part to a post-carbon economy, the European Union is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YzgRicHRuDgfczAxkHrhXqnQOoqfhyR/view?usp=sharing">targeting initial investment of 646 billion euros</a> to be matched by national governments. It is undoubtedly necessary, given the current state of the world, that investment does not follow the traditional disaster capital route of concentrating wealth. Instead we need to ensure a just and equitable transition to a net-zero carbon economy, advancing not just community benefit but also community wealth in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>This future is being cast in a moment where we face an accelerating deficit resulting from Covid-related spending in 2020. Governments are equally under pressure to implement rapid solutions intended to jump-start the real economy. This drives the policy landscape, with decisions about recovery funds tending to be based on the rear-view mirror rather than on what lies ahead. Competing incentives for cities and local stakeholders are seeded, with an emphasis on job creation and the repetition of historical approaches. This is at the expense of the innovation required to enable the next generation of solutions.</p><p>It has often been stated that societies, civilisations and cities live or die by the infrastructure they build. Many of the current infrastructures across our cities and wider society are no longer fit for purpose. In some cases, they are on the brink of collapse. Furthermore, we are at risk of building the wrong infrastructures for the civilisation of the 21st and 22nd centuries. What are the social, ecological, cultural, economic, physical, and institutional infrastructures that are necessary for this new age of long emergencies?</p><p>Over the past twelve months, Dark Matter Labs has been working on this challenge with various stakeholders throughout Europe, including <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Viable-Cities-Climate-Neutral-Cities-2030">Viable Cities</a>, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Scotland-s-Lead-Markets-From-Grand-Challenges-to-Prototypes">Scottish National Investment Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.scot/sites/default/files/2020-12/Board%20meeting%20-%2009%20December%202020%20-%20Investment%20in%20a%20Nature-rich%20Future.pdf">NatureScot</a>, and other parts of the Scottish government, the EIT Climate-KIC <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Healthy-Clean-Cities-Deep-Demonstration-Accelerating-European-cities">Healthy Clean Cities</a> programme, as well as with partners through <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/futures-in-long-termism-16c1745c361c">The Long Alliance</a>.</p><p>This work has made it apparent that the dimensional context and the scale of investments required for initiatives such as the Green New Deal are at an order of magnitude our societies and institutions have not yet grasped. We don’t yet have the tools, frameworks, and mechanisms necessary to bridge the capabilities, capacity, and capital gaps, enabling us to address this transition. We need to ‘re-code’ capital to enable the transformations we&nbsp;need.</p><p>In this series of blogs, we seek to articulate an urgent need for bridging the gap between the capital clearly aggregated at a macro scale and the investment needed for implementation of transition infrastructures on the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>The first blog outlines the five key intervention areas that present unique opportunities for macro capital to address directly the health, climate, economic, and social crises of our time. By understanding the interventions’ core underlying features we are then able to lay out ten strategic recommendations. All of them are linked together by new, or ‘re-coded’, forms of contractual and governance infrastructure for capital. These, in turn, can help foster net-zero, wealthier, and more resilient communities, with the robust social infrastructure necessary to address this new age of long emergencies.</p><p>Pathways Forward</p><p>What has emerged over the course of our work are five key areas of societal-scale transition infrastructures:</p>  Nature-based assets. These include <a href="https://cities4forests.com/project/45-cities-join-cities4forests-initiative-pledging-to-conserve-and-restore-forests/">trees</a>, wetlands, and pools of biodiversity. This future is being demonstrated by work across European cities, from Milan to Vienna and from Glasgow to Madrid, where municipalities are looking for whole-population-scale nature-based solutions. Examples include the planting of millions of street trees and the transformation of canopy cover across a city through the creation of a ring of urban forests. These solutions and future asset classes have some of the highest potential for capturable spillover values, whether that relates to the ‘heat island’ reduction effects of tree canopies, improvements to water drainage systems, or an array of health benefits such as the reduction of asthma rates in children. The need and value of these city-scale interventions are obvious but the viable operational, contractual, and governance means to execute and capitalise this vision are in urgent need of development. For more details, see some of our work at <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">https://treesasinfrastructure.com</a>.  Deep retrofitting of our cities. Many municipalities, including Malmö, Sweden, and Sofia, Bulgaria, have announced radical missions to retrofit what amounts to millions of homes across Europe by 2030. Some are exploring pathways for the physical retrofit of their entire cities. Increasingly, our work shows the need to move beyond house-by-house energy retrofits to whole-street and whole-district approaches and whole-city investment cases and business models. This needs to be integrated with parallel vertical-supply-chain innovation and collective strategic procurement across utilities, insurers, governments, and landowners. In these societal-scale aggregative models, the deployment of capital needs to be directly linked to the spillover value of a street-wide or district-wide retrofit strategy, with new mechanisms that allow for the capture of both direct and indirect benefits. By establishing community wealth models at the heart of this approach, we emphasise community-driven outcomes as a key de-risking factor for what is inevitably disruptive work in neighbourhoods.<br>This approach generates returns on a longitudinal and macro-investment scale, which may not always be captured through more traditional project measures such as internal rates of return (IRR). This is because the spillover effects go far beyond the direct energy savings or even the indirect health implications. They affect a city’s unemployment rates, the local velocity of spending, community wealth and GDP, and drive direct positive benefits with direct as well as more indirect beneficiaries. The contractual integration of this whole value case is vital to creating a sustainable financial proposition, and the community/street-driven transition is the key to growing distributed community wealth, moving us away from the disaster capital concentration of resources, innovation, and new monopolies.<br>Again, the need and value of city-scale and societal-scale intervention is clear. It enables enormous savings in yearly carbon emissions from existing residential properties — one of the <a href="https://materialeconomics.com/publications/decarbonizing-cities">key emissions sources</a> in our cities. Yet, our capacity to institutionally structure and organise the spillover values inherent in these societally entangled interventions is still missing. Without this capacity, residential retrofits will continue to be perceived, wrongly, as unpopular, capital-intensive, revenue-ineffective, and subsidy-dependent interventions, even if they are the only genuinely smart&nbsp;option.  Social infrastructures. The social and civic fabric in our cities has suffered significant and chronic under-investement. While new financing commitments are announced regularly, the fundamental challenge lies in the funding side of the business case, specifically targeting mechanisms to recognise and capture spillover values. A good example of a strategic social infrastructure investment is the $7-a-day universal childcare scheme in Quebec, Canada. The programme started in 1997, and over a period of twenty years led to a tripling of the number of mothers with children under the age of five who participate in the Quebec workforce. The impact has been particularly significant for middle-to-low-income women. The resulting economic benefits are vast: $5-billion added to Quebec’s GDP and a 64% reduction in the number households who received social assistance. The spillover effects over the past twenty years of every parent being in a position to choose when or whether they return to work has spread well beyond tax dollars and touched on almost every aspect of Quebec’s society. Empowered women make decisions on what level and quality of schooling their children receive, what local businesses they support, where they invest their education and retirement funds, and what types of communities they want to live in. Strategically investing in public childcare, supporting minority women and first-time immigrants by guaranteeing them a basic universal income, are all examples of social infrastructures that produce returns beyond IRR. Our ability to finance such civic goods is critical for any meaningful transition.  New, large-scale, urban developments. Even as the pandemic is undoubtedly impacting on cities’ fundamental economic and residential geography, many cities are (re)developing land for growth and economic adaptation. In this new age, large-scale developments cannot be justified by land value alone. Increasingly, they also need to be structured via a systems value lens — which is critical if they are to be sustainable, including both net-zero carbon in operational terms and from an embodied carbon perspective. As illustrated by our collaboration with the City of Edinburgh (and, more specifically, <a href="https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/27146/granton-waterfront-development-framework">Granton’s</a> Sustainability and Strategy initiative), they need to reconfigure a city’s housing offer, making it fit for a post-carbon, post-Covid economy. In addition, these developments need to be viewed in the context of how they can drive whole-value-chain innovations, how they support the seeding of new circular material and maintenance economies, and how they support the regeneration and adaptation of adjacent settlements. Equally important is how they can create the new regulatory innovations necessary to drive the wider transition of the city, and how they drive alternative tenures to rent and ownership, with an emphasis on the value of neighbourhoods rather than houses. Large-scale projects need to account for, drive, and value these system impacts if they are to manifest the societal outcomes necessary to support transition, and to justify the real estate sector’s social licence to operate in this age of long emergencies.  Agricultural land and our food systems as a whole. Our soil holds the key to both our health, as a source of food, and to carbon sequestration and restoring biodiversity. Any meaningful transition will require us to reconfigure our food and nutrition systems toward regenerative practices. At present, it is more expensive to purchase an organically grown local apple than one cultivated far away, on an industrial scale using environmentally harmful pesticides and chemicals. The latter also accumulates largely underpriced water waste and associated carbon emissions during its transportation to market. A systemic shift in the economy of land and agriculture is vital for the transition. It involves the redesign of incentives, repricing of externalities, the valuing of soil quality maintenance and regeneration, and the inclusion of carbon sequestration potential into the value of land. The system value of the asset is strategically understood, and the case, evidence, and values are increasingly validated. But we now need to build the funding, financing, contractual, and governance structures to manifest this fundamental value.  <p>In order to address the key challenges and asset classes of the future, we recognise there is an urgent need both to organise capital in an unprecedented manner and to re-code capital in contractual and governance terms — amongst other things, to enable the equitable and effective collaboration of public and ‘private’ capital. We believe that this re-coding of capital is fundamental to unlocking these near-now asset classes in order to generate their future&nbsp;values.</p> Re-Coding Capital <p>In order to manifest these near-now asset classes, three structural innovations are necessary.</p><p>Long Financing: New investment instruments for the long-term allocation of&nbsp;capital</p><p>Assets operating and functioning like infrastructure require both <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/futures-in-long-termism-16c1745c361c">long-term vision</a> and long-term allocation of capital. Building the capacity to finance a growing list of long-term transformational infrastructures will be a vital component of transition capital provision. This is hard to achieve within the constraints of short-term budgets and the need for rapid recycling of capital. How could we aim to reconfigure our cities and our communities for seven generations to come, if the nature of underlying investment remains locked to a period of eight-to-ten years?</p><p>For example, the idea of Smart Perpetual Bonds allows us to update an old financial instrument so that it meets the societal needs of the 21st century in a complex changing world.&nbsp;They:</p>  Replace the need for repayment of capital with the in-perpetuity offer of fixed&nbsp;income.  Create the capacity for the contingent pricing of value based on preconfigured variables with minimum transactional overheads.  Offer radical, real-time transparency in the factoring and distribution of value providing smart provenance for investment.  Offer the option for the fractional trading of smart coupons on digital secondary markets, enabling the return of capital and&nbsp;income.  <p>By implication, Smart Perpetual Bonds create pathways for financing a new class of assets that yield value across the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Analogue versions of these methods have long been in existence, and their digital transformation is well underway. Raising capital using digital solutions ensures additional protection against arbitraged appreciation and fixes the true value of underlying investment rather than the cumulative effect of trading opportunities and excessive servicing costs.</p><p>There is another benefit. The next generation of value-conscious investors are seeking long-wealth opportunities that both ensure a viable fixed return and lead to radical societal transformation. Private banks entrusted with managing their wealth are in search of solutions. Structuring a portfolio of long-financing instruments, with Smart Perpetual Bonds being one of them, will transition vast amounts of progressive wealth towards the solutions that our communities require.</p><p>Through <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/opinion/futures-in-long-termism/">The Long Alliance</a>, we will further develop the Smart Perpetual Bond as well as exploring other methods to channel long-term capital towards ‘long assets’, which are designed to provide returns far beyond our own lifetime.</p><p>New Public Governance Models: Off public balance sheets yet for public&nbsp;interest</p><p>Societal-scale interventions and whole-city transition infrastructures require new models of governance and organisation, which are fundamentally wired to acknowledge the societal entanglement of value. This involves building new institutional structures, which need to&nbsp;be:</p>  Systemically machine-readable.  Off public balance sheets yet publicly accountable.  Smart civic asset managers, which transparently balance the flows of value and interactions across an ecosystem of stakeholders with evolving incentives.  <p>These civic-development institutions are crucial mechanisms for contracting system value flows and the adjacent many-to-many spillovers. They represent the necessary progression of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), acknowledging our complex reality while limiting rent-seeking incentives that are traditionally structured into investment propositions.</p><p>These institutions would bridge the gap in terms&nbsp;of:</p>  Originating new approaches to financing.  Structuring and contracting the uplift value of these infrastructure investments.  Investing in the development of many micro community-driven assets — such as a network of urban forests — for generating collective outcomes.  Pooling and balancing flows of value across the&nbsp;system.  <p>Such civic-development vehicles will disrupt the existing dynamics of public/private relationships and prevent the use of rent-seeking mechanisms that are currently layered in every investment opportunity.</p><p>Innovating Funding: New mechanisms for contracting value&nbsp;flow</p><p>The challenge of financing this near-now transformation asset class is not the development of new funds in itself, but rather the structuring and contracting for spillover value in order to service the capital. This requires new ways and means of commingling the distributions of value and liabilities, generated and mitigated by these novel societal infrastructures.</p><p>This has all been made possible by developments in the application of smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies. Smart contracts give us the capacity to construct whole new sets of value flows and currencies. They allow and enable radically transparent, open, contingent, micro flows of value between stakeholders, facilitating an automated and almost frictionless means to transact, pool, aggregate, and couple across the ambient, micro, and known distributions of value and their spillovers, which, to date, were unaccountable and untradable.</p><p>While this future offers radical possibility, it also requires new digital institutional infrastructure, such as digital public registries for land. The provision of this public infrastructure is vital for unlocking this future and for creating next-generation investment markets for Civic Infrastructure Assets.</p> Ten Initial Recommendations <p>Making this future manifest in the near term requires tangible action now. A series of critical issues need to be addressed together if we are to make the necessary transition. For example, how Green New Deals and recovery investments concerning the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are structured over the next two quarters are essential to the direction we will take. While we continue to engage in research and development across several projects and with stakeholders from all sectors, the following initial recommendations are targeted in particular at governments (national and municipal) and strategic investment decision-makers. They form a six-month roadmap to create the necessary scaffolding that will enable a just transition to a post-carbon, post-Covid economy.</p>  Novel types of infrastructure. It is vital that we broaden, at a policy level, the definitional scope of infrastructure beyond roads, public transport and energy, to include both civic and nature-based assets. We need to recognise the vital role novel infrastructure will play in the transition our cities and places face. This reclassification of infrastructure also needs to acknowledge the role tangible and intangible assets play in the functioning of our cities. While cities accept that these assets need substantial investment to enable net-zero transition, they are burdened by legacy financing and accounting mechanisms, as well as by the practical inability to capture value; both issues prevent them from making this intuitive leap.  Impact investing. Social finance has paved the way for analysing a portfolio of returns rather than simply targeting a financial KPI. Now is the time to embed and advance these understandings and our initial outcomes-based finance strategies, developing a new investment thesis for transition infrastructures with a whole portfolio of impacts that can be captured in contracts. This will allow cities to escape the singularities of silo-value optimisation and the financial risk-return management of traditional infrastructures. It will enable them to capture a more holistic, population-scale stream of benefits from their transition investment portfolios.  Co-beneficiary infrastructures. It is clearly critical that we take a co-beneficiary view of all our infrastructure investments, designing them specifically to build synergies instead of optimising investment in solutions for singular outcomes. For example, we can choose to optimise nature-based solutions for carbon sequestration (which will encourage us to establish fenced-off forest reserves, replacing critical agricultural land and possibly ignoring biodiversity) or we can approach nature-based solutions as vital co-beneficiary assets, which have carbon-capturing capacity but also the means to manage heat island effects for energy utilities, health outcomes for communities, sustainable urban drainage benefits for water utilities, flood risk reduction for insurance companies, and which address our growing biodiversity crisis. In this way, a tree becomes an excellent source of return beyond a traditional measure of IRR and the means to regenerate our cities. The design of infrastructure assets for co-beneficiary returns requires intentional advocacy and horizontal policy infrastructure. This will be vital if we are to use our intergenerational transition investment for greatest efficacy.  Preferencing micro-infrastructures. Both resilience or anti-fragility, and community wealth development are necessary in an age of long emergencies. Across the global development landscape, we require a significant shift in our investment thesis, moving from a preference for large-scale, monolithic infrastructures to micro-networked, distributed infrastructure provision. To date, our urban and societal infrastructure development models have been skewed towards the large-scale and frequently disconnected from the local. A single, large forest is not the solution for cities, even if it feels easier and more efficient in terms of land assembly, procurement, and management. Instead, we need a network of dispersed micro urban forests, established and maintained by communities and neighbourhoods across the city, if we are to construct the intangible and tangible properties of these assets. This preference for micro and networked assets needs to be hardwired into our procurement thesis with appropriate community development and participation mechanisms.  Rapid investment in digital infrastructure and capacity. The migration from analogue to digital infrastructure needs to be systemically advanced at scale and speed in order to facilitate the transitional revolution. Technical innovation investment will need to permeate a new spectrum of open, real-time, digital public services, ranging from data-sensing with Agent-Based-Models (ABM) capabilities to advanced digital public registries. Public investment in the development of these digital and oracle infrastructures — including the legal, financial, and regulatory standards and protocols — is vital to unlocking the new classes of business and value models necessary for an equitable transition.  Transitioning from shovel-ready to shovel-worthy. Governments need to rapidly reassess the flow of infrastructure projects they have committed to fund, whether part of the Covid-19 recovery or pre-existing. This is necessary to ensure that they meet the priorities of the 21st century and are not locked into 2017/18 projections of the world to come. It also applies to investments in real estate, energy and transport, as these projects are often still ruled by short-term financing structures, with isolated linear value flows and private governance detached from the community wealth generation necessary as part of this transition investment. Building the rapid capacity for municipalities and provincial governments to undertake this review is vital and urgent, especially in a moment where there is increasing fiscal pressure and where economies worldwide are in a hiatus, providing a limited window of opportunity to redesign and reset infrastructures  Developing new viability tools, mechanisms, and protocols. Our existing viability assessment tools and mechanisms are completely outdated, and do not take into account the strategic risks our cities and societies face. For example, we cannot speak about transformation of our food systems and urban landscape without addressing the land valuation practices that discount regenerative farming and that deprioritise urban forests in favour of condominium developments. These deeply embedded practices span appraisal firms, accounting practices, building permits, zoning regulations, and municipal tax rates. If governments commit to strategic investment into the novel infrastructures discussed here, the positive effect on adjacent industries’ assessed spillover values is bound to be significant. Strategic creation of lead markets for nature-based solutions will ensure the emergence of e.g. innovation sectors around finance, remote-sensing technologies, and smart-contracting services in cities and countries. Rebuilding public viability assessment tools, valuation mechanisms, discount rates, and appraisal incentives to take into account such upsides is a vital and necessary component of an investment system fit for an age of long emergencies. We make what we measure and, currently, we measure the wrong&nbsp;things.  Developing alternative governance futures for transition infrastructures. PPP arrangements have not yielded the desired outcomes. Engineering a new typology of civic development vehicles that are off public balance sheets and yet publicly accountable should be the priority of every government.  Rapid experiments on the ground. It is essential that governments invest early and quickly in a portfolio of experimental probes that advance novel micro-infrastructure financing experiments, from whole-street retrofits to urban forest networks. The development of adjacent supply chains, policies, institutional infrastructure, innovation, and data-and-evidence collection is equally essential. Investing to learn and build the capabilities of vital adjacent industries will be essential to the success of any large-scale deployment. We are involved in several EIT Climate-KIC projects that are already doing this, such as ReCode, the Health Clean Cities Deep Demonstration, and the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/pandemic-response-projects-eit-crisis-initiative-covid-19/">Pandemic Response Projects</a> focussing on district retrofits. Many more are&nbsp;needed.  Market-making instruments.<br>Collective risk management facility. We need new hybrid institutions to pool and manage risk across both governmental departments and non-governmental sectors such as banks, utilities, and insurers. This pooling function will create the capacity to address the unmanaged long tail and the cascading risks that are a feature of the age of long emergencies. This function would further crystallise the demand for integrated procurement and co-beneficiary investment in civic infrastructure assets, thereby building the pathways for achieving outcomes such as lower asthma rates and decreased flooding occurrences.<br>Transition finance innovation sandbox. This should operate across government and non-governmental agencies, including policy-makers, regulators, professional institutes, standards agencies, investment houses and intermediaries, insurance organisations, rating agencies, and fintech startups, among others. Its primary purpose will be to support the design, experimentation, and implementation of new financial instruments and the necessary adjacent institutional infrastructure, including protocols, regulations, and standards for enabling the next-generation financial markets for transition investing.<br>Whole-value-chain investment. Governments will need to build on the learning from the many difficulties faced in initial Covid-19 response procurement, and invest in whole-value-chain renewal and innovation for a post-carbon, post-Covid economy. Addressing this crisis is not just about investing in a school or building a bridge, or even an urban forest. Its scale requires us to invest in the development of all of the resources and supply chains needed to truly build back better. The scale and speed of transition means we cannot wait for organic supply and demand matching and coordination to emerge. This will require the intentional acceleration of innovation capacity across whole supply chains.<br>For example, nature-based solutions require investment in remote-sensing capabilities as well as new financial instruments, and investment in elements as diverse as the production of seedlings, new labour market skills, or the capabilities and organisational cultures in municipal green space departments. The acceleration of these near-now infrastructure assets need rapid, coordinated investment across this whole supply chain, not only to match increased demand but to innovate practices, methods, and machinery for a post-carbon economy.<br>Building the institutional capacity to support the investments and innovation across whole value chains is vital to addressing the challenges of the transition and requires immediate governmental investment. This investment thesis needs to work in synchrony with the Green New Deals to drive the whole value chain innovation necessary for a post-carbon economy transition that is just and inclusive.  <p>Conclusion</p><p>The structural transformation our societies and cities need present us with systemic challenges that requires a system-based response. The announcement of new commercial or quasi-commercial funds will not resolve this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Our investment thesis is straightforward: we see the deep need for a new typology of value structuring which is macro in scale with regards to systemic orchestration, and micro and hyperlocal in the development of co-benefinary responses. We do not believe that projects simply connected to linear KPIs, funded by short-term investments, and governed by divergent long-term interests, are able to meet the urgent challenge any&nbsp;longer.</p><p>We see the roadmap unfolding through the parallel development of fundamental yet practical innovations across key asset classes, such as nature-based solutions and whole-city or whole-district retrofits. The political will and commitment is already manifest, yet the technical and functional capacity remains underdeveloped. To achieve the necessary scale and speed of systemic change will require a movement of open innovators and strategic sponsors across governments, sectors, and geographies.</p><p>We see cities and countries emerging as leaders and lead market makers as they invest in the digital transformation of their systems, creating secondary industries of technical expertise, and viewing their cities as platforms for novel asset development.</p><p>The next phase of this journey for us and our many partners is to develop on-the-ground experiments and to gather evidence in order to test and validate our investment hypothesis. We will openly share what we discover and&nbsp;learn.</p><p>If you want to find out more about how to engage with this mission, please contact <a href="https://medium.com/u/fc285852de98">Indy Johar</a>, Anastasia Mourogova Millin, Raj Kalia, <a href="https://medium.com/u/6cd2b63287b6">Joost Beunderman</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/u/9805eebdc48f">Chloe Treger</a> at <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a>.</p><p>We have been supported in this mission by our close partners, Dominic Hofstetter and Thomas Osdoba at EIT Climate-KIC, Viable Cities, The Long Alliance, and Emergence Room Alliance in Canada.

 Let’s Go&nbsp;Long.. <p>“We need to create opportunities to invest into a sustainable future… and at the same time design it in a way that we can finance&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Our societal institutional infrastructures no longer have the capacity to consider the future meaningfully. The examples of climate change mitigation, plastic pollution, and structural deficits in funding infrastructure (novel or normal), demonstrate an inability to manage future risks and needs at a societal&nbsp;level.</p><p>While many would agree that societies need to build new capacities to address the strategic institutional deficits, the challenge is that our current mode of coordinating the future — using finance to shift capital — is premised on imposing certainty through the need for long-term security of investments. This is to the detriment of a more holistic future. Critically, such an approach discounts whatever lies outside the socio-economic system, such as nature, pollution, future risk, and so on. In this reality even our agents of ‘long-term finance’, such as insurance providers and pension funds, seem to have become hopelessly short-termist and&nbsp;siloed.</p><p>In response to this challenge, we need to regenerate the societal capacity&nbsp;to:</p>  Democratise the capability to think and act in the long term rather than making this the preserve of the&nbsp;few.  Manage long-term strategic risks and opportunities. Risks and doing nothing about them is not adequately priced across society, with institutional incentives in place to purposely evade their true costs and implications. One key dimension of long-termism requires us to re-construct our relationship with risk, acknowledging not just the risk we face but, systematically, the risks our present inaction generates.  Governing for the long term: In 2019, there were over 33,000 businesses in Japan over a century old, according to research firm Teikoku Data Bank. However, according to Professor Richard Foster of Yale University, the average lifespan of a company listed in the S&amp;P 500 index of leading US companies has decreased by more than fifty years over the last century, from sixty-seven years in the 1920s to just fifteen years today. The prerequisite for aggregation of long-term value or long-term liabilities is the development of new capabilities to govern and manage inter-generationally. This is a skill we need to redevelop.  Build 21st-century facilities to finance the evolutionary future, not just the long, extended&nbsp;present.  <p>It is the last of these capacities that The Long Alliance has chosen to explore — which is not to overlook or diminish the relevance of the other capacities and how essential they are to its success. In this age of transition and long emergencies, the structuring and appropriation of value will play a vital role in the nature of the future we construct.</p> The Long&nbsp;Need. <p>Initial conversations with a range of investors and wealth managers have revealed that the next generation of value-conscious investors recognise this strategic failure and see an opportunity for a societal arbitrage of the current short-termism of our financial industry.</p><p>Throughout 2020, we have been developing an investment thesis with partners setting out the parameters of this facility. Based on this work and initial quantitative research, we are able to outline the ten key dimensions of arbitrage:</p>  The need for new portfolio strategies for a novel set of long assets fit for the 21st century. Investments in long assets to be correlated with societal infrastructures from nature-based infrastructure solutions, human development infrastructures, and soil / regenerative agriculture.  Indexation of next-generation investment factors for long investing. For example, a preference for long investments to be allocated in deep democracies.  Investment in long assets that yield value through a portfolio of funding instruments (e.g. ecosystem benefits from improvements to the water drainage capacity, longitudinal energy reduction to an array of health benefits).  Development of a new suite of investment instruments for long-term investment horizons (e.g. a Smart perpetual bond that pays a contingent fixed spread above a benchmark rate, with the only recorded liability representing the consistent servicing of this instrument).  Design of new fund structures and mechanisms that build capabilities for long-term management and restructuring rights, while incentivising for longitudinal returns. This challenges the traditional 2/20 free structure and 5/10 maturity cycles such as smart public trusts/foundations, which are off public balance sheets yet for public interest, with the full capacity to hybridise public and private capital&nbsp;flows.  Investment in the development of the institutional frameworks for long investments from accounting, valuation, ratings, regulatory standards, and protocols.  Development of new transactional capabilities, which are fractional, real-time, and smart contingent.  Transition beyond fiat currencies: Decoupling fiat currency risk from a security or asset. With a preference for investments and returns to be linked to non-fiat currencies/value stores, from future energy options to bitcoins.  Design of investment strategies focused on sector-shaping and whole-supply-chain development rather than traditional products and services.  Structure capital for over twenty-five-year investment horizons and beyond. Incubate the emerging appetite for twenty-five-year investment horizons among next-generation High Net Worth Individuals to create a pathway to institutional investors with fixed-income requirements. Thereby bridge the gap between single-generation investment horizons of current lead investors to the needs of seven-generation stewardship.  <p>This framework only scratches the surface of the challenges we need to address to create a long-financing societal capacity. Detailed questions remain to be addressed.</p>  What are the investment terms (e.g. tenor, right to restructure, right to future production, right to dissolve)? What is the contracting infrastructure to deliver&nbsp;that?  How is risk quantified, verified, and managed? How would ratings agencies calibrate their methodologies for ultra-long-term horizons? How would societal legitimacy be structured?  How are the outcomes measured and verified in real-time? How do we model net present values, taking into account the ultra-long-tail risk generated by the investment? Does cost-benefit analysis need to be broadened to become risk-opportunity analysis? Do discount rates have social utility in ultra-long-term investment? If so, what are these&nbsp;rates?  What currency would be used to invest in long-term mechanisms? Is a new form of cryptocurrency necessary to ensure long-value transactions and yields over the period of investment?  How would decisions be made? What are the processes or structures for making investment or restructuring decisions? Whose interests would be taken into account for decision-making? How will the interests of future generations be taken into consideration?  How would long entities be governed? Would there be a board of trustees? Or could we use innovative technologies to unlock dynamic accountability and distributed decision-making mechanisms?  What types of contracting infrastructure would be needed for long investing, and how do we make them persistent, open, and legible over the time periods of investment?   Next Steps for An Alliance For Long Financing. <p>There remains little doubt regarding the depth of the challenge we face as a society. There is an urgent need to rebalance our hyper-reactive agility with long-term perspectives. We recognise the scale of the task outlined. To realise this future, we will need an alliance of leaders to drive this change; a movement working to create the systemic change necessary for long-term financing.</p><p>Key next steps&nbsp;involve:</p>  Developing the eligibility criteria for a model portfolio.  Selecting eligible long&nbsp;assets.  Constructing a shadow / prototype portfolio.  Prototyping the contracting and governance infrastructure.  Co-designing a long-financing regulatory sandbox with external counterparties for the development of new financial instruments and vehicles.  <p>These solution pathways require extensive innovation and testing of unproven ideas. We have outlined our ideas and recommendations in the hope of opening a dialogue and further testing our assumptions.</p><p>If you want to find out more about how to engage with this mission and join this wider movement, please contact <a href="https://medium.com/u/9805eebdc48f">Chloe Treger</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/fc285852de98">Indy Johar</a> at <a href="http://Info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a>.</p><p>This mission is being developed as part of the long alliance an initiative focused on channelling long-term capital towards long-term innovation.

				  Indicio.tech finishes a working “mediator agent” and contributes its code to Hyperledger Aries and ACA-Py making it possible to communicate verifiable credentials to mobile devices via open source standards. Indicio is hosting a freely available test mediator agent for developers.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Indicio.tech, a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity, today announced the launch—and availability for open testing—of the Indicio Mediator Agent. The company is also donating the underlying code to the open source <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries">Hyperledger Aries project</a><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries">.</a></p>
<p>“It’s simple,” says Indicio CEO Heather Dahl. “If verifiable digital credentials are to be exchanged and identity verified, people need to be able to manage them on their mobile devices through an app. The mediator agent can be thought of as the pipe that enables this to happen.”</p>
<p>“The mediator is the tool that provides a cloud-based connection point to send and receive requests between mobile holders and issuers and verifiers,” says Indicio CTO, Ken Ebert. “We built it to make our clients’ projects work, and we contributed it to the open source community because a working mediator agent is critical to widespread adoption of decentralized identity.”</p>
<p>The Indicio Mediator Agent is the company’s latest contribution to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and the Aries Toolbox. Following <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md">RFC 0211: Mediator Coordination</a>, Indicio built on the work of the open-source community to make mediation interoperable and vendor agnostic. This expands the opportunities for mobile wallet implementations.</p>
<p>As part of these contributions, mediation can be managed and debugged through ACA-Py’s built-in Admin REST API or the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox">Aries Toolbox</a>.</p>
<p>“We believe in an open-source foundation for decentralized identity,” says Dahl. “But as a professional services company, we couldn’t wait for critical technology to spontaneously mature—and, more importantly, our clients couldn’t wait either. So we’re filling the technical gaps, and making the code available for everyone to get building.”</p>
<p>For the Mediator Agent tools and repositories at Hyperledger Aries, access is available&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox">here</a>.</p>
<p>Indicio Offers Mediator Agent Workshops</p>
<p>To bring developers up to date on this latest contribution to the open source community, Indicio has prepared an instructor-led workshop focusing on the use and application of the Mediator Agent. Developers will learn how to access the repository, how to use an agent, and then discuss possible use cases.</p>
<p>“One thing we’ve found is that the community is hungry for professional development opportunities.” says Ebert. “By providing private training, we have motivated engineers to learn more about decentralized identity, develop use cases, and shorten the time between development, demonstration and even launch. We tailor our training&nbsp; to those&nbsp; points in the decentralized identity development journey that give the most trouble to those who want to pick up this technology and get to work building products and services.”</p>
<p>To book a private, instructor-led Mediator Agent training workshop, <a href="https://indicio.tech/#contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Indicio-hosted Mediator Agent ready for developer testing </p>
<p>Those who want to build solutions using a mediator agent now can use Indicio’s free, hosted version of the mediator for testing, development, and demonstrations. This will shorten the time to develop proof-of-concept and pilot solutions, and help with ensuring interoperability.</p>
<p>Anyone in the decentralized identity community will have access to the mediator agent code via the open source contribution in the ACA-Py library.</p>
<p>You can access the Indicio-hosted Public Test Mediator Agent <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">here.</a></p>

 2020 — A Year to&nbsp;Remember  Looking Back on Ocean’s Progress and&nbsp;Growth <p>2020 has been a long, albeit, memorable year for the Ocean&nbsp;team.</p><p>Crypto is intense in normal times but when you layer on a global health crisis that leads to unprecedented disruption of our day-to-day activities, the rollercoaster flipped and flopped us around like never before. It’s hard to see how any other year can&nbsp;compare.</p><p>To a large extent, crypto has been insulated from the economic upheaval. Crypto might even have benefited. The government response of quantitative easing and stimulus programs raised fears of currency debasement, which brought new converts and established crypto as a reliable asset class and a store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>Teams turned inwards to build out technology and focus on user adoption, rather than travel around to conferences. Projects cut out expenses to extend runways and ready themselves for an extended crypto-winter. And as the year progressed, people were finally able to play with working production code, and integrate with other projects to allow the entire space to mature together at a rapid&nbsp;pace.</p><p>At Ocean, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">started 2020 with an ambitious plan </a>to fulfill all of the covenants made since our project inception in 2017&nbsp;. Having released Ocean V1 at the end of 2019, which included the Pacific Network, our service execution agreements to govern access control, for 2020, we wanted&nbsp;to:</p>  Deliver Ocean V2 “Compute-to-Data”, our most requested feature  Re-architect and build out Ocean V3, datatokens using Ethereum infrastructure for the smart contracts and the ERC20 datatokens.  Build Ocean Market as a platform for data providers to meet with consumers and help to launch Initial Data Offerings  Have Ocean running in a fully decentralized manner on unstoppable infrastructure  Deploy a DAO and set the stage for community-based funding for Ocean ecosystem projects.  <p>These were ambitious goals. We were going to give it our best shot to achieve&nbsp;them.</p><p>I’m pleased to declare, that all of the promises made in 2017 were fully discharged. Everything that was promised, was delivered.</p><p>Even better, the nascent community around Ocean grew into a sizable and vocal “Navy”. The many ecosystem programs that had germinated in 2019, were fully deployed in 2020. The Ocean Ambassador, Shipyard and Data Economy Challenge programs were expanded and are reaching critical mass. The Telegram community became more diverse with multiple languages being supported by community members. We have a lively discussion on Discord. And the number of new contributors to our Github repository is growing&nbsp;rapidly.</p><p>We struck new partnerships with other projects and companies like Daimler, dexFreight, Filecoin, GAIA-X, Secret Network, the United Nations ITU and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>The $OCEAN token has increased in value 30x from the lows in Q3/2019, the number of holders has increased from 5,000 to over 20,000, and it is now listed on more than 35 exchanges with traded volumes ranging from $10–25 million per day. $OCEAN tokens have come so far from the days when there would be only $20–50k in daily traded&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Looking solely from the perspective of the Ocean, 2020 was a breakout year in all ways. We are truly blessed as a global, borderless community, fighting the good fight to build an open Data Economy that is accessible to everyone.</p><p>2021 promises to be a year of growth — see you&nbsp;there!</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					 <p>The year 2020 was quite the year for everyone. Despite its challenges, 2020 was a significant year of growth for the Trinsic platform, team, and brand. Below, we highlight the moments of growth in 2020 that we will never forget.</p>

					 <p>At the beginning of 2020, we <a href="https://trinsic.id/launch/">launched</a> the world’s first self-sovereign identity (SSI) platform. This included our powerful multi-tenant API platform, the Developer Portal (now called <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>) and a new and improved version of the Streetcred Wallet (now called <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>). Trinsic Studio, built on our powerful API platform, made it easy for developers to start issuing credentials in minutes and manage their credential exchange.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the first production-grade SSI platform to market (prior to this there were only betas, alphas, early-access, pre-release, and other non-production solutions). And it was the first time anyone, not just software engineers, could get started with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to today, with hundreds of developers actively using Trinsic, we decided it was time to release the next generation of our Studio. The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-releases-trinsic-studio-2-0/">release of Trinsic Studio 2.0</a> included a simplified <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing model</a>, an improved design, and better performance. These changes to Trinsic Studio have made SSI more accessible than ever. See for yourself at <a href="https://trinsic.studio">https://trinsic.studio</a>.</p>

					 <p>One of the biggest moments in 2020 was when we <a href="https://trinsic.id/streetcred-id-rebrands-to-trinsic-raises-pre-seed-funding/">raised pre-seed funding</a> from institutional investors and <a href="https://trinsic.id/introducing-trinsic/">rebranded</a> from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. <a href="https://www.kickstartfund.com/">Kickstart Seed Fund</a> led the oversubscribed round as the first investment of its recently-closed <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/29/2024148/0/en/Kickstart-Seed-Fund-Announces-the-Close-of-110-Million-Fund-V.html">$110 million fund</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of this investment, Dalton Wright, Partner at Kickstart Seed Fund, said, “Decentralized identity enables us to finally introduce human trust to the internet, something that has been sorely needed for decades. We’ve been anxiously waiting for an opportunity to invest in this space for years, and when we came across Trinsic, we knew we wanted in. Trinsic is doing for decentralized identity what Stripe did for online payments.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time as our funding announcement, we introduced our new company name and brand—Trinsic. This rebrand included the launch of our new website and <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-introduces-new-design-system/">design system</a>. It has been great to see how our new name has been received with open arms from our developer community and the SSI community in general.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
						 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Product and feature improvements 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>One of the main questions at Trinsic that drives our decision-making is: What will make SSI more accessible? With the excellent feedback we receive from our developer community and the skills of our world-class engineering team, we consistently work to improve our platform to answer that question. In addition to the ongoing addition of new Aries RFCs and extensions to the platform, here are a few noteworthy product and feature updates:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">Provider API:</a> We added a third API to our platform called the Provider API—the first product built specifically for SSI providers. The Provider API allows you to programmatically create and manage credential issuers/verifiers.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">Portable digital wallets:</a> Trinsic, Lissi, and esatus AG were the first SSI vendors to achieve wallet portability. This means that for the first time a person could stop using one type of digital wallet and start using a new one without losing their credentials.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/new-documentation-site/">New &amp; improved documentation site:</a> We released a new documentation site which includes a knowledge base for those that want to learn SSI concepts, our API reference, and a public developer forum.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/interactive-connections/">Interactive connections:</a> Interactive connections enable people to have richer interactions with others when using the Trinsic Wallet. This includes the following features: proactive credential sharing, interoperable chat messaging, an activity log, and connection invitations.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Integrate SSI directly with 2,000+ other applications 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>This year, Trinsic partnered with workflow automation platform <a href="http://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to bring verifiable credentials to over 2,000 other SaaS apps you use every day, including Office 365, GSuite, Adobe, Atlassian, Slack, Salesforce, and many more. After we released this, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> used it to integrate Eventbrite (registration &amp; ticketing) with Trinsic (verifiable credentials) in order to issue IIW tickets as verifiable credentials. See our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/zapier-tutorial">tutorial </a>to learn how to get started fast with an example.</p>

					 <p>At the beginning of the global pandemic, Trinsic along with many others in the SSI space, saw the potential that verifiable credentials could have in mitigating the effects of COVID-19. We responded by helping start the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> and called upon the world to explore how verifiable credentials could be used to respond to the virus. Since our initial <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/call-to-action-verifiable-credentials-covid-19-a180155a157c">call to action</a>, dozens of developers and organizations have used Trinsic to build SSI solutions related to COVID-19. The solutions include receiving COVID-19 testing and vaccination credentials. Here are a few examples:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/medcreds/">MedCreds: Reducing the Risk of Returning to Work During COVID-19</a>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/decreasing-unemployment-verifiable-credentials/">Decreasing Unemployment Among African Youth Using Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/verifiable-credentials-and-smart-contracts-for-covid19-data-management/">Combining Verifiable Credentials and Smart Contracts for COVID-19 Data Management</a>

					 Indicio becomes a public benefit corporation 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  New structure supports the company’s mission, values, and its belief that identity technology should serve the public interest.   
			   
				
				
				 <p>Decentralized identity is a transformational technology that can protect an individual’s privacy, enable their consent in data sharing, and provide a pathway to formal identity for hundreds of millions of people currently without any legal means of proving who they are. Indicio.tech was founded to advance decentralized identity through providing the kind of professional services and critical infrastructure that can catalyze adoption of this technology. Today, in recognition of the role it can play in building and shaping a technology for the greater good, Indicio, announces that it has reincorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC).</p>
<p>Indicio joins companies such as Patagonia and Kickstarter in embracing a corporate model that aligns shareholders and stakeholders around a shared mission to deliver a material benefit to society, not only through products and services and how they are made and delivered, but through prioritizing the welfare of employees, diversity and inclusion, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>“When it comes to our digital lives, it is hard to think of a technological advance more beneficial to the public than decentralized identity,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “It will transform people’s digital lives by giving them control over who they are online and who they share information with. It will create identity for the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack formal, legal identity, which means giving them a way to access financial and health services. The advances in identity technology help us recover some of the lost, early idealism of the internet as a benefit to everyone. And while we know one company can’t save the world, we can take a stand about how the world can be a better place. Decentralized identity is our stand.”</p>
<p>As a Delaware PBC, the company will operate under the same management structure and corporate and tax laws it does today and with the same commitment to strong growth and profitability.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity needs a variety of business models to rapidly scale,” says Dahl. “And we think for Indicio, the PBC model combines the best attributes of the traditional for-profit corporation with the public mission orientation of a nonprofit. We need to be agile. We need to be sustainable. We need to be innovative. And we need all of these qualities to be directed, without compromise, toward advancing decentralized identity.”</p>
<p>“For Indicio, becoming a PBC means honoring the idealism of the open source community that brought decentralized identity technology into existence,” says Ken Ebert CTO. “This means open sourcing the infrastructure that we build, and by making interoperability the compass point that directs how we build for others. Indicio has already begun doing this by open-sourcing its monitoring tools package and the company is about to release more tools and services that will make it easier for companies to develop and use decentralized identity solutions.”</p>
<p>As a PBC, Indicio will continue to pioneer architectural solutions and deliver superlative development and engineering support to its list of global clients, and it will do so by cultivating a company culture where employees and interns can get the professional development and mentoring they need in order to consistently deliver their best.</p>
<p>“When we reflect on the values that inspired our launch, propelled our growth, and delivered for our clients, we want to bake them into our company,” says Dahl. “We want to hold ourselves accountable to those values, and we want to be held publicly accountable for them. That’s a powerful feature of the PBC model. And just as it has enabled credible, third-party assessment on whether a company is delivering on its environmental commitments, we see it as providing a path for identity technology to be assessed in a similar way. There’s a long way to go, but at a time, when technology is under increasing criticism, we have a chance to build better and audit better from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Indicio joins a growing number of companies worldwide embracing the public benefit corporate model recognizing that businesses can build greater long-term value by committing to stakeholders, employees, and communities. So far, 35 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation enabling public benefit corporations (sometimes called benefit corporations), and many countries have followed with similar legislation.</p>
<p>Indicio’s PBC status will position the company as a leader in trusted identity platform builders as they advance the technology, the industries it serves, and connect the growing field of decentralized identity vendors. Indicio will set out its public benefit goals in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Dock’s token migration commenced on the 8th of Dec and to date over 76M DOCK have been migrated through our portal so far. To incentivize holders to migrate, we offered a bonus to those who migrated within the first 4 weeks of the migration start, a total of 50M DOCK were set aside by the Dock Association for this purpose. You can read more about the incentives <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-2-incentives/">here</a>. </p><p>While it is possible for holders to migrate directly with Dock, some of the community prefer to migrate via exchanges who have been working to enable trading and withdrawals of the new token. In the interests of providing more time for that work to complete, and to ensure that as many of the community as possible can migrate and receive the incentives, we have decided to extend the incentivization period to midnight (GMT) on the 11th of January. This represents a one week extension. All other migrations dates and timings remain the same.</p>

   Common table expressions are a powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server. They allow you to store a temporary result and execute a statement afterward using that result set. These can be helpful when trying to accomplish a complicated process that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs allow you to perform difficult operations in two distinct steps that make the challenge easier to solve.

  <p>Common table expressions are a powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server. They allow you to store a temporary result and execute a statement afterward using that result set. These can be helpful when trying to accomplish a complicated process that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs allow you to perform difficult operations in two distinct steps that make the challenge easier to solve.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn how to write common table expressions using Microsoft SQL Server. You will then learn how to use that statement in a .NET Core MVC web application that is secured using Okta. Okta is a powerful yet easy to use single sign-on provider. By making use of Okta’s <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from Nuget, you will learn how to secure your application and any data from your CTEs properly.</p>

 Secure Your SQL CTE with an Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you want to do is set up your Okta application to handle your authentication. If you haven’t done so yet, you can sign up for a free developer account <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta Developer console and click on Add Application. Select Web and click Next. On the next page, give your Okta application a meaningful name. You will also want to replace your URIs’ ports from 8080 to 3000. Finally, set your Logout redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/signout/callback</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Done, and you will be taken to your application home screen. Make note of your Client ID, Client secret, and Okta domain, as you will need these in your web application.</p>

 Prepare the SQL Database to Use with Your CTE 

<p>To work on your database, you will need to have a database first. Microsoft provides several samples via Github. For this project, I used the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0">Wide World Importers sample database v1.0</a>. To use this, you will need to have at least SQL 2016 installed. Microsoft provides <code>.bak</code> and <code>.bacpac</code> files for you to use.</p>

 Common Table Expressions (CTEs) 

<p>Common table expressions are a temporary result set created by a simple query. Once this result set is obtained, you can perform SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, or MERGE operations on it. CTEs can be used in place of a complicated query - one with difficult joins and logic in it. By operating on a temporary result set, you can simplify the process, making it more readable, easier to optimize, and easier to debug. Let’s take a look at how CTEs work, and how they can make your life easier.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice is that the tax rates are all wrong. You aren’t supposed to charge tax unless the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code> is <code>90490</code>. So, you’ll need to update each line item in the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table. But, to get the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code>, you need a join from the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table to the <code>Invoices</code> table; then, a join  to the <code>Customers</code> table. You can round up the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code> and associate it to the <code>InvoiceID</code> with SELECT, using the common table expression below. Next, you can run one statement using the temporary results set <code>tax_update</code>. After creating your results set of <code>InvoiceID</code> and <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code>, you can update the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table with the new <code>TaxRate</code>, and then you can update the <code>TaxAmount</code> and <code>ExtendedPrice</code> with ease.</p>

   <code>--****************************
--BEGIN CTE
--****************************
WITH tax_update (InvoiceID, DeliveryPostalCode) AS (    SELECT 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].InvoiceID, 
        DeliveryPostalCode 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
        INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].CustomerID = [Sales].[Customers].CustomerID
) 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxRate = CASE WHEN DeliveryPostalCode = '90490' THEN 6.00 ELSE 0 END 
FROM 
    tax_update 
WHERE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].InvoiceID = tax_update.InvoiceId

--****************************
--END CTE
--****************************

UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxAmount = TaxRate * Quantity * UnitPrice 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    ExtendedPrice = TaxAmount +(Quantity * UnitPrice)
</code>   

<p>Next, you can write a select using a CTE. The example below is a bit simple for a CTE (you can accomplish this just with a join) but it serves the purpose of showing you how a CTE is written for selects.</p>

<p>Here, you are selecting the <code>CustomerID</code> to use to obtain the <code>CustomerName</code> from the <code>Customers</code> table, along with the <code>StockItemId</code> to obtain the <code>StockItemName</code> in your application.</p>

   <code>WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemId, 
        SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
        SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
    GROUP BY 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemID
) 
SELECT 
    CustomerName, 
    customer_items.Quantity, 
    customer_items.LineProfit, 
    [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
FROM 
    customer_items 
    INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
    INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]
</code>   

 Create Your ASP.NET Core Web Application 

<p>Your SQL database is now set up, and it’s time to begin working on your web application. Open Visual Studio 2019 and Create a new project. Select ASP.NET Core Web Application and press Next. Select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). Ensure your framework is set to .NET Core 3.1 and uncheck Configure for HTTPS. Press Create and wait for your application scaffold.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your application is created, open the project properties window and change your App URL to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to match your Okta settings. Next, import the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from NuGet.</p>

 <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0
</code> 

<p>Once that is completed, you can begin to add your code. First, take a look at your <code>appsettings.json</code> file. This is where you will add application-specific variables such as your Okta information or any connection strings. Replace the code in this file with the following. You will need to replace the <code>WideWorldImporters.ConnectionString</code> information with your connection string.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "WideWorldImporters": {
    "ConnectionString": "{yourConnectionString}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a file to hold the SQL Settings for <code>WideWorldImporters</code>. Add a new folder called <code>Settings</code>, and add a class file called <code>SqlSettings.cs</code> to it. Add the following code:</p>

   <code>public class SqlSettings
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>This very simple class will be populated at start-up and injected into your controllers as needed. You can see that process by opening your <code>Startup.cs</code> file and replacing the code with the following:</p>

   <code>public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
        {
            options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        })
       .AddCookie()
       .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
       {
           OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:OktaDomain"),
           ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
           ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
           Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
       });

        services.Configure&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("WideWorldImporters"));

        services.AddControllersWithViews();
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
            app.UseHsts();
        }
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseAuthentication();
        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
        {
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate, but there are a few things you should note. First, the <code>Configure</code> method doesn’t pre-populate with <code>app.UseAuthentication()</code>, so you will need to add it here.</p>

<p>Next, you set up your Okta middleware in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method. You also register your <code>WideWorldImporters</code> SQL configuration in this method.</p>

<p>To consume the <code>WideWorldImporters</code> in your controller, you will need to let .NET Core inject it, and then use it. You can see how this is done in the <code>DashboardController</code>. Add a file to your <code>Controllers</code> folder called <code>DashboardController.cs</code>, and replace the code with the following:</p>

   <code>public class DashboardController : Controller
{
    IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt; _sqlSettings;

    public DashboardController(IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt; sqlSettings)
    {
        _sqlSettings = sqlSettings;
    }

    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(getDashboardIndexModel());
    }

    protected Models.DashboardIndexViewModel getDashboardIndexModel()
    {
        DataTable dt = new DataTable();

        string cmdText = 
            @"WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
            LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemId, 
                    SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
                    SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
                 FROM 
                    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
                    INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
                GROUP BY 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemID
            ) 
            SELECT 
                CustomerName, 
                customer_items.Quantity, 
                customer_items.LineProfit, 
                [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
            FROM 
                customer_items 
                INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
                INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]";

        SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmdText, new SqlConnection(_sqlSettings.Value.ConnectionString));

        da.Fill(dt);

        return new Models.DashboardIndexViewModel(dt);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The application is injecting the <code>IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt;</code> object into this controller. You can reference it later to obtain the connection string for your database. Speaking of your database, this controller also contains the logic for building the model for your view. You will add the model momentarily, but for now, you notice that you are using <code>ADO.Net</code> to call the CTE you wrote earlier. This works just as well with Dapper or Entity Framework; ADO.Net was chosen here because it’s the simplest to set up.</p>

<p>Add a new class to the <code>Models</code> folder called DashboardIndexViewModel and add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>public class DashboardIndexViewModel
{
    public List&lt;DashboardLineItem&gt; Items { get; set; }

    public DashboardIndexViewModel(System.Data.DataTable items)
    {
        Items = new List&lt;DashboardLineItem&gt;();

        foreach (System.Data.DataRow row in items.Rows)
        {
            Items.Add(
                new DashboardLineItem(
                    row["CustomerName"].ToString(),
                    Convert.ToInt32(row["Quantity"]),
                    Convert.ToDecimal(row["LineProfit"]),
                    row["StockItemName"].ToString()
                    )
                );
        }
    }
}

public class DashboardLineItem
{
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public string StockItemName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal LineProfit { get; set; }

    public DashboardLineItem(string customerName, int quantity, decimal lineProfit, string stockItemName)
    {
        CustomerName = customerName;
        Quantity = quantity;
        LineProfit = lineProfit;
        StockItemName = stockItemName;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This model is just taking the items from the query you ran earlier and injecting them into a nice view-model for your view.</p>

<p>Next, add a controller to your <code>Controllers</code> folder called <code>AccountController</code> if one does exist. Replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>public class AccountController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
        }

        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Dashboard");
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult SignOut()
    {
        return new SignOutResult
        (
            new[]
            {
                    OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                    CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
            },
            new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" }
        );
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This code will set your application to use Okta authentication. In the <code>SignIn</code> method, you look to see if the user is already logged in. If they aren’t, you return a challenge which will redirect them to Okta for authentication. Once the user is logged in, they will be directed to the <code>Dashboard/Index</code> page. The signout method will redirect users back to the home page.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to add your views. First, open your <code>Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;

        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
            &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;
                        &lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;
                            &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;

                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)

                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                    }
                &lt;/div&gt;

</code>   

<p>This view has some logic that detects if the user is logged in or not. If the user isn’t logged in, you will display a <code>Login</code> button to them; if they are already logged in, you’ll display a <code>Logout</code> button.</p>

<p>Next, open your home page and add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /container --&gt;
</code>   

<p>There is nothing critical to the application here; it simply provides some extra links for you to read for further learning.</p>

<p>Finally, add or update your <code>Dashboard/Index.cshtml</code> view with the following code:</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
}

@model CTEsDemo.Models.DashboardIndexViewModel

&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Customer Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Line Profit&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Stock Item Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach(var item in Model.Items)
        {
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@item.CustomerName&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@item.Quantity&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@item.LineProfit.ToString("C")&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@item.StockItemName&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code>   

<p>This view displays the data in a nice table for your users to see.</p>

 Test Your Application 

<p>Your application is now ready to start. Press F5 to begin debugging. You should be presented with the home page. From there, you can click on Login or Dashboard. Either should bring you to the Okta login screen. Log in with your Okta account, and you will be presented with the Dashboard.</p>

 2020 has been a year like no other. Yet despite the many challenges we’ve faced — we’ve managed to scale our company, and launch a full suite of passwordless authentication products and services for the enterprise.  The year that pushed the world to passwordless <p>Like all businesses, new and old, we’ve had our company direction rerouted by the result of unprecedented travel restrictions, lockdowns, a global recession, and the tumultuous political and social movements that captured and held the attention of people all around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The events of this unforgettable year forced businesses to adapt to how they operate — and one positive outcome we noticed is that this has catapulted enterprises into an era of accelerated digital transformation. We’ve seen unprecedented recognition for the need to protect critical systems and data with zero-trust security solutions — and as a result we’re seeing an increasing appetite for passwordless authentication solutions like ours, that are powered by privacy-first technology.</p><p>In what was already a turning point year for passwordless authentication, the urgency for privacy-first, zero-trust solutions has been continually fueled by high profile hacks and breaches such as the Russian led Solar Winds Attack on the US government agencies, the Twitter hack that targeted the followers of high profile users and the ongoing Spotify hacks… to name just a&nbsp;few.</p><p>Read more on what our CTO and co-founder has to say on COVID-19 driving adoption of passwordless solutions…</p><p><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/covid19-catalyst-biometrics/">Will COVID-19 be the Catalyst to Finally Replace Passwords With Biometrics?</a></p> How far we’ve come in just one&nbsp;year <p>At this time last year, we’d only just finished building out our platform’s core technology — <a href="https://keyless.io/technology">the Keyless Protocol</a>. The Keyless Protocol combines privacy-enhancing technologies with modern biometrics to enable real-time biometric authentication powered by the Keyless Network. The Keyless Network utilizes a distributed cloud architecture to process and store encrypted authentication data.</p> Breakthroughs in biometric authentication <p>We successfully applied for five patents to date for our novel technology — of these, one is a non-provisional patent, and four are provisional. Our breakthroughs in privacy-first, distributed biometric authentication are enabling a shift away from device-dependent authentication, towards a more unified and user-friendly authentication experience.</p><p>The breakthrough shift from device-dependent biometric authentication, to device in-dependent biometric authentication, means we can use a single, universal set of biometric templates to authenticate and identify users across multiple devices, in a way that enhances privacy compliance, rather than impeding&nbsp;it.</p><p>As a result we’re able to provide secure, private and user-friendly solutions that can help solve some of the larger issues around how we manage identities across the internet.</p> Ensuring Privacy and Security Compliance <p>Since biometric data is considered sensitive, personal information, the use of biometrics is regulated in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, and other similar regulations around the world such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>We’ve made significant headway validating our compliance stance with these regulations, as well as with directives such as the Revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2), which mandates what strong-customer authentication solutions should&nbsp;provide.</p><p>In total we’ve completed five compliance assessments this year, and have been actively engaging industry alliances, such as the FIDO Alliance, to educate certification bodies around the benefits of applying privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed cloud systems to biometric-enabled authentication.</p> Rapid growth, and US $6.2 million in&nbsp;backing <p>This year we not only scaled our team, going from 15 to 32 employees in under twelve months, which forced us to move into brand new offices in the centers of Rome and London. We also <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/preventing-data-breaches-keyless-secures-2-2m-round/">brought our funding to US $6.2 million</a> — a tremendous sign of confidence in uncertain times.</p> Putting Keyless on the passwordless radar <p>In just one year, we’ve managed to build, test and launch a total of five products that serve the full spectrum of enterprise use cases for workforce and consumer passwordless authentication.</p><p>Our workforce authentication products suite includes passwordless authentication solutions for single sign-on (SSO) with providers such as Okta and Microsoft, VPN, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Windows Workstation Login — all powered by the Keyless Authenticator.</p><p>Check out our Workforce Authentication solutions here…</p><p><a href="https://keyless.io/products/enterprise">Keyless | Zero-Trust Passwordless Authentication</a></p><p>The Keyless Authenticator is an app that users or employees can download on any of their devices to enable seamless, privacy-enhancing access to all of these services.</p><p>For consumer authentication, we offer the Keyless SDK for both Android and iOS platforms. The Keyless SDK can be integrated into existing applications in a matter of hours. It offers fast, secure and frictionless, consumer multi-factor authentication (MFA) powered by the Keyless technology.</p><p>Check out our consumer authentication solutions here…</p><p><a href="https://keyless.io/products/consumer">Keyless | Zero-Trust Passwordless Authentication</a></p><p>On top of launching these products, we’ve partnered with the leading IAM and cloud providers so that customers can integrate and deploy our passwordless solutions quickly and&nbsp;easily.</p><p>We’ve so far partnered with Microsoft, Okta, and ForgeRock to help expand their identity management solutions with privacy-first passwordless authentication. We’ve also partnered with IBM and&nbsp;Cisco.</p> Partnering with Cisco to help universities adapt quickly to remote-learning <p>One of the achievements our team is most proud of is the first commercial deployment of our passwordless authentication technology in the education sector.</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/luiss-esami-distanza-l-ausilio-una-startup-innovativa-ADQDrvR">we partnered with Cisco</a> to help Luiss Guido Carli University, one of Rome’s leading higher education institutions, facilitate secure, remote authentication for students and staff during online classes and&nbsp;exams.</p><p>Unlike other passwordless solutions, Keyless offers Unique Student (or user) Identification. We can offer this feature because, with Keyless, users have one universal set of biometric templates that are used across all their devices and accounts. This means that it’s impossible for users to login to their accounts on another device using a different set of biometrics, essentially giving our clients much higher assurance that a user is who they claim to be&nbsp;online.</p><p>While Luiss University was a huge success for us, it wasn’t the only deployment we’ve been working on this&nbsp;year.</p> 10 customers, 5 sectors, 3 continents <p>Luiss University was our first live commercial deployment, however we currently have a number of customers in the Banking and Fintech and Aerospace and Defense industries who are all currently testing Keyless in pilot stage within their organizations.</p><p>Between these customers, we’re currently processing five thousand biometric authentication requests per day from approximately 15 thousand&nbsp;users.</p> $600k secured in awards and recognized by&nbsp;Gartner <p>Bans on international travel this year didn’t stop us from being invited to participate in a number of technology and cybersecurity competitions around the world. Some of these competitions have awarded us with cash-prizes, which are going directly into improving our product and services.

It’s particularly encouraging to be recognized by Gartner as one of the leading biometric solutions that’s helping companies tackle the evolving threat landscape head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This year, we’ve not only witnessed the fast-tracked adoption of cloud-first platforms, zero-trust technology and passwordless authentication, we’ve seen what impacts a lack of preparedness and unrealized digital strategy can have on organizations who are faced with unforeseen challenges. By merging modern biometrics with zero-trust, privacy-enhancing technologies, we’re able to provide a breakthrough scalable solution that can readily help companies on their journey towards a more secure and private&nbsp;future.</p><p>We’re humbled and excited by the industry recognition we’ve received for technology so far — and believe this proves that the demand for solutions that place equal importance on user privacy, security and usability is limitless.</p> What does the next year&nbsp;hold? <p>Out of darkness often comes light, and so we are hoping that as we head into a fresh year, that despite the urge to return to normal, that we are able to maintain the momentum gained during the last twelve&nbsp;months.</p><p>With the shift to remote and flexible work and the subsequent increased importance on being able to verify that someone is who they claim to be online, organizations around the globe are starting to recognise why we must act fast to converge authentication with identity proofing in the online realms. It’s not simply enough for a user to prove that they know or have something, they must also prove that they are who they claim to be — something that can only be achieved using advanced biometrics combined with machine learning.</p><p>We are confident that organizations sustain their interest in adopting solutions that leverage emerging technologies to enable more secure, reliable and privacy-focused authentication and identity management.</p><p>For us as a company, we plan to continue helping enterprises on their path towards a zero-trust, passwordless future by building out capabilities for our workforce and consumer authentication solutions, while accelerating our go-to-market efforts in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Some of our best content in&nbsp;2020  A beginner’s guide to Shamir’s Secret&nbsp;Sharing <p>Take a deep-dive into one of the core building blocks of Keyless.

<p>Blockchain.news: Triffic has to be able to monetize the platform itself to fund future development and ongoing operation. Therefore, the app makes revenues from its own GPS tokens. These come from three channels – from a share of advertising revenues, from in-app subscriptions for account upgrades, and from a share of revenues from Partner Beacons. Triffic is developed on the Ignis blockchain, the main child chain of the Ardor blockchain. Ignis offers out-of-the-box features that allowed the team behind Triffic to get up and running with a blockchain-based application without having to develop their own platform. Triffic plans to migrate to its own dedicated Ardor child chain in 2021 as part of its expansion plans, which include extending GPS rewards to ridesharing and food delivery apps. However, it’s currently one of three promising projects developed on Ignis. Treecoin is another. The third is Bridge Champ, an online gaming platform for players of the popular strategy card game, contract bridge. All three projects are supported by Jelurida, the firm that operates the Ardor ecosystem. Jelurida has a long pedigree in the blockchain development sector, having been part of the team that developed Nxt in 2013, the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain.</p>

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm. The work is happening in places like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, to name a&nbsp;few.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">Learn Concepts: Web of Trust 101</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>At the core of every <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> use case is what we call the verifiable credentials model. This simple yet effective model helps conceptualize how <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> are exchanged between people and organizations. In the SSI community, you will often hear the verifiable credentials model referred to as the “Trust Triangle”.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Often called the "Trust Triangle," this classic diagram helps conceptualize the verifiable credential model.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Roles in SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In the verifiable credentials model, there are three roles: issuer, holder, and verifier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives it (i.e., issues it) to another person, organization, or thing. An example of an issuer would be a DMV which issues driver’s licenses.  Holder: The holder is the person or organization to whom the verifiable credential was issued to. The holder keeps the verifiable credential in their <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">digital wallet</a>. An example of a holder would be the citizen that received his or her driver’s license from the DMV.  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. An example of a verifier would be the security agent at the airport that asks to see a person’s driver’s license to verify their identity.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In this example, the DMV issues the holder a driver's license as a verifiable credential which the holder then presents to the security agent at the airport (the verifier). The security agent does not need to contact the DMV to verify if the driver's license is a valid credential.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The power of verifiable credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other digital documents in that they allow the verifier to know the following four things without having to interact with the issuer at all:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  The original issuing entity (the source of the data)  It was issued to the entity presenting it (the subject of the data)  It hasn’t been tampered with (the veracity of the data)  Whether the issuer revoked the credential as of a particular point in time (the status of the data)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The standards and protocols associated with verifiable credentials and supporting technology make it possible for verifiers to make more informed “trust decisions” when accepting information from holders online. Based on the four factors above, verifiers can better determine to trust the information in the credential or not.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Use case diversity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The verifiable credentials model is quite flexible in the number and types of use cases it supports. In the example above, we highlighted the use case of digital driver’s licenses, but this same model could apply to a numberless amount of use cases where sharing identifying information is important. Here are a few examples:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Medical insurance credential: In this example, an insurance organization would be the issuer, a person would be the holder, and a doctor’s office could be the verifier.  Login credential: When a person is creating an account with a company online, the company would issue the person his or her login credential. From that moment on, the person can use the login credential to access their account, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords.¹ Check out how Trinsic issues <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">login credentials</a> to its customers.  University diploma credential: As an issuer, the university would send its graduates their digital diplomas which they could then use to apply for jobs online. Trinsic has written <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">a tutorial</a> on how to set up this specific use case in Trinsic Studio.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The SSI use cases above are pretty straightforward, but the verifiable credentials model allows for more complex situations as well. For example, SSI enables the concept of guardianship if a person does not have the ability to control their own wallet (e.g., the person is a child, has dementia, is a refugee, etc.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Further, in the verifiable credentials model the holder does not necessarily need to be a person. Verifiable credentials can be issued to organizations or things. This includes licensing and accreditations for businesses as well as supply chain-related documentation for products. SSI and verifiable credentials enable digital, trusted interactions which were not possible online before.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>The ongoing SolarWinds incident illustrates that the much-lauded Zero Trust security paradigm is, in fact, based on trust. Zero Trust is about authenticating and authorizing every action within a computing environment. It is putting the principle of least privilege into action. In an ideal implementation of Zero Trust, users authenticate with the proper identity and authentication assurance levels to get access to local devices, on-premises applications and data, and cloud-hosted resources. Access requests are evaluated against access control policies at runtime.</p>
<p>In order for Zero Trust to work though, there are elements that are trusted that are used to evaluate other entities for trustworthiness:</p>
 
 IT products – operating systems, Line of Business applications, office automation products, IaaS environments, mobile devices, IoT devices, etc. 
 IT services – SaaS apps, IDaaS, managed hosting, Managed Detection &amp; Response (MDR), full scale Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), etc. 
 Processes – auto-updates of software, communication between vendor products and their cloud services, identity vetting, federation, authentication, and authorization 
 Suppliers – IT vendors, IT service providers, IT security vendors, identity providers, and members of product and service supply chains 
 
<p>A breakdown in any of these foundational components can become an attack vector and can put organizations at increased risks. As 2020 draws to a close, cybersecurity teams are searching for signs that their organizations have been affected by the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate malware and are beginning to remediate. New information about this set of events is arriving daily, and the big picture will likely take some time to materialize.</p>
<p>As we deal with this on the tactical level, we can also think about how this should impact longer-term security strategies. Zero Trust is a good strategy, but we must consider, expose, and evaluate the processes, products, services, and suppliers that make up Zero Trust infrastructure. Zero Trust cannot be effective if on so many levels it’s still based on blind trust. As users and implementers of technology, we will always be dependent to a degree on those technology vendors to demonstrate that their products and services are indeed trustworthy. However, we must also consider how each organization can increase the level of its own monitoring, detection, and response capabilities to guard against similar attacks in the future.</p>
<p>Supply chain security and risk management, particularly in the IT product and service arenas, will likely be top concerns for organizations of all sizes and types for 2021. KuppingerCole will continue to research, discuss, and publish on the products and services that constitute <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/search?q=zero+trust">Zero Trust architectures</a>.</p>

<p>As we come to the end of December, it’s time to take a look back at what the Ontology team has been up to in the last&nbsp;week.</p><p>We are closing out the year on a high note with two new partnerships announced last week, which includes adding our Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution to the blockchain-based e-voting system launched by Waves Enterprise. Ontology has also added pre-execution features for batch transactions. Our DeID ensures that the identities and data of people who vote are protected and verified. This week we also announced our collaboration with Litentry, and we aim to onboard 10,000 users to our DeID and OScore solutions together!</p><p>Back-end</p><p>- Added Ontology pre-execution feature for batch transactions</p><p>Product Development</p><p>ONTO</p><p>- Launched ONTO&nbsp;v3.6.5</p><p>- Carried out the “Gas Fee Airdrop” campaign with Binance Smart Chain. Users who transferred BEP-20 BNB in their ONTO wallets got the chance to earn BNB from a pool with the highest equivalent value of $50000. As of December 20th, more than 7,000 ONTO users participated.</p><p>dApp</p><p>- 108 dApps running on&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>- 6,240,890dApp-related transactions since the Ontology genesis&nbsp;block</p><p>- 6,587 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;week</p><p>Bounty Program</p><p>- 1 new application for&nbsp;SDKs</p><p>Community Growth</p><p>- 146 new members onboarded across Ontology’s Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, and Indian communities.</p><p>Newly Released</p><p>- In the Polkadot Parachain test network Rococo V1 press conference, it was announced that the TestNet will be launched on Christmas Eve, December 24th. Ontology will integrate DelD onto Polkadot to build up Polkadot’s parachains and participate in the parachain slots auction in the future. Besides this, Ontology will also gradually adapt its credit scoring system OScore, DDXF, and other technologies into the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>- On December 15th, Ontology entered into a technological partnership with Waves Enterprise, an enterprise-grade blockchain platform combining both public and private networks as a hybrid solution. The two companies will collaborate to integrate Ontology’s advanced DeID technologies into the blockchain-based e-voting system launched by Waves Enterprise so that corporate users can seamlessly benefit from a fully decentralized approach.</p><p>- On December 17th, we partnered with Litentry, a blockchain identity management layer based on the Polkadot network. Ontology and Litentry are aiming to onboard 10,000 users to our DeID and OScore solutions, enriching aggregated identities and targeting potential customers based in Europe, the USA, Latin America, and South-East Asia.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-december-15-21-6d8642f41ad5">Ontology Weekly Report (December 15–21)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>La società del Gruppo Tinexta adotterà il vLEI come standard di verifica dell’identità giuridica tra le controparti all’interno del proprio ecosistema di Self Sovereign Identity DIZME.</p>



<p>Roma, 23 dicembre 2020 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, annuncia la propria adesione al programma di sviluppo intersettoriale promosso dalla Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) per supportare a livello globale la diffusione del vLEI.</p>



<p>Il vLEI èuna credenziale verificabile crittograficamente secondo gli standard W3C e contenente il LEI (Legal Entity Identifiers), il codice identificativo delle persone giuridiche reso obbligatorio dalla Mifid II per poter operare sui mercati finanziari: InfoCert, già LOU (Local Operating Unit) autorizzata da GLEIF, adotterà il vLEI come standard di identificazione all’interno del proprio ecosistema DIZME, la piattaforma decentralizzata di identità digitale basata su blockchain.</p>



<p>Novità dirompente del vLEI è che consentirà la verifica dell’identità giuridica tra controparti, in modo univoco e completamente automatizzato, anche al di fuori dei mercati finanziari. In questo modo, il vLEI – che di volta in volta potrà essere associato a set di credenziali specifiche, ad esempio verticalizzate per settori di mercato – diventerà abilitatore di un numero sempre più crescente di attività di business digitali. Tra queste: l’approvazione di transazioni e contratti commerciali, l’onboarding di nuovi clienti, la gestione di flussi informativi all’interno di reti aziendali di import-export e supply chain, oppure la presentazione di documenti e rapporti normativi.</p>



<p>Inoltre, la verifica dell’identità giuridica delle entità legali dotate di vLEI sarà automaticamente estesa anche alle persone fisiche che coprono ruoli di interesse all’interno di tali entità.</p>



<p>“Siamo convinti che il vLEI costituisca un’incredibile opportunità di crescita per l’intero settore ‘B2B’ a livello globale e per questo abbiamo risposto con entusiasmo all’iniziativa promossa dal GLEIF – dichiara Daniele Citterio, CTO di InfoCert, Tinexta Group – Le ‘verifiable credential’ sono già alla base del modello DIZME e il vLEI ne costituisce un’estensione naturale, che consentirà di aggiungere un ulteriore livello di trust alla nostra piattaforma nel suo complesso”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementando il vLEI in DIZME, InfoCert potrà verificare istantaneamente l’identità giuridica sia degli issuer – i partner che contribuiscono alla crescita del network con i propri set di credenziali – sia dei verifier – le terze parti che utilizzano tali credenziali all’interno dei propri processi.</p>



<p>Ma non solo. Operando in sinergia con Innolva, altra società del Gruppo Tinexta e leader da oltre 30 anni nei servizi di Credit &amp; Information management in ambito corporate e finanziario, &nbsp;InfoCert integrerà nei “DIZME vLEI” una serie di informazioni di dettaglio – ad esempio creditizie, immobiliari, pregiudizievoli, oppure relative ai poteri di firma – che potranno a loro volta dar vita a nuovi modelli di business. Il database Innolva vanta miliardi di datapoint da innumerevoli fonti dati ufficiali e da fonti aperte. Ogni dato segue un processo di classificazione, razionalizzazione, normalizzazione e rielaborazione finalizzato a garantire nel tempo qualità e consistenza dell’informazione.</p>



<p>“Innolva, garantendo l’accesso al suo patrimonio informativo a valore aggiunto, supporta la digitalizzazione delle imprese – commenta Matteo Gatti direttore Business Information di&nbsp; Innolva – &nbsp;e la sinergia con InfoCert rende il gruppo Tinexta un player all’avanguardia in questo settore.”</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale).

Il Sistema di Gestione della Sicurezza delle Informazioni InfoCert è certificato ISO/IEC 27001:2013 per le attività EA:33-35. InfoCert è leader europeo nell’offerta di servizi di Digital Trust pienamente conformi ai requisiti del Regolamento eIDAS (regolamento UE 910/2014) e agli standard ETSI EN 319 401, e punta a crescere sempre di più a livello internazionale anche mediante acquisizioni: detiene il 51% di Camerfirma, una delle principali autorità di certificazione spagnole, il 50% di LuxTrust, azienda leader nel Digital Trust in Lussemburgo, e il 16,7% di Authada, Identity Provider tedesco all’avanguardia. InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Khalid Maliki, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director, and Jimmy J.P. Snoek, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Tykn. 
<p>Khalid and Jimmy join Oscar for episode 35 of the podcast, discussing everything Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the SSI company they co-founded, Tykn. The conversation details the ‘three pillars of SSI’ (verifiable credentials, decentralised identifiers and blockchain), how SSI fits with existing processes, what it should appear as to end users (and what level of education they need around the technology), the importance of accessibility for inclusivity, and what’s next for Tykn.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In 5 years, people should take [SSI] for granted”</p></blockquote>
 <p>Khalid Maliki</p> 
<p>After many years working in UX at the Dutch Ministry of the Interior, Khalid’s keen product design knowledge combined with a passion for social impact led him to put all his time and efforts into co-founding the award-winning digital ID company Tykn. Khalid believes Self-Sovereign Identity will positively impact billions of people’s lives and has advocated for its adoption on the most important stages, from the Economic Forum in Africa to the United Nations in NYC. He considers one of his biggest achievements to have co-founded a happy family.</p>

 <p>Jimmy J.P. Snoek</p> 
<p>Jimmy J.P. is a musician, business developer and entrepreneur, currently residing in The Hague, The Netherlands. After having worked as a professional musician in Spain and having started his first company in The Netherlands before the age of 20, Jimmy was accepted into the prestigious McGill University in Montréal, Canada and co-founded the now award-winning digital ID company Tykn.

<p>ZyCrypto: It’s now three years since the Ardor blockchain launched on mainnet, the first multi-chain platform of its kind. Ardor was built by the same developers responsible for Nxt, the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain that has been operating continuously and without interruption since 2013. Jelurida, the firm behind Nxt and Ardor, decided to develop the latter to overcome many of the problems of legacy blockchains, such as bloating, dependency on a single token, and a lack of customization opportunities. Ardor’s parent-and-child chain structure solves each of these issues. The parent chain runs on the ARDR token and is responsible for the overall security of the network. Child chains can connect into the parent chain, operating with their own native tokens. Only those transactions which affect Ardor’s proof of stake validator balances are stored on the parent chain, with other child chain transactions pruned to reduce bloating.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Many if not most organizations have moved to a risk management model for cybersecurity and identity management. Priorities have shifted in two major ways over the last decade:</p>
 
 decreasing attack surface sizes 
 focusing on detection and response technologies instead of prevention only 
 
<p>Reducing attack surfaces inarguably improves security posture. Achieving the objective of reducing attack surfaces involves many activities: secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning and management, consolidation of functions into fewer products and services, access reconciliation, user de-provisioning, avoidance of over-provisioning, use of Privileged Access Management (PAM), OS and app patching, API security gateways, and so forth.</p>
<p>The realization that some attacks get past preventive measures had led to an increase in the prominence of detection and response techniques and technologies. However, deploying EDR, NDR, or XDR products doesn’t obviate the need for endpoint anti-malware, email/web security gateways, or WAFs.</p>
<p>In light of the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate incident, the scope of detection must be expanded. For example, comms between agents on protected resources and remote sites cannot be overlooked. IT product binaries should not be excluded from anti-malware scans. Processes running signed code still need to be examined for signs of malicious behavior. Security log retention periods must increase. 30, 60, or even 90 days’ worth of logs is not enough to keep on hand when faced with investigations that need to go back 9+ months.</p>
<p>The SolarWinds incident highlights the need for <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/">Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR)</a>, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80126/network-detection-and-response/">Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR)</a>, or their union, XDR. These tools are the best means for determining if your organization has had any compromises after the event. In the case of the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate malware, most endpoint protection (EPP, or Next Generation Anti-Malware) didn’t recognize the software as malicious initially. These detection focused tools can look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) once they are identified and shared as threat intelligence.</p>
<p>No tool is 100% perfect, though. The attackers often acquire admin privileges and use them to remove or cover their tracks. XDR tools can help to automate the environment-wide searches to uncover evidence attackers may have inadvertently left behind.</p>
<p>Both approaches, reducing attack surfaces and increasing detection/response, remain valid after SolarWinds. In fact, this global cybersecurity event shows that most organizations, public and private sector, need to re-double their efforts on both objectives. Reducing the attack surface means additional vetting is needed on IT and cybersecurity tools, which primarily must happen at the vendors. Improving the operational effectiveness of XDR, SIEM, and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar/">SOAR tools</a> will require that those who implement these tools to extend their data retention times significantly beyond the default periods, even if it increases the cost of services.</p>
<p>Addressing and mitigating risks in the IT supply chain, especially cybersecurity products and services, will be front-and-center for CISOs in 2021. KuppingerCole will continue to monitor and advise as warranted.</p>

<p>The 6.7 release brings support for more enterprise use cases, improved user onboarding, and security enhancements. The highly anticipated Roaming User Support functionality is now available as a technology preview to enable users to securely unlock any company machine without requiring individual device pairing.</p>
      

      
 Take Workstation Unlock Anywhere 
      
<p>Not all office environments include assigned seating or even assigned machines. With a cluster of domain-joined computers and unique accounts, users can log into any desktop and start working. But how do you secure that login if you have to pair your mobile device with a specific workstation?</p>
      
<p>With HYPR’s support for roaming users, a single registration can be employed to authenticate into any workstation, as long as they’re on the same domain. In this flow, users can select to log in with a QR code and once scanned by the HYPR mobile app, they get access into the machine with their own account. This removes the need to register with multiple workstations and eliminates the burdensome overhead of account management in the mobile app.</p>
      
<p>What does this mean for your business?</p>
      
<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform 6.7 frees you from requiring a 1:1 relationship between workstation and device to securely unlock your machines. Instead, you can equip your users with the HYPR mobile app and a variety of domain-joined computers to enable safe, simple, and truly passwordless authentication.</p>
      
<p>Not only will your end-users benefit from the efficient authentication process, but your administrators will also appreciate the reduction of management as the registration is no longer tied to the machines but rather the users themselves.</p>
      
 Other Notable Enhancements 
      
<p>In addition to roaming user support, HYPR now enables authentication using Feitian K9 security keys to create an even more flexible solution. Feitian keys support FIDO authentication to create an additional passwordless login option.</p>
      
<p>Administrators can improve the device pairing and user onboarding process with dynamic magic links, which automatically adjust where the user is taken based on their device. For example, if the user is on a mobile device, then the link will take them into the HYPR mobile app to pair a new web account, or it will take them to the app store to download the HYPR mobile application; if they click the link on a desktop / laptop, then they will be redirected to the Device Manager page to pair the device.</p>

We’ll cover that in next week’s&nbsp;report.</p><p>This week:</p>  Coinbase IPO + new FINCEN wallet&nbsp;rules  Google antitrust lawsuit  Facebook v. Apple (full newspaper ad)  ApplePay antitrust scrutiny (it’s about&nbsp;time!)  Stuff happens   1. It was another big week, this time led by the news that Coinbase had filed for its IPO — a week after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs over&nbsp;$20K. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-files-for-initial-public-offering-11608232520">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>Coinbase’s filing is the culmination of the yearslong development of both the company and the cryptocurrency industry, moving from an anarchist experiment in alternative money to a mainstream asset class that has attracted hedge funds, mobile-money providers and insurance companies.</blockquote><blockquote>Coinbase, founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, has grown into one of the most recognizable names in the cryptocurrency industry. It currently has about 35 million users, more than Charles Schwab Corp.’s platform.</blockquote><blockquote>FINCEN did its best to spoil the party, however, making good on recent rumors about new wallet rules (revealed in a series of tweets by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong not long&nbsp;ago).</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20201221&amp;instance_id=25260&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;productCode=DK&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=47476&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F701325de-1460-589a-8dd9-ca1d8dd5f325&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">Dealbook:</a></p><blockquote>Late on Friday, the Treasury Department proposed a<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1216"> new disclosure rule</a> for certain digital currency transactions “aimed at closing money laundering regulatory gaps.” Critics of the move in the cryptocurrency community decried the proposal.</blockquote><blockquote>Critics are focused on the process. While one crypto executive said that the rule, which requires disclosure for certain big transactions with the Treasury Department and had been rumored for some time, “<a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1340135040399904770">could’ve been worse</a>,” critics took particular issue with its rollout.

Facebook made news elsewhere as well, though this time from the other side of the aisle, attacking Apple in a full-page newspaper ad about new iOS platform rules regarding tracking and&nbsp;privacy. <p>We’ve talked before about how legal action is only one prong in a multi-pronged attack when it comes to antitrust. The other is competition as well as showing people/consumers a better way. Facebook’s latest skirmishes with Apple show that, well, hey, a little bit of healthy competition isn’t all that bad now is&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s the ad (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/16/facebook-attacks-apple/">Facebook attacks Apple in full-page newspaper ads — 9to5Mac</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/16/apple-facebook-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple rebuffs Facebook criticism, says iOS anti-tracking features are about ’standing up for our users’ — 9to5Mac</a>  <p>And here’s the Information’s take:</p><blockquote>It’s hard not to feel that Apple CEO Tim Cook has only himself to blame for the battle he now finds himself in with Facebook. Over the past few years he spent an inordinate amount of time preaching about the evils of the advertising-based business model of Facebook and others. It’s not a surprise Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg would retaliate. For all of Cook’s sermonizing, Apple is not free of sin when it comes to how its customers are treated (as anyone buying one of Apple’s high-priced cables could&nbsp;attest.)</blockquote><blockquote>And whatever the merits of Facebook’s argument — which focuses how Apple uses its control of the App Store to hurt developers and advertisers — one thing seems clear. The dispute between the two companies foreshadows a loosening of the gatekeeper powers enjoyed by all the big tech companies, whether Apple, Google or Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>After all, it’s one thing for small companies to complain about the power of big companies. That happens all the time and sometimes feels like sour grapes. But when members of the big tech cartel are also speaking out about the gatekeeper status of one of their colleagues, you know something is&nbsp;wrong.</blockquote><blockquote>The whole point of scale in business is that it empowers you to fight others with scale. What Facebook’s complaints suggest is that even great scale isn’t enough to deal with one company’s control of the mobile ecosystem. And Facebook isn’t the only big tech company to complain about Apple’s App Store — Microsoft has also raised concerns about&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>There used to be a saying about the hazards of attacking a newspaper: “Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.” Perhaps Tim Cook should have realized that he shouldn’t pick a fight with someone who has three billion users. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote> 3. Speaking of Apple, ApplePay is also getting caught in the antitrust crossfire. <p>Which makes sense. We’ve all about had it when it comes to Big Tech leveraging their platforms to force us into anti-competitive payment&nbsp;rails.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13da1d7e-d771-40b1-a597-e37ab7112d46">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p>Photo: Shinya&nbsp;Suzuki<blockquote>Apple’s next antitrust battle is shaping up to be over Apple Pay, the company’s digital wallet, as the Covid-19 pandemic turbocharges use of contactless payments.</blockquote><blockquote>The Cupertino company has spent much of 2020 fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in its App Store. By contrast, its financial services business has attracted little attention in the US, meriting only a passing mention in a 450-page report by Congress’ antitrust subcommittee in&nbsp;October.</blockquote><blockquote>But Apple Pay is growing fast as consumers try not to touch buttons or handle cash because of the coronavirus. Jennifer Bailey, head of Apple Pay, said this month that contactless payments have gone from “being a convenience to a matter of public&nbsp;health.”</blockquote><blockquote>Jason Gardner, chief executive of California-based payments platform Marqeta, said: “They are really building out, within the Apple Pay team, a financial services juggernaut.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Apple Wallet is a killer app — more of a killer app than much of the world really understands right now. And it’s absolutely going to become a battleground for regulators in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><blockquote>In June, the European Commission opened a formal antitrust probe into Apple Pay and this month competition regulators in the Netherlands launched their own investigation. Australia’s central bank chief Philip Lowe recently said Apple’s approach to payments was “raising competition issues”.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13da1d7e-d771-40b1-a597-e37ab7112d46">Apple Pay draws antitrust attention</a>   4.

  <p>While 2020 has been a roller coaster of a year, there has been one note of certainty: digital transformation has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, and identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) is a big part of that evolution. In anticipation of 2021, we asked four of our experts to share their perspectives on what you can expect in the new year.</p>

<p>Allan Foster, Chief Evangelist: “Move over multi-factor authentication. User managed access (UMA) will reign supreme in 2021.”</p>

<p>With more services online than ever before, users have come to expect amazing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">digital experiences</a>. To keep up with these expectations, digital experiences will need to involve more than one identity as more organizations start to embrace the idea of delegation. Often, authorized users are geographically separated or using a variety of devices – and these accounts or devices may not even be connected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a common example. When renting out Airbnb lodging, the host needs to grant guests access to connected things like the thermostat, smart TV, and other devices for the duration of their stay. To make this happen, the host needs to be able to work with more than one identity associated with each device and delegate access to guests. Of course, once the guest departs, access to the devices needs to be revoked. Situations like this drive the need to focus on how to work with a collection of identities.</p>

<p>Enterprises have a similar situation, with a population of users needing access to specific applications at certain times, but not necessarily all the time. Many applications rely on traditional means of authentication, like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-was-never-enough">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, but transactions that involve more than one person or identity are not really an authentication problem. This is where advanced technologies like user-managed access (<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/privacy/user-managed-access">UMA</a>) can help customers and employees manage who is allowed access to their resources, for how long, and under what circumstances. Essentially, UMA facilitates the connections of the identities while optimizing the user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2021, solutions that provide a convenient central management system for organizing digital resources that reside in many locations, delegating access to others, and monitoring and revoking access when necessary will take over from traditional authentication and MFA controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben Goodman, Senior Vice President: “ 2021 will be the year of ambient identification methods as organizations shift to ‘zero login’.”</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> technology, such as biometrics, is widely used, we will see a shift toward a “zero login” process, which removes friction for the user unless there is an issue with the initial authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are huge upsides to this. There will be no credentials to remember, and MFA will be silent on the back end. Zero login&nbsp;will be more secure than using a password, username, or MFA because it can use factors such as device enrollment and device reputation, fingerprints, keyboard typing patterns, the way the phone/device is held, and other markers to verify identity in the background while the user enjoys a frictionless experience.</p>

<p>For zero login to be successful, all these identity verification factors must be measured and combined in a transparent way so that consumers don’t feel their privacy is being compromised. Organizations should also have the option to introduce authentication steps into the process if they prefer to introduce more friction for bigger or riskier actions. This is the approach online retailers like Amazon take when customers want to purchase big ticket items. By not allowing the “buy in one click” option for purchases over a certain dollar amount, they are adding friction to the purchase process to ensure the buyer is who they say they are. Rather than only authenticating at the “front door” with passwords or MFA, extra security steps will be added right at the point of potential fraud during the transaction to create a better digital experience for users. Zero login enables smarter authentication that adjusts as necessary for a more seamless login experience across an individual's devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eve Maler, CTO: “IT will infuse access governance with intelligence to protect workforce cybersecurity in 2021.”</p>

<p>Accelerating changes in enterprise technologies, cyberthreats, and the user landscape are increasing pressure on traditional <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration (IGA) </a>solutions and, in turn, on security and compliance teams. On top of growing compliance risks, enterprise IT environments become more complex every year, increasing the number of applications and systems that need to be accessed by their users. These challenges are driving organizations to seek out artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions that simplify and automate the access request, access approval, certification and role-modeling processes.</p>

<p>In 2021, we will see AI increasingly employed to enable an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">autonomous identit</a>y approach. AI-infused authentication and authorization solutions will be layered on top of, or integrated with, existing IGA solutions, providing contextual, enterprise-wide visibility by collecting and analyzing all identity data and enabling insight into different risk levels of user access at scale. The use of AI will allow systems to identify and alert security and compliance teams about high-risk access or policy violations. Over time we will see these AI systems produce explainable results while increasing automation of some of the most complex cybersecurity challenges within the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary Writz, Vice President, Product Management: “National identities will become more prevalent."</p>

<p>There are two fundamental shifts in the way we view and define digital identity on the horizon for 2021.</p>

<p>First, non-human identities will be just as important as human identities. While we often associate digital identity with a person, many “things” will need identities – from watches to wristbands, from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) sensors to medical equipment, and even DevOps containers and Kubernetes resources. While the number of human identities may grow at a slow pace, the number of non-human identities will explode. For example, enterprises want to attach identities to machines, such as virtual machines, hosts, or containers in order to control security, as well as spend on cloud computing. The ratio of humans or developers to machine identities is 1:200 and still growing.</p>

<p>Second, national identities will become more prevalent as national, state and local governments transform to provide services primarily in digital format. COVID-19 is driving the need for new services like contact track and trace and remote access to benefits services, which will continue globally. For example, the new Japanese prime minister has aggressively called for the digitization of government and a new digital agency that will be established to drive “e-everything.” In the U.K., we saw the emergence of an NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app that citizens could use to enter pubs and restaurants. These examples show how this trend is already evolving.</p>

<p>We hope that you find our predictions insightful and that they help you to uncover new ways to look at the power of identity. We’re looking forward to an exciting year ahead, full of new innovations that will continue to shape the ever-evolving digital identity landscape.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To celebrate the launch of my book, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, which was just published by Manning Publications, I've teamed up with my employer, ForgeRock, to demonstrate how some of the techniques in the book can be accomplished with less effort using the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>API Security in Action discusses five primary security mechanisms you can use to strengthen your application programming interfaces (APIs) against common threats:</p>

  Encryption of data in transit and at rest ensures confidentiality and integrity. 
	 Rate-limiting reduces the damage of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
	 Authentication checks users are who they say they are. 
	 Authorization ensures that users can't do anything they aren't allowed to do. 
	 Audit logging allows users to be held accountable for their actions. 
   <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the book, you'll learn in detail how to build these features into your APIs and really understand how they work and why you need them. ForgeRock's comprehensive Identity Platform can get you up and running with all of these security controls in no time. Let's take a closer look at a few examples.</p>

 API Protection at the Edge With Identity Gateway 

<p>One of the core security controls in API Security in Action is the use of rate-limiting to protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. To get the most from this protection, you really want to push rate-limiting as far out to the edge of your network as possible to reject requests early before they consume significant resources. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">ForgeRock Identity Gateway (IG)</a> provides a suite of functionality for protecting your APIs at the edge, including <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/throttling-about.html">sophisticated rate-limiting and throttling filters</a>.</p>

<p>However, IG can do much more than just rate-limiting, and is a veritable Swiss Army Knife of API security. The Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection discussed in Chapter 4 is <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/csrf.html">built right into IG as a general-purpose filter</a>. It can also handle sophisticated authentication and single-sign on flows, protecting APIs with JSON Web Tokens, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. If that's not enough, you can extend IG with scripts and Java plugins to implement almost any API security pattern described in the book.</p>

 Powerful Authorization Options 

<p>Perhaps the most important topic in the book is authorization: working out who is allowed to do what. You'll learn about three important topics in depth in authorization:</p>

  Identity-based authorization, including role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). 
	 Capability-based access control, which uses fine-grained tokens that act a bit like keys in the real world. 
	 Delegated authorization, using OAuth2, allowing a user to delegate some of their authority to a third-party application or service. 
 <p>One of the strengths of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> is its comprehensive support for authorization technologies, through the ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a> product (AM) and policy enforcement points, such as IG or our dedicated policy agents. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">AM's powerful policy engine</a> can be used to implement sophisticated access control decisions, fully integrated with it's mind-blowing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">intelligent authentication</a>.</p>

<p>As you might expect, AM also provides one of the most advanced OAuth2 authorization server implementations available today, with excellent support for the latest <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16">best practices</a>. IG's <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/oauth2-rs.html">Resource Server Filter</a> makes accepting access tokens at your APIs easy and secure, including support for advanced features like <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">OAuth mutual TLS</a> discussed in Chapter 11. The latest release of AM also supports issuing access tokens as Macaroons, a powerful new token format described in Chapter 9, which brings many of the benefits of capability-based security within the framework of existing OAuth2 standards.</p>

 Kubernetes-Ready and Rocking the IoT 

<p>The final third of the book looks at protecting APIs in two increasingly important deployment scenarios:</p>

  Microservice architectures running in a <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes container orchestration environment</a>. 
	 Constrained devices operating in the industrial or consumer Internet of Things (IoT). 
 <p>ForgeRock has invested heavily in recent years in ensuring that our Identity Platform works well in a Kubernetes (k8s) environment, and <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgeops">provides recipes for deploying our products to k8s</a>. Our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> runs on Kubernetes, so we've got deep knowledge on how to scale and secure deployments in this platform, some of which is distilled into Part 4 of the book.</p>

<p>IoT environments are very different from the comfortable world of servers running in data centers, both due to the constrained nature of the devices involved and how exposed they can be to external threats. ForgeRock has spent several years investigating the challenges of these environments and developing our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">ForgeRock Things</a> offerings that can help secure IoT applications and integrate devices with our identity platform.</p>

<p>During the second half of 2020, Civic has continued charging ahead, making strong gains with our Civic Wallet app, building out Health Key by Civic, and providing our users with a best-in-class experience by transitioning Civic Secure Identity users to Civic Wallet.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Following the app store launch of Civic Wallet in June 2020, thousands of users have created Civic Wallets. Civic Wallet users love that their cryptocurrency is protected by our $1M Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee (see <a href="https://www.civic.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>) and is hassle-free, without the need to remember complicated passwords. In the words of one Civic Wallet reviewer: “[It’s]…the most secure way to store your crypto, guaranteed.”</p>



<p>Enhancing the value of Civic Wallet for our users is a top priority. This is why we’ve contacted many of our users to get their unfiltered feedback and improved our app to give them the features they need to make crypto easier. We were also proud in the second half of 2020 to expand our global coverage, which now includes 195 countries. Our customers live around the world, and Civic has them covered where they need to be.</p>



<p>We’ve also expanded Health Key by Civic, our health status verification service, which will help create safer working environments. Health Key by Civic is now available to help reopen daily life in any use case where health information is required for access, and across borders. This summer, Civic <a href="https://youtu.be/U4TnqeG_F5g">presented an overview</a> of the service to a forum convened by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Sharing health status is easy for consumers, who can access Health Key by Civic through their Civic Wallet. With Covid, navigating border regulations has never been harder, but we’re making the process easier for businesses and other organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/k4C6lP62XFc">Our new demo video</a> and the recent <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vinny-lingham-on-civics-first-mover-advantage-in-health-verification/">deep-dive article</a> appearing in BeInCrypto help explain how the system works. Finally, we made strides in laying a strong foundation for <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/09/legislation-offers-solution-to-safely-store-covid-19-testing-data-critical-information/">future health status legislation</a> through our work with the State of California.</p>



<p>When we designed and launched Civic Wallet earlier this year, we took into account lessons learned from Civic Secure Identity to build a better, more flexible experience for users in Civic Wallet. With the improved user experience in place, we’ve <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">removed Civic Secure Identity</a> from app stores and asked our users to download Civic Wallet. By streamlining our processes, we’re better able to serve all of our users.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>During the second half, Civic was covered in a number of publications, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/08/24/crypto-mass-adoption">Cointelegraph</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/civic-digital-identity-wallet-with-facial-biometrics-and-health-credential-launched">Biometric Update</a>, <a href="https://identityreview.com/civic-launches-digital-wallet-app-and-announces-proof-of-health-verification/">Identity Review</a>, and <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/162888-blockchain-powered-identity-payment-solutions-civic-launches-digital-wallet-out-of-private-beta/">Crowdfund Insider</a>. As a first-mover in the blockchain space for health status, Civic was also featured in an industry profile in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/safe-and-sound-blockchain-backed-digital-identity-in-the-post-coronavirus-era">Cointelegraph</a>. Civic CEO Vinny Lingham was also featured in podcasts and events, such as <a href="https://blockspeak.io/2020/09/04/blockspeak-episode-25-shark-dragons-civic/">Blockspeak</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://nicharalambous.com/blog/vinny-lingham-abundant-thinking">The Curious Cult</a> and <a href="https://blockdownconf.com/live_videos/blockdown-2-0-the-post-pandemic-economy-and-the-endless-reserve-funds/">Blockdown</a>.</p>



<p>What’s Next for Civic</p>



<p>As we take a look around the corner into 2021, Civic is already hitting the ground running with our stand-alone identity verification service for businesses, including more flexible options and pay-as-you-go pricing. Compliance has never been more critical than in 2020, where a remote world needs secure systems to work. Civic Identity Verification does just that by ensuring that commerce with customers is compliant across KYC, AML, GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we’re focused on enhancing the value of Civic Wallet for our users. As they continue to bring in and hold BTC, our users are assured knowing that their crypto is protected with a $1M Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee. We’ll be introducing more features in 2021 that are sure to appeal to our loyal users.</p>

 Diagnostic: Female livelihoods in the gig&nbsp;economy  Tensions and opportunities <p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive Digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and facilitates the exploration of a topic together.</p><p>For this conversation, we had 12 experts on women and platform work in emerging markets, ranging from those running platforms to donors, private sector, academia and advocacy. The conversation was under Chatham House rules so this is an edited summary of the key themes and not attributed to any one person. However, we have a list of names and resources discussed at the end of this&nbsp;piece.</p>A still from a promotional video for HelloTask, illustrating the importance of identity and professionalism What’s the landscape in a COVID-19&nbsp;world? <p>As we began our Diagnostic discussion, we acknowledged that COVID-19 illustrated the worst case scenario for many platform workers, and even more so for women. Research by Caribou Digital and Qhala in partnership with Mastercard Foundation has shown that platform work for women <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender">holds many tensions</a>, and this has been further heightened by the lack of a safety net during COVID-19. The myth of flexible work may in many cases be no more than cheap labour in disguise, and self employment a way for employers to shift responsibility to workers. This can impact women more so than men. COVID-19 also brought home the reality (perhaps obvious) that women still carry most of household duties while also working, another flip side of flexibility which puts more strain on women trying to combine both kinds of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Below, we distill our discussion into three tensions, three actions and the way forward on women and platform work, especially in emerging economies.</p> The tensions of formal, flexible&nbsp;work <p>On the one hand, the formality of platforms was seen as a plus point. Being given an identity (e.g. a badge, a relationship) was something women valued, according to one platform provider. It had a similar appeal for the customer: “I think, people use a platform rather than go the traditional way for the responsibility a platform always takes. The way Uber verifies rides, indemnifies any problems users face and takes users’ feedback seriously…every platform should take the responsibility of ensuring a digital identity, verifying ID cards and including for finance”. However, too many restrictions have made platform work unfair. A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uber-made-big-promises-kenya-drivers-say-it-s-ruined-n1247964">report on Kenya</a>, for example, showed that drivers were “worse off” after the introduction of Uber. Platform lock-in can also be disadvantageous to the worker (for example, when a woman works across different companies or platforms… shouldn’t they be able to have ownership over their identity and ratings)?</p><p>Equally, in theory, platforms provide an opportunity for women’s emancipation, notably by providing “flexible” work, i.e. flexible hours, working from home etc. Yet, even pre-COVID,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/uber-rideshare-lyft-safety-crime"> many platforms fell short</a> of protecting their workers. Now, the flexibility benefits of platform work, especially for women, are being questioned, as a kind of “bogus self-employment”. From a gender perspective, real change is unclear. One participant stated that “platforms do nothing to change the gendered occupational segmentation that characterises offline labour markets around the&nbsp;world”.</p> Building identity…or having to fake&nbsp;it <p>What do platforms do regarding workers’ sense of identity? On the one hand, platforms provide a sense of identity and belonging: “helpers are motivated to work on HelloTask’s platforms because of the identity they get on our platform rather than working like a ghost.” On the other hand, workers can fake their identity to counter the racial or gender biases that exist on platforms. For example, some female workers in Kenya were adopting “white, male” identities to get (more) work, depending on the type of work. In some sectors, being a woman will be preferred, (e.g. beauticians, domestic work). So how much does one need to identify&nbsp;oneself?</p> Broad reach versus high-tech <p>Despite this significant opportunity for women’s emancipation mentioned above, how can we ensure we move beyond only higher skilled women having the opportunity for digital work? One study mentions the increasing integration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dUW9S519I&amp;amp%3Bfeature=youtu.be&amp;amp%3Bab_channel=DWMImpact">social commerce for female-headed small and medium enterprises</a>. However at the same time the risk of “too much tech” was brought forward — with a large part of potential gig workers (the “<a href="https://migrationology.com/jua-kali-kenyan-informal-labor-sector/">jua kali</a>” type workers, as described in Kenya’s informal economy) not being digitised, not having smartphones let alone computers.<a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/digital-gender-divide-wont-close-itself-heres-why"> Women are particularly affected by the digital ga</a>p, often only accessing feature phones and either unable to participate or participating through intermediaries, for example giving someone else’s contact number or bank account for payment, which increases the risk of dependence.</p> What are the priority actions and who is responsible for&nbsp;them? <p>Making platforms accessible to all — including the lower income and often unemployed communities, especially women was one of the key points. How to ensure that inclusion and who is responsible for it is a harder “hot potato” question. We agreed that platforms had a significant role to play, in some cases along with funders/investors, regulators/policy bodies, workers themselves and workers’ organisations.</p> More feature phone integration <p>One way of encouraging scale and inclusion is by integrating basic feature phone access to platform services. For example HelloTask used IVR to connect with domestic workers when there is a job for them as they rarely had smartphones. Similarly, using SMS and USSD services is key to ensuring platforms reach all workers — including at the last mile. However, there was skepticism on interest and investor funding on this: “I wonder what chances you’d get in 2020 at getting funding for an SMS-based service when most money seems to be drawn to the web and&nbsp;apps”.</p> Address analogue gaps such as&nbsp;ID <p>Women are particularly at risk of not having their own ID credentials resorting to their family’s ID (often father/brother) which raises a first question as to whether platforms can change the existing informal power relationships or do they leave them unchanged. Intertwined with ID requirements are payments and financial inclusion as not having an ID may often lead women to being financially excluded. Platforms’ payments structures <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02681102.2020.1818544">often do not favour workers</a>: “wage management and payment processes are set up for the convenience of the “employers” who are upper/middle class clients.” This not only limits access but also impacts on other issues such as credit scoring or financial independence. Platforms and digital financial service providers could push for these types of processes to be put in&nbsp;place.</p> Invest in education and&nbsp;training <p>Education and training of workers is required to ensure that they can fully leverage the opportunities platforms provide — especially in order to get more skilled and better paid gig work online. Currently, to fill the existing training and knowledge gaps, workers organically regroup on social media platforms to create self-help groups. However this may not be sufficient and women may not have the time or possibility to join these groups in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Platforms seem to take on the responsibility of trust in the worker for the customer’s sake (e.g. vetting a domestic helper) but not necessarily being responsible for the worker’s health and safety or their training: “platforms avoid training as it can be used for a claim that they have misclassified independent contractors as employees/workers…this is why algorithmic control is preferred to explicit methods of control / direction / training in many&nbsp;cases”.</p> The way&nbsp;forward <p>As a group, we agreed that all stakeholders had a responsibility, especially platforms themselves — be it in training or security. Platform work should not just be work but meaningful and dignified work. This is obviously not just an emerging markets issue. Governments around the world — the Canadian government was mentioned as an example — and regulators do not always seem to know what to do as this is still a nascent area. As a whole, we could devise metrics on women’s inclusion and safety on platforms (see the work of the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a> for example). One suggestion was that: “development agencies and investors could play the role of the regulator to ensure certain metrics are met when it comes to ensuring gender parity”. <a href="https://www.foodstersunited.ca/">Worker rights movements or organisations</a>, women’s rights bodies and unions could exert pressure. Private bodies such as <a href="http://perks.gg">Perks</a> could also create sustainable models for gig workers’ benefits for safety nets and guidance on how to ensure that platforms provide decent work to workers, in particular women. In short, there is still much work to be done on women and platform work worldwide, including in emerging&nbsp;markets.</p> Participants   Anjali Banthia,&nbsp;Tala  Dr. Jamie Woodcock, Open University, <a href="https://www.jamiewoodcock.net/">https://www.jamiewoodcock.net</a>  Jessica Colaço, Brave Venture&nbsp;Labs  Dr. Kathi Kitner, Payments, Google  Katie Highet, FinEquity, convened by&nbsp;CGAP  Ken Banks,&nbsp;Yoti  Mahmudul Hasan Likhon, HelloTask  Rani Deshpande, CGAP  Shikoh Gitau,&nbsp;Qhala  Shirley Mburu, BFA&nbsp;Global  Shyam Krishna, Royal Holloway, University of&nbsp;London  Dr. Tricia Williams, Mastercard Foundation  <p>Other participants chose to remain anonymous</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">Female livelihoods in the gig economy: tensions and opportunities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/four-innovative-crypto-companies-to-watch-in-2021/">Four innovative crypto companies to watch in 2021</a> 

<p>CryptoNewsFlash: 2020 was a landmark year for Jelurida, the software development firm behind the Ardor and Nxt blockchains. Back in June, at the height of the pandemic, it was announced that the Austrian government would leverage its Ardor multi-chain architecture to facilitate secure communication between authorities, institutions and citizens, particularly as pertaining to data exchange relating to COVID-19 tests. The same government also funded HotCity, a sustainable energy project that launched on Ardor in May.</p>

<p>With a series of novel projects building on both platforms, and post-Covid management likely to be the focus of many governments’ attention, it’ll be fascinating to see how Jelurida’s solutions develop in the year ahead. Of course, enterprise use is just part of it; the company recently developed an on-chain version of Bridge on its child chain Ignis, with Jelurida Director Lior Yaffe opening the door to tokenized gaming. Might we see more of this in 2021?</p>

  <p>So here’s the story. A nation-state attacks a technology company, leveraging a backdoor in a piece of software to infect computers. Then using the infected machines as jumping-off points to move laterally across what was previously thought to be a secure network, the threat actors take aim at targets of interest to the U.S. government. You may think I am talking about the SolarWinds hack. In fact, I am talking about the 2009 attacks on Google and at least 20 other technology companies commonly known as <a href="https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/operation-aurora">Operation Aurora</a>.</p>

<p>Operation Aurora exposed what many of us already knew – that securing the perimeter of a network through firewalls left the heart of the network vulnerable. A single compromised node on a secure network can put all protected resources at risk, especially when faced with the reality that it’s a challenge to secure every endpoint. Google published an approach that would address this, known as BeyondCorp. It moved the perimeter from the edge of the network to each application and treated every application as unprotected, as if it were connected directly to the internet and needed to be secured with authentication and authorization. BeyondCorp assumes that no user or device can be trusted until it has been evaluated. This approach is better known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a>, or what Gartner calls CARTA (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment).&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is so much we still don’t know about this latest attack and the damage it has done, but what we do know is chilling. Nation-state hackers, believed by experts to be from Russia, used SolarWinds’ build system to infiltrate their digital supply chain, which was used to deliver software updates. They then distributed a “security update'' that included a backdoor. A follow-on “security update” leveraged the backdoor to add a malicious payload to a select group of targets. Once those devices were compromised, they were used to deliver additional malware and move laterally across the network to attack other systems.</p>

<p>It’s easy to hear the echoes of these two attacks over a decade apart. It shows us that history repeats itself and will continue to if we don’t break the cycle. Cybercriminals exposed more than <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">5 billion records in 2019</a>, costing U.S. organizations over $1.2 trillion. It also shows us that many of the answers to this challenge exist today.</p>

<p>With more than 20 years of industry experience, I look at most things through an identity lens. When you spend years using hammers, a lot of things look like nails. However, the reality is that some problems are uniquely nail shaped. That is why I see a layered, identity-centric approach that builds on the principles of Zero Trust and BeyondCorp as our best answer to prevent malicious actors from obtaining the initial foothold within an environment as well as reducing the possibility of further lateral attacks. With this model, you can:</p>

  Minimize attack surface by leveraging modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration (IGA</a>) techniques. This means enlisting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to understand and manage appropriate levels of access. By limiting users’ access to the bare minimum needed to do their jobs, risk can be dramatically reduced. According to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-consumer-identity-breach-report-us-breaches-cost-over-18-trillion">2020 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, unauthorized access was the most common attack vector used in 2019, responsible for 40% of all breaches. 
	 Monitor user and device behavior to create a baseline for “normal” behavior so that anomalous and risky behaviors can be flagged and analyzed quickly and at scale. This is often referred to as user and entity behavioral analysis (UEBA) and is another opportunity to enlist the help of AI and ML. These behavioral changes may be subtle – for instance accessing systems that aren’t typically accessed, logging in at times that don’t make sense, or moving more data than usual. They can also be distinctive at the technology layer by requiring automation and AI to define, and make visible such as logging in from multiple IP's with disparate geographical locations. If an organization understands how a user or device typically behaves, they can quickly address a compromised system before the threat can move laterally across a secure network, dramatically reducing the risk of this type of attack. 
	 It may be cliché to say that identity is the new perimeter, but if the perimeter moves to each application, the existence of a firewall becomes moot. Scalable technology that can continually validate device posture, user authorization, and authentication is a game changer to preventing a compromised device or user from doing damage via lateral attack. 
	 A compromised system is a perfect place to steal usernames and passwords – those credentials can be used to access and attack other systems. This is why <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless</a> and multi-factor authentication (MFA) can eliminate a massive attack vector leveraged in lateral attacks.&nbsp; 
 <p>There is no silver bullet to solving these problems, and hackers will continue to get more sophisticated. However, the recommendation represents concrete steps that CISOs and other security executives can take to mitigate risks. When we encounter a problem, it is human nature to try to find a new tool to deal with it. But sometimes, the tool has been there all along (or for about ten years).</p>

<p>Editor’s Note:&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock Identity Cloud and ForgeRock’s corporate infrastructure was not impacted by the SolarWinds breach. ForgeRock has conducted a full review of its environment and has confirmed that neither the ORION product nor the modules that make up the ORION product exist within our corporate infrastructure. In addition, we are conducting reviews of all critical suppliers to establish any potential risk to operations via our supply chain.</p>

Meanwhile in Sweden the first nine cities signed a national Climate Contract (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dd54ca29c9179411df12b85/t/5fd3af6304b5167f02c2a42f/1607708516566/PRESS+RELEASE+European+Viable+Cities+Day+11+Dec+2020.pdf">Klimatkontrakt 2030</a>) on the 11th of December 2020, together with four government agencies and Viable Cities. The concept of the Climate City Contract will be further developed during the coming years. The big question is, how can democracies [2] contract such a momentous societal transition in an age of uncertainty and complexity, while conserving or even constructing legitimacy?</p><p>Cities, towns and municipalities are aware of the large-scale transformations necessary to address the climate emergency. But we need to recognise that the climate crisis is not a nascent property of the environment. Alongside biodiversity loss [3], global inequality [4], financial injustices [5] and other wicked problems [6] — climate change is but one symptom of a deeper structural failure; our inability to construct meaningful relations through social and democratic processes enabling humane thriving. Our relationship-ability towards other humans, ourselves, things, nature and the future should be a fundamental concern when designing methods for the climate transition. Unless we are able to make this deep shift in our societies, we will neither be able to develop the social legitimacy for large scale change, nor address the multitude of risks we face that undermine the capacity of human civilisations. We are at a position, in which we have to choose whether we want to direct our efforts towards a thriving planet or keep a steady course at the edge of surviving.</p><p>The transition towards entanglement</p><p>We can imagine many versions of the future. We briefly want to discuss two of those. One, is based on the legacies passed down by dominant western histories, that lead us to incline towards risk management to ensure survival. The other, moves beyond risk management, towards constituting the conditions for the regeneration and renewal of societies and the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Throughout the past centuries we have insisted on a thesis for human development that is based on command and control [7]. As a result, our democratic processes tend to create passive centralisation, simplifying the complexity and interconnectedness of reality, resulting in a singularity of publics [8], where the public is seen as a rather homogeneous expression.</p><p>At the same time, it is increasingly clear that we live in an age of entanglement. This calls for acknowledging diversity and interconnectedness. Quantum physics has proved there is a relationship between the fundamental properties of particles [9] that can’t have happened by chance. The Wood Wide Web [10] describes the millions of species of fungi and bacteria that swap nutrients between soil and the roots of trees, forming a vast, interconnected web of organisms. The field of biology is reconsidering the boundaries of individual organisms [11], understanding that where biological bodies end and where their environments begin is truly contentious. And indigenous language and philosophies have always recognised a kinship with nature&nbsp;[12].</p><p>It can be difficult for current government and institutional structures to recognise this transition towards entanglement. One reason for this could be that it would fundamentally challenge our perception of sovereignties. What if sovereignties were not defined by political boundaries (e.g. national borders, political jurisdictions, private properties), but rather through the knots of their systems (e.g. human relationships, nutrient exchange between trees)? How then could we imagine creating the conditions for viability and thriving of all ecosystems (e.g. environmental, human, material) that transverse territories? Could this shift the contractual relationships between different sovereignties to acknowledge interconnectedness?</p><p>Investing in relationship abilities</p><p>Investments in transitions that redistribute relation-capabilities [13] with others, ourselves, and our future is familiar for countries with deep democracies [14], like Scandinavian countries. During the 18th century, the Scandinavian context included some of the poorest nations in the world [15]. However, beginning in the mid-1800s, a series of investments in human development infrastructures, created some of the most equitable transitions and societies today.</p><p>The Folk high school movement [16] offered a unique educational setting, supporting self-fulfilment, fellowship with others, practical knowledge and active democratic participation, to a large part of the population for free. Students would develop the technical and philosophical agency, as well as the self-authorship capacity for constructing their future. Across Scandinavia, the cooperative movement [17] has been particularly strong and influential, forming an extraordinary process of self-organization, institutionalized in the form of commonly agreed upon written rules, and establishing democratic processes that ultimately led to trust and the development of valuable social capital. Similarly, the Swedish government introduced a loan (Egnahemslån [18]) to support workers in building a house on the outskirts of cities, with the aim of creating better living standards and establishing a connection with nature. As mentioned in the book The Nordic Secret [13], these and other measures allowed Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland to undergo major technological, economic and structural changes peacefully, developing everybody’s potential and changing their&nbsp;fate.</p>Figure 1: A contracting process that builds collective intelligence, agency and legitimacy for constructing transition conscious choices to enable the climate transition.<p>Climate City Contracting</p><p>Today, cities in Scandinavia, along with other urban areas in the world, are facing a number of challenges — high debt levels, heat island effects, catastrophic fires, unequal mental wellbeing. Since 2015 municipality debts in Sweden have grown by 276 billion SEK [19]; larger cities in Fennoscandia are experiencing 3–5 °C warming due to urban heat island effects [20]; Norway’s fire season in 2019 was the worst for several years with 35 fires burning 4,654ha [21]; while reduced mental wellbeing amongst school girls in Sweden with low socioeconomic status is met at 83% compared to 49% amongst girls living in higher socioeconomic conditions [22]. These risks demand a transition parallel to the historic investments of the Scandinavian context more than a century&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Contemporary risk management approaches focus on outputs and contract for outcomes. But linear cause and effect strategies no longer work, as wicked problems, like climate change, are relational and therefore continually mutating and evolving. When operating under the realities of uncertainty and complexity, we need to think about building capacities and capabilities, rather than directly focusing on results. Such a transition would require thinking through (1) multiple domains, incorporating both social and environmental concerns (technological, urban, psychological, biological, institutional, cultural, and deep code [23] domains); (2) integrating the perspectives of multiple actors [24], while creating the capacity for other-centering [25]; and 3) considering multiple scales/ layers of democracy (European/ National/ City/ Citizen), each self-sovereign with respect and awareness of interdependence.</p><p>Climate City Contracting is an opportunity to move towards a ‘plurality of publics’ [8], each aware of their interdependencies, by addressing: how can deep democracies14 contract a just climate transition in an age of uncertainty and complexity, while building legitimacy for large-scale transformations?</p>Figure 2: In order to make a legitimate and just transition we need to build distributed capacity and capabilities, by connecting demand for and supply of transition conscious choices, while enabling every actor by developing a new humane development stack, e.g. a stack improving the settings affecting society’s learning ability, wellbeing, socioeconomic status, environmental quality, justice and equity, work conditions, connectivity and security&nbsp;[26].<p>In such a thesis (and investigating alongside outputs or outcomes) Climate City Contracting would focus on the means to strengthen democracies’ capacity to do deep change while tackling the frictions and lock-ins [27] preventing a democratically-desired change. The Contract would become a ten-year iterative process through which governments would build the capacity and capabilities to run, feedback, learn from and iterate civic deliberative processes [28] (at multiple scales). This iterative process would then create a Demand for transition conscious choices and open pathways to Supply society with transition conscious choices.</p>Figure 3: The contracting process would be an evolving process aiming to build shared sense-making and innovation as well as democratic fitness.<p>On the one hand, we need to build the capacity and capabilities within governments [29] to construct the Demand for transition conscious choices — choices that emerge from collective intelligence, a sense of collectivism and interdependent agencies.</p><p>Demand can be generated through civic sensemaking [30], discovery labs [31] and commitments [32]; at multiple scales from street collectives (e.g. cooperatives, land trusts, local organisations), associations (e.g. housing, sport, arts), anchor institutions (e.g. schools, universities, care homes) to business consortiums and multi-stakeholder networks. Civic sensemaking [33] would be a co-constructive process involving multiple stakeholders who identify and create opportunities for contextual challenges. This tool would help identify strategic risks created by both individual and collective behaviours, allowing the actors involved to participate in developing a vision towards a particular future (whether that be a safer, healthier, more prosperous neighbourhood or a more sustainable place for us all). Civic discovery labs [34] would empower individuals with the ability to provoke and challenge possible solutions by building portfolios of potential experiments [36] to address their strategic risks. Civic commitments [35] would allow multiple partners to commit to specific portfolio experiments, through pledging or participatory budgeting, set in a social setting; becoming a mechanism to hold partners accountable to the transition. A feedback loop can be formed through all three components, with the use of spatial information (e.g. mission dashboards or art installations) to continually share progress and engage citizens.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to build the Supply for transition conscious choices, with the aim of reducing the frictions and lock-ins in our current systems that hinder a democratic transition.</p><p>In this realm, the role of governments would include the adoption of measures to shift incentives and biases. This could be done by investing in innovation ecosystems [37]; by creating new fiscal incentives [38] that advance civic commitments [32]; and by securing lead procurement [39] to create direct support for commitments. Informed by experimentation, local as well as national in the long-term governments can start introducing new regulations and policies [40] to open pathways for scaling the transition.</p>Figure 4: Suggested principles of the contracting process.<p>To nurture an iterative and transparent process of development, Climate City Contracting would be designed under a set of principles:</p>  A contract with an open, additive and modular framework — continuously evolving.  A contract which is built on the foundations of advancing learning &amp; development.  A contract designed for radical legibility — accessible and understandable by everyone.  A contract where the city is defined as the extended city (i.e citizens, municipalities, industry, academia, civil society).  A contract for civic &amp; capital commitments accelerating a climate and sustainability transition.  A contract which is digital by default, and operating with a persistent, immutable record.  A contract designed on a hybrid contractual basis;    Short-term: contracting for self-defined outputs (in a particular context), i.e CO2 reduction, Community Wealth [41],&nbsp;etc.  Medium-term: contracting for collectively-defined outcomes, i.e. economic justice, human development, equality, etc.  Societal: contracting for capabilities for transition, i.e sense-making, experimentation, societal decision-making.  <p>8. A contract focused on driving accountability, through radical transparency and mass participatory engagement;</p>  Self accountability (feedback-based).  Collective accountability (peer2peer).  Public accountability (e.g. radical transparency, citizen&nbsp;audits).  <p>Context-dependent choices</p><p>In order to fully unlock a just transition, there is an additional need to invest in the contextual settings of a humane development, allowing every actor to make transition conscious choices with an awareness of interdependence. We know that our current financial, physical and psychological precariousness can lead to short-term decisions [42], infringing on our ability to make transition conscious choices. In this sense, we need to build an equitable humane development infrastructure to enable the democratic process of Climate City Contracting.</p>Figure 5: The Humane Development stack aims to enable care, craft, creativity, contextuality and complexity.<p>Learning from, for example, UNDP’s Human Development Index [26], a humane development context would need to address the infrastructures affecting society’s learning ability, wellbeing, socioeconomic status, environmental quality, justice and equity, work conditions, connectivity and security. We argue that these could be arranged along four layers including (1) self-authoring infrastructures (e.g. Folk schools 2.0, humane technology [43]), (2) freedom infrastructures (e.g. universal basic income [44], permission landscapes [45], universal basic green transport), (3) just environmental infrastructures (e.g. community urban forests [46], city-wide low pollution levels [47]) and (4) institutional infrastructures (e.g. preventative health care, employment contracts that account for the value of emotional labour). Sweden is already at the forefront of many of these aspects, however, there is still improvement to make. These infrastructures could further support local democracies in nurturing the distributed cognitive capacity to creatively craft and actively care for transition conscious choices. A Humane Development stack towards an accelerated and democratically-desired climate transition.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We often refer to the social contract as a theoretical or ambient idea. But we know this ambient idea has had tangible impacts on the relations formed between actors in society [48]. Climate City Contracting is an opportunity to reconsider our multiple social contracts, it is a year-on-year exercise that builds a democratic muscle to make the large-scale climate transition a reality, re-aligning our societies towards Humane Thriving.</p><p><a href="https://en.viablecities.se/">Viable Cities</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, together with a network of experts, are exploring how we can democratically contract for a climate transition.

As the incoherence of linear planning and single point solutions with issues like climate change or rapid urbanisation become increasingly apparent, organisations are starting to explore “portfolio approaches” as a way to better come to grips with complexity.

<p>Inledning till en diskussion om utvecklingsvägar för en demokratiskt önskvärd klimatomställning. (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">In English follow this&nbsp;link</a>)</p><p>I sin rapport “100 climate-neutral cities by 2030 — by and for the citizens” [1], föreslår EU:s styrgrupp för klimatneutrala städer utvecklingen av en “multi-level and co-creative process formalised in a Climate City Contract, adjusted to the realities of each city, […] aiming at the shared goal of the mission”. I Sverige undertecknade de nio första städerna ett nationellt klimatavtal (<a href="https://www.viablecities.se/klimatkontrakt-2030">Klimatkontrakt 2030</a>) den 11 december 2020, tillsammans med fyra nationella myndigheter och programmet Viable Cities. Klimatkontraktet som koncept kommer att vidareutvecklas under de närmaste åren. En central fråga i detta arbete är hur demokratier [2] kan skapa åtaganden för betydelsefulla samhällsförändringar i en tid av osäkerhet och komplexitet där man bevarar eller till och med skapar legitimitet?</p><p>Städer och kommuner är medvetna om de storskaliga omvandlingar som är nödvändiga för att ta itu med klimatkrisen. Men vi måste även inse att klimatkrisen inte är ett normalt förlopp i naturen. Vid sidan av förlusten av biologisk mångfald [3], växande global ojämlikhet [4], ekonomiska orättvisor [5] och andra lömska problem [6] är klimatförändringarna bara ett symptom på ett djupare strukturfel; vår oförmåga att bygga meningsfulla relationer genom sociala och demokratiska processer som kan skapa ett samhälle där vi alla frodas. Vår förmåga till relationer med andra människor, oss själva, saker, naturen och framtiden bör vara en grundläggande fråga när vi formar metoder för klimatomställningen. Om vi ​​inte kan göra denna djupgående förändring i våra samhällen kommer vi varken att kunna skapa legitimitet för storskalig förändring eller ta itu med de många risker vi står inför och som undergräver den mänskliga civilisationens kapacitet. Vi befinner oss i ett läge där vi måste välja om vi vill rikta våra ansträngningar mot en planet som frodas eller hålla en stadig kurs vid gränsen för vår överlevnad.</p><p>Omställning som går mot sammanflätning</p><p>Vi kan föreställa oss många versioner av framtiden och vill nu kort lyfta fram två av dessa. Den första versionen är baserad på arv från dominerande västerländska historieskrivningar där vi tenderar att luta oss mot riskhantering för att säkerställa vår överlevnad. Den andra versionen går bortom riskhantering och öppnar upp mot att skapa förutsättningar för regenerering och förnyelse av både samhällen och hela planeten.</p><p>Under de senaste århundradena har vi insisterat på ett tillvägagångssätt för mänsklig utveckling som bygger på att befalla och kontrollera [7]. På grund ut av detta tenderar våra demokratiska processer idag att skapa en passiv centralisering som förenklar verklighetens komplexitet och sammanflätade natur och leder till det man på engelska kallar “singularity of publics” [8], där allmänheten ses som ett enda, relativt homogent, uttryck.</p><p>Samtidigt blir det allt tydligare att vi lever i en sammanflätad tid. Det innebär att vi behöver ta in diversitet och sammankoppling. Kvantfysik har visat att det finns ett samband mellan grundläggande egenskaper hos partiklar [9] som inte kommit till av slumpen. Wood Wide Web [10] beskriver de miljontals arter av svampar och bakterier som utbyter näringsämnen mellan jorden och trädrötterna och bildar en stor sammankopplad organism. Inom biologin omprövas teorier och tankar om gränser för enskilda organismer [11] och om var biologiska kroppar slutar samt var deras omkringliggande miljöer börjar. Urbefolkningars språk och filosofier har alltid erkänt ett släktskap med naturen (kinship) [12].</p><p>Det kan vara svårt för nuvarande styrformer och institutionella strukturer att förhålla sig till denna omställning som går mot sammanflätning. En anledning till detta kan vara att det i grunden utmanar vår uppfattning av suveräniteter. Tänk om suveränitet inte definieras av politiska gränser (ex. landsgränser, politiska jurisdiktioner, privat egendom) utan snarare genom knutpunkterna i systemen (ex. mänskliga relationer, utbytet av näringsämnen mellan träd)? Hur kan vi då skapa förutsättningar för livskraftiga, gränsöverskridande och välmående ekosystem (miljö, människor, materia)? Skulle det kunna förändra åtaganden och relationer mellan olika suveräniteter och erkänna vår sammankopplade natur?</p><p>Investera i förmåga till relationer</p><p>Att investera i omställningen på ett sätt som förändrar hur vi relaterar till oss själva, andra och vår framtid [13] är redan ett bekant tillvägagångssätt för länder med djupgående demokrati [14], som till exempel de skandinaviska länderna. Under 1700-talet var dessa länder några av de fattigaste i världen [15], men från och med mitten av 1800-talet gjordes en rad investeringar i infrastruktur för mänsklig utveckling, vilket skapade några av de mest jämlika samhällen vi har&nbsp;idag.</p><p>Folkhögskolor [16] erbjöd en stor del av befolkningen en unik pedagogisk miljö som stöttade självförverkligande, gemenskap, praktisk kunskap och aktivt demokratiskt deltagande. Studenterna skulle utveckla såväl tekniska förmågor och självständigt tänkande, som förmåga att forma sin egen framtid. I Skandinavien har kooperativa rörelser [17] varit särskilt inflytelserika och bildat en stark process för självorganisering, vilken institutionaliserades genom överenskomna skriftliga regler, och i sin tur etablerade demokratiska processer som bidragit till att utveckla tillit och värdefullt socialt kapital. På liknande sätt införde den svenska regeringen ett lån, Egnahemslån [18], för att stödja arbetare i att bygga egna hus i utkanten av större städer där de kunde skapa bättre levnadsstandard och en koppling till naturen. Dessa och andra åtgärder möjliggjorde fredliga tekniska, ekonomiska och strukturella förändringar som utvecklade Danmark, Norge, Sverige och Finland till vad de är idag och beskrivs närmare i boken The Nordic Secret&nbsp;[13].</p>Figur 1: En kontraktsprocess som bygger kollektiv förmåga att göra medvetna val genom gemensam förståelse, medverkan och legitimitet för att möjliggöra omställningsinriktade val.<p>En aktiv process för Klimatkontrakt</p><p>Idag står städer i både Skandinavien och övriga världen inför ett antal utmaningar som bland annat höga skuldnivåer, värmeeffekter, katastrofala bränder och minskat mentalt välmående. Sedan 2015 har kommunernas skulder i Sverige ökat med 276 miljarder kronor [19], städer i de nordligaste delarna av Skandinavien upplever 3–5 °C uppvärmning på grund av global uppvärmning [20], Norges skogsbränder 2019 var de värsta på flera år [21] samtidigt som 83% av de skolflickor i Sverige med låg socioekonomisk status har lågt mentalt välmående, jämfört med 43% av de som lever i en högre socioekonomiska standard [22]. De historiska investeringarna som gjordes i det skandinaviska sammanhanget för mer än hundra år sedan är idag mer aktuella än någonsin.</p><p>Moderna riskhanteringsmetoder fokuserar på effekter och kontrakterar resultatbaserat. Men linjära strategier baserade på orsak och verkan fungerar inte längre eftersom lömska problem, som klimatförändringar, är relationsbaserade, muterar och därför ständigt utvecklas. När vi agerar i en verklighet som kännetecknas av osäkerhet och komplexitet, måste vi tänka på att bygga kapacitet och förmåga, snarare än att först och främst fokusera på resultat. Ett sådant skifte kräver att vi tänker igenom; (1) multipla domäner som innehåller både sociala och miljömässiga perspektiv (däribland tekniska, urbana, psykologiska, biologiska, institutionella, kulturella samt de som rör samhällets underliggande strukturella koder [23]), (2) att integrera flera aktörers perspektiv [24] och samtidigt stärka förmågan att utgå från andras perspektiv och (3) att beakta flera lager av demokrati (europeisk/nationell/stad/medborgare), var och en suverän och respektfullt medveten om det ömsesidiga beroendet [25] parterna sinsemellan.</p><p>En aktiv process för klimatkontrakt öppnar upp för möjligheten att röra oss mot det man på engelska kallar “plurality of ‘publics’” [8], där allmänheten synliggörs i uttryck som är mer diversa, och medvetna om det ömsesidiga beroendet gentemot andra. Detta kan ske genom att utgå från frågeställningen: hur kan demokratier skapa åtaganden för en rättvis omställning för klimat och hållbarhet i en tid av osäkerhet och komplexitet, som samtidigt bygger legitimitet för storskalig förändring?</p>Figur 2: För att kunna bygga en legitim och rättvis omställning behöver vi skapa distribuerad kapacitet och förmåga. Detta kan göras genom att sammankoppla tillgång och efterfrågan på omställningsinriktade val, samtidigt som varje aktörs medverkan möjliggörs genom en satsning på allas personliga och gemensamma utveckling. En utveckling som innefattar att förbättra samhällets förmåga till lärande, allas välmående, socioekonomiska förhållanden, kvaliteten i våra miljöer, rättvisa, arbetsförhållanden, sammankoppling och säkerhet&nbsp;[26].<p>En tes är att vi, snarare än att stirra oss blinda på effekt eller resultat, kan se en aktiv process med klimatkontrakt som ett medel att stärka vår demokratiska förmåga att göra stora förändringar samtidigt som vi minskar friktion och inlåsningar [27] som hindrar demokratiskt önskvärd förändring. Kontraktet kan ses som en tioårig iterativ process där beslutande offentliga aktörer för det första bygger kapacitet och förmåga att genomföra, återkoppla från, lära av och iterera medborgerliga deliberativa processer [28] (på flera nivåer) som skapar efterfrågan på nya omställningsinriktade val och för det andra öppnar upp utvecklingsvägar som ger samhället ett utbud av sådana omställningsinriktade val.</p>Figur 3: Kontraktsprocessen är en utvecklande process som syftar till att bygga gemensamt meningsskapande, innovationsförmåga och demokratisk kondition (fitness).<p>Å ena sidan behöver vi stödja förmågan och kapaciteten hos beslutande offentliga aktörer [29] så att de kan bidra till att väcka efterfrågan på hållbara val, val som framträder genom stärkt kollektiv intelligens, en känsla av gemenskap och ömsesidigt beroende.</p><p>En sådan efterfrågan kan skapas via gemensamt meningsskapande [30], utforskande labb [31] och åtaganden [32] i olika omfattningar från kollektiva gator (t.ex. kooperativ, land trust och lokala organisationer), föreningar (t.ex. bostads-, sport-, eller konstföreningar), institutioner som involverar många i samhället (t.ex. skolor, universitet och vårdhem) till företag och nätverk. Gemensamt meningsskapande [33] kan vara en samskapande process där flera intressenter involveras som identifierar utmaningar och möjligheter utifrån verkligheten i ett visst sammanhang. Detta verktyg kan bidra till att identifiera strategiska risker som skapas såväl av individuella och kollektiva beteenden, och möjliggöra för de involverade aktörerna att utveckla en vision av framtiden (oavsett om det handlar om ett säkrare, mer välmående, eller mer hållbart samhälle). Gemensamma utforskande labb [34] ger människor möjlighet att provocera och utmana möjliga lösningar genom att bygga portföljer av möjliga experiment [36] som möter deras strategiska risker. Gemensamma åtaganden [35] kan göra det möjligt för aktörer att tillsammans åta sig specifika delar av de portföljer av experiment som föreslås, genom att göra sådana publika eller genom medborgarbudgetar. När detta sker i ett publikt sammanhang blir det också en mekanism för att hålla parter ansvariga för omställningen. En återkoppling kan ske från alla tre komponenterna via rumsligt representerad information (som exempelvis informationstavlor eller konstinstallationer) för att kontinuerligt dela framsteg och engagera medborgare.</p><p>Å andra sidan måste vi också bygga utbudet av omställningsinriktade val på ett sätt som bidrar till att minska inlåsningar i befintliga system som hindrar en demokratisk omställning. Här har offentliga aktörer en viktig roll genom att förändra incitament och motverka fördomar och egenintressen. Detta kan göras genom att investera i innovationsekosystem [37], exempelvis genom nya skatteincitament [38] som främjar gemensamma åtaganden [32] och genom att främja upphandling som skapar nya marknader [39] som direkt stödjer åtagandena. Baserat på insikter från den experimentella processen kan offentliga aktörer börja införa nya regler och policyer [40] som skapar förutsättningar för att skala upp omställningen.</p>Figur 4: Föreslagna utvecklingsprinciper för en aktiv process med klimatkontraktet.<p>Genom att värna om en stegvis och transparent utvecklingsprocess kan en aktiv process med klimatkontrakt designas enligt en uppsättning principer:</p>  Ett kontrakt med ett öppet, additivt och modulärt ramverk som utvecklas kontinuerligt.  Ett kontrakt som bygger på att främja lärande och utveckling.  Ett kontrakt som är överskådligt, lättillgängligt och enkelt för alla att&nbsp;förstå.  Ett kontrakt där staden definieras som den utvidgade staden (dvs. inkluderar medborgare, kommun, näringsliv, akademi, civilsamhälle).  Ett kontrakt där gemensamma och finansiella åtaganden snabbar på omställningen.  Ett kontrakt som är digitalt och där varje version finns tillgänglig.  Ett kontrakt som har en hybrid design för kontraktsförhållanden;    Kort sikt: åtaganden för självdefinierade resultat i det egna sammanhanget, såsom minskade klimatutsläpp, gemensamt välstånd (Community Wealth [41])&nbsp;etc.  Medellång sikt: åtaganden för kollektivt definierade resultat, såsom ekonomisk rättvisa, mänsklig utveckling, jämlikhet, etc.  På samhällsnivå: åtaganden för att bygga omställningsförmåga, såsom gemensamt meningsskapande, experimentering, beslutsfattande i samhället, etc.  <p>8. Ett kontrakt som driver ansvarstagande genom radikal öppenhet och massdeltagande;</p>  Eget ansvarstagande (baserat på återkoppling till&nbsp;själv)  Kollektivt ansvarstagande (jämlike till jämlike, peer2peer)  Samhälleligt ansvarstagande (radikal öppenhet, medborgsargranskring )  <p>Kontextberoende val</p><p>För att fullt ut möjliggöra en rättvis omställning behöver vi dessutom investera i sådant som ger alla möjlighet att utvecklas som människor, att göra omställningsinriktade val och ta hänsyn till vårt ömsesidiga beroende. Vi att vet den ekonomiska, fysiska och psykologiska utsatthet som finns idag kan leda till kortsiktiga beslut [42] som begränsar vår förmåga att göra omställningsinriktade val. Därför är det avgörande att vi bygger en infrastruktur för rättvis och mänsklig utveckling som möjliggör en demokratisk och aktiv process för klimatkontrakt.</p>Figur 5: Lager av infrastrukturer för mänsklig utveckling som möjliggör omtanke, skapande, kreativitet, förståelse av sammanhang och komplexitet.<p>Utifrån lärdomar från t.ex. UNDP’s Human Development Index [26] skulle mänsklig utveckling behöva beakta de infrastrukturer som påverkar samhällets inlärningsförmåga, välmående, socioekonomiska förhållanden, rättvisa, arbetsförhållanden, konnektivitet och säkerhet. Vi menar att dessa kan organiseras i fyra kategorier; (1) infrastruktur för självförverkligande (t.ex. folkhögskolor 2.0, teknik som gynnar mänsklig utveckling [43], etc.), (2) infrastruktur för allas valmöjlighet (t.ex. universell basinkomst [44], tillstånd att agera45, etc.), (3) infrastruktur för hållbarhet (t.ex. urbana skogar [46], låga nivåer av föroreningar i städer [47], etc.) och (4) institutionella infrastrukturer (t.ex. preventiv hälso- och sjukvård, affärsmodeller som inkluderar både affärsmässigt och samhälleligt värdeskapande, etc.). Sverige ligger redan i framkant inom många av dessa områden, men det finns utrymme för ytterligare förbättring. Dessa infrastrukturer kan stödja lokal demokratisk förmåga så att människor också kreativt och aktivt kan engagera sig i omställningsinriktade val som främjar en snabbare klimatomställning.</p><p>Slutsats</p><p>Vi hänvisar ofta till samhällskontraktet som en teoretisk och diffus idé. Men vi vet att den diffusa idén har haft konkreta effekter på relationer mellan olika aktörer i samhället [48]. Klimatkontraktet är en möjlighet att ompröva våra samhällskontrakt år efter år och stärka våra demokratiska muskler för att kunna förverkliga en storskalig omställning till ett samhälle där människor trivs och utvecklas.</p><p>Viable Cities och Dark Matter Laboratories utforskar tillsammans med ett nätverk av experter hur vi demokratiskt skapar åtaganden för omställning till hållbara och klimatneutrala städer.

Dess lösning är oåterkallelig, vilket betyder att varje försök räknas, 6) Det finns inget slut på antalet möjliga lösningar och sätt att närma sig lömska problem, 7) Alla lömska problem är i huvudsak unika, 8) Lömska problem kan alltid beskrivas som symptom på andra problem, 9) Sättet på vilket ett lömskt problem beskrivs bestämmer dess möjliga lösningar, 10) Planläggare, det är de som presenterar lösningar på dessa problem, kan inte veta vad som är rätt eller fel. Till skillnad från matematiker, är planläggare ansvariga för konsekvenserna av de lösningar som de genererar; effekterna kan spela stor roll för de personer som berörs av handlingarna.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Attending AWS re:Invent is always an exceptional experience and, despite it being virtual, this year was no different. As usual, there were the expected announcements of bigger better and faster services and components. AWS always shows a remarkable level of innovation with many more announcements than it is practical to cover comprehensively. Therefore, in this blog, I will focus on what I think are some of the highlights in the areas of hybrid IT, edge computing, machine learning as well as security and compliance.</p>
<p>There is an old adage – “Keep it Simple Stupid” and this is excellent advice. In his keynote, Andy Jassy described the need for organization to avoid complexity in order to achieve agility. This is the thinking that lies behind how AWS is evolving its services towards platforms focussed on simplifying the solutions to real-world problems. Jassy also described how he believes the definition of the hybrid cloud needs to be rethought.</p>
 Hybrid IT 
<p>What now exists in most organizations is a complex mixture of IT services some delivered on-premises and some delivered through the cloud. This is currently defined as hybrid IT.</p>
<p>However, there is now an increase in computing outside of the data centre and at the edge where much of the useful data exists. In addition, advanced networking capabilities provided by technologies like 5G will increase access to this data as well as augment the possibilities for remote control and automation.</p>
<p>In his keynote, Jassy stated that people have become too settled on the definition of hybrid as meaning on-premises plus cloud. AWS’s vision is that there are now so many IT components outside of the data centre, in offices, factories, on ships and elsewhere that cloud plus the edge will become the dominant elements in the future IT infrastructure. This is a vision for clouds of things being the infrastructure for the organization of tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, managing and securing this increasingly complex set of services, upon which the world has now become dependent, are now the critical factor. Just consider the impact of the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55299779">short Google outage</a> with people complaining that they could not switch the lights on in their home.</p>
 Edge Computing 
<p>Given the importance placed on this area by Jassy, there were several announcements.</p>
<p>Like other vendors, AWS offers a “cloud in a box” which the customer can deploy wherever it is needed. There may be several reasons that customers choose this including proximity to data, compliance related to service/data location, and network latency. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/1u-2u/">AWS announced that AWS Outposts will be offered in 2 new sizes</a>, including a smaller size in 2 flavours Graviton / Intel.</p>
<p>AWS says that they now have thousands of customers using this. One key benefit of this product is that it enables the full range of Machine Learning services close to where they may be needed. Since most of this is managed by AWS, it effectively extends the cloud to wherever it is located. However, beware - this introduces some extra customer responsibilities – for physical security, power and local infrastructure as shown in figure 1. It therefore adds a little more complexity to the already complex hybrid management challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Customer responsibilities for IaaS and Cloud on Premises</p>
<p>IoT is an important element of AWS’s vision of this new hybrid IT environment and there were several announcements in this area. AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-iot-greengrass-2-0-provides-open-source-edge-runtime-capabilities-building-operating-iot-device-software/">IoT Greengrass release 2.0 is now available</a> - this provides an open-source edge runtime, which includes a set of pre-built software components, tools for local software development, and new features for managing device software on large fleets of devices.</p>
<p>Another area is integration with 5G to achieve very low network latency. AWS achieves this through what they call “Local Zones”. Here AWS infrastructure is deployed closer to large population, industry, and IT centres where no AWS region exists. &nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-preview-of-aws-local-zones-in-boston-houston-and-miami/">AWS announced a preview of AWS Local Zones</a> in Boston, Houston, and Miami, with plans to launch 12 additional AWS Local Zones throughout 2021 in key metro areas in the United States including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York. There are currently no plans for these in Europe.</p>
<p>5G is not the only communication type supported. AWS also announced AWS IoT Core for <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoRaWAN</a>, a fully managed capability that allows AWS IoT Core customers to connect and manage wireless devices that use low-power long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) connectivity with the AWS cloud. It enables them to set up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting their own LoRaWAN devices and gateways to the AWS cloud - without developing or operating a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).</p>
 Industrial Edge 
<p>AWS says that their innovation always follows customer demands and so it is interesting to note how AWS is expanding their services with a focus on an industrial plant.</p>
<p>AWS announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-amazon-lookout-for-equipment-a-service-which-detects-abnormal-equipment-behavior-and-enable-predictive-maintenance/">Amazon Lookout for Equipment</a>, a service which provides a way for customers with existing sensors on their industrial equipment, to send their sensor data to AWS to build machine learning models and return predictions to detect abnormal equipment behaviour. This enables predictive maintenance that allows them to act before machine failures occur and avoid unplanned downtime.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-amazon-lookout-for-vision-to-automate-quality-inspection/">Amazon Lookout for Vision</a> is a new machine learning service to find visual defects in industrial products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing components in products, damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in silicon wafers — or any other physical item where quality is important.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-aws-iot-sitewise-edge-preview/">AWS announced AWS IoT SiteWise Edge (Preview)</a>, a new feature of AWS IoT SiteWise providing software that runs on-premises at industrial sites and makes it easy to collect, process, and monitor equipment data locally before sending the data to AWS Cloud destinations.</p>
 Machine Learning 
<p>In line with AWS’s intentions to make it simpler to use their services, several new useful tools have now been now fully integrated into Amazon SageMaker.</p>
<p>One interesting example is the announcement of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/detect-bias-in-ml-models-and-explain-model-behavior-with-amazon-sagemaker-clarify/">Amazon SageMaker Clarify</a> to help machine learning developers achieve greater visibility into their training data and models so they can identify and limit bias and explain predictions.</p>
<p>Training machine learning models is hard because a neural network does not provide an explanation of why a conclusion was reached. In addition, this also makes it difficult to ensure that the neural network has not been trained on biased data. There are mathematical models from game theory that can help in this area – notably the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapely values</a> that help to show the relative contribution made by different elements. The challenge is that some of the tools available are not robust or well-integrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Amazon SageMaker Clarify provides an integrated approach to detect potential bias during data preparation, after training, and in the deployed model by examining attributes specified. SageMaker Clarify also includes feature importance graphs that help to explain model predictions and produces reports that can be used to identify issues with the model that can then be corrected.</p>
 Security and Compliance 
<p>Stephen Schmidt AWS CISO in his keynote reviewed the AWS security capabilities that customers had found most impactful during 2020. Top of this list was <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3_detection.html">Amazon Guard Duty S3 Protection</a>. This emphasizes the importance organizations place on taking care of their data how the first sign of a cyber-attack is often unusual access to data.</p>
<p>While AWS take great care to secure the service that they deliver organizations still have concerns over how they can prove that their use of the service meets their security objectives and compliance obligations.</p>
<p>This often involves manually collecting and collating evidence from multiple sources to respond to queries from internal and external auditors. To simplify this process AWS announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-aws-audit-manager/">AWS Audit Manager</a>.</p>
<p>This is a new service that helps to continuously audit AWS usage to assess risk and to demonstrate compliance with regulations and industry standards. It automates the collection of evidence on whether the controls are operating and effective. It includes predefined templates for common compliance needs such as CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</p>
<p>It is expected that internal and external auditors will be the main users of this service.</p>
 My Opinion 
<p>AWS has a unique approach to innovation with a very strong focus on providing what the customer wants. Accepting the need for simplification in the complex world of IT services is very welcome and the announcements show how AWS is achieving this for its platform.</p>
<p>AWS’s alternative vision for the hybrid cloud recognises that the future of the IoT is inescapably linked with the cloud. The IoT will actually become the clouds of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, while it is right to emphasize this aspect of hybrid IT for the future, today many organizations are struggling today with the problems of securing and managing their mixture of SaaS, IaaS and on-premises services and a solution to this problem is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The release of AWS SageMaker Clarify provides a useful out of the box solution for some of the current challenges of bias and explanation related to machine learning. However, while it provides a robust implementation of the state of the art in this area, it does not provide a revolutionary solution.</p>
<p>AWS Audit Manager will provide welcome capabilities for organizations to reduce the costs of demonstrating the effectiveness of their AWS controls and how these are meeting their compliance obligations. The challenges of doing this for the whole heterogeneous IT stack involved in many business-critical applications remain to be solved.</p>

<p>Digital transformation is everywhere. It is used to describe so many things that it risks losing its meaning, and with it, the potential for a common approach to supporting it in pursuit of equitable, sustainable development. We’re sharing this blog, then, as part of defining this important area.</p><p>Digital transformation should include both the processes and outcomes of mindful, intentional, and shapeable efforts that lead to intended, prosocial effects. Definitions of digital transformation at the firm level tend to focus on existing or new business models. For McKinsey, it is to “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-transformation-improving-the-odds-of-success#">enable existing business models by integrating advanced technologies</a>,” while for Salesforce, it’s “<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/">using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences</a>.”</p><p>Definitions at the national level tend to take a broader perspective. The European Commission characterizes digital transformation as “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/advanced-technologies_en">a fusion of advanced technologies and the integration of physical and digital systems</a>.” The OECD defines it as “t<a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264312012-en">he economic and societal effects of digitization and digitalization</a>.” This is important; while the first three definitions focus on process, the last focuses on effects and the consequences of these significant changes.</p><p>Development-focused definitions emphasize this outcome-focused perspective but highlight challenges and risk. The Pathways Commission at Oxford University cautions that “<a href="https://bsg-pathwaystoprosperity.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/The_Digital_Roadmap.pdf">The use of digital technologies will not automatically lead to the inclusion of the poor and marginalized</a>.” UNCTAD points to the <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/der2019_en.pdf">challenge of measuring the broader national digital economy</a> and emphasizes how digital transformation is “<a href="https://unctad.org/topic/ecommerce-and-digital-economy/ungis-dialogue#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20the%20United,UNGIS%20presents%20for%20more%20effective">highlighting the significant divides that exist.</a>” The United Nations Foundation Digital Impact Alliance, having reviewed over 30 frameworks, concludes that “<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/accelerating-national-digital-transformation-announcing-the-first-in-dials-new-series-of-leadership-briefs/">more work is required to attempt an overarching articulation of the most important elements</a>” of digital transformation. This blog is a contribution to this continuing effort.</p><p>We believe that the emphasis on transformation as both process and effects is particularly important, especially as although digitization and digitalization are well underway, accelerated by the response to COVID-19 (remote working, payments, etc.), these are not inevitable processes. They are the results of human decisions. Similarly, the effects of these are not inevitable, either. We agree that technologies <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify</a> intent, and left unchecked, digital transformation may amplify the most powerful, strengthening autocracy and dystopia. With strategic engagement and clear intention, it is possible to build ethical and inclusive digital economies, societies, and politics that mitigate risk and prioritize protection.</p><p>Digital transformation that works for all requires values-based intentional focus on the promises of this new era and mindfulness to mitigate their perils. The following five considerations are insights that help us ensure we are intentional in our support to governments, donors, and other partners in their work to ensure digital transformation prioritizes people, protects fundamental rights, and promotes equality of opportunity.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation as development in a digital age</a>. Since we made this phrase central to our work in 2016, we’ve only become more convinced that while digital is fundamental to processes of change in politics, economy, and society, the emphasis needs to be not on digital but on the changes and developmental outcomes. It is vital to recognize that this is not simply focusing on technology to drive changes, and that there are particular characteristics and challenges to achieve developmental goals in a digital age. As we wrote for one donor, “Digital transformation introduces new risks as well as opportunities,” so building inclusive, ethical transformation demands engaging “<a href="https://link.medium.com/ZfiwxERgubb">with complex, nuanced concepts around agency, literacy, power, and structure in the digital&nbsp;age.</a>”  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation requires an ecosystem approach</a>. Most digital development projects still exist in sectoral silos and/or are driven by a relentlessly optimistic approach to “connecting the last billion.” This is despite all the evidence pointing to the significant cross-cutting — both negative and positive — impacts of digital technologies on economies and societies as the excellent<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016"> 2016 World Development Report</a> on “Digital Dividends” laid out. We have found it helpful to firstly define and bind <a href="https://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-ecosystems">digital ecosystems</a>, at the national or firm level, for example, and to engage at this level — for example, on mapping a <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">digital identity</a> or on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-57878-5_4">entrepreneurial ecosystems</a>. Although the map is not the territory, it is vital to know the terrain before plotting a course to successfully reach your&nbsp;goal.  Digital transformation must be inclusive, leave no one behind, and prioritize the protection of vulnerable communities. Otherwise, at best, it will leave them behind, or at worse, it will increase vulnerability and exclusion. The promise of digital transformation in terms of added value to government and the economy are increasingly recognized, but there is a growing realization of the harms these transformations can bring, particularly on the most vulnerable. We have found that for groups such as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">women</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">informal, gig, and platform</a> workers, there are increased risks to privacy, personal protection, and secure jobs that enable social wellbeing — not forgetting the risks to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/unbundling-the-imaginary-community-adf1eb7e5ea8">political process and social polarization</a>. In supporting clients to develop digital transformation strategies, we have emphasized the importance of incorporating “responsible digital” and “digital inclusion” as critical components of strategy to support ethical and inclusive digital transformation.  Digital transformation should be integrative, not additive. In our work with partners, we are often asked to develop a digital program — building a new team and developing a program of work. We have found that to effectively influence the arc of digital transformation, development outcomes can be better achieved if programs and organizations incorporate digital into existing teams, programs, and work. We advised on ways that <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">digital information systems might enable humanitarian to social protection transitions</a> while emphasizing protection and security. We worked with Oxfam to help their team conceptualize, develop, and sustain an <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">approach that emphasized digital</a> technologies that “<a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">are not an end in themselves; but&nbsp;…integrated into existing programs</a>.”  Digital transformation requires leadership and ownership. All change is hard, and without leadership, it is often sidelined and withers. Efforts to direct digital transformation are no different, and require leadership to own and push for the changes that are required. Globally, efforts such as the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> provide helpful normative framings. With national governments, we’ve found it to be critical to identify champions who take ownership and invest political capital in attaining success. However, champions cannot be isolated figures. One international development donor that we supported in developing a team of digital champions found they were unable to gain traction because they had no ownership over the processes they tried to influence.  <p>There are many different interests advancing the processes and effects of digital transformations, but for these to lead to inclusive development outcomes requires purposeful, intentional, and considered engagement. This will be particularly important as the challenges of equitable progress, social inclusion, and climate change place ever greater demands on the international community and its capacity to&nbsp;respond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/transformation-in-a-digital-age-9068338fd778">Transformation in a Digital Age</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We invited everyone to join us for a Demo Day to learn about the company, meet the Fission team, and share everything we've built in the past year. We shared our technical building blocks and the roadmap that we have planned. We ended with demos of apps built on our platform so far.</p> Fission: Fast App Publishing Platform <p>Fission is building an app publishing platform that supports developers in building great apps, connecting to users, and getting app makers paid.</p><p>Rather than "just" being next-gen cloud infrastructure and technology that powers great apps, we're saying that the Fission platform will help developers reach their ultimate goal of building an app: having app users, and having those users support the app.</p><p>In short:</p> <p>🚢&nbsp;Ship Apps, 🗣&nbsp;Talk to Users, 💵&nbsp;Make Money</p> <p>Is that too bold or blunt? We are a platform that supports developers, and ensuring that digital makers are successful means that more great software can get built.</p><p>Here are some of the further themes, movements, and beliefs we're thinking about:</p> Open Collective <p>Fission is now a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Fiscal Host on Open Collective</a>. We are doing this in order to work closely with open source developers that want to work together with their users to build and maintain apps sustainably over time.</p><p>We are also placing our own open source software on Open Collective, starting with Fission Drive.</p>Try <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive »</a><p>The <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive/contribute/drive-23617">Drive+ membership tier</a> is an annual support tier that supports building out Drive and the associated Fission account. Backers get special badges on our Discord chat and Discourse forums, will have members-only access to communication channels, including voting on features and other opportunities. Drive+ members will also get a one year Fission Premium account when we launch support for it.</p><p>If you like what we're doing, and want to support more of it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive/contribute/drive-23617">sign up for Drive+ »</a></p><p>Thank you so much to <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339652057049911296">Gyuri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339688618726584320">Helder</a>, <a href="https://brianginsburg.com/">Brian</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339659752393961473?s=20">Omo Earth</a> team for being backers on the very first day. We appreciate your early support in this!</p> Full Demo Day Video <p>The full 2 hour video is split into chapters so you can jump to different sections. We'll be sharing smaller portions of the video after a little bit of editing.</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/events/n1BLwS/fission-demo-day-december-2020">Slides are available on Notist »</a></p> Open Source Collaboration <p>We are very proud of all the technical building blocks we've shipped so far, and have had some early discussions with other teams about adopting some of the protocols we've defined. During Demo Day, it was fantastic to hear that a lot of you want to get more involved!</p><p>We've scheduled a community kick off meeting to work on the WNFS Database layer for January 7th, 2021. <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/wnfs-db-api-aka-wndb-research-design-session/1335">Full details on the forum</a>, please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrKyfvfigz8PpNGV">RSVP » </a></p> <p>Thank you to everyone that joined us. It was great to see you and we really appreciate your interest and the excitement you showed. The team has put a lot of work into what we've shipped so far, and we can't wait to see what you build with Fission.</p><p>We shared and announced a lot during this one event, so we'll be posting more from the event over the next week. We wish everyone a restful time as we head into the winter holidays, and look forward to more in 2021!</p>

<p>Firstly, I hope you’re keeping well and looking forward to the holiday season. This has been a difficult year for many, but I’m pleased to say progress has continued unabated here at Nuggets. In fact, we’ve made some significant strides&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We’ve all been working remotely for the past 10 months, with no in-person events since early March. But everyone has adapted well, and the pandemic restrictions haven’t held us&nbsp;back.</p><p>Looking back at some of the highlights from the last 12 months, I’m extremely proud of what we’ve been able to achieve — and enormously excited for&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s a quick&nbsp;recap…</p><p>Product</p>  Our big product news this year was the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nuggets-pay-id/id1216139887">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.nuggets.app">Android</a> releases across Europe in May, and shortly after in Australia. This was a huge step for us: making Nuggets available to any business that wants to protect its customer data. Now, anyone can enjoy the privacy, security and simplicity of&nbsp;Nuggets.  We also launched <a href="https://merchandise.nuggets.life/">our own demo store</a>, which allows businesses to test the platform in a live environment. Any business can download Nuggets and experience the onboarding, log in and payment flows — without sharing or storing their data. It gives potential partners a full overview of exactly how the platform works, and allows them to run through the user experience.  Our engineering team grew this year — and will again in 2021. As always, there’s been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes.The team has been hard at work on UI/UX, infrastructure and architecture updates, continually improving the platform’s resilience, robustness and functionality. This puts us in a great position for the exciting things we have lined up for&nbsp;2021.  In June we created a <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xeab7e907e01203bf0b823dbe135b151921b74568">liquidity pool for NUG on Uniswap</a>, meaning NUG is now available to swap with any other ERC20 token available on the platform.  <p>Partnerships and memberships</p>  We announced our commercial partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions in November, after working with them for some time. This is a big one. LexisNexis is one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data, and one of the biggest risk and fraud companies in the world. And this partnership has huge, positive implications for us. Specifically, we’re working together to deliver self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) solutions for existing and prospective customers. <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/new-nuggets-partnership-with-lexisnexis-risk-solutions-769fa676de0">There’s more on this on Alastair’s blog</a>.  We joined the<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/"> Open Identity Exchange</a> (OIX) earlier this year, complementing our existing membership of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. Formed in 2010 to address the increasing challenges of building trust in online identity, OIX is uniquely dedicated to ID Trust. As a member, we’re collaborating on thought leadership initiatives and getting involved in sector-specific working groups. Fellow members include companies such as Barclays, Microsoft, LexisNexis and HSBC. We’ll also be able to support pilot projects, working alongside other members. For more on OIX, read <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/were-now-members-the-open-identity-exchange-89424eb77ad8">my blog from September</a>.  <p>Awards and recognition</p><p>We’ve done well on this score in the past, and thought last year would be hard to beat. Little did we know! We don’t celebrate these accolades just to show off — they’re important evidence of the impact we’re&nbsp;making.</p><p>Let’s start with the&nbsp;awards:</p>  Most recently, we won ‘<a href="https://www.emergingpaymentsawards.com/2020-winners">Best Use of Blockchain in Financial Services</a>’ at the Emerging Payments&nbsp;Awards  We won ‘<a href="https://www.retail-systems.com/awards/winners20.php">Mobile Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Retail Systems Awards, and ‘<a href="https://www.payments-awards.com/awards/winners20.php">Security Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Payments Awards — where we were nominated for five awards in&nbsp;total.  Nuggets also won the <a href="https://youtu.be/AemOOIByaQg">Women in Payments Unicorn Challenge</a>, where I got to showcase the platform to a panel of judges from Santander, JP Morgan and American Express. Competing against five other fintechs, we were especially proud to win both the main judges’ award and the audience choice&nbsp;award.  On a personal note, I was honoured to receive some individual awards this year, including <a href="https://techplaymakerawards.com/last-years-awards/seema-khinda-johnson">Entrepreneur of the Year at the Booking.com Technology Playmaker Awards</a>, and the <a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2020/2020-female-fintech-competition-winner-announced-en-11710.htm">Female FinTech Competition 2020</a> held by Atos, Deutsche Bank, Google and TechQuartier.  <p>We were nominated for other awards&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named as one of the 10 Best Payments Startups globally in Efma-Capgemini’s Financial NewTech Challenge 2020  We were nominated for ‘Best Enterprise Security Product’ at Computing.co.uk’s Technology Product Awards, and were up for a Financial Services Forum’s Product and Service Innovation Award, in the Security&nbsp;category  <p>There was plenty of high-profile recognition for Nuggets&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named one of the ‘<a href="https://info.harringtonstarr.com/the-financial-technologist-tufwa-edition-2019-0">Most Influential Firms in Financial Technology for 2020</a>’ by Financial Technologist Magazine. Judges from EY and Lloyds Banking Group selected the shortlist based on innovation, growth, product and&nbsp;team.  We were listed in <a href="https://www.businesscloud.co.uk/100-fintech-disrupters-2">BusinessCloud’s 100 FinTech Disrupters</a>, at number 42. That put Nuggets alongside some of the UK’s most established names such as Revolut, Starling Bank, Monzo and Checkout.com  We were also included in the <a href="https://www.efma.com/assets/portals/fintech/FNT_Watchlist_banner_Final.pdf">Efma-Capgemini Global Financial NewTech 2020 Watchlist</a>. The list is made up of 100 Financial NewTechs that will help reshape financial services in&nbsp;2020.  Alastair and I appeared in the <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/who-are-the-uks-top-32-fintech-leaders/97865">UK’s ‘Top 32’ fintech leaders</a> by Business Leader&nbsp;News  I was also named one of the <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/list/the-most-influential-women-in-payments-2020">Most Influential Women in Payments 2020</a> by PaymentSource, and selected for the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/30-entrepreneurs-selected-for-female-founders-first-programme-by-barclays">Female Founders First programme</a>, created by Barclays and Techstars. Just two weeks ago, I made it onto the <a href="https://asiansintech.com/top-100-asian-stars-in-uk-tech-2020">Top 100 Asian Stars in UK Tech&nbsp;list</a>.  <p>Team</p>  Our sales team grew this year, and we were delighted to welcome Ben Geleit as Director of Partnerships and Alliances. Ben’s been driving all the end-to-end go-to-market activity and commercialisation. We’re now working through a number of great opportunities, and hope to reveal more in the new&nbsp;year.  <p>Events and&nbsp;media</p><p>We haven’t been to as many events as previous years — for obvious reasons! But we did manage to get to a few at the start of the&nbsp;year.</p>  I took part in a fireside chat as part of the European Women Payments Network Meetup, held at legal firm Allen and Overy’s offices in London in February.  In January, I was invited by MasterCard to speak at Paris FinTech Forum. I showcased Nuggets during a session entitled ‘Building trust in the future with…Data’.  I was also involved in a panel discussion at February’s Women in Identity Meetup, where the discussion focussed on ‘Diversity and Identity’.  Our last event before the lockdown was in March, when Alastair took to the stage at London Blockchain Week — twice! On Day One he was on a panel on Decentralised Finance. Day Two saw him discussing data sovereignty on the Decentralised Data Marketplace panel.  <p>Once again, there’s been a huge amount of media coverage throughout the year. We’ve been in titles like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-id-solution-aims-to-tackle-spike-in-delivery-fraud-amid-coronavirus-measures">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/tech/seven-tech-innovations-to-help-run-stores-in-a-post-coronavirus-world/7034882.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1RKaU1XWm1aak16Wm1KaiIsInQiOiJESkpXSkJtVlZxQjh6Mm5FcjFkaUNhWjVGbUVqVnMxbEY1VHlKWExEZWFRRHFPaFZWdjd0VVdtbTV5Rlp5K2FKaUFyU3AxMENhM0d1Z2U2a1pYWWlWY0FobVZlaFNXdjdMa1NuZmM0SWV5WlVOTE5aWEtpeXN0eFFuVVdMVmdyNSJ9&amp;authent=1">RetailWeek</a>, Cointelegraph (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-digital-id-putting-people-in-control-of-their-data">here</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bookingcoms-entrepreneur-of-the-year-talks-blockchain-and-women-in-tech?platform=hootsuite">here</a>), <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/how-biometrics-can-put-an-end-to-identity-theft">TechRadar</a>, <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/the-era-of-cashlessness-is-here-are-we-prepared-for-the-change/">The Fintech Times</a>, <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lexis-nexis-risk-explores-blockchain-identity-to-address-bank-fraud">Ledger Insights</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/nuggets-brings-biometrics-to-delivery-confirmation-as-industry-offers-solutions-for-new-working-normal">Biometric Update</a>, to name but a few. <a href="https://nuggets.life/media.html">Visit the Media page on our website</a> for a full list of this year’s coverage.</p><p>Alastair continued to publish his influential thought leadership articles on Forbes.

<p>Già qualche anno fa, da quando abbiamo cominciato a parlare di Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale (SPID), abbiamo preventivato che, nel momento in cui il sistema avesse raggiunto un numero sufficientemente alto di utenti attivi, imprese e aziende private avrebbero cominciato ad affiancare le Pubbliche Amministrazioni per rendere disponibile l’accesso ai propri servizi attraverso le credenziali SPID, innescando un circolo virtuoso in cui:</p>



  per i cittadini diventa estremamente conveniente avere l’accesso&nbsp; a sempre più servizi con lo stesso set di credenziali;  per soggetti pubblici e privati diventa sempre più importante semplificare l’accesso ai propri servizi online con SPID per una mole crescente di utenti.  



<p>Il momento sembra arrivato.&nbsp; Negli ultimi mesi il numero di Identità Digitali SPID rilasciate ai cittadini è infatti lievitato, spinto dalla pandemia (vista la necessità di richiedere aiuti economici e dialogare con gli uffici pubblici da remoto) e dalle ultime iniziative del Governo, quali il cashback di Stato.</p>



<p>Di conseguenza, le organizzazioni private cominciano a farsi avanti e ne è un esempio Directa, che sfruttando i servizi di InfoCert (Service Provider SPID) ha anticipato tutti con il proprio servizio di “Apertura conto trading” tramite SPID.</p>



 Directa, inaugura il servizio di apertura conto trading con SPID 



<p>Directa è il primo operatore del mondo finanziario a proporre questa possibilità per rendere più agile l’apertura del nuovo conto&nbsp;senza la necessità di sessioni di video-riconoscimento ulteriori a quella eventualmente sostenuta per attivare SPID.</p>



<p>Grazie a InfoCert e SPID, Directa ha reso possibile aprire un nuovo conto in soli 5 minuti, digitalizzando completamente il processo. La procedura diventa non solo più rapida, ma anche più intuitiva e completabile in&nbsp;totale assenza di operatori, anche di notte e nei weekend.</p>



 Come integrare SPID con InfoCert per identificare i tuoi clienti?

<p>The security firm Leviathan has now finished their initial audit of the security of Urbit's Ames network protocol. In addition to their review of Ames, we also asked them to identify any other issues in order to help guide further development.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to report they confirmed the cryptographic soundness of the protocol, namely that "a ship must have possession of their own valid Urbit key in order to authenticate as that ship and to send valid Ames messages. Additionally, no other ship except the two communicating may be able to decrypt or modify messages during transport."</p>
<p>This means Ames uses cryptography in a mathematically sound manner that protects your privacy, keeps your secrets secret, and ensures nobody else will be able to impersonate you on the network.  Since this was an architectural audit, it’s possible there are still vulnerabilities in the runtime implementation.  Until the runtime has been hardened, Tlon continues to recommend against storing valuables in your ship.</p>
<p>Aside from a couple of minor issues that have already been resolved, there are three general classes of problem highlighted in their report that future work will need to address:</p>
 
 Forward secrecy 
 Protection against denial of service attacks 
 Enforcement of social boundaries 
 
<p>Ames’ design allows for versioning of the protocol, which means that the proposed changes below can be deployed as over-the-air updates as they become more pressing concerns. This feature gives us confidence that we can address future security issues as they arise.</p>
<p>We will need to improve all of these over the next couple of years, as independent lines of work.  As the network grows: better forward secrecy will decrease the damage from a key getting compromised; resistance against denial of service attacks will make the Urbit network resilient to increasingly determined saboteurs; and stricter enforcement of social boundaries will let Urbit’s social networks remain safe and friendly despite potentially increasingly large numbers of bad actors and increasingly complex app ecosystems.</p>
 Forward Secrecy 
<p>A protocol is said to have forward secrecy if compromising a key used in a recent message doesn’t also compromise all previous messages.  Similarly, a protocol is said to have backward secrecy -- also called future secrecy -- if compromising a key used in a previous message fails to compromise all future messages.  Ames has some degree of both, but more would be better, to decrease the damage an attacker could inflict by compromising a key.</p>
<p>As it stands, an Urbit user can change their Ames keys whenever they want, by conducting an Ethereum transaction to update the Ames public key listed in the Azimuth contract, which implements Urbit’s PKI on Ethereum.  Compromise of one Ames private key does not compromise earlier or later keys, so this has both forward and backward secrecy.  The main drawback is that Ethereum transactions can be expensive, so key rotation is likely to be infrequent, and an attacker might be able to gain access to a long stretch of time by compromising a single key.</p>
<p>Various key rotation “ratchet” schemes could be added to Ames to establish varying degrees of forward and backward secrecy, and other kinds of cryptographic protections beyond basic soundness, such as break-in recovery.</p>
<p>Right now, changing a key through Azimuth is a manual process.  It could be automated, possibly as one of a suite of services that an Urbit Provider will offer.  Unfortunately,  each key rotation costs the user money, so automating rotation could get prohibitively expensive. 
Existing protocols, such as the Signal app's encrypted messaging protocol, the Noise protocol framework, and the Wireguard VPN protocol, use ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange and KDF chaining to achieve forward and backward secrecy and self-healing.</p>
<p>Ames could be upgraded to use one of these existing ratchet algorithms, or we might create an Urbit-specific variant optimized for the Urbit network.  This is work that should be done, but fortunately it will not require any novel research or drastic changes to Ames’s architecture.</p>
<p>While Urbit’s cryptographic protections don’t yet match those of Signal or a few other privacy-focused apps, Ames is cryptographically sound, and since Urbit updates itself over-the-air and is backed by a stable, decentralized PKI, I’m confident that the level of sophistication of Urbit’s cryptography has the potential to be world-class with just a bit more work.</p>
 Denial of Service 
<p>A denial of service (DoS) attack against an Urbit ship is an attempt to overwhelm it remotely by sending it network data in such a way as to interfere with the ship’s ability to communicate with other ships or process other events -- usually by hogging its resources (computational power, memory, or bandwidth) until normal operation slows down or ceases entirely.  Since the promise of Urbit is that everyone can run their own server, that server needs to be able to defend itself against DoS attacks.  This is in fact one of the main impediments to running your own server in the modern world.</p>
<p>Right now, Urbit has no protection.  Soon, it will need to at least be able to resist a simple attack carried out by an individual.  Eventually, it should be able to resist a determined Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) attack, which is more difficult.</p>
<p>There are two categories of DoS attacks in Urbit: authenticated and unauthenticated.  An authenticated attack requires access to a ship's private key to construct valid Ames packets intended to overwhelm a target.  All authenticated attacks will be handled primarily through enforcement of social boundaries, as discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>An unauthenticated DoS attack constructs packets that eventually fail to authenticate and decrypt but still overwhelm the target by causing it to waste resources (CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth) in such a way that it can't keep up with legitimate communications.</p>
<p>An unauthenticated DoS attack relies on the lack of Sybil resistance of IP networks: it's possible to generate new IP addresses rapidly, and a determined attacker might also be able to spoof its sender IP address.  This is best considered an IP-layer attack that must be handled mostly at the IP layer itself, by maintaining state about which IP addresses can be trusted and which can't, determined empirically and heuristically by the Urbit runtime.  The best any higher-level protocol, such as Ames or TCP, can do is make it as cheap as possible for a DoS target to reject a bad packet.</p>
<p>The overall strategy that Ames can take, as a protocol layering over the IP protocol, is to add an authentication procedure to each packet that can quickly identify bad packets, which an implementation will then use to mark that IP address as suspect and to refrain from adding the sender IP to a list of known-good IPs.</p>
<p>Currently, Ames handles this by attempting to decrypt a message and rejecting the message on failure. This may be a more costly solution than other methods, such as attaching a signature or a MAC to each message.  The way to mitigate unauthenticated attacks is to make bad packets fail faster by augmenting each packet with a signature or MAC to each packet, since those are faster to validate than encryption.</p>
<p>So far, we have identified three approaches that could be taken here.  Of these three, Leviathan recommended the end-to-end HMAC solution, since that would not impose additional CPU requirements on packet-relay nodes, such as stars. </p>
 
 Sign each packet, and any relay or final recipient could validate the signature 
 Wrap each packet in an HMAC, validated by the final receiver 
 Wrap each packet in a HMAC for each hop in a relay chain; each relay would validate and strip the previous HMAC and add a new one for the next hop 
 
<p>Any of these solutions would be attempts to increase the rate at which the network could discard invalid packets, with different tradeoffs.  I'll back up a bit to provide some context, and then I'll compare the approaches. </p>
<p>In any DoS solution, a planet will want to block or throttle IPs that have been sending it packets that fail to authenticate and decrypt.  Ideally, a star will help protect planets for whom it’s relaying, too. Many different arrangements among galaxy,  star, and planet are imaginable here, from an open policy to a policy wherein each packet has to come from a known-good IP. This sort of paranoid, closed-off arrangement might still not be enough to withstand a determined DDoS, but it's difficult for me to imagine doing better than that without launching Urbit-specific ISPs. Ames packets are cryptographically authenticated, so an Urbit ISP would actually be feasible.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the three possible ways of mitigating DoS from within the Ames protocol.   They all involve adding a piece of authenticating information to each packet that can be verified more quickly than waiting for the cyphertext to fail to decrypt — Ames's symmetric encryption is authenticated, so it's not a cryptographic soundness issue, but the performance impact of trying to decrypt could be significant enough to make it hard to prevent a DoS.</p>
<p>As-is, an Ames packet is basically <code>[protocol-version checksum sndr rcvr (nullable origin) cyphertext]</code> (visit <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4051#issue-530369627">this PR</a> for a full specification). Let’s walk through the construction of the packet and how it can be upgraded to offer different DOS mitigations.</p>
 DoS Mitigation Approach 1: Signature 
<p>The first approach to DoS protection would be to add a signature to the packet.  The signature would cover everything except the checksum and the origin, since those need to be swapped out by relays.  The signature would probably obviate the need for the (20-bit) checksum, although we could also leave it in there if we can't figure out what else to do with those header bits.</p>
 Advantages of a signature over other approaches 
 
 It can be validated by anyone on the network.  Relays would not need to modify it.  This might also give it symmetry with the upcoming remote scry protocol, which might also sign every packet.  I'm not quite sure this is an important property, actually, but it might theoretically make launching an Urbit ISP or internet backbone easier one day. 
 It would be signed directly by the key listed on Ethereum, not something that might get ratcheted at some point for better forward secrecy — this could eventually lower the rate at which intermediate validators need their key caches invalidated, although this is a bit of a theoretical concern. 
 
 Disadvantages of a signature over other approaches 
 
 Generating and validating a signature is significantly slower than generating and validating an HMAC. 
 An ECDSA signature is 64 bytes, which is ~6% of a packet payload.  As far as I can tell, it can't be compressed. 
 Since the signature could be validated by anyone, it doesn't attest to a specific communication channel, so it might not help as much with IP filtering. 
 
 DoS Mitigation Approach 2: End-to-End HMAC 
<p>The second approach would be to use an HMAC instead of a signature, validated by the eventual receiver.  This HMAC would also cover everything except the mug and origin.  I'm calling this the "end-to-end HMAC" design.  An HMAC requires a shared secret, for which we could use the same symmetric key that Ames uses.</p>
 Advantages of end-to-end HMAC 
 
 It's simple in some sense; relays don't need to do anything cryptographic. 
 HMACs are much faster to create and validate than signatures. 
 HMACs, since they're hashes, can be truncated arbitrarily and still maintain some security — to find hash collisions, you'd still have to guess what packet||shared-secret would hash to; it would just be a smaller search space.  Since Ames's encryption already guarantees authentication and we'd just be using this as a performance optimization, I suspect we could get away with using one that's significantly smaller than a signature — I'm not sure how small, but if 4 bytes would be enough in practice, that would take up less than 0.5% of the space in a packet. 
 
 Disadvantages of end-to-end HMAC 
 
 Only the recipient can validate.  This means the authentication couldn't be used by relays to discard invalid packets.  The recipient could provide back-pressure out-of-band to a relay to ask the relay to discard packets from an IP with an invalid HMAC, but this is indirect and might need to filter backward through multiple relays to work properly. 
 
 DoS Mitigation Approach 3: Point-to-Point HMAC 
<p>The third approach, which is what I would build unless convinced otherwise, is what I'm calling "point-to-point HMAC".  This design would include a different HMAC for each hop in a relay chain, instead of (or maybe in addition to) including one end-to-end HMAC.</p>
<p>We have a couple different options for how to construct the shared secret for each hop.  I would intuitively construct it using a Diffie-Hellman of my private signing key and your public signing key — the "networking keys" on Ethereum include a currently unused signing key in addition to the encryption key that Ames uses.  This way even if we add more forward secrecy to Ames, changing the symmetric key used for encryption, relays wouldn't have to have their caches invalidated as often; the state required to perform relaying wouldn't be as tied to the state required to receive a message.</p>
 Advantages of point-to-point HMAC 
 
 A star could perform some validation on every packet it's asked to relay.  This makes it more difficult for an attacker to route a ton of packets to a planet through a star, or even through many relays.  Signatures also have this property, but they're slower to verify.  This approach and the signature approach, but not the end-to-end HMACs, force an attacker to use an (at least partially) authenticated attack in order to use a relay as a way to get to a planet. 
 A planet could quickly validate that a relayed packet actually came from its star, not an attacker who's managed to spoof the star's IP address. 
 
 Disadvantages of point-to-point HMAC 
 
 Not everyone on the network can validate a packet, unlike a signature. 
 Each relay needs to validate and strip off the previous HMAC and create a new one before sending it.  This should be quite fast, since an HMAC is just a hash, but it's still some CPU, and potentially creates an imbalance where an attacker could induce the relay to spend more CPU in validation than the attacker spent in constructing the packets. 
 By itself, it doesn't validate the cyphertext in an end-to-end way.  I suspect we might want to include both a per-route HMAC and an end-to-end one, especially if we use truncated HMACs — although per-route might be enough on its own, since if the receiver fails to validate a bunch of packets whose HMACs were validated by the relay, the receiver can ask the relay to block that whole Urbit address regardless of IP, so it shouldn't be possible to sustain that kind of attack for long. 
 
 An Aside About Cryptographic Performance 
<p>I'm not sure exactly how much faster HMAC is.  According to DJB (https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110705.pdf), an ECDSA signature can be created in around 30 microseconds and verified in around 100 microseconds.  This source (https://www.jacksondunstan.com/articles/3206) suggests about 21 microseconds for HMAC-SHA256, so about a 1.5x improvement in generation speed and 5x in validation speed.  We should verify these numbers for ourselves before making a decision.</p>
 DoS Protection Strategy and Timeline 
<p>Tlon is not currently pursuing adding any of the extra cryptographic authentication on Ames packets described above.  Since this is ultimately a performance issue, there are other more pressing performance issues that we could improve upon before decryption will become the limiting factor in how many packets can be processed by a ship.  We will revisit this authentication performance question once some of the low-hanging fruit has been done, perhaps roughly a year from now.</p>
<p>Since the audit, we’ve already improved the Ames packet format to allow faster parsing, faster validation of basic fields, and faster relaying; in the future, increases in performance of Nock execution and inter-process communication between Urbit's I/O process and Nock worker would allow Urbit to absorb somewhat more punishment before service can be effectively denied.</p>
 Enforcement of Social Boundaries 
<p>While Urbit needs to rely largely on its runtime to mitigate unauthenticated attacks, any attack conducted from an Urbit ship needs to be handled inside Arvo itself, not just by IP filtering in the runtime.  Just like in any DoS, an attacker ship might try to induce you to use too much memory, CPU, or disk space in order to sabotage normal operation.  An authenticated attack is harder to define than an unauthenticated attack, because it depends on what social relationship the attacker and target have, and it involves valid, authenticated Ames packets; once discovered, though, it’s easier to mitigate, because it can use Urbit’s permanent identity system to enforce social consequences, i.e. stop listening to that Urbit address and possibly encourage others to do so as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different kinds of authenticated attack: attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the Nock worker (the interpreter, allocator, and jets) by causing particular Nock code to run, and attempts to induce the target to exhaust various computational resources.</p>
<p>Protecting against attempts to break out of the sandbox and hijack or otherwise interfere with the Unix process running Nock will require a process of hardening, fuzzing, and likely further security audits specifically evaluating the security of that boundary.  This is largely out of scope of the Ames protocol itself, which was the subject of this audit.</p>
<p>This leaves us with the latter case: resource exhaustion attacks.  A peer could try to get my ship to use too much RAM, disk, CPU, or bandwidth by sending it valid Ames packets.  This represents a social problem: a person on the network is trying to interfere with me.  It's what's known in blockchain circles as an "attributable fault": once the attack is detected, it's trivial to determine the identity of the culprit.</p>
<p>Once the attacker’s Urbit address is known,  Urbit will fall back on the Sybil resistance of its identity system: there are a finite number of identities, each of which costs some money.  Because Urbit identities are relatively permanent, they can be blocked permanently.  As long as the expected value of an authenticated attack is less than the cost of the identity, the attacks won't happen very much — they'll cost money to sustain, instead of being self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>Attacks like this are best thought of as attempts to violate social boundaries.  I don't want you using up too many of my resources; that's a social boundary, and an attempt to force my ship to spend its resources on your behalf constitutes a violation of this boundary.  The strategy for mitigating these attacks is to impose social and, indirectly, economic consequences on the perpetrators.  The main social consequence is other ships refusing to communicate with you anymore.</p>
<p>Some of this mitigation will take place in the Arvo kernel, and some will need to be application-specific.  To protect the system from attackers, the kernel needs to be able  to free space (Urbit is a single-level store, so there's no distinction between disk and RAM from Arvo's perspective) taken up by unfinished messages sent by peers.  This can be done by allowing an application to ask Ames to delete partially received messages from a peer, generally replacing the received packets with an intent to nack (negative acknowledgment) to indicate that the transaction the peer wanted me to perform has been rejected.</p>
<p>Applications should also be able to set resource usage policies that the Arvo kernel will enforce.  For example, a chat application should configure Ames to reject any chat messages larger than, say, two hundred kilobytes.  A file-sharing application would need a much larger per-message limit (ideally no per-message limit), but it might need to place a cap on its bandwidth usage to make sure lower-latency communications aren't swamped by a large file transfer.  This kernel/application interface starts to resemble a permissioning or capabilities system, and it could be built as part of the crucial larger project of providing for configurable application permissions.</p>
<p>To close the loop on enforcing social boundaries, reputation information should be shared across ships.  This will likely be done by building one or more applications that share statistics and block operations.  Some forms of reputation are likely to be globally shared, whereas others are likely to be multipolar, i.e. some people like you and some don’t.  Generally, the lower the layer of the attack, the more global the reputation effect will be; the higher the layer, the more multipolar.  An attempt to spam the network with millions of malicious packets will cause most people not to want to talk to you; sending me a movie I found mediocre is probably not even information worth sharing with anyone else.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Ames’ design has unparalleled potential to deter, mitigate, and recover from attacks, since every packet is authenticated and encrypted and backed by a stable, decentralized PKI.  It feels good to have our design for encryption and authentication be confirmed by a third party as cryptographically sound, and we know more or less what we need to build to reach the full security potential of the platform, including the steps outlined here.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on nearly every industry, and education has been no exception. While we recently explored the impact of Covid-19 on remote education in a recent whitepaper,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/reports/learning-through-disruption-au10tix/">Learning Through Disruption: Digital Identity in Education</a>, we wanted to take a more in-depth look at how this shift has raised issues concerning the integrity of online testing and exams. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous testing conditions consisted of tens to hundreds of students sitting in one room at a time. With the pandemic, this is no longer a safe or viable option. Instead, institutions have begun partnering with companies that offer online proctoring software. These softwares implement tools such as webcams and microphones, facial recognition, and screen record to verify the test-taker’s identity. How can schools, colleges, and standardized testing boards verify that the test-takers sitting on the other side of the screen are who they say they are? How can test-takers prove their identities while maintaining privacy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Current State Analysis: Tech Stack Breakdown 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions address two main issues: verifying the test-taker’s identity and preventing cheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifying the Test-Taker’s Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that test-takers are who they say they are, these softwares&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">require a scan of the individual’s ID</a> before the exam and use facial-recognition technology to match the face to the ID photo. Random scans are performed throughout the exam to ensure that the test-taker does not switch places with another person. Companies will also verify identity through a typing test. The test-taker is asked to type 140 words at the beginning of the semester and then perform the typing test before any exam. The speed and rhythms of the keystrokes are used to verify their identity, and any discrepancies are flagged for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">further inspection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-Cheating Software Leveraging Behavioral Biometrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online proctoring services such as Proctorio and ProctorU implement a variety of security features to prevent cheating. They hire live proctors to watch test-takers’ faces and listen to them talk, and proctors can demand test-takers aim their cameras around the room to prove their honesty. ProctorU requires test-takers to show their ID cards, their rooms, and the surface of their desk before beginning the exam. During the exam, the proctor takes precautions to mitigate cheating, such as listening through the microphone, accessing the test-taker’s screen, and using the webcam to allow the video system to view the test-taker’s eye movements. If the system or proctor suspects cheating, the instance is flagged as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">a suspicious event</a>&nbsp;for further review or alerted to a specialist known as an “interventionist,” who can take action and enforce an academic penalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The COVID-19 Shift and Concerns 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These softwares are not offering dramatically new technology, and before the pandemic, they were used in online-only classes. But in 2020, they have seen a boom in business as grade schools and standardized testing organizations pivot to maintain operations. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/11/online-proctoring-surging-during-covid-19">Educause poll</a>&nbsp;conducted in April of 2020, 54 percent of institutions had already begun using online or remote proctoring services. Another 23 percent were considering or planning to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>As adoption skyrockets, data privacy now becomes a pressing concern. Students not previously familiar with such technology are experiencing a culture shock and raising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecampusnews.com/2020/09/04/online-proctoring-keeps-remote-exams-secure-but-raises-privacy-questions/?all">questions regarding privacy rights</a>. Also, now that grade schools have moved online, more minors are using exam proctoring software, raising concerns about how their privacy rights should be protected.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond privacy concerns, comfort with the technology is another issue. Many test-takers have pointed out the “creepiness” and general “inhumanness” of being watched through a camera while taking a test, leading to increased anxiety and, therefore, lower performance. In fact, with ProctorU’s software, test-takers used to see the proctor watching them on their screen. Due to reported negative experiences, ProctorU&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">disabled that function</a>&nbsp;to increase the feeling of privacy, even though the proctor is still watching.&nbsp;Privacy is a crucial factor affecting comfort. If users are ensured that their recordings, face, and photos are securely protected, they will become more comfortable with the software, and subsequently, user adoption and success will increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Solution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clear solution is the implementation of a student digital identity. If schools issued their students a digital identity, it could be used to verify the student’s identity before they take an online exam. The idea of a digital student ID isn’t new; in 2018, edtech company Blackboard Inc.&nbsp;<a href="https://press.blackboard.com/2018-10-02-Blackboard-Announces-Support-for-Student-ID-Cards-on-iPhone-and-Apple-Watch">announced</a>&nbsp;Blackboard Mobile Credential support for Student ID cards in Apple Wallet, allowing students to use their phone as a mobile ID, becoming the first campus credential solution provider to offer NFC-enabled contactless mobile IDs for iPhone and Apple Watch. Over the past two years,&nbsp;<a href="https://dukecard.duke.edu/mobile-dukecard">Duke University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://actcard.ua.edu/actioncardinapplewallet-gettingstarted/">University of Alabama</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ou.edu/soonercard/mobile">University of Oklahoma</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scu.edu/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/february-2020/santa-clara-university-offers-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-.html?#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif.%2C%20Feb,from%20the%20library%20and%20more.">Santa Clara University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2019-01-28/mobile-owlcard">Temple University</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/03/28/apple-wallet-homewood-campus-ids/">Johns Hopkins University</a> have given students the ability to use this solution.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier in 2020, campus card solutions provider Transact rolled out support for Android NFC student IDs, integrated with Google Pay, to <a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2020/05/19/366583/transact-rolls-out-android-nfc-student-ids-at-16-us-universities/">16 US universities</a>. This kind of student mobile identity also provides an extra level of security as it requires two-factor authentication on the device, keeping its credentials and information secure.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>OWI recommends taking the mobile student ID a step further. Not only could it provide the same uses as a physical ID, such as offering access to dorms and checking out library books, but it could also be expanded into other sectors such as student healthcare. Post-graduation, it could be updated to reflect alumni status and allow the option to offer alumni benefits. Employers can use this digital ID to quickly verify an applicant’s education credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of November 2020, Mastercard, Australia Post, and Deakin University are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.securitydocumentworld.com/article-details/i/16600/">moving toward</a>&nbsp;this solution. Students can create a digital identity in Australia Post’s Digital iD app and use it to gain access to Deakin University’s exam portal. Integrated into both organization’s platforms, Mastercard’s digital identity service “ID” successfully orchestrated the sharing of verified identity data between the two parties – sending only the specific personal information required to permit entry using its highly secure network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, OWI believes that there is an opportunity to expand the mobile student ID’s functionality into verifying test-taker identity. Players in this space, whether new or established, must keep data privacy concerns at the forefront of their solutions. Ultimately, a digital student identity could address the issues of test-taker identity, and its uses could be expanded into a variety of sectors and span a lifetime.</p>

<p>This post was authored by Alexis Falquier, who helps lead the self-sovereign identity (SSI) initiative at GlobaliD.</p><p>Back in October, team GlobaliD attended the 31st biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), the premier conference dedicated to building collaborative environments that foster the development of open standards around all things digital identity. According to legend, it’s the birthplace of&nbsp;SSI</p><p>On top of leading two sessions, we also unveiled our Dynamic Governance API. And as part of GlobaliD’s ongoing commitment toward open SSI standards, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">we open sourced our iOS and Android native Hyperledger Aries frameworks</a>.</p><p>With the year coming to a close, we wanted to look back at the conference and highlight some of the fascinating topics we came across and what we&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Disclaimer: This piece is a bit jargon heavy given the nature of the space. I’ve made my best attempt at making it as approachable as possible, but if you’re looking for a crash course on the basics of SSI, distributed identifiers (DID’s) and Verifiable Credentials, here’s some recommended reading:</p>  <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">What is self-sovereign identity?</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">Multi-Source and Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;Systems</a>  <p>OK, without further adieu, here are some highlights from&nbsp;IIW:</p> Now KERI is my best&nbsp;friend <p>One of the hottest topics at IIW 31 — in part because of how much it offers — was our new friend KERI, which stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It’s no trivial subject, to the point that Drummond Reed and Sam Smith (the creator of KERI) held three separate sessions dedicated to describing it at different levels — KERI for Muggles, KERI for mudbloods, and KERI for Wizards. I can tell you that even KERI for Muggles very much felt like a “Wizards” session but I will do my best to share what KERI is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>In its most fundamental sense, KERI is a Public Key Infrastructure or PKI. One of the foundational pieces of SSI is public/private key cryptography and its relationship with a decentralized identifier or DID. In other words, public key encryption makes SSI go round. KERI, then, is a new and fully decentralized PKI. You can see why all of this might be such a big&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Some of real-world benefits of KERI — and why it was incidentally the belle of the ball — as explained by Timothy Ruff, Sam Smith, and Drummond Reed during <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpzYcPrIox9V4hERtn4Kcf7uq01OVU9u3PuVm1aYzR0/edit#slide=id.ga411be7e84_0_116">their muggle-friendly and all around more approachable KERI session at&nbsp;IIW</a>:</p><p>Independent and&nbsp;Portable</p><p>Distributed ledgers underpin many SSI solutions, but KERI is a highly portable public key infrastructure that does not necessitate their use. It is self sustained, and therefore every organization/individual is its own root of trust. It is not locked into one governance framework, network or ledger. It is truly decentralized.</p><p>Secure</p><p>KERI relies solely on cryptography as the means to prove the root of trust. What this means is that you can rotate the key without changing the identifier. You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store these, and — in the case that your current private key is compromised — you can use the pre-rotated keys to restore your identifier. To throw some more jargon at you, this pre rotation turns out is actually a post-quantum proof (secure against attacks with quantum computers) method of key security. In other words, it is future&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Delegatable</p><p>You can easily create keys and delegate them as needed. This creates the potential for any number of hierarchical architectures.</p><p>Scalable</p><p>Since KERI is self reliant it is extremely scalable, only limited by its hardware. Given its cryptographic nature, existing key management solutions can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>Private</p><p>The key logs are controlled by the organization/individual themselves. In some SSI solutions that rely on immutable ledgers privacy can become problematic in terms of GDPR, and the right to be forgotten. Since KERI is not reliant on ledgers this can be avoided all together.</p><p>Standard Adherent</p><p>Like many SSI solutions, KERI uses existing cryptography in new ways including W3C standards, DID’s and SSI Wallets. KERI follows open source standards and is fully auditable.</p><p>Sound good so far? If you’ve made it this far, here’s how KERI actually works at a very high&nbsp;level:</p>  KERI uses self certifying identifiers (SCID’s), which means that a specific identifier can prove to be the one and only identifier using cryptography alone. This is the pivotal piece of&nbsp;KERI.  KERI uses key event logs (also self certifying) which carry the history of the keys, such that if you ever need to rotate your key you can do so, sign it, log it, and prove that you control this new key via the event&nbsp;logs.  KERI uses “witnesses” that keep and sign a copy of your logs for added ‘evidence’ of your key ownership.  You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store the keys, log the pre-rotation, and when this key is needed you will be able to prove the key is yours and keep your identifier safe.  KERI is not attached to any one system, any system that can process data will be able to validate your identifier.  KERI allows for the creation of multiple identifiers that can be delegated, allowing for any complex hierarchy of identifiers and&nbsp;keys.  <p>If you feel like you still do not really get it, don’t worry, most of us didn’t either. One thing that isn’t hard to get is why KERI made such a big splash at the conference. These are still early days but the possibilities for KERI are vast and disruptive — it’s certainly one to keep an eye&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you’re feeling brave and are interested in learning more about the nitty gritty of KERI, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">here’s the 140-page white&nbsp;paper</a>.</p> Chained Credentials <p>Another compelling topic at IIW was chained credentials — the concept of linking two or more verifiable credentials with one another. The discussion focused less on the how but rather on the&nbsp;why.</p><p>At its most basic function, linking credentials makes sense in the same way that databases have relationships that link data from one table to another. You might have two credentials that work just fine on their own for a specific purpose, but attributing them together can provide broader significance.</p><p>A basic example of this would be having a credential of citizenship and a credential of residence — the link of which allows you to vote in local elections. Really, anytime you have a history of transactions such as supply chain, registries, etc., verifiable credentials add value. So rather than present use cases, I will focus on a few primary benefits.</p><p>Reputation</p><p>For Kiva’s Nathan George, their work with refugees led them toward the path of chained credentials. Since refugees often lack traditional forms of documentation and credentials, the concept of chained credentials opens up the possibility of building their reputation by allowing them to receive credentials that attest to their skills — whether by linking one with the next or by adding endorsements.</p><p>Proof of&nbsp;Linkage</p><p>Linked credentials would allow for proof of a larger scope of information without disclosure. If part of my verifiable credential is how it is linked to another, then I could disclose to a verifier the proof of linkage without disclosing the credential itself, thus demonstrating the reputability of my credential without actually disclosing it. If this proof of linkage also shows where the credential was linked from, I am able to show the provenance of truth. In other words, the source of the link can add to the validity of my credential.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials</p><p>Chained credentials are a core building block of delegatable credentials. In simple terms, a delegatable credential is one that proves the permission of an action by means of proving a link to the original credential that allows for that action. For example, if I lend my friend my car, I will delegate my car’s credential to them, in the case that they need to prove that they are allowed to drive it (or in the future, be able to start and drive it, period). For delegatable credentials to work, revocation is also needed — a topic for another day. The point being, linked credentials are a key part of the delegation process.</p><p>All in all, there are use cases abound — one reason why I’m so excited to see where people take the&nbsp;concept.</p> Guardianship (AKA Custodial Agents) <p>The topic of guardianship made an appearance in multiple sessions. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus on the one held by Ken Ebert and Sam&nbsp;Curren.</p><p>At first glance, you might think that this is about the legal role of guardianship when it comes to a person’s online identity, i.e. a parent being a guardian for a child’s digital presence until they turn 18. While that is an ever present topic at IIW and one that is always interesting to be part of, this discussion focused on guardianship in a technical sense.</p><p>This potential for confusion came up during the discussion and we ended up changing the phrase to custodial agents for semantic&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>A custodial agent is an agent that resides on a cloud infrastructure rather than on someone’s personal device. Therefore, their identity and wallet is being maintained by someone else. This is worth considering because in reality, there are people who cannot have an end agent, generally for the purposes of convenience and access. That might mean a web wallet interface for easy integration and adoption or simply because not everyone has a smartphone.</p><p>Since the agent is not on a personal device, this means that the keys are being managed by whoever manages the cloud infrastructure. Naturally, this adds a degree of centralization. (Someone on the discussion made the joke that here, SSI stands for Somewhat Sovereign Identity.) That’s true — to an extent. On the other hand, it’s important to solve for cases where the ideal scenario might not exist in the name of inclusivity.</p><p>The thing is, even though cloud hosted wallets inherently takes away some portability, we should focus on the potential benefits cloud-hosted wallets provide users over not having an SSI wallet at all. End users (for the most part) do not care what is happening in the background. They simply care how it affects their experience.</p><p>So while not not all the benefits of SSI come with cloud hosting, there’s enough upside that it would still make a significant impact.</p><p>This also puts the onus on cloud-hosted providers to maintain sovereignty of their users’ identity to the largest extent possible. Given that they inherently hold some fiduciary responsibility, we discussed ways in which cloud-hosted against could be architected that optimized for user sovereignty.</p><p>One of the first ideas brought up was the imposition of restrictions on what agents can do. Cloud-hosted providers should focus on and adhere to specific use cases. Furthermore — as to allow a user to move to a truly self-sovereign solution — the agent and the wallet should be de-coupled such that the user always has the option to retrieve their wallet and transfer it to an end agent. GlobaliD’s Dev Bharel also brought up the concept of “trusted execution environments” as a means to host an agent and wallet without requiring the ability to see any information transaction — including keys.</p><p>There’s still plenty of considerations to consider in the context of custodial agents, but many organizations along with GlobaliD are actively exploring options that promote inclusivity in the&nbsp;space.</p> Signing out <p>These are but a few of the notable highlights, but if you’re interested in reading more about any of these or any other session at this past IIW, the book of proceedings (which contains notes on each session) can be <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It’s truly difficult to put into words the level of knowledge and ideas shared at each and every IIW, a conference that breeds innovation every time you attend. For us it’s a privilege and an opportunity to see how the world of online identity is evolving. So here’s to the next IIW, where we will eagerly see what is discussed and find what’s already been implemented — while also sharing some of our own progress along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Also, stay tuned for another follow up piece on the GlobaliD approach to Governance Frameworks.</p><p>The digital identity revolution is well underway, and here at GlobaliD, we’re proud to be apart of&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/what-we-learned-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-aebda1f49f3a">What we learned at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/b3e0625479e">Mario Cardoso</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/e52c6099919c">Andre&nbsp;Rabello</a>.</blockquote><p>The Operations Tools team in <a href="https://medium.com/u/2714cdc6872a">Onfido</a> handles a lot of repositories. Being “the glue” for manual check processing, the domain is large and vast. Front-end projects were written in JavaScript and while there was some Flow types, they weren’t first-class citizens and were usually either old/unmaintained/wrong or simply&nbsp;missing.</p><p>Exactly because we have to context switch so much between different repos, strict types help immensely with code discovery and safety. When the interface between two unrelated files is typed and you only need to change a single one, you no longer need to read the other. As long as you don’t change the interface and type checking passes, you can be sure your code won’t&nbsp;break.</p><p>Thus began our journey to refactor our biggest and most frequently changed app, Ops Manager, a React front-end with a Node GraphQL server, into TypeScript.</p> The journey <p>To be fair, we had been writing new features in TypeScript for about a year, and sometimes refactoring a file or two. We were confident that a migration would be straightforward.</p> TS setup <p>Ideally you want an editor that integrates well with TypeScript so that you see red squiggly lines below errors and don’t have to watch the terminal, which makes fixing issues that much faster and&nbsp;easier.</p><p>We recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS&nbsp;Code</a>.</p><p>Additionally, you should use a tsconfig to tell the compiler what to do in you project, specifically. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html">official docs</a> and the example&nbsp;below.</p><p>Depending on the bundler you use you will also need to setup TypeScript support. If you use <a href="https://parceljs.org/typeScript.html">Parcel</a> it works out of the box. If you use Webpack, like we still do, you can follow <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/">their&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Essentially all we did was remove babel completely, install the appropriate loader and add this single line to module.rules:</p><p>{ test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }</p> Start converting <p>First step, pick a file and replace its extension with&nbsp;.ts. You will immediately notice a bunch of tslint errors about missing types. Now the goal is to get rid of all the&nbsp;errors.</p> Imports <p>Let’s start with the beginning of the file that usually contains imports. We can split them in three different groups:</p>  imports from third party libraries;  imports from other project&nbsp;files;  type imports (in case you were using non-TS types, like&nbsp;Flow).   Import from 3rd-party libraries <p>In case the library doesn’t provide TS types along with code, you should install them from @types if they exist. <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">It’s a community managed repo</a> that has types for most common libraries in npm. For example if you use lodash, you can install TS types with npm i -D @types/lodash or yarn add -D <a href="http://twitter.com/types/lodash">@types/lodash</a></p><p>If the package is not popular enough to have @types, you have 3&nbsp;options:</p>  contribute to the community by submitting a Pull&nbsp;Request;  create a local&nbsp;.d.ts file that defines the&nbsp;module;  just use tsignore until there is&nbsp;one.  <p>Option 3 provides the least benefits, you just disable type checking for that library which defeats the&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Option 2 is a nice temporary fix, for example: foo-library.d.ts</p> define 'foo-library' {<br>  function Foo(): string;<br>} <p>If you’re familiar with its API you can cover just the necessary cases for your code to function and be type checked&nbsp;:)</p> Import from project&nbsp;files <p>The simplest way is to use tsignore until it is converted to TS. Don’t forget to come back later and remove it once the imported file is converted. That way you can focus on one file at a time, but if some imported files are really easy and simple to convert you can also just go convert them first. That depends on complexity but generally we would have a more iterative/progressive approach and focus on a few files at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>Another option is to start inwards, from files that have no dependencies up the tree. That’s not always the best approach as you’ll change context/domain pretty frequently, but is definitely helpful for the “utils” kind of&nbsp;files.</p> Import types <p>In case your project is using Flow (we will not discuss whether you should or should not go from Flow to TS), you could find imports like import type FileName. In that scenario, just convert the Flow type to a TS compatible type and you can keep the import type&nbsp;. Depending on your build process and bundler, you should still use import type, it was introduced in TypeScript 3.8, you can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html">here</a>.</p> Auto-fixable issues <p>VS Code commonly suggests fixes for some tslint issues. Generally the suggestion is good enough and you can start with that, and later you can improve it. Examples of suggestions for types include “infer by usage”, where VS Code tries to infer the type of a variable based on how it is used. For example, it understands which arguments in a function are used inside it or which methods of an object are used (if you use a String.prototype method it suggests that the type of the argument should be string). You can usually accept the suggestion and if needed update it by giving it a name or adding missing types, and you could also extract it to its own type&nbsp;file.</p><p>Generally it works pretty well, just validate if it makes sense and improve it if you can. But that’s a great and helpful feature, specially when you are starting&nbsp;out.</p> From Flow to&nbsp;TS <p>That was our case, we were using Flow in most files. This definitely helped because we had already some knowledge about our types and the work was mostly about completing the missing types and converting to TS because the syntax is a bit different. Most types are pretty similar, like&nbsp;these:</p><p>Some are slightly different, like this function:</p> Different ways to&nbsp;type <p>In our case we were heavily influenced by the types written in Flow, but there are many ways to achieve the same goal. For example, the function above could be written in any of these 3&nbsp;ways:</p><p>There are also many TypeScript utility types that you can use, for example the Record&nbsp;type:</p><p>Your team might prefer a specific style, like inline types vs isolated files, but at the end of the day agree on some standards you all can abide by, and above all be consistent.</p> Any <p>You should almost never use any, it defeats the purpose of using TS. Always try defining the types, looking at how they are used and if you get stuck use tsignore until you figure it out. tsignore should be temporary and a reminder that you should come back later and fix it. That worked for us, we saw them as TODOs for later, and that helped us proceed and not get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>In situations where you definitely don’t know the type, you can use unknown. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type">here</a>.</p> As any (casting) <p>In actual code, don’t do it. For tests however, it is very useful. Instead of polluting mock objects and stubs with useless data (for that specific test case), you can cast it to any, essentially disabling type checking, to provide the minimum necessary interface for the test&nbsp;case.</p><p>In the example below the type requires fullName, but we know that if a name exists in the object we won’t need the rest. In this test case, we can ignore fullName and disable type checking because we are sure of the consequence (for testing). Just remember to cast it as late as possible so you still have type check in your actual test&nbsp;code.</p> GraphQL types vs TypeScript types <p>As mentioned before one of the projects we were working was built with GraphQL so this could also help you introduce TypeScript in the sense that you already have to define types for your Schema (queries, mutations, subscriptions). At the same time be aware that the syntax is not exactly the same and could sometimes cause some confusion. But if you keep most of your GraphQL code in separated files it’s easier not to mix things and better organise you&nbsp;code.</p><p>As you can see shared types are easier to achieve in TypeScript than in GraphQL. Also the philosophy of null in each language are opposites (default nullable vs default defined).</p><p>You can also use the amazing <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com">GraphQL Code Generator</a> to create types for you automatically! We don’t yet use it but plan to in the&nbsp;future.</p> What we&nbsp;learned   Some Flow types were incorrect and caused bugs after the migration to TypeScript, which shows the importance of keeping types up to date. I’d argue it’s better not to have types than to have wrong types. Mostly it was arrays and objects which could be null but weren’t typed as&nbsp;such;  Several bad data paths were discovered and potential future bugs prevented, like nullish objects, empty arrays, bad tuples, loading and error&nbsp;states;  Writing types for a whole repo is repetitive, boring work. It’s also the fastest and surest way to understand all of its interconnections and intricacies;  As you migrate, you discover better patterns and solutions and will probably want to come back to earlier&nbsp;files;  Don’t try to convert many files at once, go one by one and use tsignore when importing other JS files so you can focus on one file at a&nbsp;time;  TS and JS files can co-exist so you can migrate progressively from easiest to hardest file and not block other changes in the&nbsp;process;  The benefit of having types is not obvious at first, when you only have a few TS files, but it becomes easier and a better Developer Experience as more files are converted, which is nice to keep you motivated.  <p>Having the entire project in TypeScript has some clear benefits, like being much easier to onboard, maintain and change with some confidence it won’t break (thanks to type checking).</p><p>Migrating an old repo to TypeScript, especially if it has some other form of types that aren’t all that precise, is arduous and time intensive work. Make sure to properly weigh the benefits for your team and to plan it out in advance. We chose a big-bang refactor, which worked well for the GraphQL server but not as great for the React app, as it introduced some issues and blocked other features until the whole thing was resolved (merging conflicts later would be a nightmare). Doing one module at a time would have been a better approach in our&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you decide you want TS in your repos too, good luck migrating and enjoy your improved Developer Experience!&nbsp;:D</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@mariorcardoso">Mario Cardoso - Medium</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@andre.rabello">Andre Rabello - Medium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/migrating-600-files-to-typescript-580440141c35">Migrating ~600 files to TypeScript</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digitalization is an important topic in the insurance industry. However, according to a study by NTT Data, many insurers urgently need to catch up on their homework when it comes to digitalisation: the status and development of digitalization are measured and assessed by 12% of insurance companies (12%) according to clearly defined criteria. One in three companies (36%) does have various indicators in place that give an approximate picture of the state of digitalization. On the whole, however, the topic of ” digitalization ” is apparently still often diffuse, complex, and not very concrete. Around half (52%) lack a systematic measurement of the degree of digitalization.</p>
<p>API management as a key factor of digitalization.</p>
<p>New digital business models, changing user requirements, and the general shift towards fast and simple solutions are forcing new and established insurers alike to act. Many service providers have realized this business potential, and the market is flooded with API providers. Insurance companies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep an overview of external – but also internal – API-based services and their performance. Intelligent API management has thus become one of the central challenges of digitalization.</p>
<p>Syncier, a spin-off of Allianz in partnership with Microsoft, has recognized this problem: On the Syncier marketplace, digital services specifically relevant to the insurance industry are made available. These can then be integrated directly into insurers’ existing IT systems via API.</p>

 Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit Scoring Solutions <p>Litentry’s Integration Of Ontology’s Bespoke Products Aims To Increase Adoption By 10K&nbsp;Users</p><p>Singapore — 16 December 2020 — In a bid to further the shared goal of bringing about greater data privacy and transparency, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with <a href="https://www.litentry.com/">Litentry</a>, a blockchain identity management layer based on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>As part of the agreement, the two pioneers in decentralized identity and data management solutions will collaborate to integrate Ontology’s bespoke decentralized identity solution, DeID, and DDXF, Ontology’s decentralized data exchange and collaboration framework, into Litentry’s identity aggregation and computation system.</p><p>In line with this, Ontology will make its DeID solution, as well as its OScore, the company’s proprietary decentralized credit-rating system, available to Litentry for the integration with its DID aggregation technology to generate new use cases. Over time, the partnership will see Litentry build a cross-chain identity aggregator based on Polkadot, which includes a unique decentralized Web3.0 identity computation network and related tools. In joining forces, Ontology and Litentry are aiming to onboard 10,000 users to the DeID and OScore solutions, enriching aggregated Identities and targeting potential customers based in Europe, USA, Latin America and South East&nbsp;Asia.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, stated “The great synergy between Ontology and Litentry makes this partnership an obvious one. The need to bring about greater fairness, privacy and transparency when it comes to data is extremely important to both parties and our shared missions. Our team is excited to see this partnership come to fruition and to leverage our commonalities to accelerate the growth of both Ontology and Litentry. In particular, we are really happy to be furthering our relationship with the Polkadot ecosystem, having partnered with Patract Labs and Parity Technologies just last&nbsp;month.”</p><p>Fei Liu, CTO of Litentry said, “Ontology has made a great achievement in the development of decentralized identity solutions, and in particular decentralized credit scoring solutions — a timely solution in high demand given the industry’s current focus on DeFi. We are delighted to collaborate with Ontology to integrate these solutions and to work to increase user adoption of our products and services to create a fairer world when it comes to individuals and their&nbsp;data.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-litentry-accelerating-adoption-of-its-decentralized-identity-and-credit-95870de47ea3">Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   CEO Perspective 

<p>In 2020 we witnessed radical changes in how we live, work and play, requiring all of us to embrace “remote everything.” The world’s reliance on digital access has never been more profound, and watching how our customers stepped up to new challenges to keep their virtual doors open has been inspiring.</p>

<p>Some of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customer</a> stories I’ve heard this year stand out because of their massive scale and transformative effects. A luxury car maker was able to onboard 25 million new consumer and workforce applications in just seconds. A financial services customer was able to deploy the recent release of the ForgeRock platform in just 25% of the time that it took them to deploy earlier versions - and they did this using just half the number of resources previously required. And one of our major healthcare customers was able to identify 550,000 excess entitlements among 14.6 million assignments within three hours and reduce their cybersecurity risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enhancements we made to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> this year were incredible, and when combined with our commitment to customer success, it was truly a special year at ForgeRock. We hired nearly two hundred new ForgeRockers to the team, deepened relationships with our partners, onboarded exciting new customers like Calabrio and BTPN Bank, and grew existing relationships with Allianz, BMW, BBC, Verizon, Australian Securities Exchange and WW (Weight Watchers). And topping it off was industry recognition from three major industry analyst firms that named ForgeRock an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">identity and access management</a> leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Take a look at some of the highlights.&nbsp;</p>

 A Growing Presence in the Cloud&nbsp; 

<p>We made significant investments in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-expands-leadership-team-extend-success-cloud-and-identity">Cloud Success </a>operational model, keeping our customers top of mind as we rolled out new features. We took configurability to the next level to enable customers to deliver superior omnichannel experiences to their users and secure all of their workforce and consumer identities. We introduced a one-subscription model to provide complete deployment flexibility in data centers, private clouds or public cloud. And, our full tenant isolation ensures that all customer data is stored separately so you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe and secure.</p>

 Platform Upgrades&nbsp; 

<p>We introduced one of our biggest <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> updates in company history. The addition of AI-driven intelligence in ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> provides a deeper understanding of the risks associated with user access and reduces costs. We also introduced ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access"> </a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a>, which helps customers create seamless and secure experiences that adapt to your users’ needs in real time. This new release also added <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go,</a> making passwords and usernames a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>

 Expanding Our Partner Network&nbsp; 

<p>Our Trust Network continues to be one of our greatest assets as it has expanded to over 90 technology partners extending the value of the ForgeRock Identity Platform. Today nearly half of our new customers will leverage at least one <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> partner as part of their complete Identity Solution. Our partnership program gained momentum as we expanded relationships with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/aws">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-joins-microsoft-intelligent-security-association">Microsoft</a>. In April, we joined the Google Cloud co-sell program and our Google Cloud marketplace listing, which will enable us to further expand our sales pipeline, is coming soon. We continued to expand our partnership with AWS as an advanced technology partner, and joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) in September, providing an integration with Microsoft Cloud Security services to help reduce risk and strengthen compliance for our joint customers.</p>

 Corporate Updates 

<p>We’re excited to share that ForgeRock earned major recognition from top industry analysts this year. We’ve been named a leader in access management and customer identity and access management (CIAM) – by top <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">analyst </a>firms. These analysts have highlighted our ability to provide exceptional digital experiences while meeting our customers’ requirements for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy and compliance.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>ForgeRock also achieved an important milestone that put us one step closer to becoming one of the premier digital identity companies in the market. In April, we secured an additional $93.5 million in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/series-e-funding-marks-momentous-day-forgerock">Series E funding</a>&nbsp;led by Riverwood Capital, with our existing investors, Accel, Meritech Capital, Foundation Capital and KKR Growth also participating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to thank all of you – our customers, partners and employees – for your support and hard work this year. As we move into 2021, we will continue to stay focused on our purpose: to help people simply and safely access the connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish you a healthy, safe and joyful holiday season!</p>

  Digital technology is not intended to aggravate inequalities and must not become an obstacle to integration in today's society but, on the contrary, a valuable aid. Cozy Cloud has joined forces with the CEMÉA for digital inclusion.

 <p>Not having access to the Internet or <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4241397">not knowing how to use digital tools is a handicap for nearly 17% of the French population</a>, according to a study by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). This digital illiteracy particularly affects the most fragile populations and is closely linked to what is commonly known as the digital divide.</p>
<p>Although our uses, our administrative procedures and our relationships with others have never been as online as they are today, inequalities persist among the oldest people, those with fewer qualifications and those on modest incomes. However, digital technology is not intended to aggravate inequalities and must not become an obstacle to integration into today's society but, on the contrary, a valuable aid. A few months ago, <a href="http://www.cemea.asso.fr/">CEMÉA</a>, a group of associations and a major player in the popular education movement came knocking at the door of our cosy cloud to propose a project that has just been deployed...</p>
 Introduction 
<p>First of all, it is important to remind you that our mission at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/about/">Cozy Cloud</a> is to democratise the digital home with a simple tool for the technical reappropriation of its data.</p>
<p>Because we strongly believe that for a society to be democratic, individuals must control their personal data themselves, we have developed a personal data platform for a new approach to digital inclusion - a kind of new channel to create a real digital proximity with users, to empower them digitally.</p>
 Cozy and digital inclusion 
<p>By definition, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_num%C3%A9rique">digital inclusion</a> is a process that aims to make digital technology accessible to every individual and to provide them with the digital skills that will be a leverage for their social and economic inclusion.</p>
<p>This process includes the establishment of a set of policies and strategies that aim to lead to the creation of an "inclusive" information society, which can benefit everyone without excluding citizens from marginalised communities. These policies are developed taking into account the social and economic reality of individuals. They aim to put in place ways of overcoming digital exclusion in order to promote access for all. This can be done through access and education to tools, training and learning, etc., aiming at the autonomy of people in the use of new technologies. A nationwide plan has been deployed for <a href="https://www.cohesion-territoires.gouv.fr/inclusion-numerique-favoriser-lapprentissage-du-numerique-et-developper-les-usages">this purpose</a>.</p>
 La clé d'accès à mes droits" (The key to access my rights): Project by CEMEA in partnership with Cozy Cloud and with the support of Secours Populaire Français, Samu Social de Paris, AFNIC Foundation and Framasoft. 
<p>Today, access to rights requires a real mastery of the digital world (applying for benefits, updating CAF and RSA files, etc.). However, for many people, particularly the most vulnerable (young people who have dropped out of school, homeless people, asylum seekers, women victims of violence, etc.), this remains a complex task.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project "The key to access my rights" consists of enabling people in a situation of fragility in their relationships or access to digital technology to regain their autonomy and pursue their emancipation while preserving their personal data, in order to strengthen their access to their social rights.</p>
<p>It is inspired by the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framakey">Framasoft's Framakey project</a>, i.e. a USB key containing the embedded applications (without any personal data being stored on it) enabling everyone to find their personal space simplified whatever the machine used.</p>
<p>Access to the key is completely secure. The helper's data is synchronised with an online personal space. In addition, this also serves as a portal to access various services. This object also symbolises the reappropriation of data belonging to people on the road to digital autonomy.</p>
<p>This project has been designed as a whole:</p>
 
 political (reappropriating one's rights, etc.), 
 technical (simplicity and data protection), 
 deontological (to put the accompanying persons in the right place by holding personal data), 
 educational (support the training of users and support staff in the use of the key), 
 partner (by associating field actors and users in the construction of the tool and support). 
 
<p>In addition, this project aims at decomplexifying the ubuesque situations in the accompaniment of people by professionals and/or volunteers (passwords entrusted to third parties in public digital spaces, non-disconnected transfers on public computers, sometimes very personal attachments present in the "download" folder of these same computers, etc.).</p>
<p>Moreover, it is complex and even almost impossible for vulnerable and sometimes homeless people to keep all the documents that enable them to assert their rights, or even simply "souvenirs" or personal objects such as a simple photograph.</p>
<p>Our administrative procedures are increasingly dematerialised and this results in risks, in particular the non-use of rights. Many people are no longer in a position to carry out their own procedures. As a result, many end up delegating their procedures to a third party so that they can continue to access their services and rights. This assistance sometimes turns into a real situation of interference, which is partially suffered.</p>
<p>It is therefore with great pride that <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a>, as a simplified personal space, complements this project with the Secours Populaire Français, the Samu Social de Paris, the CEMEA and the Afnic Foundation (French Association for Cooperative Internet Naming).</p>
 Relevance of the Cozy digital home 
<p>Managing online services is complicated: you have to manage your identities and passwords to connect to services that have become essential (CAF, RSA, Pôle emploi, Social Security, etc.), often from a mobile phone, find the website address, navigate the site to find the right information or fill in the right form.</p>
<p>To carry out their administrative procedures, individuals are confronted with a multitude of services and sometimes complex technologies. The digital home developed by <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a> simplifies these procedures.</p>
<p>Mon-domicile-num-rique](/en/content/images/2020/11/Mon-domicile-num-rique.png)</p>
<p>Cozy brings together several services (storage applications, bank aggregator, password, contact and photo manager) and data, simplifying usage with simple and easy to use features: direct links to share a folder or document, password management with automatic filling or generation of strong passwords, automatic online data retrieval with a single click, alerts and help with budget tracking.</p>
<p>All this in a context that places the individual truly in a "home" - a digital home, which he can keep beyond the initial provision, which he can move to...</p>
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/"></a></p>
 From assistance to autonomy 
<p>Cozy thus becomes an immediately operational solution to simplify the digital daily life of these people in a precarious situation and enable the effectiveness of aid by guaranteeing :</p>
<p>✓Easy access to the rights of the person receiving aid<br>
✓Facility and secure actions of those accompanying them<br>
✓Back up of passwords / identities of the person being helped<br>
✓all the personal data are secure (supporting documents, photo, contacts, bank details, etc.)</p>
 A frictionless and uncomplicated grip for both parties 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy digital home then provides several services to the person being helped:</p>
 
 "My Accounts": direct access to their bank accounts, which allows them to monitor their cash inflows/outflows 
 "My Contacts" : directory of people to contact, in particular the carer and other people essential to the management of his administrative life. 
 "My Photos" : backup folder and organisation of your photos 
 "My Rights" : direct access to the website <a href="https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/">https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/</a> 
 "My Papers" : access to the backup of your identity papers and retrieve your pdf's, certificates and other documents automatically recovered without any action on your part thanks to connectors (for example Ameli and Impots.Gouv). 
 "My Notes": direct access to notes shared by the carer 
 "My Mails": direct access to your webmail (upcoming feature). 
 
 
 
<p>Each helped person (= new user with a personal cloud) is accompanied by a helper (= companion), trained and available to help him/her progress in the reappropriation of his/her data, papers and other necessary documents.</p>
 
 
<p>The person being helped has a USB key with which they can open their Cozy digital home from any PC. The content of this key will be systematically synchronised in the assisted person's digital home. The USB key symbolises physically the possession of their data (in addition, for some people concerned, the assurance that they no longer run the risk of losing a photo, letter, diploma, etc., the only witnesses to their story) even if they will obviously be kept in a cloud. The key is really only the simplified access key to one's personal space, inaccessible without a password. The browser - Firefox- is installed and configured on the key, so that the person being helped does not leave any personal data (cookie, browsing history, etc.) on the computer on which he or she inserts the key to access his or her personal space.<br>
In the event of loss or destruction of the key, it will nevertheless be very simple to reconstitute a new one from the data saved on the digital home.</p>
 
 
<p>The Pass extension, the password manager is already installed in the private Firefox browser available on the USB key. The person being helped thus federates and secures all their identities and passwords in their Cozy so that they do not lose them and are always at hand.</p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy of the person being helped thus becomes a place to share documents (via sharing often read-only in Drive) and help to recover passwords (if the carer needs to find this or that paper/lamp).</p>
 
 
<p>This is a paradigm shift for the person receiving assistance, who until now has been on the fringes of digital use and who, by reappropriating and controlling his data in his digital home, becomes a real player in his digital life and a citizen again.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We are convinced that our collective digital sovereignty will be the sum up of individual digital autonomies and it is by allowing each individual to control their data in a personal space to which they hold the key that we will achieve this. **At Cozy Cloud, we want the emancipation of each individual and not their manipulation or exclusion from society through digital technology.</p>
<p>A big thank you to the CEMEAs for having taken us on this adventure that gives a key back to those who need it.</p>

 🔄 Cozy Drive 
 Cozy Drive - synchronization application 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/releases/tag/v3.24.1">version 3.24</a> fixes some residual issues that occur in rare cases (especially when moving files under MacOS) and paves the way for the developments we have started to work on.</p>
 
 
<p>Under MacOS, we fixed a bug that prevented some successive moves of the same document, especially if the user has an HFS+ partition and there is an automatic change of the UTF-8 encoding of the path.</p>
 
 
<p>The permission to execute files under macOS and Linux is kept even when the file is also synchronized on a PC under Windows (which doesn't have this kind of permission).</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/download/"></a></p>
 
 
<p>When a local folder and a remote folder of the same name are linked together, the metadata of the remote folder is updated.</p>
 
 
<p>Storing the local metadata allows us to better detect when a remote change to a file has been saved but not applied to the local disk before a client restart. So we can now do without a backup copy to the local file trash when we decide to apply this remote change.</p>
 
 
<p>I can confirm that the features you are waiting for are under development and will arrive beginning 2021.</p>

 Cozy Drive - web 
<p>The sharing path has been completly reviewed and the team is working to make the experience as fluid as possible. Let's get down to the details:</p>
<p>✨ adding a preview link of the share directly in your Cozy if the Cozy of the sender knows the URL</p>
<p>✨ you can now find out if a folder or document you have shared has been viewed</p>
<p>✨ remove the share request step if the recipient URL is already known</p>
<p>✨ improvement of the sharing window with a separation between the upper part dedicated to sending by e-mail or contact and the lower part dedicated to sharing by link. This makes the modal more airy and clearer.</p>
<p>✨ appearance of a red badge in your Cozy on new shares you have not yet consulted</p>
<p>✨ the share link sent by email (or added in the Cozy) has been shortened</p>
<p>You can find the details of the possibilities on <a href="https://help.cozy.io/article/485-how-to-share-files-or-folders-with-your-cozy">our FAQ</a>.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, December 16, 2020 — <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> today named Tokeny Solutions in its inaugural <a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies">Blockchain 50 ranking</a>, a list of the top private companies applying or analyzing blockchain technology to solve business or consumer problems across various industries.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with Blockdata, the 2020 Blockchain 50 cohort includes companies from all around the globe across varying investment stages of development, from early-stage startups to well-funded unicorns.</p>

		 
	 
    Blockchain moved from possible to practical in 2020 as evidenced by the enterprise adoption we tracked. At the same time, the blockchain company ecosystem also became more crowded, creating noise and uncertainty for enterprises as they evaluate vendors and partners. The Blockchain 50, which we've created in conjunction with Blockdata, was born out of a desire to reduce that uncertainty and recognize the pioneering companies using the blockchain.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO     <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies/"> </a>     This inaugural class of the Blockchain 50 is tackling a range of use cases across trade finance, capital markets, exchanges and more and are being used by banks, governments and major retailers. We’re excited to see the impact the Blockchain 50 will have on industries as their solutions are deployed and to see the continued evolution of blockchain technology as it matures.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO       2020 has been a year where blockchain has made some important steps in becoming a reputable and accepted piece of technology. The digital assets industry has grown phenomenally. CBDCs have manifested on the agendas of major governments, regulations have progressed and there have been more security token issuances, particularly in real estate. All of this has only fuelled interest in security tokens, and many now see the path to private market liquidity. We are pleased to have further recognition in this vision by the CB Insights Blokchcain 50 and are excited to be included in such an impressive cohort of companies.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny Solutions marked some important industry milestones in 2020. It was a year in which they accelerated private market adoption; they tokenized a total of $27bn in asset value, were selected by the government of Monaco as its tokenization platform and teamed up with the major banks in France to explore the use of a digital currency. Through the institutional-grade T-REX protocol, they are bringing genuine asset transferability to private markets, an industry that has always been starved of liquidity.</p>
<p>Through an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights research team, in collaboration with Blockdata, selected the Blockchain 50 from thousands of applications and nominees, based on factors including patent activity, business relations, investor profiles, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty.</p>
<p>Quick facts on the 2020 Blockchain 50:</p>
 
 The 2020 Blockchain 50 companies have raised over $3B in aggregate equity funding across 110+ deals since 2017. 
 The list includes five unicorns (companies valued at or above $1B). 
 While the majority of the companies are based in North America, 40% of the 2020 Blockchain 50 winners are based outside the United States, in countries such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
 Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Kinetic Capital, Pantera Capital, and Valar Ventures are the most active venture investors in the Blockchain 50, with 5 investments each since 2017. 
 

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>

 Voting just got a whole more&nbsp;secure. <p>The two blockchain companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding and entered into a technological partnership. As part of the deal, the companies will share their tech experience and vision, provide mutual consulting on their blockchain solutions, and jointly develop and integrate related technologies.</p><p>The parties are especially interested in applying the <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">Decentralized Identity Solution (DeID)</a> developed by Ontology, in a <a href="https://we.vote/">blockchain-based e-voting system</a> recently launched by Waves Enterprise.</p><p>Voting technologies similar to those used in Waves Enterprise’s online voting service were tested and applied in an e-voting system developed for the Russian Central Election Commission by Rostelecom and Waves Enterprise during the single voting day in the Russian Federation, when more than 30,000 people took part in voting. This system employed the Russian unified identification and authentication system to identify users, which is centralized and not available to corporate users.</p><p>User authentication and identification are weak points of any e-voting system, even if it is fully implemented on a blockchain and utilizes advanced encryption. Together, the companies will explore how to integrate DID technologies into the voting service so that corporate users can seamlessly use and benefit from a fully decentralized approach.</p><p>“To implement and launch the voting process in some types of legal entities, we need to integrate our e-voting platform with KYC service providers, since trusted user authentication and verification is an essential requirement. Ontology DeID is a promising product that can help reach these goals. Therefore, we are focused on mutually beneficial cooperation and deep integration of our products.’’ — said Artem Kalikhov, CPO at Waves Enterprise.</p><p>Ontology’s founder, Li Jun, said: “Voting is a new and profound application for identity verification and privacy. It is one area that Ontology is excited to integrate with, as our DeID can do wonders to ensure that the identities and data of people who vote are not only protected, but also verified — a central issue facing many elections around the world. We look forward to deeper partnerships with Waves Enterprise, and hope that our technologies can work well together!”</p><p>About Waves Enterprise</p><p><a href="https://wavesenterprise.com">Waves Enterprise</a> — is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform for building fault-tolerant digital infrastructures. It combines both public and private networks as a hybrid solution, offering a high degree of data privacy and throughput, configurable encryption that can be tailored to local standards, and language-agnostic containerized smart contracts.</p><p>Waves Enterprise is one of the leaders in the market of corporate blockchain platforms. It has been used to implement projects for major Russian companies and government organizations in various industries: the national e-voting system, fintech services, trusted document management, supply chain management systems, and other solutions with high infrastructure security requirements.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://wavesenterprise.com">https://wavesenterprise.com</a> and <a href="https://we.vote">https://we.vote</a></p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/waves-enterprise-partners-up-with-ontology-to-integrate-decentralized-id-into-its-e-voting-service-19b9e375b68c">Waves Enterprise partners up with Ontology to integrate decentralized ID into its e-voting service.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Let's talk about IO in Urbit. I won't say much about how events and effects are processed by the runtime; it suffices to note that the runtime is a normal Unix program which (1) listens for various events, (2) passes them to Arvo (Urbit OS), and (3) processes the effects produced by Arvo. Instead, I’ll focus on how IO works from the perspective of Hoon programs, like Arvo or apps running on Arvo. But first, let's review IO paradigms in other languages.</p>
<p>All examples are in a made-up language, since it's useful to understand this information even before you're comfortable in Hoon. If you're learning Hoon and want a challenge, try translating them!</p>
 The three styles of IO 
<p>I will call these styles imperative IO, monadic IO, and state machines (note that this classification refers only to the experience of using them and the program structure they dictate). An imperative programming language can use any of these and a functional programming language can use any of them.</p>
 Imperative IO 
<p>Imperative languages (such as C and Python) perform IO by calling a function in the middle of whatever they were doing. Anywhere, in any statement, you could have IO.</p>
<p>In this example and others to follow, the task will be to read a filename from the command line, read a URL out of that file, and fetch the contents at that URL.</p>
 output = fetchUrl(stripWhitespace(readFile(cliInput())))
 
<p>For readability, intermediate variables would be a good idea, but nothing stops you from nesting IO this way.</p>
 Monadic IO 
<p>Languages that use explicit monads for IO (such as Haskell) perform IO by running IO behind a bind operation, which I'll notate with <code>&lt;-</code>. Thus, while you can't put IO anywhere, the general structure is a sequence of IO operations.</p>
 fileName &lt;- cliInput()
url &lt;- readFile(fileName)
output &lt;- fetchUrl(stripWhitespace(url))
 
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mark.pdf">Tackling the Awkward Squad</a> is the canonical description of monadic IO, and does a great job of explaining how the Haskell community decided to use this as their primary IO style.</p>
 State machines 
<p>Languages that use explicit state machines for IO (such as Elm) perform IO by accepting events and producing a list of effects.</p>
 event :: Initialize
       | CLIInput text
       | FileInput text
       | HTTPResponse body
effect :: CLIInput
        | ReadFile fileName
        | FetchUrl url
        | Print text
main(event) {
  switch event {
    Initialize        -&gt; [CLIInput ~]
    CLIinput fileName -&gt; [ReadFile fileName]
    FileInput url     -&gt; [FetchUrl stripWhitespace(url)]
    HTTPResponse body -&gt; [Print body]
  }
}
 
<p>The effects produced are not functions but data.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this example is chosen to highlight a particular kind of IO — sequences of events. Further, this example has no persistent state — each IO operation is a pure function of the output of the previous one.</p>
 A stateful, loopy example 
<p>Let's look at another type of program: a simple HTTP server that you can give text at the CLI, which will respond to all HTTP requests with that text.</p>
<p>Imperative:</p>
 text = "no text entered yet"
while (true)
  cli = readCli()
  if (cli != Null)
    text = cli
  request = readHttp()
  if (request != Null)
    respond(request,text)
 
<p>Monadic:</p>
 loop("no text entered yet")

where:

loop :: text -&gt; IO Null
loop =
  input &lt;- readInput()
  switch input
    CLIInput newText -&gt; loop(newText)
    HTTPRequest request -&gt;
      _ &lt;- respond(request,text)
      loop(text)
 
<p>State machine:</p>
 text = "no text entered yet"
main(text,event) {
  switch event {
    CLIInput newText    -&gt; [newText, Null]
    HTTPRequest request -&gt; [text, HTTPResponse text]
  }
}
 
<p>Again, note the response in the state machine is data, not a function.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make a point about which type is better in general. There's a pretty strong argument that in the first example, imperative was the best option, followed by monadic, followed by state machine. There's an equally strong argument that the second example is most naturally represented by the state machine.</p>
<p>Look at how state is handled in the monadic example. Formally, bind composes functions, so that every time you see a <code>&lt;-</code> there's actually a new function (closure/delimited continuation) being created and stored for when we receive a response. All variables in scope are stored in that closure, so we can conveniently access them later without explicitly storing them. However, the state we preserve over time varies a lot. In this example, it varies between storing <code>loop</code>, <code>[loop input]</code>, <code>[loop input newText]</code>, and <code>[loop input request]</code>.</p>
<p>By comparison, the state machine does not store intermediate values, it only stores its explicit state. While this is somewhat less flexible, it puts the permanent state front-and-center.</p>
<p>I'll reiterate that all of these are possible to implement in purely functional languages, and further they can all be implemented in terms of each other. State machines are trivially implementable -- it's just a function [state event] -&gt; [new-state (list effect)]. Monadic IO can be implemented directly (as in Haskell) or on top of state machines by storing continuations in your state. Imperative IO is somewhat more difficult but should be possible through algebraic effects.</p>
<p>When inventing a new system, you should consider which of these you intend to support based on the sort of code you expect to see. For example, a scripting language will almost always benefit from imperative (or at least monadic) style.</p>
 In Urbit 
<p>So much for exploring the space of IO solutions. In terms of deployed code on Earth, the split is about 90% imperative, 5% monadic, and 5% state machine. In Urbit, the split is about 90% state machine and 10% monadic. This is what I intend to explain and defend.</p>
<p>Urbit's OS is called Arvo; it has several "kernel modules" called vanes, and it has userspace applications. Colloquially these are called "apps," but when speaking about them abstractly, it's helpful to use their more specific name: <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/gall/#agents">"agents"</a>. Arvo, the vanes, and agents are all structured as explicit state machines.</p>
<p>In addition, there are <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/gall/#threads">"threads"</a>, which are structured as monadic IO. Note there's only a superficial resemblance to Unix threads: they are not executed in parallel and they don't share memory, or at least not any more than agents do. They're simply a computation that takes an argument and produces a result, possibly after doing some IO, structured monadically.</p>
<p>As you can see, all the lowest levels of Arvo are explicit state machines, and only the highest layer supports monadic IO. To see why this is the case, let's list advantages and disadvantages to each type. Note that, while I'm speaking specifically of agents and threads in the context of Urbit, these are fundamental properties of monadic and state machine IO.</p>
<p>Agents are:</p>
 
 
<p>Upgradable. Since the state is explicit, you can upgrade an agent in-place by supplying a new state machine and a function from the old state type to the new state type. This is very similar to a database migration.</p>
 
 
<p>Robust. A state machine must accept any input at any time. If it receives unexpected input, it must have had explicit error handling for that input, since it's one of the types in the switch statement. Thus, it's relatively easy to stay in a consistent state.</p>
 
 
<p>Permanent. Since it's upgradable and robust, there's no reason to stop its running.</p>
 
 
<p>Hard to write long sequences of IO. Long sequences of IO create many possible states, and you must handle any input in any state. This can result in complex, hard-to-follow code with code paths that are rarely if ever taken.</p>
 
 
<p>Threads are:</p>
 
 
<p>Not upgradable in-place. Since the state is implicit, you can only cleanly upgrade by (1) killing the thread and restarting it or (2) letting it resolve to a defined "upgradable state" periodically, usually at the top of a "main loop". If you do (2), then you are in fact structuring it as a state machine, so the other advantages of threads are compromised.</p>
 
 
<p>Fragile. If we don't receive expected input, the default behavior is to be stuck waiting for input. You must remember to add any error-handling features you want, and it's easy to end up in an inconsistent state.</p>
 
 
<p>Impermanent. Since a thread can't be upgraded and may get stuck in case of unexpected input, a thread can't be expected to last forever. It must be "rebooted" from time to time.</p>
 
 
<p>Easy to write long sequences of IO. Just...write the IO one line at a time.</p>
 
 
<p>Arvo proper and the vanes are permanent pieces of software and, for this reason, state machines are more natural.</p>
<p>I'll note that other kernels, like the Unix kernel, use imperative IO. The difference is that Unix isn't permanent in itself — it only lasts until you reboot. Since your permanent state is stored externally, you don't need to be upgradable or permanent. With sufficient discipline you can write robust C code, so it makes sense to use imperative style. Even so, a lot of C code is written in a state machine style; even if it doesn't need to be upgradable, it's worth it for the robustness and concurrency advantages.</p>
<p>However, Arvo is a single-level store — all of its state is permanent. This is very convenient and eliminates many long-tail bugs, but it also means we need to code for permanence, and that's much easier when you structure your code with explicit state.</p>
<p>Further, Arvo and the vanes rarely perform long sequences of IO. Generally, they do one thing and emit some effects, similar to the HTTP server example above. Sometimes they "pass through" a request. For example, the Eyre vane passes HTTP requests to userspace agents or threads. In this case, there is a sequence of IO, which in monadic code would be:</p>
 loop()

where:

loop =
  request &lt;- receiveRequest()
  agent = lookupAgent(request)
  response &lt;- callAgent(agent, request)
  _ &lt;- sendResponse(request, response)
  loop()
 
<p>This is clear code to read, but it leaves open the question of how to respond during the callAgent() function. If another request comes in, can we handle it in parallel? If we need to upgrade ourselves before the agent responds, can we make sure to properly handle the response?</p>
<p>The naive solution in monadic code is to say that you can only handle one request at a time, and if an upgrade happens you just drop outstanding requests. You can resolve both of these by introducing a sort of main loop, which is just a way of saying "turn it into a state machine".</p>
<p>In a state machine, the naive solution is:</p>
 state :: (map request agent)
main(state, event) {
  switch event {
    HTTPRequest request -&gt;
      agent = lookupAgent(request)
      [put(state, request, agent), CallAgent agent request]
    AgentResponse request response -&gt;
      [del(state, request), HTTPRespond request response]
  }
}
 
<p>Upgrading this is trivial, since the state (map of requests to outstanding calls to agents) is explicit. It also trivially handles concurrent requests.</p>
<p>I won't claim this is easier or harder to write than the monadic version, but it has the properties we need at this level of the system.</p>
<p>Userspace agents similarly are permanent entities that need to not lose data or get stuck. For this reason they’re structured as state machines.</p>
<p>A helpful comparison is that explicit state machines are basically Mealy machines, the kind you might have learned about in an introductory digital design class. This shouldn't be surprising; a digital circuit must always be consistent because it can't be manually "rebooted", and their input and output is highly formalized. By contrast, a Rube Goldberg machine doesn't have the same constraints; which is why they're a lot more fun!</p>
<p>It's notable also that explicit state machines are considerably more declarative than imperative or monadic IO. Not everyone thinks that's a good thing, but anyone who defends functional programming should see some advantages to that.</p>
<p>However, userspace sometimes needs to perform long sequences of IO. Let's look at an example where we want to fetch the front page of a site and the first couple comments on each story. HTTP is unreliable, so on failure we retry five times.</p>
<p>Monadic:</p>
 topStories &lt;- fetch(topStoriesUrl)
loop(topStories)

where:

loop :: topStories -&gt; IO Null
  if topStories is Null
    return Null
  comments &lt;- retryLoop(5,head(topStories))
  otherComments &lt;- loop(tail(topStories))
  append(comments,otherComments)

retryLoop :: [n story] -&gt; IO Comments
  comments &lt;- fetchComments(story)
  if comments is HTTPError:
    if n == 0:
      bail
    else:
      retryLoop(n-1, story)
 
<p>State machine:</p>
 state :: Initial
       | FetchingTop
       | FetchingStory comments stories retries
       | Done comments

main(state, event) {
  switch event {
    Initialize -&gt;
      assert state == Initial
      [FetchingTop, Fetch topStoriesUrl]
    HttpResponse response -&gt;
      switch state {
        FetchingTop -&gt;
          [FetchingStory Null stories 5, FetchComments head(stories)]
        FetchingStory comments stories retries -&gt;
          if response is HTTPError:
            if retries == 0:
              [Initial, Null]
            else:
              [FetchingStory comments stories retries-1,
               FetchComments head(stories)]
          else:
            comments = append(response,comments)
            if tail(stories) is Null:
              [Done comments, Null]
            else:
              [FetchingStory append(comments,response) tail(stories) 5,
               FetchComments head(tail(stories))]
      }
  }
}
 
<p>With practice, the state machine version of this can be written correctly. However, (1) it's verbose, (2) the control flow jumps all over the place, and (3) in practice it's challenging to get exactly right. This is still a small example, and it gets much worse as the length and complexity of the IO sequence grows.</p>
<p>The monadic version, on the other hand, flows cleanly down the page. We can factor out generic functionality like "retry this request n times" to make the essence of the computation clear.</p>
<p>Suppose you have to upgrade this. In the state machine, you can see exactly which stage of the computation you're in and write specific code to upgrade cleanly.</p>
<p>Threads, as we've discussed, can't be upgraded in-place. Let's be real though: we're downloading comment sections, not regulating a nuclear reactor. If we get a better version of this script, just kill the old one and start the new one from scratch. What's a couple extra HTTP requests?</p>
<p>This suggests a general division of workloads: code which needs to be permanent, upgradable, and concurrent should generally be a state machine. Code with long or complex sequences of IO and definite termination should generally be a thread.</p>
<p>These aren't completely mutually exclusive, but it's surprising how often they are.</p>
 Jael: a case study 
<p>When you need to do something permanent and upgradable, but you also need to do long sequences of IO, the main trick is to factor your problem into both an agent and a thread (or several).</p>
<p>As a case study, consider Jael, one of our vanes. This maintains our PKI state, which it downloads over HTTP from an Ethereum node. Downloading from an Ethereum node is a complex sequence that starts with fetching its most recent block number, then fetching all the blocks we haven't seen and scanning for transactions we care about. We also maintain a map of block hashes to block number, and if we see that a block's parent doesn't have the hash we expect, that means a reorganization has occurred, so we must "rewind" one block at a time until we find where the fork happened, then restart going forward.</p>
<p>You don't have to understand this sequence of IO; it's sufficient to see that it's complex and must be exactly right. We used to do this in a state machine directly in Jael. This data is, of course, permanent and needs to be accessible to the rest of the system, so Jael must be a state machine.</p>
<p>However, we had many small mistakes in this sequence of IO, some of which only appeared during unusual events, such as when an HTTP request failed at the same time as a reorganization happened.</p>
<p>We're in a bit of a bind, though: Jael has to be a state machine. The solution is to factor out the act of getting updates into a thread while the main PKI state is stored in the state machine in Jael.</p>
<p>This thread has a definite purpose: given the most recent block number we already know about, fetch all the PKI transactions since then. The function signature is:</p>
 syncEthereum oldBlockNumber -&gt; IO [newBlockNumber, newTxs]
 
<p>Jael runs this thread every five minutes and, if it succeeds, then we update our block number and PKI state. If the thread fails, gets stuck, or we need to upgrade it, we just kill the old thread and start a new one. Again, a few extra HTTP requests don’t matter.</p>
<p>From Jael's perspective, it looks something like:</p>
 state :: State block txs outstandingThread
main(state,event) {
  switch event {
    Initialize -&gt; [State 0 Null Null, StartTimer (now + five minutes)]
    TimerFired -&gt;
      effects = If outstandingThread is Null
                then Null
                else [Kill outstandingThread]
      newId = newThreadId()
      [State txs newId,
       append(effects,
              StartThread newId syncEthereum(block),
              StartTimer (now + five minutes))]
    ThreadFinished Failure -&gt; [State block txs Null, Null]
    ThreadFinished Success newBlockNumber newTxs -&gt;
      [State newBlockNumber append(txs,newTxs) Null, Null]
  }
}
 
<p>In other words, from Jael's perspective, it's just a single IO event that encapsulates arbitrarily complex IO in the thread. A single IO event is easy enough, and we can maintain all our permanency and robustness guarantees, because we know the thread will have one of three results: success, failure, or it hangs. If we set a timeout, hang becomes failure, so there's only two possible results: success or failure. If we handle both of those correctly, we've handled all the possible IO errors that could have occurred.</p>
<p>What about upgrading? We've already said we can handle the thread dying for arbitrary reasons, so if an upgrade comes in, we just kill it. We can upgrade Jael's state machine easily since its state is very simple.</p>
 Recap 
<p>Let's recap what we've covered:</p>
 
 There are three styles of IO: imperative, monadic, and explicit state machines. 
 Urbit supports explicit state machines (agents) and monadic IO (threads). 
 Explicit state machines are preferred for permanent, robust, concurrent code. 
 Monadic IO is preferred for short-lived code with complex IO. 
 If a state machine needs to perform complex IO, it should encapsulate it in a thread so that, from the perspective of the state machine, it's simple IO. 
 
<p>Hopefully it's fairly clear why Urbit uses explicit state machines in most situations. More than anything else, our goal is to build software that can last forever. Explicit state machines are a crucial tool for that.</p>

So what can you do as a tech leader or employee in a company utilising tech, to build trust? Or much more to the point, what can you do to become trustworthy?</p>
<p>An important step is to communicate honestly with your customers and stakeholders about the technology you use. However too often organisations fall at the first hurdle due to the damaging visual misrepresentations of AI that accompany their written communications, promotional material or media coverage. This session investigates the way that organisations and the media represent AI through images, and what this says about what they and customers expect and understand about the benefits of technology. We look at how this exposes the broader implications of anthropomorphising technology, and how to deal with describing the role of humans and human agency in your solutions.</p>
<p>As well as exploring how public perceptions of AI will shape the risks and opportunities faced by your organisation, you will leave this session with some practical suggestions on earning and building trust in your AI solutions, and helping to imagine a more positive AI future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_cetin_duarte"></a>

<p><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) is a hugely popular user authentication and identity protocol on the web today. It enables relying parties to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience.</p><p>In typical deployments of OpenID Connect today, in order for a user to be able to exercise the identity they have with a relying party, the relying party must be in direct contact with what’s known as the OpenID Provider (OP). OpenID Providers are responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties. This effectively means that an OpenID Provider is the Identity Provider (IdP) of the&nbsp;user.</p>In today’s OpenID Connect implementations, the Identity Provider mediates on behalf of the&nbsp;user<p>It’s the reason we often see buttons that say “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” during the login journey in an application or service. The website or application you want to use must first authenticate who you are with a provider like Google or Facebook which controls and manages that identity on your behalf. In this context we can think of the IdP as the “man in the middle.” This relationship prevents users from having a portable digital identity which they can use across different contexts and denies users any practical control over their identity. It also makes it incredibly easy for IdPs like Google or Facebook to track what users are doing, because the “man in the middle” can gather metadata about user behavior with little agency over how this identity data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>In order to allow users to have practical control over their identity, we need a new approach.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, an extension to OpenID Connect which enables the end-user to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a digital wallet. This specification defines how an OpenID Provider can be extended beyond being the provider of simple identity assertions into being the provider of credentials, effectively turning these Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p>OIDC Credential Provider allows the user to manage their own credentials<p>To maximize the reuse of existing infrastructure that’s deployed today, OIDC Credential Provider extends the core OpenID Connect protocol, maintaining the original design and intent of OIDC while enhancing it without breaking any of its assumptions or requirements.</p><p>Instead of using OIDC to provide simple identity assertions directly to the relying party, we can leverage OIDC to offer a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) which is cryptographically bound to a digital wallet of the end-users choice. The digital wallet plays the role of the OpenID Client application which is responsible for interacting with the OpenID Provider and manages the cryptographic key material (both public and private keys) used to prove ownership of the credential. The credentials issued to the wallet are re-provable and reusable for the purposes of authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-related information by providers and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the user-controlled “wallet” layer between issuers and relying&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, a wallet makes a request to an OpenID provider in order to obtain a credential, and then receives the credential back into their wallet so they can later use it to prove their identity to relying parties. The interaction consists of three main&nbsp;steps:</p>  The Client sends a signed credential request to the OpenID Provider with their public&nbsp;key  The OpenID Provider authenticates and authorizes the End-User to access the credential  The OpenID Provider responds to the Client with the issued&nbsp;VC  <p>In this new flow, the credential request extends the typical OpenID Connect request in that it expresses the intent to ask for something beyond the identity token of a typical OIDC flow. Practically, what this means is that the client uses a newly defined scope to indicate the intent of the request. The Client also extends the standard OIDC Request object to add cryptographic key material and proof of possession of that key material so that the credential can be bound to the wallet requesting it. Though the credential can be bound to a public key by default, it can also support different binding mechanisms, e.g. the credential can optionally be bound to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifer</a> (DID). In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user.</p><p>The request can also indicate the format of the requested credential and even ask for specific claims present within the credential. This is designed to allow multiple credential formats to be used within the OIDC&nbsp;flow.</p><p>On the provider side, OpenID Connect Providers are able to advertise which capabilities they support within the OIDC ecosystem using OpenID Connect Provider Metadata. This approach extends the metadata to support additional fields that express support for binding to DIDs, for issuing VCs, and advertising which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a>, credential formats, credentials, and claims they are offering. This information can be utilized by the end-user’s digital wallet to help the user understand whether or not they wish to proceed with a credential request.</p><p>In order to create a way for the wallet or client to connect to the OpenID Provider, the spec also defines a URL which functions as a Credential Offer that the client can invoke in order to retrieve and understand the types of credential being offered by the provider. The client registers the ‘openid’ URI scheme in order to be able to understand and render the offer to the user so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>The sum of these changes means that OpenID Connect can allow users to have a portable digital identity credential that’s actually under their control, creating an opportunity for greater agency in digital interactions as well as preventing identity providers from being able to easily track user behavior. The OpenID Connect Credential Provider <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">specification</a> is in the process of being contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item at the A/B Working Group, where it will continue to be developed by the community behind OpenID&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>MATTR is pleased to announce that our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/extensions/oidc-bridge">OIDC Bridge Platform Extension</a> now uses OIDC Credential Provider under the hood to facilitate issuing credentials with OpenID Connect. OIDC Bridge hides the complexity associated with setting up infrastructure for credential issuance and simply requires configuration of a standard OpenID Provider. We also simplify the process of verifying credentials issued over OIDC Credential Provider by allowing the wallet to respond to requests, present credentials, and prove ownership and integrity of their credentials via&nbsp;OIDC.</p>OIDC Bridge is an Extension to the MATTR&nbsp;Platform<p>This new set of capabilities allows OpenID Providers greater flexibility around which claims end up in a credential, and allows for the support of many different credential types with a straight-forward authentication journey for end-users.</p><p>Our Mobile Wallet supports the ability to invoke credential offers using OIDC Credential Provider as well as creating credential requests and receiving credentials from an OpenID Provider.</p><p>To find out more, check out our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">tutorials</a> on MATTR Learn, read the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">spec</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WPwotNArI">recording</a> of our presentation on this spec from the recent Internet Identity Workshop.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">Introducing OIDC Credential Provider</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The GiD Report#139 — The landmark antitrust case against FB, Visa + Circle/USDC is a big&nbsp;deal <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-138-the-age-of-antitrust-stripe-is-windows-for-fintech-b5dcfbf5da5d">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Well — a LOT went down this last&nbsp;week:</p>  The landmark antitrust case against&nbsp;FB  Don’t expect it to be a&nbsp;panacea  Why the real solution is always innovation/competition  Visa + Circle’s stablecoin USDC is a big&nbsp;deal  Why porn is suddenly taking identity so seriously  This week in credentials  Stuff happens   1. Make no mistake, last week’s lawsuits against Facebook were a landmark moment in American antitrust history. <p>As Greg Kidd noted, this is “the big&nbsp;one.”</p><p>It’s been a long time coming—and how quickly the tide has turned. Not five years ago, Big Tech was still the bell of the ball. Today, you’d be hard pressed to find a Facebook defender. Regulators have turned — both federal and state. So have the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Last week’s lawsuits included not only the FTC but also now 48 state attorney generals. In a time of intense social and political division, such comprehensive consensus speaks&nbsp;volumes.</p><p>As Kara Swisher opined, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">has become a&nbsp;menace</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e9f50136-c3c3-49f4-a786-7adb44ce3e8e.html">the latest from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Both the Federal Trade Commission and the states want to break up Facebook, not just reform its practices. This wasn’t a given, or inevitable. The FTC also wants the court to require Facebook to seek approval for future acquisitions, going beyond what’s already required under&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s moves to freeze out competitors raised antitrust alarms. The FTC argues that Facebook limited third-party software developers’ access to its platform in anticompetitive ways and cut off firms it perceived as&nbsp;threats.</blockquote><blockquote>Privacy, regulators now say, is a competition concern. The states’ lawsuit mentions privacy dozens of times, arguing that Facebook surveils its users and that its monopolistic practices have reduced the “quality and variety of privacy options and content” available to the public. The states also argue that WhatsApp started as a privacy-focused app and Facebook has slowly eroded its privacy protections.</blockquote><p>Also, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>What the lawsuits really represent, experts said, is an indication that the government will no longer look the other way when it comes to how Facebook operates.</blockquote><blockquote>“Every acquisition they try to make from here on will be met with such a level of inspection and skepticism associated with it,” one expert told Business&nbsp;Insider.</blockquote><p>Notable that this stance is not just limited to Big Tech and Facebook if the ongoing Visa/Plaid situation is any indication.</p><p>Greg outlined his take on Twitter. On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337458090036215808">the lawsuits</a>:</p><p>You can and do need to turn back the clock when it comes to anti-competitive behavior that destroys #innovation and user rights to their own&nbsp;data.</p>Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337798851676184577">Facebook and&nbsp;privacy</a>:</p><blockquote>#Facebook’s pattern of bogus privacy claims are simply a cover for a pattern of anti-competitive behavior and misuse of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (#CFAA).” Users should be able to view their own data however they see fit to authorize.</blockquote><p>The thing is — this fight isn’t new nor are Facebook’s anti-competitive tactics, of which those who have been on the short end of the sticks have been keenly aware, as Greg&nbsp;points:</p><blockquote>46 states are now following up on the same grounds as our portfolio company</blockquote><blockquote>@LenddoEFL — which sued #Facebook over anti-competitive blocks to #API access that deny users access to and control of their own data. Original filing: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr">https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr</a></blockquote><p>Of course, those at the short end of the stick continue to expand in numbers. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-facebook-crime-spree?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MjQxODIyMDUsIl8iOiJRd3ZzbCIsImlhdCI6MTYwNzYwNzY2NiwiZXhwIjoxNjA3NjExMjY2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTE1MjQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q1ETVKKVDGsLqOK5u02PwT43TUuO7R4kGQZSEHX43aY">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>So what changed? Well, we made the case for the rule of law. Many people were involved, like Jeff Chester, who opposed the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers at the time. The list of people who sought to address the harms of Facebook grew every year I was paying attention, and I started paying attention closely in 2013. Just in terms of what we did and Facebook’s reaction, we wrote, researched, and advocated against monopolization, and Facebook in particular. For one shareholder meeting, we hired an airplane to draw in in the sky outside of Facebook’s shareholder the slogan “You broke democracy.”</blockquote><blockquote>In response, Facebook hired a company to investigate us, and then tried to smear us in the press as anti-semites in an attempt to undermine our arguments. We were no strangers to retribution by powerful monopolists, and we aren’t the only ones that Facebook sought to target. I suspect they regularly go after many people. I mean, just before the election, Facebook sued NYU researchers trying to study how its political ad targeting worked after its ad archive ‘accidentally’ malfunctioned. This kind of dirty stuff is routine, it’s a business in Washington, D.C., and increasingly Brussels. It’s the crust of corruption protecting the slime of monopoly.</blockquote> 2. But don’t get it twisted. It would be naive to assume antitrust regulation to be some sort of panacea to widespread problems that the Facebook monopoly symbolizes. <p>For one, experts <a href="http://4ce3e8e.html">question the long term effectiveness</a> of legal action on its&nbsp;own:</p><blockquote>The FTC and states have to prove that rejecting Facebook’s acquisitions would have made life better for consumers and increased industry competition — a tough case to make, legal experts told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The court will be looking at whether the acquisition of WhatsApp, for instance, was lawful when it occurred in 2012, not whether it would be lawful now, said Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher and former chief of the appellate section of the DOJ antitrust division.</blockquote><blockquote>One hurdle for the FTC is “that they reviewed the transaction and cleared it,” she said. “Their suit depends on admitting they made a mistake in&nbsp;2012.”</blockquote><blockquote>It’s not common for the FTC to try to undo previous acquisitions, but it has happened, said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a partner at Arnall Golden Gregory and former antitrust attorney at the FTC. He called the FTC suit “super aggressive.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">And</a>:</p><blockquote>Wall Street analysts told Business Insider’s Martin Coulter that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-antitrust-lawsuits-wall-street-breakup-instagram-whatsapp-2020-12?r=kc-sub">the lawsuit might not actually have legs to hold up in court</a>, and a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp is unlikely to happen, Lightman&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“If you break them up now, are you going to give them a refund check?” Lightman said. There are so many integrated assets, from engineers and executives to user data, so the question is how does that even begin to be unraveled, according to Lightman.</blockquote><blockquote>Experts said what the lawsuit really represents is being part of a series of governmental actions signaling the broader consensus that the industry needs oversight.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s time to take all of these companies seriously, both in terms of the incredible benefits they’ve provided to our economy, to the marketplace of ideas and to our personal lives, but also the problems that they pose for those same things,” Dinielli&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Rather than the end, it’s just the beginning.</p> 3. Instead these latest actions serve as one part of a multi-pronged campaign. Another prong will be innovation and competition. <p>Like Matt Stoller, I also started paying attention to Facebook nearly a decade ago when I was still covering Wall Street and Big Tech for VICE/Motherboard (before setting my sights on a nascent thing called Bitcoin). That beat eventually culminated into <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pggg3z/what-happened-to-the-facebook-killer-it-s-complicated">an investigative longread about Diaspora</a> (an open source, decentralized social network), at the time, the most successful Kickstarter project on the platform.</p><p>Even as early as 2010, Facebook had already soiled its reputation:</p><blockquote>Since it launched, as Facebook made tweaks to privacy settings — with the presumption that privacy standards were changing — users were largely kept out of the loop, learning of privacy abuses after the fact. They were like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, slowly coming to a boil. The frog jumps out if the heat’s turned up too fast. But if it’s turned up gradually, the frog never notices, and stays in the water until it boils. Except the anecdote is fallacious. Most of the time, the frog&nbsp;notices.</blockquote><blockquote>In February of 2010, at the height of Facebook’s run-in with the public’s trust, a law professor named Eben Moglen delivered a public lecture at NYU titled “Freedom in the Cloud.” “The human race has susceptibility to harm, but Mr. Zuckerberg has attained an unenviable record: he has done more harm to the human race than anybody else his age,” Moglen declared, and outlined the dubious contract the connected world was entering into with Facebook. “Namely, ‘I will give you free web hosting and some PHP doodads and you get spying for free all the time.’ And it works. That’s the sad part, it&nbsp;works.”</blockquote><p>Enter Diaspora:</p><blockquote>The idea was simple. Build a decentralized, open source version of Facebook for the Freedom Box. Own your data. Own your social network. No Mark Zuckerberg. No need for real names. Just the people. Hoping to raise some funds for what was supposed to be a summer distraction, the team posted their idea on then little-known microfinance site, Kickstarter, with an unfussy target of $10,000. They called it Diaspora*, which fit the project’s decentralizing aims nicely. From the Greek διασπορά, “scattering, dispersion,” it’s “the movement, migration, or scattering of people away from an established or ancestral homeland” or “people dispersed by whatever cause to more than one location.”</blockquote><p>TL;DR — Diaspora didn’t work out (in tragic fashion). Here’s what Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent, told me at the&nbsp;time:</p><blockquote>To Cohen, guru of p2p, Diaspora isn’t just cumbersome: it’s deeply flawed. And it’s not something we really need at the moment. “There may be room for a form of social networking somewhere between email and Facebook,” he wrote in an email. “It can’t just be a verbatim copy of Facebook though, it would need some rethinking.” And a big part of it is timing. All of this is relatively brand new and a solution like Facebook in its current form still has much to offer. “I think it’s a good idea to wait for things to get more mature before trying to build something less&nbsp;agile.”</blockquote><p>And that’s essentially how things played out. Facebook’s centralized and integrated approach to the world still had much to offer — and when its influence started to wane, they deftly picked up the hottest new kids on the block in Instagram and WhatsApp, extending its ascent and&nbsp;power.</p><p>As Bram keenly pointed out, Diaspora was ahead of its time. A lot has happened since then. The Facebook platform, IG and WhatsApp in tow, is fully matured. We’ve seen the rise of Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain — open source, decentralized projects with builtin mechanisms for financing and consequently, economic sustainability.</p><p>Which brings us to the next prong.

Speaking of Facebook and Diem, Visa moving into the stablecoin space with the help of Circle is a big&nbsp;deal. <p>First <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=3af6d3e44b1f">the news from&nbsp;Forbes</a>:</p><blockquote>Credit card giant Visa today announced it is connecting its global payments network of 60 million merchants to the U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) developed by Circle Internet Financial on the ethereum blockchain. The digital currency is now valued at $2.9&nbsp;billion.</blockquote><blockquote>While Visa itself won’t custody the digital currency, effective immediately, the partnership will see Circle working with Visa to help select Visa credit card issuers start integrating the USDC software into their platforms and send and receive USDC payments. Circle itself is also going through the same Fast Track program. In turn, businesses will eventually be able to send international USDC payments to any business supported by Visa, and after those funds are converted to the national currency, spend them anywhere that accepts&nbsp;Visa.</blockquote><p>How Visa sees&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“We continue to think of Visa as a network of networks,” says Sheffield, a five-year veteran of Visa, who took over as head of crypto last June. “Blockchain networks and stablecoins, like USDC, are just additional networks. So we think that there’s a significant value that Visa can provide to our clients, enabling them to access them and enabling them to spend at our merchants.”</blockquote><p>Why it’s a big&nbsp;deal:</p><blockquote>Visa estimates that $120 trillion in payments annually are made using checks and instant wire transfers, costing as much as $50 each, regardless of the size of the transaction. Since USDC settles on the ethereum blockchain, transactions can close in a little a[s] 20 seconds and, importantly, can be done for nearly free, Visa believes its vast array of merchants could choose to use this nearly instant alternative form of payment. “We worked closely with digital currency wallets to issue Visa credentials,” says Sheffield. “And helping them receive USDC payouts can add additional value for&nbsp;them.”</blockquote><p>Moreover, the move essentially creates a direct connection between Visa and the crypto universe with Circle’s USDC serving as a bridge — no doubt a savvy move by all parties involved, one that could also have a huge impact on the continued mainstreaming of Bitcoin et.&nbsp;al.</p><p>Keep an eye on this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=77358bc84b1f">Visa Partners With Ethereum Digital-Dollar Startup That Raised $271&nbsp;Million</a>  <p>Also in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/kiwipete">/kiwipete</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>: <a href="https://event.webinarjam.com/replay/101/vo5y0t1mtl1b8zi6pk">Dave Schwartz on XRP: Remodelling the future of&nbsp;finance</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-criminals-idUSKBN28J1IX">Criminals getting smarter in use of digital currencies to launder&nbsp;money</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87175/bitpay-bitcoin-bank-occ-filing">Bitcoin payments startup BitPay wants to create a national bank in&nbsp;Georgia</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cenbanks-digital-idUSKBN28K1NI">Central banks split on role of private sector in payments — survey</a>  <a href="https://blockfi.com/fidelity-digital-assets-adds-collateral-agent-capabilities-custody-for-bitcoin-pledged-on-loans-financed-by-blockfi">Fidelity Digital Assets Adds Collateral Agent Capabilities for BlockFi&nbsp;Loans</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>— <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-lawmakers-tell-mnuchin-to-back-off-from-potential-crypto-wallet-regs">Lawmakers Urge Mnuchin to End Rumored Wallet Rules — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-raising-another-400m-btc">A De Facto ETF?

			<p>Luxembourg, December 2020 – With <a href="http://www.digibrixx.lu">Digibrixx</a>, blockchain technology makes its entry into the property investment market in Luxembourg. Developed by Property Token, the Digibrixx brand is a solution enabling anyone wishing to invest in property in Luxembourg to purchase digital bricks backed up by real, solid bricks and mortar. The project has been made compliant thanks to the T-REX protocol and the solutions provided by <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny Solutions</a>.</p>
 The benefits of digitalisation 
<p>Digibrixx breaks a property down into small digital bricks (or tokens). An investor can then buy one or more of those bricks for a few thousand euros. In other words, Digibrixx democratises property investment, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Digibrixx brings simplicity, ease and flexibility. The investor has no need to involve their bank, get tied up in red tape with the authorities or have to keep monitoring their property. It is managed by a professional throughout the whole process. The administrative costs borne by the investor are therefore also reduced.</p>
 For all investors 
<p>Given how flexible and accessible Digibrixx is in financial terms, this investment is aimed at all people who want to invest in bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive option for someone near the border who wants to invest in Luxembourg and take advantage of its dynamic property market, while at the same time ensuring they do not need to dip into their borrowing facilities to finance the purchase of a home of their own.<br>
Digibrixx is also aimed at anyone seeking to diversify their assets, but keep a large degree of agility and freedom for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Digibrixx also offers a suitable investment solution for self workers who want to invest in property but sometimes face obstacles because of the employed banks’ requirements when it comes to borrowing, given their employment status.</p>
 How does Digibrixx work? 
<p>When they visit the Digibrixx site, investors can learn about the different investment projects in which they have an opportunity to invest.</p>
<p>Those projects are owned by developers who offer serious guarantees and who have chosen to sell one or another of their property projects via the Digibrixx brand. Assets are automatically audited and selected by Digibrixx experts, who have a background in immovable property.</p>
<p>Transparency is essential. Each project is covered by a detailed presentation. The percentage of funding already raised is automatically stated and an estimate of the annual performance is given.</p>

		 
	 
    If the investor is interested, all they need to do is click on the subscription form for their chosen project. They will then be put in touch with the developer, who will remain their direct contact person. They are also put in touch with BIL, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, Digibrixx’s financial partner, which is responsible for issuing digital title deeds, otherwise known as tokens  Cyril LamorletteChartered Accountant &amp; Audit Partner    
	 
		 
			<p>Investments are therefore appropriate, secure and transparent. </p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization activity has continued to surge in Luxembourg since the regulation has become clearer. Real estate is a key driver in this space because lower ticket sizes can be offered, opening up new investor segments. We’re pleased to provide the technological pieces to this innovative project and help provide new pathways for investment. We believe Digibrixx will act as a precursor to many more like minded projects.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			 What project, and what will the returns be like? 
<p>The money gathered by the developer is used to create leverage and finance the property operation. The investor therefore sees an immediate growth in their return. The process also provides an additional security guarantee for the investor: the developer, too, invests in the project, as does the bank which grants a loan.</p>

		 
	 
    The approved property projects offer real potential in terms of return on investment. They may be commercial premises, residential or garages  Laurent OlmedoAdministrator at Digibrixx    
	 
		 
			<p>During the investment period the building is constructed and put up for rent. At the end of that period, which is specified straight away, the subscriber recovers their initial investment, the capital gain on the sale of the property, and their share of the rental income, minus the charges and fees relating to the Digibrixx programme.</p>
<p>Risk is weighted because Digibrixx is based on an existing property asset, and the Luxembourg market cannot collapse overnight. Over the past decade it has actually proved its resilience through a steady continuously upward trend. But, as with any investment, there is an element of risk.</p>
 Toward a digital exchange platform 
<p>Digibrixx has already launched its first property investment project. The entry price was voluntarily set at 10,000 euros to attract qualified investors.</p>
<p>The ambition is quickly to roll out offers aimed at the “general public”, allowing property investments in the Grand Duchy amounting to a few thousand euros, or just a few hundred.</p>
<p>Digibrixx is also considering the rollout of an online trading platform which will allow investors to sell, buy or even exchange their tokens with total freedom and ease. That innovation will be launched once the legal and regulatory frameworks governing digital assets in Luxembourg and Europe (security<br>
tokens) allow.</p>
<p>But, right now, Digibrixx falls within a well-defined legal framework based on a securitisation vehicle governed by a Luxembourg law dated 22 March 2004.</p>

			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>Tokeny Solutions is the leader in its field and in 2019 they were included in KPMG’s top 100 FinTechs globally, awarded Luxembourg’s FinTech of the year and raised €5mn in funding from the leading pan-european exchange, Euronext.</p>

 As more businesses in Europe move to adopt multi-factor solutions that comply with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), we thought we’d explain what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is. <p>To give a little background, financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe must change how they authenticate users by the 1st January 2021 under the revised <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">Payments Services Directive</a> (PSD2). This change has been driven by a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/is-the-payments-market-ready-for-sca/">fraud and identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>So as Europe gets ready to adopt strong customer authentication (SCA) solutions that are compliant with PSD2&nbsp;, we thought we’d cut through the noise to give you a clear breakdown on what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is.</p><p>To put it simply, strong authentication is achieved when solutions combine at least two mutually-independent authentication factors (keep reading to learn more about the three factors), to confirm a user’s identity and grant access to private accounts, systems and&nbsp;data.</p> Combating the password&nbsp;threat <p>Passwords are still clinging onto their place as the number one means of verifying a user’s identity online, but are they still sufficient in protecting users from threats? With the volume of digital accounts each user has (and by result number of passwords they have to keep safe), alongside a steady increase in <a href="https://www.securelink.com/blog/81-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">hacking attacks and data breaches caused by compromised credentials</a> — it’s safe to say passwords have lost their intuitiveness and effectiveness when it comes to mitigating unauthorized access.</p> What is multi-factor authentication? <p>Solutions providing multi-factor authentication (MFA) combine at least two independent authentication challenges in order to provide a solution that is more resilient to threats and account takeovers.</p> Multi-factor authentication solutions integrate at least two of the below challenge factors: The 3 authentication challenge factors — knowledge (verifying something the user knows), possession (verifying something the user has), inherence (verifying something the user&nbsp;is). 1. Knowledge challenges <p>Knowledge challenges verify that a user knows something that no one else does. Common examples are passwords and PINs. In reality, passwords and PINs are readily shared and compromised — making knowledge based challenges one of the least reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity&nbsp;online.</p> 2. Possession challenges <p>Possession challenges verify that the user has something in their possession that no one else does. In the context of consumer authentication, proving a user has possession of something is usually done by delivering one-time passwords via push notifications or SMS to a user’s trusted device or phone number. In the workforce, employees could be given swipe-cards or USB&nbsp;tokens.</p> 3. Inherence challenges <p>Inherence challenges verify that a user is something. Essentially this is verifying the unique characteristics and traits of an individual by way of biometric sensors.</p><p>Having two mutually-independent factors enhances security by enabling an additional security layer. This means that even if one factor is compromised, private accounts, systems and data are all theoretically still protected, so long as the second factor hasn’t also been compromised.</p> A real-world example for multi-factor authentication is the usage of credit-card (something the user has) with a PIN code (something the user&nbsp;knows).  MFA vs strong customer authentication (SCA) <p>The European Central Bank takes security one step further and says that to enable strong authentication, at least one of the authentication factors must be non-reusable.</p><p>A common example of a non-reusable authentication challenge is a one-time authentication code sent to a user’s device, for example a push-notification or SMS-token.</p><p>One-time codes are by nature less likely to be compromised, making the challenge response more resilient to threats, however, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252476811/Four-fifths-of-SIM-swap-fraud-attempts-succeed">with four out of five SIM swapping attacks being successful, one-time codes are not without&nbsp;risk.</a></p><p>Rather than verifying a user’s identity based on something they know or possess, inherence challenges authenticate users by validating something the user&nbsp;is.</p> The benefits of biometrics for&nbsp;SCA <p>The benefit of authenticating users via their biometrics is that biometrics are much harder for an attacker to steal or&nbsp;fake.</p> This is especially true when solutions take a multi-modal approach to biometrics. <p>Multimodal biometrics are when a user is authenticated via both physical and behavioral traits unique to them, essentially a form of biometric two-factor authentication.</p><p>An example would be if a solution verified a user’s unique facial measurements (using facial recognition technology), alongside their unique keystroke dynamics (the way they interact with their&nbsp;device).</p><p>Because of their layered approach, multi-modal biometrics can give companies extremely high assurance that a user is who they claim to be online, without disrupting the user-journey or adding undue complexity.</p> Strong authentication = seamless&nbsp;login  At Keyless we combine inherence and possession factors to provide fast, secure, user-friendly authentication that is resilient to common threats including phishing, credential stuffing and SIM-swapping attacks.  1. Our first factor is inherence (something the user&nbsp;is) <p>We leverage multi-modal biometrics, combined with advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing technology, to verify that a user is who they say they are, both at the point of authentication and continuously as they user accesses private systems and accounts. The intuitiveness offered by multimodal biometrics allows our clients to strengthen access control security, without jeopardizing on productivity or user-experience.</p> 2. Our second factor is possession (something the user possesses) <p>We use device-identity verification to ensure that each authentication request is launched from a user’s trusted device without needing to send a push-notification to the user’s device. The combination of inherence and possession factors allows for seamless, strong authentication that is resilient to a wide range of threats facing enterprises, while also being intuitive to the user, and minimally disruptive to workflow.</p> Implementing Strong Authentication <p>The deadline for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe to implement SCA is fast approaching.</p><p>When executed properly, strong authentication should not disrupt the user-experience or make authentication more challenging for the user. Instead, strong authentication should enhance employee and customer experiences while protecting your company from privacy and security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Keyless passwordless solutions are PSD2 compliant and designed to seamlessly integrate with existing security and identity management infrastructure, so that you can quickly deploy biometric-enabled passwordless solutions to your remote workforce and&nbsp;users.</p> Interested in how Keyless can help you achieve SCA compliance&nbsp;?

<p>Coinspeaker: Bridge is one of the most popular card games, known for its complexity and need for strategic thinking. It’s most commonly played in clubs and at home. However, the events of 2020 have severely hampered gamers, and the opportunities for playing online are sorely lacking. Therefore, Swiss-based blockchain development firm Jelurida is seeking to plug the gap with Bridge Champ. Bridge Champ is purpose-built for the game, offering customization options, an open API to organize contests and tournaments, and built-in social features such as chat and video. However, the blockchain features are where Bridge Champ really comes into its own. The platform will feature an in-game economy for competition registration, with the ability to award crypto assets awarded for “proof-of-play” and player achievements. Achievements will also be stored on Jelurida’s platform, the Ardor blockchain, which will provide proven randomization of card dealing, preventing fraudulent behavior and cheating. Jelurida is partnering with Bridge Online Academy, experts in online bridge training</p>

  <p>If 2020 taught the world nothing else, organizations learned the vital importance of adapting to disruption. When COVID-19 halted supply chains and countries around the world phased in and out of various lockdown procedures, organizations needed to quickly shift gears to survive.</p>
<p>To meet the challenges of today’s world, organizations must improve the resilience and sustainability of their application platforms and architectures to continuously evolve to meet business needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Optimizing application delivery has always been about continual evolution, but to implement digital transformations, modernize existing applications and innovate, skills in distributed architecture, integration patterns and cloud platform technologies are critical.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Sustainable application delivery requires architecture and platforms with effective governance, architectural dexterity and relevant skills,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/54513/Brad-Dayley">Brad Dayley</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>In the coming year, application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient. The key is implementing continuous learning, with a focus on:</p>
 
 Strong agile architecture: Does your organization have the skills to enable delivery of components of the application (such as individual apps, APIs and services) at independent cadences and using optimal technologies? 
 DevOps: Can your application technical professionals implement an operation and effective tool chain that supports continuous integration and continuous delivery? 
 Cloud-native skills: Is your team able to design, architect, integrate and operate applications that are ready to deploy and operate in a cloud environment? 
 
<p>With a foundation in these areas, application technical professionals can make realistic and pragmatic assessments of new architecture and integration technologies, platforms and patterns as they emerge.</p>
<p>But much more is needed to ensure your organization is sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet new challenges in the future.</p>
 Adapt and modernize application architecture 
<p>Changing user needs, customer expectations, business models, processes and application delivery requirements are intrinsic challenges of running a business. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the need for change.</p>
<p>Application architects and delivery teams with the appropriate skills and technologies in place have been able to step up, adapt and support their organizations to meet those significant challenges and weather the storm.</p>
<p>Conversely, lack of skills has inhibited application delivery professionals from making needed transitions to meet business needs, accelerate delivery cadence, optimize costs and scale applications to meet accelerated requirements.</p>
 Prioritize skills 
<p>With skills in place for agile architecture, DevOps and cloud-native, organizations should then prioritize skills based on real business and application needs. To determine the additional skills needed based on the real impact to your business, ask these questions:</p>
 
 Is this a skill that has already been identified by my organization as critical? 
 Is this a skill in which we are currently deficient on my team or within my organization? 
 How will I apply this skill in my current role? 
 Will this skill enable me to expand my current role in the products I am working on? 
 Is this skill required for future modernization/innovation efforts that have been approved and are underway in my organization? 
 Look for strong and clear “yes” answers to these questions. Avoid skills for which there is uncertainty. 
 
 Gain experience and knowledge 
<p>Successfully learning skills means balancing knowledge and experience. Gaining too much knowledge is dangerous because you know how to do things without the experience to understand when and why to do them. At the same time, trying to learn a skill solely through experience is painful.</p>
<p>Depending on the skill and individual learning style, many learning activities are available, such as tutorials, online courses, bootcamps, conferences, proofs of concept (POCs), book clubs and lunch-and-learns. Look for those opportunities within your organization and utilize them. When they don’t exist, take the initiative and start one when appropriate. However, always prioritize those activities that provide practical experience and enable you to gain both knowledge and experience. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Communities of practice 
 POCs/prototypes 
 Paired (programming, design, architecture) 
 Team rotation/sharing 
 
<p>These types of activities tend to provide multiple benefits to application architecture and integration professionals. They enable you to focus on real-world problems; they integrate into your normal workflow so you don’t need to set aside learning time; and the outcomes are often used in production applications.</p>
 Culture of continuous learning 
<p>The most successful organizations encourage and support a culture of continuous learning and allow technical professionals the time and opportunities to learn new skills. A culture of continuous learning is one where multiple activities are available for individuals to increase their skills.</p>
<p>Application architecture and integration professionals contribute to this culture by participating in available activities and taking the initiative to create, start or encourage activities. To overcome any barriers to justifying the time and effort to learn new skills, define valuable and measurable outcomes from your learning activities.</p>
<p>Dedicate time to develop soft skills (e.g., time management and listening) as well as technical skills.</p>

<p>Coincodex: Many projects are now also recognizing that it may be easier to lure in gamers by giving them a blockchain-based platform to play their favorite games. Swiss blockchain development firm Jelurida is one example, having spotted an opportunity to put the popular card game bridge on its Ardor blockchain platform. Hundreds of millions of people play bridge, all over the world, in clubs, in tournaments, and in their homes. However, the advent of the COVID-19 crisis has left many people without the opportunity to participate due to social distancing measures. No company currently offers a white label solution that makes it easy for new operators to set up. Therefore, Jelurida is developing Bridge Champ, a customizable gaming platform purpose-built for bridge. It allows operators to set up competitions using the platform’s in-game economy, and players can “mine” bridge tokens based on proof of play and player achievements. All game results and achievements are recorded on the blockchain, and the platform uses blockchain for proven randomization.</p>

In addition to this DOCK/USD decentralized price oracle, we are looking into using Chainlink to make other fiat exchange rates available on the platform in the future, as well as allowing our credential data to be accessed by smart contracts in other blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>The Need for Chainlink</p><p>Following Dock’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dock-announces-mainnet-launch/#:~:text=September%2030%2C%202020.,its%20much%2Danticipated%20blockchain%20mainnet.">mainnet release</a> earlier this year, which enables organizations to create, issue, and revoke verifiable credentials, our business development team has been steadily working with organizations interested in issuing credentials on Dock. </p><p>While the use cases are varied and span several industry sectors, they do share a common element beyond their desire to unlock the potential of verifiable credentials. They require their network operation costs, such as those to create decentralized identities or to revoke credentials, to be available in fiat currency. This stands to reason as almost all their costs are in fiat and they don’t want to bear the burden of exchange rate risk. </p><p>Of course, the Dock token serves as an integrated payment mechanism on the network. However, this is the network’s only notion of value. The Dock Network currently has no concept of different currencies and rates of exchange. Thus, the Dock Network requires a <a href="https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/">blockchain oracle</a> to source this data from off-chain, so it can be integrated into our on-chain dApps.</p><p>Pricing in USD</p><p>Once integrated, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network will provide a DOCK/USD Price Feed that Dock Network will use to calculate the transaction fees users must pay in DOCK tokens given their original stated price in USD. The prices will be updated on an ongoing basis via a decentralized network of Chainlink nodes, ultimately serving as the standard benchmark for exchange rates on all Dock Network operations.</p><p>Why Chainlink?</p><p>We selected Chainlink because it's the most battle-tested oracle solution in the market, with its Price Feeds already widely relied on by leading DeFi projects to secure billions of dollars in value. Here are some of the key features we found valuable when it comes to Chainlink Price Feeds:</p>  High-quality price data sourced from premium off-chain aggregators, providing volume-weighted market coverage across all trading environments to mitigate exchange rate risk.  Security reviewed oracle nodes run by leading security and blockchain DevOps teams, ensuring Dock Network has reliable oracle services with Sybil attack protection.  Decentralized infrastructure at both the data source and oracle node levels, providing developers with highly available and manipulation resistant data and oracles.  A proven mainnet solution already live in production, making it easy for developers to quickly integrate new and existing Price Feeds into their applications.  <p>While the Price Feeds will provide Dock Network with the ability to solve its immediate need for reliable fiat pricing, ultimately the Chainlink Network provides us with a general-purpose oracle solution that can be used to interoperate with any external system, removing all limits to the data that Dock developers can bring into their applications or what data they can send to other networks.</p><p>“Dock Network is using blockchain technology to redefine how people around the world create, issue, and revoke verifiable credentials,” said Dock CEO Nick Lambert. “Integrating a Chainlink-powered DOCK/USD Price Feed brings the familiarity of fiat to the Dock Network, enabling enterprises and end-users to more easily interact with and adopt Dock apps without having to worry about backed cryptocurrency processes. Chainlink’s market-leading oracles ensure that all Dock services are priced at fair market exchange rates, in a manner that’s highly accurate, reliable, and tamperproof.”</p><p>About Chainlink</p><p>Chainlink is the most widely used and secure way to power universal smart contracts. With Chainlink, developers can connect any blockchain with high-quality data sources from other blockchains as well as real-world data. Managed by a global, decentralized community of hundreds of thousands of people, Chainlink is introducing a fairer model for contracts. Its network currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across the decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance and gaming ecosystems, among others.</p><p>Chainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable data feeds.

					 <p>Our mission is to make the world more accessible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). But to do that, we first are making SSI more accessible to the world. We strive to consistently remove barriers to entry to getting started with SSI. About a year ago, we became <a href="https://trinsic.id/launch/">the first SSI vendor in the world</a> to host a free, production-ready platform for issuing and verifying credentials. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers who trust Trinsic enough to build their SSI solutions on our platform. Today, we’re excited to release the next generation of <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the simplest tool for verifiable credential exchange, Trinsic Studio was originally designed to help developers get started with Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">powerful APIs</a> in less than 5 minutes. The release of Trinsic Studio 2.0 only enhances and increases our ability to meet that goal. The Studio also serves as the mechanism through which our users manage their API keys and subscription.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 New pricing model 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As a part of the launch of the new Studio, we announce changes to our pricing model that make SSI more accessible than ever.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Usage-based pricing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In line with our values, for the last year we’ve charged based on a metric called “DIDComm” which is any interaction between two participants in an SSI ecosystem. Despite its imperfections, this model was well-received due to the fact that our subscribers only had to worry and estimate one value (DIDComm), and they could build in the usage-based pricing into the pricing model they charge their customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, DIDComm is an unfamiliar term and requires deep technical knowledge of SSI protocols and accurate forecasting of usage in order to correctly model pricing. Throughout our platform, we strive to abstract these complexities away into the simplest possible experience for our users—so it didn’t make sense to expose the complexity through our pricing model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Simplified pricing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With Trinsic Studio 2.0, we’ve implemented a pricing model that keeps all the benefits of our former DIDComm-based pricing model but removes the complexity. Going forward, Trinsic will charge based on&nbsp;credential exchange. That means we’ll charge for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Credentials issued  Credentials verified  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The subscription plans will remain the same; the Developer plan for just starting out and the Production plan for when you are ready to go to production or get additional support. But now, there&nbsp;is a much lower minimum threshold and added flexibility for each of Trinsic’s paid plans; see the table below for a quick comparison.</p>

					 <p>This means more teams will be able to join the Trinsic community, allowing us to start to scale with them from an earlier point in their development as partners. All users can easily manage their subscription plan through Trinsic Studio.</p>

					 <p>This release was about more than a simple glow-up—the Trinsic Studio has been completely rewritten based on a more scalable architecture. With world-class Blazor architect&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenTCramer">Steve Cramer</a>&nbsp;at the helm, we migrated the Studio from server-side rendering to client-side via WASM. More to come in another blog if you’re interested in going deeper; but the end result is that pages load 2x faster. You can now start to issue a credential in the time it used to take to load the page!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of Trinsic’s value propositions is that we abstract away the low-level SSI protocols so that developers can focus on their use case. Another is that Trinsic is continually adopting SSI standards and new technologies as they mature. Therefore, a flexible architecture that’s easily extensible was an important design decision. Shipping new features on Studio 2.0 takes our developers, on average, 4x less time than it took on the original Trinsic Studio. Plus, we have integrated end-to-end testing that should prevent bugs from sneaking in and speeding up our time to release. So not only will we move even faster in our development, but we’ll be more flexible to evolve with the SSI space as it advances over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See below for an example; you can create a Verification Template in the new studio in the time it would take you to simply load the verifications page in the previous studio.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Previous Studio lacked performance.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					New Studio loads pages at least 2x faster.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Other changes 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In addition to simplifying pricing, UI, and performance, we’re introducing a couple of other important changes. See the feature breakdown on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing page</a> for more detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Support: We’re launching an exclusive community where members receive early access to features, co-marketing opportunities, and a dedicated support channel. Available for our Production subscribers.  Documentation: All of the content on our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation site</a> will continue to be available free to all subscription levels. We don’t believe in restricting content behind a paywall unless it is client-specific.  Organizations &amp; Cloud Wallets: Organizations (institutional agents) and cloud wallets (“custodial” cloud-hosted end-user agents) will be limited based on the subscription tier.

					 <p>It’s amazing to look back and see how much Trinsic Studio has evolved since we first launched. We are thankful to all of our users and their feedback which continually inspires us to develop the best and simplest developer tools for self-sovereign identity. With the release of Trinsic Studio 2.0, verifiable credentials exchange has never been more accessible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking to build an SSI solution or integrate SSI into your existing solution, <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account</a> today, and see how easy it is to get started with SSI.</p>

  <p>Digital transformation has made it imperative for application leaders to find effective ways to modernize legacy systems. The biggest challenge? Knowing the risk-to-reward ratio before acting.</p>
<p>“For many organizations, legacy systems are seen as holding back the business initiatives and business processes that rely on them,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/52795/Stefan-Van-Der-Zijden">Stefan Van Der Zijden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “When a tipping point is reached, application leaders must look to application modernization to help remove the obstacles.”</p>
<p>The Gartner three-step evaluation process provides direction in determining how to approach application modernization. The best approach depends on the problem that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="38636"]</p>
 STEP 1: Evaluate legacy systems using six drivers 
<p>There are six main drivers for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">application</a> modernization. These are the issues, concerns or impediments that have been created by the legacy application as a result of its technology, architecture or functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three of these drivers come from a business perspective — business fit, business value and agility. If the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-evaluate-an-application-integration-platform-infographic/">legacy application</a> is not meeting the new requirements imposed by digital business, it needs to be modernized to fit properly, and should be upgraded to provide greater business value. Applications that lack the agility to keep pace with the demands of digital business may be a cost or risk liability.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">Key Strategies for Cost Optimization in Application Design and Development</a></p>
 
<p>The three other drivers come from the IT perspective, and involve cost, complexity and risk. If the total cost of ownership is too high, the technology too complex, or security, compliance, support or scalability are being compromised, it’s time to modernize.</p>
<p>The best modernization opportunities are those with multiple drivers from both a business and an IT perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 STEP 2: Evaluate modernization 
<p>Once the opportunity is selected and the problem is identified, look at modernization options. Gartner has ranked seven options by ease of implementation (the easier it is, the less risk and impact it will have on the system and the business processes; the harder, the more risk and impact it will have.)</p>
 
 Encapsulate. Leverage and extend the application features by encapsulating its data and functions, making them available as services via an API. 
 Rehost. Redeploy the application component to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without modifying its code, features or functions. 
 Replatform. Migrate to a new runtime platform, making minimal changes to the code, but not the code structure, features or functions. 
 Refactor. Restructure and optimize the existing code (although not its external behavior) to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes. 
 Rearchitect. Materially alter the code to shift it to a new application architecture and exploit new and better capabilities.&nbsp; 
 Rebuild. Redesign or rewrite the application component from scratch while preserving its scope and specifications. 
 Replace. Eliminate the former application component altogether and replace it, considering new requirements and needs at the same time. 
 
 STEP 3: Choose the modernization approach with highest effect and value 
<p>Finally, choose the modernization approach that will have the highest effect and value to your organization by mapping the seven modernization options in terms of their effect on technology, architecture, functionality, cost and risk.</p>
<p>Ultimately, modernizing legacy<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/its-time-to-disrupt-the-application-organization/"> applications</a> means choosing between rearchitecting, rebuilding or replacing. Rearchitecting has medium costs and risks, whereas rebuilding or replacing provides best results with higher costs and risks. The key is to weigh all options to help identify the extent to which each will have the desired effect — with the minimum effort and maximum positive impact.</p>

VCs are not a generalized container for attaching a cryptographic proof to a document. That's what LD proofs (or JOSE style proofs) are for. VCs *use* LD proofs (or JOSE style proofs) to attach an assertion proof to a document that specifically models statements made by an issuer about some subject, which is therefore inherently about the identity of that subject.</p></blockquote> COMMUNITY BLOG POSTS  Distributed ID learning path <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kristinayasuda">Christina Yasuda</a> shares a learning path, based on her work navigating the VC-Spec Map by <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelruminer">Michael Ruminer</a>, that we shared a few weeks ago and has now <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">been donated to the DIF</a>.</p><p>Her <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://kristinayasuda.com/posts/decentralized-identity-catch-up-path/">distributed ID learning path</a> first describes pre-requisite knowledge, including JSON, JSON-LD, JWT, JWS, JWK, JWA, and sometimes CBOR.

<p>Red Hat surprised the open source world with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/centos-shifts-from-red-hat-unbranded-to-red-hat-beta/">announcment</a> that it is pulling the plug on CENTOS. But should anyone be surprised? At the end of the day, why does it make sense to offer a product that undermines your business model? On the one hand, you have a huge investment in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that generates a ton of revenue. On the other hand, you have an underfunded effort working on an open source project that generates no revenue. You don’t need an MBA to figure out what the smart financial decision is here.</p>
<p>But is there an analogy that relates to identity and access management? Is there a product where IBM has a huge investment in an another profitable product, where a little under-financed open source project undermines the business model? Hmmm, what about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-access">IBM Security Verify Access</a> and Keycloak? </p>
<p>The writing is on the wall. Keycloak makes no business sense. IBM doesn’t need two access management platforms. The current IBM access management platform has more features that are valuable to businesses. It has more integrations with current IBM products. It has more documentation, “red books”, training, engineers–more of just about everything else you’d want for a product.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of time before we see a similar “surprise” announcement for Keycloak. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we moved the core Gluu software to the <a href="https://jans.io">Janssen Project</a>. When one company controls the destiny of a project, the project’s fate is subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that may befall that one company. Enlightened despotism is efficient. But it is not democratic. At Gluu, we have moved to consensus based governance to ensure that whatever happens to Gluu, the project will survive. We didn’t spend the last 10 years building an open source identity distribution to see some bean counters decide to change the license and close the repository.</p>
<p>Janssen is just getting started. In 2021 we’re going to work hard to fill in the gaps to make it a world class, cloud-native identity platform. Heed the writing on the wall. Ditch Keycloak, and join us!</p>

					 <p>For this tutorial, we will be referring to Alice Smith who is a recent graduate of Faber College. Alice is looking to apply for a job at ACME Corp. and has started the process of filling out the company’s online application form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In previous “how to” posts, we walked through the scenarios of 1) Faber College <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing Alice a university diploma</a> in the form of a verifiable credential and 2) Alice <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating a connection</a> with ACME Corp. to securely begin applying for a job online. If you have not already completed these steps, we suggest you go back and complete those steps before continuing with the tutorial below.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Log in to Trinsic Studio 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/login">https://trinsic.studio/login</a>. If you do not have a Trinsic Studio account, you can create one for free at <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a>. As mentioned above, you will need to complete the tutorials for <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing credentials</a> and <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating connections</a> in Trinsic Studio before moving forward.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a verification template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before Alice can fill out an online job application from ACME Corp., the company must create one. Let’s assume that ACME Corp. wants to request the following information in the application:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First Name  Last Name  Degree  Year  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because ACME Corp. wants to ensure the legitimacy of an applicant’s responses, the information listed above must come from a valid college diploma. So let’s get started creating the verification template.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, get the Schema ID for the transcript. To do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First, click on the Faber College organization card on the dashboard screen.  Click on the “Credentials” tab.  Copy the “Schema ID” from the College Diploma credential template.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now create the job application template:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Return to the dashboard screen and click on the ACME Corp. organization card.  Click on the “Verifications” tab, and click the “+ Template” button.  Name the verification “Job Application”.  Now we are going to set the policies. Policies are a way to specify what data to request from a digital wallet. Click on the “+ Policy” dropdown, and you will see that there are two types of Policies—”Predicate” and “Attribute”. Select “Attribute”.  Enter “Diploma Verification” as the policy name.  In the “Select Credential Template” dropdown, select “Define Custom Attributes”.  In the “Define Attributes” text box, enter the attribute names exactly as they appear in the credential template that you created for Faber College. So we will write in First Name, Last Name, Degree, and Year.  In the “Credential Restrictions” dropdown, select “Schema ID” and paste the transcript schema ID into the text box that appears. This is so that only credentials issued from the template you created previously will pass the verification.  Click the “Save Policy” button and wait a few seconds for the template to be saved.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Send a verification request 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now that ACME Corp. has set up its verification template, it can send its verification to Alice!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As ACME Corp.:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the “Verifications” tab, locate the verification template you’ll use to request a verification from Alice. Click on the “Request” button which corresponds to this template.  In the list of “Send verification request via options”, select the “Connection” option.  Click on the connection you’ve made for Alice.  Click “Send Request”.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now as Alice:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Your Trinsic Wallet should get a push notification for the verification request from your ACME Corp. connection.  From your home screen, select the verification request to respond. Once you’ve opened it, you can customize the information you share if you have more than one credential that can satisfy the request. In this case, we do not.  If the information looks correct, press&nbsp;“Present”.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>And just like that, Alice has securely sent ACME Corp. the information it asked for in the online job application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In the Trinsic Wallet, a verification request notification will appear.

I looked to the left and my girlfriend was sound asleep next to me. I looked to the right and my watch was indicating it was indeed the middle of the night.</p>
